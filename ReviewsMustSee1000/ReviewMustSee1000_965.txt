		<shortDescription>An excellent movie if you can take wanting more when it's over.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished the movie and it really is a great piece of work. No futuristic crap mixed up though you might expect it. Miss Knightley really does a great job playing the part, though her role seems to have been kept a bit too far in the background.The whole idea of changing the future has been brought up before, but this time instead of changing the future by altering the past it brings new perspective by altering the present by adding new info from the future. At first it reminded me very much of Butterfly Effect. If you like that one, you'll love this one.It also shines new light on the subject whether or not you can change your own destiny which hasn't been brought up in a while.It surely is a "must-see".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jacob's Ladder meets One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) is pronounced dead during the Gulf War. Moments later, he shows signs of life again. He's discharged and tries to get back to his normal life in Vermont. But he had a severe head injury, he had amnesia for awhile, and he has periodic blackouts and maybe hallucinations. When he winds up being blamed for a serious crime, he is sent to a psychiatric prison. While there, he is subjected to a bizarre treatment involving a straightjacket. Starks begins to learn dark secrets about the hospital and surprising truths about his life. Can he emerge from his predicament unscathed? This is a high concept film--it's basically Jacob's Ladder (1990) meets One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest (1975), with touches of similar "rubber reality" and mental institution flicks thrown in for good measure--a dash of Donnie Darko (2001), a touch of 12 Monkeys (1995), and so on. That it resembles a high concept amalgamation of modern films may be more surprising in light of the fact that the basic idea is adapted from a 1915 Jack London novel, The Star Rover, which was published as The Jacket in the UK.It might also be surprising to some readers that I'm giving a film that is so strongly derivative a 10. But I don't rate higher or lower based on originality or a lack of the same. To me, what matters is how well the film works, how well it is constructed for its ambitions. The Jacket is a fine piece of art.The performances are excellent. Adrien Brody in particular is amazing. His turns in what amounts to an "isolation chamber" are breathtaking. All of the principal actors, including Keira Knightley, Kris Kristofferson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Laura Marano and Kelly Lynch, produce finely nuanced work. The characterizations are demanding, as The Jacket requires them to play multiple realities, with different knowledge, relationships and attitudes to each other in most of the major scenes.But as good as the performances are, what really stands out is the direction. This is the first John Maybury film I've seen, and if it's any indication of his other work, I can't wait to see more. His direction is constantly inventive and challenging. For example, The Jacket begins with grainy war footage like the typical CNN almost "real-time" footage that was so popular during Operation Desert Storm. Maybury cuts it to enhance the chaos of war. When he moves to a more "normal" technique, he still exhibits a strong but subtle and unique touch.He is fond of unusual close-ups, frequently filling the screen with a character's mouth, eye, one side of their face from the cheek up, and so on. He also employs a lot of intriguing and bizarre inserts, and frequently constructs scenes with unusual pacing, often slower than other modern directors, or at least pulled like taffy on certain beats. But it's always right for a particular scene. The Jacket has a complex timeline structure that could easily fall apart in lesser hands; Maybury keeps the film easily coherent, and provides just the right amount of clues to the rubber reality aspects at just the right time. Echoing the unusual, contemplative, directorial temporal manipulations is a fine score (as if we could expect anything else) from Brian Eno.As a rubber reality film, it's important to not watch The Jacket expecting a neat, linear, tightly-wrapped and transparent plot. As is typical for the genre, multiple interpretations are encouraged, with little pushes and prods to help along audiences who might be reluctant to embrace hermeneutics. For example, in one scene, a character says, "We're all dead". And for less overt subtexts, it's worthwhile to note how Jack often tends to be handled throughout the film more like a slab of meat. But whatever your interpretation, an important and relatively clear subtext is that of using one's life from this point forward to the best of one's ability to effect the kind of world one would like to see. Maybury makes sure to convey a disbelief in strong determinism, although freedom from fate in the film comes at a cost, and it may not be able to completely circumvent destiny.Like Renny Harlin's version of The Exorcist: The Beginning (2004), The Jacket is really a "difficult" film that is likely to be approached with inappropriately philistine expectations that lead to complaints that it is boring or in some other way inadequate, pointless or non-entertaining. It deserves a more serious look than that. This is an excellent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Jacket" has gotten some bad press because the plot has a lot of holes in it, but if you suspend belief and just enjoy the movie, it is a lot of fun.Any film that involves time travel requires that you suspend belief, and "The Jacket" is no different. What makes "The Jacket" better than most sci-fi thrillers is the production quality. The scenes in the hospital are done in muted colors which look like hand painted black and white. The scenes in the future are done in super saturated colors. I thought the super close-ups added to the disorientation and claustrophobia of the protagonist.The acting is first rate. Adrien Brody is convincingly haunted. Kiera Knightly does an acceptable American accent.Fans of "The Twilight Zone" should like this one. It is rated "R" for language, nudity, sex, violence, and disturbing images in a mental hospital; so you are getting your money's worth. If you like good production quality and want to go for a thrill ride, check this one out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Difficult to categorize but, for all its faults, still quite a gripping roller-coaster of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every so often there's a movie that's so hard to describe that it's to picture whether it's your type of movie or not. The Jacket melds about five different genres without falling firmly into any of them. Even to describe it as an 'alternative reality' movie could put off those who think, "Oh, no, not another sci-fi". I wouldn't describe it as sci-fi. There is a love story, but I wouldn't call it that. There's some pretty disturbing shots and dizzying camera work but it's not really a horror film. What can you rely on? A stellar cast for starters: Adrien Brody, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Keira Knightley, Kris Kristofferson. All needed as the story is not exactly flawless, but the combined characterisations and sheer ingenuity keep you in suspense and mostly make you want to forgive any shortcomings in this rather ambitious project.If you like stories nice and simple, stay away. If you like a challenge, The Jacket might fill the bill. It's not quite such a headbanging puzzle as Mulholland Drive, and it doesn't have the cutesiness of Donnie Darko, but it is in the realm of dark, weird and ultimately rather moving experimental film.Brody is Mr quite nice guy Jack Starks, apparently shot dead at point blank range in the Gulf War - but hang on a minute, his eyelids blink before they pronounce him dead and he recovers - with amnesia but otherwise OK - then he gets committed to an asylum for the criminally insane fro a murder he didn't do, and we're talking 1990s when some pretty strange experimental psychotherapy went on behind closed doors. Enter the old doctor, played by Kris Kristofferson, who looks like he's had one too many acid trips and survived and believes he can think up new treatments for nutters like Jack Starks. During some pretty unconventional (not say unethical by today's standards) solitary 'treatment', Starks sees himself in 2007. The treatment is a combination of drugs and sensory deprivation - a sort of Neanderthal NLP the hard way. Each time he is locked up in 'The Jacket', Starks' projected timeline lets him interact with other characters in his dilemma. It gets continuingly creepier and the tension builds to an ending that leaves you shocked, horrified and filled with warmth at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was fortunate enough to see this at Sundance on opening night and I thought it was absolutely BRILLIANT. Adrian Brody was incredible and I thought it was directed almost flawlessly. I highly recommend it.The film really makes you think and I was disappointed not to be able to ask questions I had during the Q&amp;A which followed the premiere. I think there are loads of things hidden in this film which you would have to see several times to catch. That is my idea of outstanding film making.I could have done without the nudity which I saw no reason for. I think a love scene is much more erotic when you don't see anything. Body parts don't need to be shown. Most of us have decent imaginations. :-)Chris</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rented this movie, and I have to say, its one of the best films I have seen in along time. It's a complex story line, where paying attention is key, probably makes even more sense the second time around. I almost teared up at the end, not 'cause it was sad, but because it was beautiful, and compelling, a must see movie. You may think this movie won't be good, but don't brush it off, 'cause it's officially on my top 5 favorite movies list.Adrien Brody delivers a awesome performance worthy of an Emmy. If there is one movie you should rent this year, it's The Jacket.Great movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Profound Performance!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adrian Brody deserves at least, an academy award nomination for his performance in this film. Sadly I fear this film won't be recognized because of it improper marketing and poor performance in the theaters. This film was promoted as a horror film, just look at the tag- line, "Terror has a new name!" What kind of crap is that? Anyway I don't think he will be recognized for this role even though I believe he should. Also, Kiera did a stunning job! I was totally surprised by her performance as well. I mean she hasn't been terrible in her past films, just no where near as deep or real as her role in this film. All in all I really enjoyed this film. The direction, cinematography, compositing (effects in his eyes) and Editing were superb. I will watch this one again and I would recommend it any day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trippy Yet Still Intelligent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, this film is not for everyone. It does, however, seem to delineate an emerging and exciting trend in contemporary film making whereby directors are becoming increasingly enamored with these sorts of dark, brooding, almost dreamscape-like and melodramatic thrillers which defy archetypal and conventional narrative formats. Think of the "The Machinist" and work your way backwards to "Vanilla Sky", or even as far back as 1990's "Jacob's Ladder" as one other reviewer accurately suggested. To this end, "The Jacket" represents the apotheosis of this rising genre, and is both an artistic psychological thriller, as well as what you might call a metaphysical tragedy, and easily envelopes the viewer into its morose and sterile world replete with dreary snow scapes, perpetual grey skies and faces, muted and washed out colours, institutional isolation, and the angst of working class loners. The film's imagery and the pace of the story and script immediately command one's attention from the outset and the film is unrelenting in both its tension and gumption. Because of this, despite the story's meandering timeline and lack of feasible explanations for the protagonist's "visions", the viewer is still to an extent able to believe what they're seeing. Because the film takes itself so seriously, and actually pulls it off, the viewer then buying into the fantasy of the story becomes far more palatable than it does in other misguided attempts at this same sort of risky and artsy storytelling ie: "The Butterfly Effect". This is an ambitious film which taps into both the romanticism and pain of our dreams and our memories, and how they both act upon us, and cause us to act upon them. It examines what is real versus perceived, the fragility of life, how each persons's life effects others, even passing strangers, and the sovereignty of the self and the mind. The film features outstanding performances from just about everyone on screen, particularly Brody as the hapless and tortured Jack Starks, and Kristofferson as the morally ambiguous and equally tortured Dr. Becker. Despite the big names on the marquee, however, this, as previously mentioned, is not a cut and dry "popcorn flick" and will leave many people bewildered. It is for these people that the "Butterfly Effect" was made first, and now with them out of the way, the timing for a film of this caliber which deals with these issues properly is appropriate. "The Jacket" is a trippy and entertaining yet still very intelligent film which asks only that you check your preconceptions and logical rectitude at the door. By doing so, you'll find the imagination of this film is fact more real than you might have expected.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Literlly a TEN! 2 thumbs WAY up! This was an uplifting, thoughtful, mind thriller! It makes you really think. This is not scary though. The romance and chemistry between "Jack Starks"(Adrien Brody) and "Jackie Price" (Kiera Knightly) was perfectly amazing! Adrian Brody has a way of drawing you in through his eyes and actions in all his films. I nearly cried at the end (Not saying if it's happy or sad) and I was just amazed at how it basically showed that life has meaning, and second chances ARE possible. Like he says in the movie: "I think we live through certain things, just to say that we actually did live through them. Not anyone else, but you." Amazing and lovely! I URGE you to see it and I was angry that it wasn't int heaters for long. By the way, I'm gonna marry that man! Hehe. --Natalie R.L.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Based on a Jack London Book, The Star Rover</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw this at an advance screening. I liked it. Adrien Brody and Keira Knightley carry this film well. Although I have to admit that i was in the front row and watching a cinemascope film like that has one turning their head from left to right a lot. I recommend the star rover novel to read to anyone who likes this film. It was published in 1913, one of londons last books. it dealt with how the prison system at the time would strap people in straitjackets so tight that it would cause damage. The hero of the book comes to desire the tightening of the straps to the point where the guards have not seen, in order for him to more spiritually transcend his mind and soul into another life. He jaunts into other existences, all past, ie napoleon battle, viking conquest, to free his mind from the pain. The Jacket takes this idea in a way where the hero goes to a place that is involved in the plot running in the present.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is truly a film of horror and disturbance. It is all about interpretation and nothing about preconception.It is about a Gulf War Veteran who loses his memory after a gun shot to the head in Iraq. He is accused of murder and sent to a mental institution where he is "treated" by being confined to a whole-body straight jacket and placed into a morgue drawer. He travels forwards in time.It is a trip through memory and what could have been or still could be.Although there are still a few kinks (this was the world premiere, so I'm assuming that there is still editing to do) but the disjointed nature of the film adds to the affect. The CGI is great and non-obtrusive.This is a disturbing and moving film. It interlaces love and revenge in an original, fantastic trip of a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT a sci-fi action flick. MUCH better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first glance at the box I thought BS Sci-Fi action thriller but frankly out of boredom with available films went for it. I'm glad I did! Push to talk view: Guy gets shot in the head during the Gulf War I. Guy is thought dead at first, then is realized alive and treated. Guy is treated, then turned onto the street, as is the norm... Guy bumps into a child on the side of the road with an obliviously drunken mother with a disabled vehicle. He fixes the vehicle, mom vomits and chases him away from her daughter and goes on her drunken driving way. Guy gets picked up by stranger who, during a routine traffic stop, kills the police officer. Guy goes down cold due probable delayed stress AND previous trauma. Stranger wipes the weapon clean and plants it near him and drives off. Guy gets convicted and sent to a mental institution for the criminally insane. Gets experimented on and visits the future. He meets the now grown child, who has had a rather lousy life after surviving her mother's death in an alcohol related smoking fire and ends up emulating her mother's life. She is suspicious at first, then tentatively, then completely embraces the Guy's story about being the man who befriended them long ago. The only glitch is that he was killed not long after the experiments, which is later revealed as, well, not well documented. Appearance is possible homicide. The two doctors in the unit he was committed to were: Experimenter: Fired, given the sack, terminated from employment. Bad reference... Second doctor: Interested but overworked in the present/past, cold in the future. He investigates during a few brief appearances in the future. He is the only warmth in the otherwise cold and forgotten existence of the former girl, now grown and assisting him. A love affair ensues, as usual. The investigation shows him a probable murder at the hands of the experimenter, ala "mad scientist", but appears that in the old experimenter's eyes a personal and professional failure. Guy returns to the "present" and convinces the second doctor by quite improbable and unimpeachable means to assist him to visit the drunken mother who burned herself to death, much to the ill of the child's development. He speaks briefly, leaves her a letter and goes back to the hospital knowing he will die soon, per his future "history". His letter to the experimenter, doctor and drunken mother make right that which was once wrong in a quantum leap manner on steroids. Turns into a bit of a tear jerker with a finish with an interesting style. The finish seems a bit weak, but then again the *REAL* future is weak until it becomes the past... Frankly I'd pay TWICE the retail for this one. Finally a movie that *ISN'T* a lousy remake or sequel! The cast is improbable at best but works incredibly well. The direction is beyond compare. The effects were not to my liking, but do well to the story line. If a few of the out-takes were included it would give the movie 5 out of 4 stars. Instead, I'd award 4 stars to the movie, as does my wife.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uninspired, Mildly Entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(potential spoilers)The theater was filled with people expecting what this picture could have potentially been if given more time to develop the story. Instead the audience got another story filled with quick cutaways and bass designed to give you a scare in that moment, but after leaving you with an emptiness where the story should have filled.I will say this though, this movie didn't suck because of Adrien Brody. He was fun to watch and his subtleties didn't go unnoticed. A part that comes to mind is when he asks Kiera Knightly what year it is, she says 2007 and he gives his unbelieving, "wha." Unfortunately the rest of the scene took place in bizarre 2007. What attractive 20 something female is going to bring to her apartment (where she lives alone) a mysterious Adrien Brody standing outside freezing. Her reason for letting him stay is that she called all the homeless shelters and none are open, so she'd feel guilty if she sent this guy she met 1 min ago away. "You can sleep on my couch." Trusting aren't we. I didn't buy it. Also watching her vast array of facial expressions in this scene also brought a tear to my eye... from laughter. I don't know about you but I'm so sick of films that use static and weird sound effects with shooting images to get the audience on edge. Ever since the Ring I haven't been able to appreciate them anymore and it looks more and more like a cheap thrill device. I was sitting in the theater waiting for those parts to be over. All in all, the Jacket was a decent, unfinished story that had so much more potential. If it wasn't for Brody and a character named Mckenzie, this film would be a lot harder to watch. They tried to do something different, but didn't follow up. 4 (for effort) out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This story is so disjointed, so frenetic, and so abstruse that it was impossible to find a coherent story line throughout. Brody is a good actor and I feel this work was a total waste of his talent. The flashes of light as he was experiencing the flash backs (or forward, which I found hard to understand) while in the morgue drawer, were visually distressing, and could bring on a fierce migraine, at the very least, or an epileptic fit to anyone so inclined. To me, there was a lack of good direction, in not having some believable continuity, that would have told the story better. I sincerely hope to see Brody in something more fitting in the near future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Jacket is another very, very classic and conventional sci-fi based thriller who relies on the usual tricks of the genre: identity search, time travel, alteration of future events... nothing particularly original and that is what mainly serves this unremarkable movie badly. The elements on which relies the scenario have all been used over and over again ? and often better ? in other productions: for example, some developments are a bit far-fetched, like the not so credible love story.It's a shame because the direction is good, as the rhythm, the intriguing atmosphere is coherent with the genre, but it's Adrien Brody's excellent performance, by the way an incredibly underrated actor, who illuminates the movie, as opposed to his partner Keira Knightley, always very linear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Acknowledging Jack London, "The Star Rover," (aka "The Jacket")</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw "The Jacket," I assumed that Jack London would get some credit for the story. The film is, after all, an adaptation of London's "The Star Rover," which puts the protagonist, Darrel Standing in San Quentin prison for life. Standing gets put in a straight jacket as special punishment, and finds himself slipping into trances that enable him to re-experience past lives. "The Star Rover," while not as widely known as "Call of the Wild" or "White Fang," was one of London's last books, and in my opinion, his best. According to London's daughter, Joan, he lavished material he had compiled for future books into one: "The Star Rover," which he almost titled, "The Jacket." Anyone who enjoyed the movie is bound to enjoy London's book.But why does this film not give him credit? Is it legal to borrow so much from a book and ignore the author?London himself had a bad habit of plagiarizing other authors, his stories: "Before Adam," "Love of Life," and passages from "The Iron Heel," are all flagrant plagiarism. So I guess he had it coming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>**spoilers contained**Too bad I saw Jacob's Ladder first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were three movies released within a six-month or so period, The Jacket, The Machinist, and Stay. Each deals with similar themes, each is a trip through the protagonist's mind, and each may or may not be what's really happening. Each has varying degrees of success in its resolution through narrative, but Jacob's Ladder is still the top of this particular genre.However, if you don't see Jacob's Ladder first, The Jacket is a compelling and unusual little film about a Gulf War vet who is sentenced to a mental hospital and subjected to highly unusual experimental treatment, namely being pumped full of drugs and locked into a morgue drawer. Adrien Brody's acting is top-notch as always, and Keira Knightley is the real surprise as a down-and-out waitress.The film buff in me that wants to read more into it than is really happening says that this movie is really a Jungian attempt for the protagonist (Jack-Jacket) to reunite with his inner child. (Young Jackie, note the diminutive). Through this, he resolves his issues with an absentee mother (Jean), and becomes a whole person through the reunification of his anima and animus (Grown-up Jackie and Future Jack, respectively, if I'm remembering my Jung correctly, female and male parts of his personality).In this way, the doctor's experiment was a success, even though it had to kill him to do it.But then again, you could say the real moral of the movie is Don't Smoke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring, disappointing, confusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually turned this movie off half way through.Aside from the fact that the movie was virtually unwatchable, the acting performances were atrocious.Brody's character was very one dimensional and unlikable, though technically speaking the acting was decent enough. I just couldn't find the energy to like his character or care what happened to him. He was put in one of the most horrible situations imaginable, being locked in a mortuary drawer for long periods of time in a straight jacket, yet his performance hardly inspired terror, it was vaguely annoying. I found myself sort of wishing he would just go to sleep so the movie could progress because these scenes were just too long and redundant.Knightly was absolutely terrible. She overacted her part to the point of absurdity, and spent half the movie trying to awkwardly seduce the cameraman with her ugly overbite, doing things like staring hatefully at the camera with her hair in her face and sucking on the lip of a glass trying to be "drunk" but succeeding only in seeming mildly retarded with her mouth hanging open and her eyes looking dull and glazed throughout the film. She was very over-dramatic, yet her character was as flat as cardboard at the same time and completely unlikable. Like I seriously wished after her first scene with Brody that she would be written out of the film.The "relationship" between the two characters was unbelievable and the two had zero chemistry. It was mildly gross actually, Knightly's character being first represented as a very young girl. The sex scenes were completely unnecessary and instead of being sexy, really just made me feel uncomfortable...they just seemed to serve as an excuse to show Knightly's extremely skinny, prepubescent body and tiny breasts. Thankfully, the nudity was brief, though there is a scene where he licks her boob (somewhat obscenely), and I have to say, I actually felt embarrassed for them both.The rest of the acting was passing, nothing particularly bad or good or memorable.The writing was simply bad, though the camera work and directing shots (scene framing and such) were decent. The flashback/forwards were visually painful to watch and redundant after awhile.I will never be able to take Knightly seriously in a movie again. Her acting was so dismal and annoying (though, to her credit, she did do a good job with the American accent) it completely destroys her ability in my opinion.I wont go into the plot here, as it is confusing and not interesting and not the least furthered by the acting "talent" in the film, which actually has a pretty promising cast. Lets just suffice it to say that the film fails on almost every level.Also, just on a final note, what the hell was with the young girls mom in the beginning? She was on the side of the road, moaning and rolling around like someone about to die. She didn't seem drunk..which is what the movie insinuated later, she seemed like she had been beaten severely about the head and left on the side of the road to die. Brody just sort of pat her head and then actually let her get in the truck and drive with her daughter! If I had met a woman that F'ed up I would have never let her drive. I actually spent almost the whole scene wondering what was wrong with the mom, thinking she was hurt, and actually felt confused when it was later revealed that she was only drunk. I found that scene particularly strange and irritating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In "The Jacket" a lone drifter named Jack Satrks who has gotten discharged from the military after the gulf war helps a mother and daughter with their car trouble. The plot then takes a fast jump to Starks in a mental institution for the criminally insane. During a cruel experiment conducted by the Doctors in the facility he's forced to wear a straight jacket and is locked into a closet. He soon begins to fight to distinguish between the real world and the world in which his mind has created for him.Adrien Brody gives a fantastic performance as a tortured war vet who just wants to find happiness. Brody manages to keep the audience wanting more all the way to the end. Kiera Knightly and Jennifer Jason Leigh use their great acting abilities to smooth the story along and make this movie a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Starks, a veteran of the 1991 Gulf War, is charged with the murder of a policeman. Although Starks is innocent, the fact that he is suffering from amnesia means that he is unable to prove his innocence, and he is found "not guilty by reason of insanity", and placed in a mental institution where he is subjected to cruel experiments. He is injected with an experimental drug, bound in a straitjacket (from which the film takes its name) and placed in a morgue drawer. In this condition, however, he finds that he is able to travel into the future; he awakens to find himself in 2007. (Two years after the film was made in 2005).The other main character in the film is a young woman named Jackie, whom Starks briefly met as a young girl shortly before the murder of the policeman. In 2007 Jackie, now in her twenties, tells Starks that he died on 1st January 1993, only a few days after he entered the mental hospital in December 1992, so cannot be who he says he is.The film is reminiscent of two great time-travel romances from the seventies and eighties, "Quest for Love" and "Somewhere in Time". Like "Quest for Love" it also plays with the idea of alternate realities and of altering time; Starks makes a number of trips into the future, into differing versions of 2007. (In one, for example, Jackie is a waitress, in another she is a nurse). Starks has to resolve the paradox of how he can be alive in a future in which he is already "dead" and to use his knowledge of the future to try to prevent not only his own death in 1993 but also that of Jackie's mother Jean who we learn died in a fire some time during the period between 1993 and 2007.The best thing about the film is the performance of Adrien Brody as Starks. I was very impressed with Brody after seeing him in his Oscar-winning role in "The Pianist", but had not seen much of him since that film came out in 2002. (Apart from "The Jacket", the only one of his subsequent films that I have seen is "The Village). Brody does not have classic "film-star looks", but in both "The Pianist" and "The Jacket" he is able to turn his looks to his advantage, using his long, gaunt face to suggest a haunted man suffering both physically and mentally. Kris Kristofferson is also good as the psychiatrist Dr Becker, a man who in his quest for scientific knowledge has lost sight of his humanity, although I was rather disappointed by Keira Knightley as Jackie; this is not one of her better films.I would not rate "The Jacket" as highly as either "Quest for Love" or "Somewhere in Time"; the theme is not handled as clearly and the plot tends to become excessively complex and ambiguous in the second half of the theme. Nevertheless, it is an intellectually ambitious film, a welcome exception to the post "Star Wars" assumption that all science-fiction films must be huge blockbusters dominated by special effects, and worth seeing if only for Brody's contribution. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. Adrien Brody is sensational as Jack Starks and that is the key to the success of the film.As to the question of whether it is all just a dream: there is nothing in the film to suggest that, so why should anyone arbitrarily decide that to be the case. A story is what the writer wrote: no more and no less. Time travel to the future is currently impossible, both technologically and logically (the future is a concept based on prediction and speculation of events that have not yet occurred and may never occur, thus, it never actually exists). That, however, does not mean it doesn't ever happen. Should that be the case, our whole notion of existence and reality (as well as cause and effect in this case) must change - that is one of the basic ideas in the film.So, if you just watch the movie very carefully, you will see a very interesting, mind-challenging, well-produced story. Then, if you wish to add more in your own mind that is your prerogative.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once more up Jacob's Ladder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know Adrien Brody's Gulf War veteran is in a bad way in The Jacket not just because he's been shot in the head and sent to Kris Kristofferson's asylum for the criminally insane for a murder he didn't commit, but because Jennifer Jason Leigh is the most normal member of staff there. In that context, being pumped full of drugs, put in a straitjacket and left in a morgue drawer that allows him to project himself into the future to unravel the mystery of is imminent death seems almost straightforward. Yes, we're in Jacob's Ladder territory here (once upon a time it even had the same ending) without ever approaching that film's complexity or emotional power. The result is not so much bad as okay. Brody and Daniel Craig are fine, but the gimmick casting of Keira Knightley in the kind of damaged goods part that Leigh used to be able to do in her sleep doesn't really work. While it's the closest she's give to a decent performance yet, it's still all surface affectations - some of them good - but no substance, which takes away from the heart the film both wants and needs. Mildly satisfying but not outstanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just wasn't dark enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Jacket represents an interesting quandary. How does a film this intriguing come off as so light and sweet?Certainly, a more sinister direction could have been taken with the story, but the plot moved along in a more softer direction. I will state this: it was a pretty well made movie and had solid acting performances. But it just didn't go far enough. Instead of providing a dark end to Jack Stark, it chose to have him ending his life to the backdrop of sweet guitar rifts and a ride from a radiant Keira Knightly. What I did especially like was the potential. The potential for Jack to mess with the future in adverse ways or Jack finding a way to go back in time would have made the story far more interesting. Perhaps getting rid of Knightly's arc all together would have been a benefit to the story.Either way, The Jacket isn't a bad movie watching experience. It does a good job of creating sympathy for its characters even though they might not necessarily deserve it. Sadly, it just didn't push the envelope enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A feast of drama, cinematography, humanity, and surprisingly - music (!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only other Adrien Brody film that drove me to tears was The Pianist, in the scene where he played to a standing German officer who was both his persecutor and admirer. This film establishes him as the king in contemporary cinema of sensitivity and vulnerability - an aspect that modern actors seem incapable of displaying on screen anymore.A lot of words have been said about the superb directing by John Maybury (funny the film is produced under Warner Independent Pictures - meaning it didn't get the mainstream nod?), and the great cinematography. The story radiates decency from someone who seems to have lost everything to live for in this world, utterly heart warming!But it wasn't till 'We Have All The Time In The World' was played from the end credits that I was driven to tears this time round - the song so well encapsulates the end that it was part of the ending itself; and was sung with none of the laziness present in the much better known Louis Armstrong interpretation, but with a sense of warmth and sentimentality (even melancholy). The strong base/drum lines very much emphasise these feelings without making it noisy and uncomfortable - the soundtrack is now on my must-buy list.Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, if you can just sit back and not ask too many questions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being trapped in a confined space, it would seem, gives one clarity. Uma Thurman's character in Kill Bill Vol. 2 was buried alive and was able to recall the days of her training. Jason Schwartzman was zipped up in a large bag to help him reflect on his life in I Heart Huckabee's. But the claustrophobia that these two films tried to inject in a simple scene is exploited into a full-length film in the new Adrien Brody thriller, The Jacket. Brody plays Jack Starks, a name said so often during the film that I didn't have to look it up again days later when preparing this review. Jack is the opposite of lucky. In 1991, he goes to Iraq only to be shot in the head by a child trying to protect his family. As the voice-over quickly points out, he is 26 and that was the first time he died. Flashing forward 12 months, Jack is trying to hitch a ride on a cold winters morning when he is picked up by a tense and anxious young driver (played by bad boy Brad Renfro). When a police officer pulls over the duo shots are fired leaving the officer dead and Jack with yet another bullet hole. When he awakes, Jack finds himself with temporary amnesia and the lack of his recollection of the incident allows leaves him as the only suspect to the murder. Jack is then sentenced to a mental institution where under the care of Dr. Becker (Kris Kristofferson) he finds himself being strapped in a straight jacket and thrown into a morgue locker as part of an experimental treatment. For reasons that never become overtly clear, this process allows Jack to travel into the future where he befriends Jackie (Keira Knightley) whom he had met as a young girl the day of the murder years previous. Together, they try and piece together the years between his incarceration and the present date, Christmas Eve 2007 while Jack uses his knowledge of the future to impact the lives of the present. The Jacket jumps around in time so frequently that it takes you about half way through the film to understand what exactly is going on; and even then, I wasn't exactly sure how it all pieced together. Was he real? Is he a ghost who haunts those that lead to his death? Neither of these questions come clean with acceptable answers, but for a movie of this genre, I guess we can expect to cut it some slack and do some piecing of assumptions together ourselves. There are so many things about this film that just don't work well. The chemistry between the two leads is so non-existent that it is completely unbelievable that Jackie would befriend the eerily gawky Starks and their love scene was nothing more than an attempt to throw Knightly's first screen nudity at a confused and somewhat bored audience. And although The Butterfly Effect was no Gone With The Wind, it at least appreciated the fact if you change something in the past, it should have drastic effects on how the future unfolds. But there are things that do work wonderfully. The color scheme of using only blues and greys in the Mental Institution give it a CSI: NY feel that fits well within the sterile setting. Also used to good effect is the claustrophobia of the locker. Much like Uma in Kill Bill Vol. 2, the screen goes dark and you feel as if you are squiggling along with the character trying to gasp for air while fending off insanity. Director John Maybury (you are excused if you have not yet heard of him), does an ample job of keeping the movie moving even if we don't quite understand exactly what it is moving towards. Based on a screenplay by Massy Tadjedin (again, you are excused), the movie doesn't allow you to have many popcorn refill breaks and be able to understand exactly where these characters are headed. Whether you like The Jacket or not will depend on whether you are someone who can sit back and enjoy a film or whether you think you are smart enough and try to jump ahead to try and figure things out before the characters do. I was in the latter category upon first viewing, but enjoyed it enough for a recommendation upon a revisit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie twice in a night, I found it that excellent. The whole premise was very compelling, though in fairness a bit unoriginal. Adrien Brody was mind numbingly good as Jack Starks. His post-war traumatized character--brilliantly done. His emotions were very contagious and seemed entirely genuine. At first, I felt the film was a bit too anachronistic, but then I found the appeal in that. As a viewer, I was constantly looking for nuances/clues that would tell me whether his visions were actual events, or fabrications of his damaged brain. Keira executed her role nicely, and her husky American accent deserves some applause. Her performance was well done, and her body language is fluid and natural. Who says she is a wooden actress again?? There were enough plot twists to keep the movie interesting, and the supporting roles were just as deserving of praise. It was very easy to sympathize with all the characters, especially Jack and Jackie, who are both broken in different ways. I will say that the sex scene between Jack and Jackie seemed like titillating filler that neither added or took away from the plot. The ending was touching, albeit a little confusing. Don't think the movie brought me much closure, nor answered my questions. But I fancy a plot that keeps me thinking hours on end to make sense of the whole thing. I recommend!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Puzzling storyline. A feel-good factor in the end. Watch it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(*WARNING - SPOILER ALERT)First impressions ? why haven't I watched this before? A complete mind boggling movie. It started off as a cold, depressing, 'I don't belong in this asylum' type of movie and slowly, but gradually turned into one of the most puzzling movies I ever watched. Kind of reminded me of 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'. The story was fresh, but could have got tighter and twisted towards the end. Anyway, here is a brief recap.Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) is a war hero who gets injured in the head while on duty in Iraq. He comes back as a hero, but seems to get wrongfully convicted for murdering a policeman on duty. It all happens when he hitchhikes a ride with a guy after having helped a woman and her kid with their car (He gives his dog tag to the small girl). He tries to defend himself by mentioning the woman and the girl, but no records show of their existence.He is declared insane and sent to an asylum (The year is 1992). Here, he is treated by Dr. Thomas Becker (the villain doc played by Kris Kristofferson) and Dr. Beth Lorensen (the helpful, caring doc played by Jennifer Jason). As part of his treatment, he is put in a jacket and is put in isolation in a confined space. Initially, he starts to hallucinate or that's what we are made to think. But after a few scenes of 'what the f is going on, it soon dawns that, during those hallucinations, he is actually travelling in time to the future. During those intermittent 'visions', he gets to meet Jackie Price (Keira Knightley) and realizes that the year is 2007. And actually, Jackie is the small girl after he sees his dog tag in her room. Soon, he tries to convince her to help him find out what happened to him in 1992. However, there is a hitch. All these visions happen when he is in the jacket. So, with advice from his trusted companion, Rudy McKenzie (played entertainingly by Daniel Craig) he devises ways to get back into the jacket. Once in the jacket, he travels to the future and with the help of Jackie, finds out what actually happens in the present. What happens then is his effort to find out about his death in the present. Without giving away too much, I would suggest to seriously give it a try. It is worth it.</fullReview>

It's as beautiful a movie about the ugliness of life that I can remember seeing. Kelly Lynch and Daniel Craig were so convincing in their roles that I had to remind myself that it was them in their respective roles. Keira Knightly and Adrien Brody are two stars worthy of any praise that comes their way - and I measure all actors against the stars of the Golden Age of Hollywood. The hauntingly beautiful music that plays when Jackie and Jack are together was perfect and the scene near the conclusion where he meets little Jackie was very deeply touching. I'm certain that many folks were confused or felt that such events as portrayed in this film were implausible. Well, they are, but I appreciated this story for how it moved me and I haven't been moved since Kevin Costner realized that the catcher was his father in "Field of Dreams".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Starks is a Gulf War veteran who, upon return to America to recuperate from a gunshot wound to the head, is charged and convicted with the shooting of a police officer. He is committed to an institution where he is subjected to what appears to be a radical form of treatment, which we understand will calm his violent tendencies. Whilst undergoing this treatment, Starks finds himself inexplicably propelled into the future, meeting a young woman named Jackie, and discovering he dies in four days time. Having found him wandering in the freezing cold, apparently with nowhere to go, Jackie is at first reluctant to help him in any way beyond providing him a place to stay for the night, not even wanting to exchange names, but the walls of resistance break down and together they attempt to find a way of preventing the inevitable.The film keeps a bleak tone very well, and boasts great performances from Adrien Brody, who may have his ups and downs with regard to what he chooses to appear in, but is undeniably a strong presence on screen; his desperation in the "treatment" scenes is almost tangible, and we really do feel the claustrophobia of being stuck in a morgue drawer. I understand Brody chose to spend a great deal of time in the jacket of the title, so as to be able to sell the experience convincingly on screen. Daniel Craig, pre-Bond, whose performance wouldn't have been at all out of place in "Twelve Monkeys", is one of those where looking back at the film now, you have to look twice to recognise him. Possibly the most surprising is Keira Knightley, who turns in a performance about as far removed from Elisabeth Swan as you could ask for, as Jackie, an unquestionably American, chain-smoking waitress, whose dependence on alcohol is much-highlighted. Her persistence in offering Starks a drink should border on ridiculous, but it works, because she sells the line, "Do you want a drink?" perfectly as the only thing she is comfortable saying, emphasising just how low and lost her character is. I would go as far as to say she almost steals the film (that's almost ), which is a bold statement when Adrien Brody is your lead! It is a shame that performances like this were overshadowed by a certain pirate franchise.....The film deals with two time-frames, and the putting-together of them, without spending too much time in one, or ever becoming confusing, deserves some applause."The Jacket" does have its flaws, such as unremarkable support performances from Kris Kristofferson and Jeniffer Jason Leigh, who aren't bad, but aren't really given a great deal to do. Its pacing is strange, with certain elements of the story fleeting by, or only glazed over in the writing process; a great deal of space and brevity of detail where you expect deeper-resonating dialogue, especially for a film with a concept like this. The film is, beyond being an off-beat thriller, something of a philosophical essay in film format, dealing with things such as the perception of insanity, the existence of fate, and whether how we feel for another person can ever make fighting the lost cause worthwhile, so the fact that it pussyfoots around the themes, rather than getting its teeth really stuck in, is a bit disappointing, Much like "The Soloist",this suffers that same issue of the writers, Tom Bleecker and Mark Rocco, apparently losing faith in their ability to really delve into the ideas, and becoming unsure of how to pull it all together.That said, they do manage to make it all work, and even with the flaws, it remains an intriguing idea that holds the attention, with very exciting lead performances. It is also a film with enough directorial flair, that one would have kept an eye out for other work by John Maybury, except that beyond a couple of episodes of "Rome", he hasn't really done anything worthy of mention. Nevertheless, if this sort of "thinking man's", existentialist thriller is your cup of tea, whilst it is quite far from perfect, "The Jacket" is still worthy of your Saturday evening's viewing. It has enough to it that in time to come, it may well be discussed by film-fanatics and philosophy students alike, as an interesting cult movie, even if it is somewhat forgotten.</fullReview>

The mental hospital uses him as an experiment...The best part of this film is the creativity. You might find yourself asking "how?" often during the film, only to find out that there could be multiple explanations.

		<shortDescription>A different take</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where does this movie come from? A story by someone who had never done anything before, a script by a someone who'd only written one thing before it, a director who had made nothing noticeable but a fictional biography of a British painter? "The Jacket" deserves credit already for coming from somekind of darkness, and that's what gives the film an extra point. The film is an unexpected surprise; a flawed tale about the deepest fears of the human mind.It's flawed because it could have known better and had all the elements for it. We meet Sergeant Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) when he tells us he has died, but we see him alive again. He walks through the snow and finds a little girl named Jackie and her mother Jane with their car stopped in the road. He helps them, then he asks for a lift and gets into a guy's car; a policeman stops them. Next thing we know, Jack is being accused of murder and charged innocent because of 'mental problems'. He's sent to a clinic, an institution, a hospital, call it whatever you want.Maybe it's too much to take for a few minutes, but this is the way it happens. Later in the clinic one could think that Jack will go crazy, like Rambo crazy, because he's been in the war and all that. But this doesn't happen, and if you try to figure "The Jacket" out leaving its simplicity aside, you may arrive to a lot of different conclusions. I've seen crazy, you've seen crazy: the patients of "One flew over the cuckoo's nest", the girls in "Girl Interrupted". It's different here: craziness is rarely seen (specifically in a character played scarily by Daniel Craig) and in one point director John Maybury uses it merely as an instrument to get to a crucial part of the movie. There's a jacket, and it will take Jack to the future so he can try to figure out what happened to him. If I have to be honest, this 'time-travel' approach seems to be the film's main preoccupation, and it works. But what's the problem? It's too easy, too convenient, too planned. Jack meets two fundamental individuals at the hospital: Dr. Becker (Kris Kristofferson?he's great) and Dr. Beth Lorenson (the infallible Jennifer Jason Leigh); and he'll meet them again in the future, and they'll be surprised and you can try to guess what happens. If you watch "The Jacket" taking only this approach into consideration, you will be entertained but you should be disappointed. That's why I looked at some other things and other movies came to mind. "The I Inside", with its intensive use of resources to leave the viewer clear that a man was going nuts and an also intensive dramatic feeling that sometimes was laughable; "The Butterfly Effect", daring and unstoppable, but more measured and truly worried about characters. In both of those movies, the main characters travel through time, and everything seems quite frenetic. Not here: Maybury makes sure there's not an excessive use of the score or the musical supervision that may have introduced unnecessary songs; he respects silence and doesn't abuse of 'time-traveling' resources. The other key is Brody's performance: his humane composition of Jack never indicates someone about to explode. This guy stares, speaks quietly and with long pauses, seems confused and down to earth about the sort of gift he's been given. I haven't even mentioned that while going back and forth in time, he falls in love with the same little girl (now older) he helped on the road before, Jackie, played by a stupendous Keira Knightley that grows slowly into love, delivering a performance that starts from a very deep bottom, morally speaking, and culminates between the clouds. As I see it and said it (because the movie deserves the detailed analysis), "The Jacket" is a flawed tale about the deepest fears of the human mind, like death. Flawed because it wastes a tremendous ensemble that gives their best, flawed because it misleads the viewer with a story that's simpler than it appears to be. But its flaws contain a bid deal of optimism. "The Jacket" believes in love and is sure that death may not be so bad and scary. There's a moment during which the darkness the movie came from and took place, turns to light. It may make you smile.</fullReview>

The movie is wonderfully shot, really places you into the world of The Jacket, the score is good but really the aspect that makes the movie one of the best I've seen is the acting. The acting is truly moving, i don't think i have seen two actors with more on-screen chemistry than Ardrien Brody and Keira Knightely. At the end of the movie you will be left wanting more of the story, wanting more of them. The Jacket is a wonderful film which i would recommend to anyone interested in fantasy, love and really good acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time Out of Bound</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A clever sci-fi thriller directed by John Maybury that pays homage to both 12 MONKEYS and JACOB'S LADDER. Jack Starks is a soldier fighting in the Persian Gulf who gets shot in the head by a young, frightened kid. He returns to life as he's about to be pronounced dead only and resumes his life in the States after the was is over. One day, he has two fateful encounters that will mark his life from then on: a drunken mother and her young daughter whose car he fixes, and a man who picks him up only to be later stopped by a state trooper. Caught and sent to a state mental facility, he gets an abusive form of shock treatment with an experimental drug that allows him to re-visit his past, his future, and enable to change and re-shape his own life.THE JACKET may not have the much of the whimsical imagery and multiple, confusing story lines of 12 MONKEYS and the sense of impending horror present in JACOB'S LADDER, but its sparse images and the sense of cold, realistic despair sets it aside in its own right and allow for the more sci-fi elements to come through believably. This mental facility is a little closer to the one in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, with Kris Kristofferson playing a male counterpart to Louise Fletcher's Nurse Ratched. Daniel Craig has a small part as a lunatic who may or not have murdered his own wife and knows about this "jacket" where patients are sent to face their own "corrective reassignment". Keira Knightley plays a dual role, in which for the most of the movie, her character comes off as harsh, bitter, but once a warning is taken into consideration, she reintroduces herself to Brody as a compassionate, friendly person. Hers is the type of role that Jennifer Jason Leigh would have had a field day with, but Jason Leigh comes off well as a well-meaning doctor who wants to help Brody.THE JACKET is a pretty good entry in the time-traveling genre, but in essence, all it is is a murder mystery with sci-fi overtones. The problem with the movie is that the issue of did-he/didn't he never gets resolved the way it should be; hence, the character of Jack Starks remains positioned in this Kafkaesque place where he is perpetually the victim of a crime he did not commit. Other minor points, such as a comeuppance for Dr. Becker, do not happen in a satisfactory way, but even then it still is an entertaining watch, especially when there aren't many movies today that can tackle the issue of time-bending without insulting the audience or selling out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the first time I have enjoyed a physcology movie, And also the first time I have seen a REAL murder in a movie, they call it war but it is still one human killing another,the military footage at the start of this movie is real, first time I've seen that. This Film was very confusing the first time I saw it for the fact that I had missed the first 80vminutes of it, then turned it off after 10 minutes so i missed the last few minutes also, only seen when he was delivering the note to jean, then i seen it from 15 minutes into it to the end, I loved it and caught it again a few hours later and seen from the start, Adrien Brodeys best performance to date, and Keira was awesome I really love the way this movie was laid out, The idea/concept is not the most original but its the best made movie with this idea one of the top 25 movies I have ever seen.top 5 movies of 2005.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you liked Memento and Identity, movies that messed with your head and made you think, you'll probably like The Jacket. As in Memento, you'll sometimes wonder if now is now. And as in Identity, you may wonder if one or more of the characters is "Live or Memorex." The only problem I had with the film was the pairing of Adrien Brody with Kiera Knightley. They were both fine in their individual roles, but for whatever reason the romantic connection between them seemed a bit off key. Jennifer Jason Leigh and Kris Kristofferson were well-cast in their supporting roles.If you check your skepticism at the door before you enter the theater, you should be in for a good ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How I wish I could give this movie a 6.5 out of 10. I am erring on the high side, because some of the twists worked for me. The acting is uniformly excellent, especially the performance from Jennifer Jason Leigh, whom I generally do not like as an actress. Her character is well-conceived and behaves in a consistent and logical way. Nolte is good, if a little under-utilized.Many will compare this film to 'The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,' and in a sense, that's fair. There are some cross-overs, and some similarities in technique. Also, fans of recent horror films such as 'Dead End' and 'The I Inside' will find much to like here, in a higher-budget package. And inevitable connections to 'The Butterfly Effect' seem likely. 'Dead End' is scarier, 'The I Inside' less satisfying, and only the re-cut version of 'The Butterfly Effect' is superior to 'The Jacket.' Actually, the re-cut version of 'Butterfly' was one of the few horror films in recent years that actually involved my humanity deeply. And because I am a Cthulhu mythos freak, I have to plug 'The Attic Expeditions' as a flawed but groundbreaking look at the issues many of these more recent films raise.One frustration that I have with 'The Jacket' mirrors my reaction to 'Jacob's Ladder'-it's clear that much of the movie had to be trimmed in places, and, as every commentator has noted, it leaves big gaps in parts of the story. However, in 'The Jacket,' I think this is in part intentional: our minds are being wiped/altered/damaged as we move through the story. 'Eternal Sunshine' has much the same effect, and of course does it better, at least in this reviewer's opinion.Further, the DVD of 'The Jacket' I rented did not have a great many deleted scenes on it. I'm not saying that all movies of this genre need to have a down-beat ending (in fact, the need for an eternally down-beat ending in horror irritates the crap out of me), but it did feel like a studio wrap-up for palatability's sake. To see how a film can handle this kind of plot-line well, see the re-cut 'Butterfly' as above. My sense remains that there is a great deal more deleted material out there associated with 'The Jacket,' and I'd really like to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Freaky but an OK movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First thing that attracted me to this movie was the thriller-link; I always look for the description on IMDb.com for the type of movie, sometimes i look at the votes too. This movie started out as a war-movie. But in a few scenes the movie turns around and gets into a very good drama/thriller movie. The Ring is a little bit better maybe. For me the "jacket-scenes in the closet" were a little bit to much. The first scene almost made me stop looking. When you are only a little bit claustrophobic..... beware!! The story needs this scene with all its drama and scariness. It gets a little bit difficult when time as we know it changes. After all i was very pleased i kept looking this movie. Small things that happen in somebodies life can change other people(s life's) for a great deal. This movie makes that clear. One cigarette can change a whole life. This movie could be a very long commercial for smoke- or fire-detectors!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen four incredible movies this year. These are Sideways, Garden State, The Machinist and this one..The Jacket is categorized as a horror/thriller/fantasy movie. I didn't interpreted this movie at all in this way. According to movie, this is a romantic friendship/love story with a large twist of science-fiction. The movie gives a similar feel-sad-but-in-a-good-way feeling that many have experienced in movies such as Vanilla Sky, Sixth Sense etc.I would really like to recommend this movie to everyone! See it together with your loved one and see it more as a love story instead of horror film. You won't be disappointed.My favorite line is without any doubt: "What's wrong, Doctor, you look like you've seen a ghost..." when Jack meets his doctor in "the future"..Score: 9 out of 10</fullReview>

I was amazed as well as "The Invisible". The same atmosphere and the Music gives the film the breeze for the romance / drama.Music: Brian Eno, Co-Producer: Steven Soderbergh.I will turn my attention to John Maybury and the Writers of this film! Big remark (!!!): I cannot share/emphasize the recommended films below like "Halloween" (horror) or "Lethal Weapon" (action) with this fair and beautiful, slow and profound drama that moved me to tears.You will see a film like "The Invisible" or related atmosphere but more known "Donny Darko".Hope my perception helps and will be shared.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Jacket is a film that on the surface is a great mystery thriller, but once you start looking into it more deeply you can see that it's a lot more complex and intelligent than it makes itself out to be. Going into any detail on this would certainly start spoiling things, but once you look closely you can start to open up a lot of theories to exactly what happened in this disturbing asylum and, more specifically, in this fragile mind. It is a truly brilliant, mindbending film with so much layers in it's main character and it's overall narrative.Adrien Brody delivers a shatteringly real performance as Jack Starks that disturbed me to my core. It's just as good as his flawless work in The Pianist. Keira Knightley steps out of her comfort zone to play an internally anguished girl who becomes the one thing Starks can rely on and she is wonderful. 2005 proved that she has tremendous range; a lot more than most people give her credit for just because all they see is a girl who does period films from time to time. Daniel Craig provides tremendous support, which as always for him went completely unnoticed, as a fellow patient in the asylum that Starks is placed in. Jennifer Jason Leigh and Kris Kristofferson round off this flawless cast as two tortured doctors who make significant, and very different, impacts on his life. The screenplay is one of the most unique I've ever seen and never ceases to deliver brilliance.The technical aspects (especially the editing) are phenomenal. And, of course, I can't praise a film this much without giving a lot of credit to it's director. John Maybury hits every mark just right, tying all of this genius up into a well-structured package that I can't seem to find a single dent in. It really is an amazing psychological thriller that blends so many different genres together into something absolutely perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe that many filmgoers try too hard to figure out the why's and who's and what's and when's of a film. They ask "why this" or "why that". I have found it beneficial to just sit back and watch the film. Of course we'll ask questions at times, this is our nature. But it is fun to simply appreciate the differentness of a film. To say to one'self, "wow that was really strange, I loved it!". To absorb the story for what it is, a story. A vision by the filmmakers whom wished to share it with the audience. Something that moved them and hopefully us as well. That is my perception of "The Jacket". It was brilliantly written and acted. There are many emotionally charged moments. Adrien Brody was great, as usual. And the ensemble cast performed admirably. This is a story to appreciate, not to dissect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A second chance to do the right thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good science fiction film deals more with human nature than it does with cool gadgetry and special effects. Take for instance 2001, Solaris (the original), La Jetee or 12 Monkeys, Gattaca, Children of Men and Blade Runner (yes, I know it has flying cars but that's besides the point), all these films were concerned with human nature either subjectively or objectively. Such is the case with The Jacket. Jack Starks, our protagonist, isn't concerned with the actual mechanics of how he was able to travel to the future, nor is he fascinated with the travel itself, instead he's concerned about the people who exist in that future. In the hospital, where jack is imprisoned, we witness the horrible mistreatment he undergoes. He is constantly drugged up and contained within a drawer (the kind you see in the morgue) while strapped tightly in a straight jacket. The doctors have control of his physical self but it is Jack's will power, his being that they can't imprison. Physically he's trapped and abused but his true nature, his selflessness has found freedom through the time travel (a side effect of his experimental treatment).In this sense the film becomes very clear to the viewer that it's introspective in nature and therefore less concerned in gimmicks (special effects, action scenes).I very much enjoyed this film and I don't want to go into further details and I don't think it's possible to. That's what makes this such a great film is that its theme allows for multiple interpretations which will result in multiple viewings. If you are into the films that I mentioned earlier than give this one a shot and if you are not into those films or have not seen them then start with this one and go from there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I loved the fact that it was the future that was seen whilst being in the jacket, instead of the usual 'looking into the past to change the future' concept. Most of the scenes looked very cold which helped to subconsciously change the overall mood of the film. Adrien Brody worked great and he actually did look terrified in some of the jacket scenes. Keira Knightley was quite good as the lethargic love interest, but the part really could have been played by anyone. Just like the Butterfly Effect the film is damn near perfect unless you look to deeply into the story too much which then reveals the plot holes and mistakes that could ruin the film completely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really expected this film to have a higher rating from IMDb users. I read a couple reviews that said they couldn't keep up with the film, and couldn't grasp what was going on. Don't comment on something you don't understand please. =) The way this movie is presented to the viewer, it is truly touching. Adrian Brody does yet another bang up job and really deserves credit for participating in true art. I can't really find any mistakes the movie made as it paces along following our tormented hero. I call him a hero because in the end, that's what he turns out to be. I also read that it doesn't explain what causes him to jump into his futuristic visions, where if you pay attention it most certainly does. They explain that the drugs given to Jack and the other patients, are supposed to in essence MAKE them hallucinate and peel away the layers of insanity in a claustrophobic environment where they can accept the fact they are troubled. The drugs are what make the patients fly into a world of chaos and emotion, the claustrophobia mixed with the drugs and focus on reality is what makes him time-jump. It is conceived that maybe only a sane person put under this treatment for very insane people can adjust to the mental suffering it induces. No matter what you argue on a theoretical basis, the truth about this movie is it's fantastic. The setting has a gritty and a "One Flew Over the Cuccoos Nest" type feel. The story is fast paced and goes directly for the punchline instead of dancing around itself and trying to make you think already more than you are. The morals are introduced in a beautiful fairy tale like manner. The acting is better than most, and the characters are well developed and make you care for them. The directing is splendid and the independent film feel works very nicely. The script works well with the actors and the idea is never flinching. I can't find one real bad quality about this motion picture which is why it deserves a thoughtful 8/10. What I can find about this movie that is flawed and the reason it doesn't score perfect or make it in my top 50, is that all the ideas are taken from other movies. Even the feel for the film is something I have felt before from other movies. To get a perfect score from me, you most make a motion picture art, AND it must be totally original and thought provoking. This movie is art but answers itself precisely and takes other's ideas and puts them together for the plot. Still, this is an excellent movie and I recommend it for anybody wanting to be fully entertained and satisfied! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is expertly written, with a complex plot of tangled emotions and realities. It is an excellent film for those who want to get away from the cookie-cutter plot movies and view an astounding piece of art. Adrien Brody is absolutely fantastic for this role as Jack Starks; who, throughout the movie, discovers the truth about his past, and possibly others' future. The only thing about the movie that didn't quite fit was Kiera Knightley's role. Although she did a pretty good American accent, she was clearly out shined by Adrien. But for her, it is one of her best performances because not only is she working with a foreign accent (to her at least), she is also playing a dark, emotionally distressed character- which, if you have seen her other works, is a huge leap. The cinematography was perfect,for while there were many times when the camera zoomed-in on different parts of characters' faces very quickly, it never had a Blair-witch feel. The plot was gripping, although i must admit i had to watch it twice to pick up every small detail. I have to say this has become one of my favorite movies of all time. ( You know what, I think that I will watch it right now, in fact! (PS: for any Sex and the City fans out there, Smith Jerod has a small part in the beginning as a cop :)</fullReview>

At first this movie The Jacket reminded me of the Butterfly Effect and Secret Window. But it began to have its own sort of taste. The whole outlook of "the Jacket" was very unique from the beginning picture sequences, with the soldiers dying and the gun aim, all the way to the end where "Moth Lights" was mimicked in the credits. It portrays a very unique idea, not a everyday movie. It takes time and depth to write something that happens in the mind. But it is also like a clean slate. No one knows what goes on in an persons mind. Sometimes they don't want to know. But it portrays the right idea, fellow writers might agree with me on this. There is an constant action of ideas, thoughts, fantasy's. This happens in Jack Starks mind, making him seem normal to us. But different and insane to a person with a single minded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Jacket has overtones of Jacob's Ladder, Barton Fink, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and even The Butterfly Effect. It's a very dark Kafkaesque journey into terror, and on several levels it works very well indeed. Adrian Brody is effective as the brain damaged Gulf War Veteran, Jack Starks, who suffering from amnesia is accused of shooting a Patrol Officer. He is committed to an Asylum that makes One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest look a garden party, and undergoes experimental treatment by a Dr. Becker, Kris Kristofferson, that includes being drugged, confined by a straight jacket, and interred in a morgue body draw for varying periods. In some way this apparently projects him into the future where he meets Jackie, Keira Knightly, and he finds he has very little time to live. Brody who resembles Barton Fink not a little, does a great job portraying the unfortunate inmate, he has the right combination of weird little guy, but with an inner strength that wins the day. There are some quite horrific moments, and suspense as the plot unfolds, and we are never sure what is real and what is imagined. Clever direction and editing tie up a good example of its type.</fullReview>

When a film requires you to understand - and this movie certainly pretends that - then it has to make sense. Otherwise, you better sit down for pure entertainment, like a Batman movie. I've enjoyed a lot movies that ask you to think a little beyond what's just presented to you (like Jacob's Ladder or Memento).

		<shortDescription>Not a good fit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack (Adrien Brody), a near-casualty in the Gulf War, returns home a shell of his former self and is accused and convicted of murdering a police officer, which he doesn't remember. Remanded to a sanitarium, Jack undergoes an unusual type of therapy at the hands of Dr. Becker (Kris Kristofferson) that involves being strapped inside a straitjacket and tossed into a morgue drawer for hours, even nights.During his time in the drawer, Jack - mostly deprived of his senses - finds he has the ability to time travel some 15 years into the future, where he sees some of the consequences of the actions of the past. Does he risk changing the future to protect the present? Alternately turgid and creepy, The Jacket relies a little too much on Brody's expressive, elongated face to move the story along. His work here isn't bad at all, really, but the plot doesn't always hold up to close scrutiny.Before his arrest, Jack had encountered a woman and her young daughter alongside their disabled truck. Jack gives his dog tags to the girl and fixes the vehicle, receiving no thanks for his aid. But while in the jacket, Jack encounters a sad, disillusioned diner waitress who just happens to possess his old dog tags.Luckily for Jack and the audience, it doesn't take long for him to figure out what's happening when he's put into the drawer; the question is how he can use the information he's gleaned to make things better for the girl and her mother. Thrown in for good measure are the requisite Convincing a Good Doctor (a bespectacled Jennifer Jason Leigh) of His Time Traveling and Confronting the Not-Bad-but-Misguided Doctor. Oh, and figuring out who really killed the cop in the first place.The plot itself isn't terribly complicated, which is certainly a relief, but it moves so slowly at times that such a benefit is rendered moot. As good of an actor that Brody (and the disheveled, gothlike Keira Knightley) is, all the clever emoting in the world can't make up for a pace somewhat akin to jogging in mud.One major saving grace, though, is the ending, which feels very sincere and is in fact quite heart rendering. Very well played, even if the rest of the film isn't terribly rewarding.The Jacket: **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Art films discover science fiction yet again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much in the same way "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless" mind reveled in the supposed novelty of memory erasure plots, "The Jacket" takes on time travel, specifically the ever popular if-you-knew-the-future-could-you-prevent-it question. The set-up is an interesting one -- Jack, a Gulf war vet suffering from previously diagnosed amnesia gets the supposed leniency of an insanity ruling when he's charged with murdering a police officer and blocks out the memories that could have established his innocence. The court confines him to an insane asylum where the doctors treat the inmates as criminals requiring drastic, life-threatening treatments in an effort to cure them of their violent tendencies.During one of these treatments when confined in the straight "Jacket" of the title, like Billy Pilgrim, Jack finds his mind unstuck in time. After seeing terrifying images of past events, he finds himself able to focus on a future -- but one in which he has been dead for years, having expired mere days into the future. With the help of a now grown-up girl he befriended in the past, he plays detective to try to learn the circumstances of his death with the hope of preventing it or otherwise bettering the future.For those of us who have seen this plot unfold many times (actually there was an "Outer Limits" episode on the other night where a scientist travels into the future, learns his wife has been murdered, and then tries to prevent it by similar leaps back and forth in time), I had hoped this film would say something new about time paradoxes -- or perhaps turn out not to be about time travel at all, but I was disappointed. Although the film is well-acted and deals fairly realistically and consistently with Jack's interactions with the future versions of the present-day characters, the art house pace also severely reduces the feeling of urgency that should at least have characterized the last part where Jack's death is imminent. Because of the creepiness of its setting, the emotional horror the films invokes at someone being pinned down, shot up with drugs, and stuffed in a box in the morgue, there could have been a very intense build-up followed by a huge payoff at the end in terms of emotional intensity, but instead the film glides to a happy ending that completely ignores the time paradox. It also leaves the audience having to figure out for itself exactly how that ending could have come about.All in all, I could think of a number of better endings accepting time travel as real, though most would have required eliminating the sudden romance between Jack and Jackie (which as another person pointed out, seems out of place anyway considering in Jack's time, Jackie is still a child.) Even better would have been one using a completely different (and perhaps not supernatural) explanation for the events a la "Jacob's Ladder". The apparent coincidence of Jack and Jackie having virtually the same name made me think she might be merely a projection of himself in his mind whom he needed to "save", and that everything that seemed to happen took place in his mind during one of the horrendous treatments as a means for him to hold onto his sanity.Despite all these problems, I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes time travel/supernatural puzzle films, but recommend to the director and scriptwriter that the next time they want to deal with science fiction concepts, they should go out and discover what ground has already been covered many times before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did anyone see Butterfly Effect? Change the actors to Adrien Brody and Kierra Knightly and you have The Jacket. This movie starts off with Jack Stark being "killed" in the Gulf War. He survives his wounds to become a drifter.He is nice to a lady and her daughter whom just happen to be stranded on the side of the road. The drunken mother does not notice the strange man that comes up to her and touches her, but as soon as he fixes the truck she becomes aware enough to get her daughter away from the creep. To push the issue that no good deed goes unpunished,our hapless hero accepts a ride from a hip, I don't care about anything, youngster. This pointless character kills a cop and leaves our hero unconscious in the snow to take the blame. Because our hero got the bronze star while in the Gulf he is found not guilty by reasons of insanity.So he is sent to the mental hospital where patients are treated like lab rats.For some unknown reason (we are to believe it is because he is a criminal) he is injected with some kind of serum and placed into a straight jacket and forced into a morgue locker. Once in this locker our hero begins to get flashes of events that have happened. We learn sometime later that the more me panics, he will then be able to see the future. When he travels to the future he meets the little girl that was on the side of he road.She is all grown up now and seem to be heading down the road that her Mommy was on that day they first met. When he tells her whom he really is, she does not believe him and tells him that he died about 15 years prior in the mental hospital.He then takes this as a mission to figure out who plans to kill him and why.With each visit into the locker he goes to Jackie(Kierra Knightly) and they get closer while gathering more information on what happens to him. They get so close that the next step is of course for them to have sex. Did they forget that she is really still a little girl?So they get their one night of love together,which really is not needed in the movie at all.What does he learn from his many trips? The doctor that experimented on them (himself and two others) really is sorry about what he did and is haunted by the men he mistreated everyday. And the person that killed him? It was Mother Nature. He slips on some ice and hits his head.There really were more things in this movie. I think the director had many messages that he wanted to get out, but just did not know how to do it. This movie needed more time in development.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointingly Average</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adrien Brody (The Pianist) plays a Gulf War veteran, placed in an asylum on his return home after being accused of murder. His doctor uses unconventional means to cure his madness, injecting him with experimental drugs and placing him in the morgue's body drawer, which causes him to have visions of his own death, giving him four days to find out what is real if he wants to save his own life.The plot sounds intriguing but the execution wasn't very good. The film felt very much like Jacob's Ladder and between the two films, Jacob's Ladder is a lot better. That doesn't mean that The Jacket is a bad film, it's just an average one and its also a missed opportunity.Adrien Brody, unsurprisingly, gives a pretty good performance. He keeps the film moving along nicely and he gives us a reason to watch the film. I usually like Keira Knightley except here she doesn't seem to be trying. Her performance is wooden and she can't keep up with Brody. They should have hired someone else who would equal Brody's strength. Jennifer Jason Leigh had a small role but her performance is pretty good and it's nice to see her in another movie.John Maybury directs and he doesn't do a very good job. He makes the film look creepy and feel creepy but the twists are easy to figure out and he didn't do a good job editing the film. The movie becomes messy to watch during the second half and the ending is handled poorly. It started off nicely but then the film took a familiar road and did nothing exciting or interesting with the story. In the end, The Jacket may add up to a rental but it wasn't a particularly good movie nor a bad one just an average one. Rating 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A psychological thriller minus the psychological</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you ask too many questions about this movie, you'll just start to hate it more. More or less this is a thriller that's thrilling in theory, but tries to be a psychological thriller and fails. You just can't ask questions, just go with it. For those of you who just can't see though the major holes in the story will not enjoy this movie, but leave frustrated.The film does have some things that make it worth watching if you're in the right mood. The film is mesmerizing. In fact, it's so mesmerizing that I didn't actually start to think about the film's major problems until long after I left the theater. This is partly due to the interesting subject matter, but even more so due to the great filming style. Also, for the most part, the movie is well acted. Adrien Brody is decent, but overacts too much. Keira Knightly, who is said to be a huge talent ready to burst, also does a decent job although I don't see the huge talent. The best acting is with the supporting characters, like Daniel Craig and Jennifer Jason Leigh.Generally, the movie seems to try and please everyone. It has elements of thriller, sci-fi, romance, drama, murder mystery, and even fantasy. It's too bad that it never settles into anything, and the romance is extremely unnecessary and awkward. Within all these genres, the huge problem lies in the time-travel. I won't spoil anything, but it's not at all thought through. In conclusion, this may be a fun ride that's might be worth it if you're in the right mood. Just don't expect to be psychologically challenged.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Escape to the future or not?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Jacket" (2005) is a sci-fi and perhaps time travel movie, which means it's not going to make any sense as time travel unless the writers make an extraordinary effort to cover over the paradoxes of time travel. In this movie, they don't. The logical approach to the story is that everything we see happening that seems to be time travel is in Brody's mind. That's definitely a feasible approach. A movie like this needs to wrap things up somehow and take a stand. Here, the position is to inject some philosophical content in order to be able to end it. This is done in the movie.Whatever the ambiguities, the movie spins an engaging if fanciful tale. Most of it is enjoyable, and that's mainly because Adrien Brody is so excellent in his part. You cannot help but identify with this man, with so much going against him. And the movie is helped along by such good support from Kris Kristofferson and Daniel Craig. The winter settings are just right for the story. If you stop to think much about the story, you cannot buy into it, even without the time travel aspect. And that supports the notion that it's all in Brody's mind. It seems that the writers have found themselves an out. In that case, what's it all mean? What's the takeaway from what a dying man might possibly be imagining or going through? It seems to be that he doesn't want to die. He wants to come back to life. Keep on trying for life, Brody counsels the woman who either fell asleep with a lit cigarette or didn't, as the case may be. The idea seems to be to make life count. That's the message. There are worse messages, and a lot of movies have none.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>well i have seen this movie long time ago and iv watched it again today,so i just don't know where to start. Acting - first of all id like to say about acting of all, from leading to outstanding. Adrien is Brilliant so is Kiera but i want say compliments to whole cast from Craig to Babak who is also Iraq boy... Directing - is so good, it is keeping you to watch,not just watch to watch it inside and think about all of the scene and meanings of them. Soundtrack - soundtrack is really calm,nice and thrilling,internal at same time,i cant imagine any other soundtrack for this plot and movie so enough with track.... Now i want to say a few word about the ending and meaning.like we all have noticed that this flick lets us to have our opinions about end and whole movie and makes us think about it after watch(this thing i loved most) id like to say my versions of end.The first one: Jack was murdered by the Iraq Boy and whole movie is agony or some hallucination.why i think that? 1)He is bleeding from the same place where he was when he got shot from Iraq boy and when he died in last scene 2)the fact that the jacket place is actually morgue so if you ll watch closely its kind of same frame when he lies wounded in Iraq and when hi lies over Jacket, i mean same eyes, same face same camera moving and stuff. i cant figure out the Jackies role in this version truly. The second one. what just plot says,Jack died in the past and survived in future so survived Jackies mom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot express how much I love this movie... or perhaps more importantly, why I love this movie. It's just a beautiful movie that makes you feel emotions both happy and sad. The acting and filmmaking are incredible. The plot is simple and even random in some regards, but it all works and the movie plays like a work of art.The enjoyment that I got from the Jacket is definitely different from the way that I enjoy most films. There is something greater to this film that most films don't offer. That being said, this is definitely one of my favorite films. It actually pains me a little that it has gotten so little recognition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delusion with a new approach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am always on the look-out for movies that deviate from the norm, something new and refreshing. In that department, this movie delivers perfectly. It is part of the time-travel genre but approaches it with a very unique story. A war veteran is unjustly accused of murder and sentenced to an insane asylum due to his lapses in memory and other planted evidence by the real killer. The theme of unjust treatment always gets me interested and engaged, rooting for the character. But despite his suffering, he is increasingly conflicted when he's stuffed in the morgue drawer where he goes on a liberating journey while inside. Is it all in his mind?Adrien Brody's smile was very heart-warming and Kiera Knightley's acting as an unstable, lonely girl was very well done indeed, complimented by her sexy voice.The two hours passed quickly and I found myself wanting to know more, though clearly the movie ended on a perfect note. Watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Jacket</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you start a movie starring Adrien Brody, you know you're in for quite an experience. An actor like Daniel Day-Lewis or Al Pacino, Brody immerses himself in his work and always becomes quite believable in the character he is playing. His role in The Jacket was no different. This dark, gritty film from 2005, captures the essence of despair of a world Brody's character had already left.We first meet our star, Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) in a military hospital during the Gulf War. The soldier was shot and believed to have died, when the stunned doctors realize he is alive and needs further medical attention right away. Once he comes to, Jack navigates to his native Vermont, afflicted by bouts of amnesia. Hitchhiking to get around, Jack is picked up by a man who murders a police officer when he is pulled over while Jack is in the car. Jack is accused of murdering the police officer, and is sentenced to an institution for the criminally insane. Once admitted to the hospital, he unwillingly becomes a participant in a Doctor Thomas Becker's (Kris Kristofferson) experiments. The experiments have Jack laced into a heavy straightjacket in the drawer of the morgue. Throughout this "treatment", Jack gets flashbacks of the future and the effect is has on a little girl (Kiera Knightly) headed for a troubled life because of her alcoholic/drug addicted mother he meets while hitchhiking. When one flashback shows that he will die within the week, he engages in a race against time to save the girl and her mother.This film was not my cup of tea, as the saying goes. The character development seemed minimal, and when it was fleshed out, seemed as if nothing good had ever happened in these people's lives. The film was shot in a gritty, dark way, which fit the story line; but was a little difficult to view as some scenes were difficult to discern due to the extreme darkness of the screen. Admittedly, I'm also not a huge fan of Adrien Brody's. His acting was wonderful in The Pianist, but I have just not been impressed with him since. So, granted, I am biased against the actor, although I'm always willing to be proved wrong, I just wasn't this time. The overly dark sets and lighting were detractors that were too difficult for me to overcome. The story was an interesting one, but perhaps could have been better developed or fleshed out. The Jacket had me hopeful, but in the end left me just wanting a better story out of it.Fans of Adrien Brody's will surely enjoy the film and its message which I thought to be escape. Even though the experiments were so intrusive and painful for Stark, he didn't want them to stop. He used the experiments as an escape. Maybe he wanted to help people; or maybe he just wanted to leave his own reality behind for a little while. Whatever the reason, Stark was anxious to escape. Unfortunately for the audience, poor casting and a convoluted film, made me want to escape while watching it. It's safe to say, I won't be visiting this film again, if I can help it, in this dimension or another.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start, yes, The Jacket shouldn't be really close to any consideration as a horror film but that is contrary to the internet movie database's classification. Receiving a horror label presents the opportunity for discussion since the film leaves a lasting impression on the viewers on so many levels. Without giving too much of anything away, the film can be summed up as dark, romantic thriller with a strong tale based on time-travel and redemption. Filmmaking was impeccably constructed, bestowing a cold and somber atmosphere with great casting calls consisting of Adrien Brody and Keira Knightley as the main leads. The Jacket is a tremendous psychological piece that won't scare or shock but is highly imaginative and emotional.</fullReview>

Sets a strangely good mood, maybe even if the subject is not as bright as it looks. Yes, it has some obvious plot holes, but like with most of the movies similar to this one, you simply have to believe everything that happens and go with the flow to enjoy it.The acting is top notch, Adrian Brody and Keira Knightley have outstanding performances here, really adding to the flow of this movie.

		<fullReview>Not Surprisingly, This Psychological/Time Travel/Life Affirming/Sci-Fi/Horror Show Did Not Do Well at the Box-Office and was Tepidly Reviewed by Critics. Derivative as it May Be, it Presents its Dense, Complex, Story in a Flashy Style with Some Very Good Performances. Besides Adrien Brody Who is Superb, and Keira Knightley Who Struggles Just a Bit, there is Kris Kristofferson Playing a Crusty and Unethical Doctor, Jennifer Jason Leigh as His Counterpart with Scruples, there is a Riveting Daniel Craig as an Inmate in a Small but Compelling Role.The Film is Obviously too Much to Take In for the Mainstream and it's One of Those that is Disjointed by Design and May be Ambiguous to a Fault (especially the ending), but it is a Thriller that Keeps You On Your Toes. It Does So with Enough Artistry and Thoughtfulness to Make it One of Those That is Underrated for its Type. It is Haunting, Terrifying, and Disturbing, but Also Touching and Philosophical in Ways that Some of its Contemporaries Are Not. The Ensemble Working This Film Do Everything They Can to Make it a Palatable Picture for Everyone, but it is Just Too Heavy and Demands Thinking and Contemplation. Something Most in the Audience Might Consider Taxing and Exhausting.Recommended for Others that are Willing and Able to Strap-In and be Taken for a Ride, Fully Aware that the Destination is Anything but Predetermined. It's Just Too Good a Film to be Ignored and Can Most Likely be Appreciated by Discerning Audiences. The Film, Once Again, is Not For Everyone but Worth a Watch to See If It's For You Because of the Professionalism Involved and Because it is Wrapped in a Stunning and Sensitive Package.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) barely survives his injuries from the 91 Gulf War and suffers from memory problems. A year later, he's drifting through Vermont where he encounters a drunken Jean Price (Kelly Lynch) and her sweet daughter Jackie (Laura Marano). He gets picked up by a Stranger (Brad Renfro) and they get stopped by a cop. The cop ends up dead and Jack is found not guilty by reason of insanity. In the asylum, Dr. Thomas Becker (Kris Kristofferson) puts him in a straitjacket and a morgue drawer where he starts to have visions. Fellow patient Rudy Mackenzie (Daniel Craig) tried to kill his wife. While placed in the jacket, he finds himself in the future talking to a grown up drunken Jackie Price (Keira Knightley). She tells him that Jack Starks is dead found on New Year's Day 1993. Only Dr. Lorenson (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is willing to help.This is an interesting idea but the movie is done without much tension. This could be a dark horror but director John Maybury doesn't have the sensibilities. It's a slow moving movie without many thrills. It struggles for any excitement. The idea is there but the movie lacks too much. This movie may as well put the audience in a straitjacket and put them in a drawer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chilling, atmospheric gem of a thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Jacket is an extremely underrated thriller that went mostly overlooked, or was met with lukewarm reviews back in 2005. It's ripe for a revisit, and deserves many. It's moody, disconnected (in the best possible way), sketchy and cold, but at the same time injected with a vital emotional pulse, carried by the ensemble cast's wonderful work, as well as the poignant, exciting screenplay. Adrien Brody magnificently underplays that role of Jack Starks, a psychologically damaged gulf war vet thrown headlong into a web of confusion, violence and time travel following a mysterious incident he has no memory of. The spine chilling, scintillating story takes its time unfolding, with each new reality bending revelation more exciting than the last, and some truly memorable and unique touches that really make it a special film, Jennifer Jason Leigh is outstanding in a supporting role, as is a young Daniel Craig, before he got self conscious and started limiting himself in disappointing roles. The filmmakers give the proceedings a bleak yet hopeful, eerie and downbeat yet oddly exciting, quaint aura, and it's a film that sticks in your memory and your dreams. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Jacket (2005): Dir: John Maybury / Cast: Adrien Brody, Keira Knightley, Kris Kristofferson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Kelly Lynch: Riveting thriller about confinement in both mind and body. Adrien Brody plays a war veteran who is picked up by a cop killer and framed for murder. He is locked in a straight jacket and tortured by images that could foretell the truth. Clever and surprising but the time line makes no logical sense. There is also no plot solution regarding the real cop killer. Directed by John Maybury with an agonizing sense of torture by Brody who is locked in a morgue slab and haunted by images that could reveal the truth. Keira Knightley plays a mysterious woman seen in flashbacks. She is a key to his past and also to his future. Kris Kristofferson plays a sadistic doctor running an experiment where Brody becomes the subject. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays a doctor caring for a sick child. She becomes interested in Brody's case and aims to help him when she realizes that he is innocent. Kelly Lynch appears as the alcoholic mother of a young girl by their truck, which has broken down. This also factors into the Brody's mental state. Well produced thriller with great use of lighting particularly during morgue scene where Brody revisits his fears. Although it doesn't always gel together effectively it does present a strong theme regarding piecing together our sanity. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Jacob's Ladder type of film. Where Jacob's Ladder was a more comprehensive and detailed film. This is a shorter version I guess. Jack Starks probably dies when the small kid shoots him, but before dying or while dying he sees a dream where he visualizes everything that we see in the film. Of course this is my take on the film.We can also say that Ryan Gosling starer "Stay" was also same kind of a film. This is kind of a film that leaves viewers with multiple options regarding how/what the film is. Adrien Brody was good as usual. he's a perfect cast in such kinds of intense films. he seems very natural doing such films. The story of the film is Adrien Brody (Jack Starks)is shown in Iraq war (1991) he gets shot and considered dead. But later on he's seen alive by the crew.Later on the story unfolds and Jack is suspected of a murder, tried and sent to a mental institution. Where he becomes the object of doctors' experiments. He's enclosed in a morgue drawer braced with a jacket. He dreams there and can see future events. If you liked Jacob's ladder,The Machinist, Stay etc. you'd like this film as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's directed by John Maybury and written by Massy Tadjedin, both are pretty unknown to me, somehow Netflix had suggested that to me so I saw a few rating and rented it out without any knowledge of the plot. I have to say, I'm glad I did it, because I really enjoyed it.The story is about a veteran from Persian Gulf War back in 1991, and some incidents happen to him that he ends up in a mental institution. The first act of the film can be painful for some to watch or even complex, but some (like myself) can get more curious about the story. There's a sci-fi side to the story, if you don't go a long with it, I don't think you would like the film; I somehow enjoy that part of the story. Regarding the performances, Adrien Brody does a fine job, in my opinion, he doesn't disappoint at all, however, Keira Knightley, I don't know why, I just don't like her acting style, this is the first time I see her doing an American accent and she does well here, but I sadly never can relate with her performance. On the other hand, Daniel Craig is totally different more than anything he's done, I wish he would have had more scenes because he does a fantastic job, in my opinion if he had more scenes, he could've been nominated for Oscars.Overall, I liked the movie and it was interesting there was supporting characters with Persian names, they didn't have major parts and affected my opinion towards the film. So check it out if you can, I give it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Jacket Fails To Adapt The Cleverness of Memento</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A troubled war veteran tries to unlock his memories of a terrible crime in this stylish thriller,The Jacket.It features Adrien Brody and Keira Knightley together with Kris Kristofferson,Jennifer Jason Leigh,Kelly Lynch,Brad Renfro and Daniel Craig.The movie is based on the Jack London novel titled The Star Rover, however, in the UK the book was published as The Jacket; and it is directed by John Marbury.In 1991, Jack Starks was an American soldier serving in the Persian Gulf when he was shot in the head. Pronounced dead by a field surgeon, Starks somehow returned to life, though with no small number of psychological problems to show for his troubles. A year later, Starks is walking through the snowy Vermont wilderness when he discovers a woman whose truck has broken down, Jean. Starks tries to help Jean and her young daughter, and later flags down a car for a ride into town; however, the car is being driven by a criminal on the run from the police and not long after the car is cornered by police, Starks' memory goes blank. When he comes to, Jack is accused of killing a patrolman in the violent standoff that followed, and is told that the woman, her daughter, and the criminal existed only in his imagination. Declared insane in his murder trial, Starks is sentenced to a mental institution run by Dr. Becker, who seems to believe that the more brutal the treatment, the better. As Starks suffers frequent beatings and long spells in a frozen locker, his mind drifts from his harrowing past into the future, where he visits with Jackie, who once was the young girl Starks tried to help.The film aspires to the cleverness of Memento and falls short of that target, but Brody gives this exercise in desperate disorientation a certain gravitas that keeps you watching as his tormenting visions begin to unravel.Added to that,it just bounces his character back and forth in time and yanks us around, and around, and around.The story begins begins as a potentially intriguing study of the depersonalizing effects of warfare, only to end up a pastiche of time-travel and psycho-ward movie clichs that is why it falls short to achieve its potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film definitely worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good and touchy drama about human lives with a mystery/thriller aspect involving (possible) time-travel, without turning it into either a science-fiction film, or an action one.The film starts with Jack, whom we see as a good and a kind man, a Gulf War veteran with severe consequences regarding his wartime head-wound. Dealing with his amnesia attacks, he is involved in a serious crime he has no memory of. During the course of the film, he possesses the opportunity to learn to know better both himself and people around him, urging him to try to make wrong things right.A warm recommendation to dedicate one evening, or weekend afternoon, to this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If the film content was as good as the film making it would get a higher score. Can't fault the film production or acting but the story is just too bleak and unpleasant to be enjoyable. And in the end quite pointless and meaningless. Of course a lot of films are pointless but the journey to the pointless conclusion is often enjoyable, has to be enjoyable to make it worth watching. Besides its not really SciFi. Nothing futuristic about it to merit the term. The best thing about the film is the camera work - very modern, spliced up, crisp. Even so it's not warm. Who wants to watch cold, bleak films? The action is also long winded and what's coming next is fairly obvious. The revelations about what is happening to him are also obvious. And of course there is one fundamental problem - how is he doing his time travelling. What's the cause of that? It can't just happen. As others have pointed out the holes in the plot are too big to make it an enjoyable experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An intriguing time travel drama with an unusual and rewarding storyline. There are shades of THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT here, as Adrien Brody's Gulf War veteran finds himself at the mercy of dodgy doctor Kris Kristofferson and undergoing some bizarre out-of-body experiences. THE JACKET neatly sidesteps clich for the majority of its running time, delivering a TWILIGHT ZONE-type story and effectively running it to feature length.Brody seems completely at home in his role as the film's protagonist and he soon gets us on side. Keira Knightley's cast against type as a damaged, boozy American and boy, is she good. Kristofferson's crusty doc is another ace up the film's sleeve, and watch out for a kooky Daniel Craig in an almost unrecognisable supporting role. This unusual film Is one that's difficult to pigeonhole, and it doesn't always make sense, but come the ambiguous ending I found the intricacies of the plot had paid off nicely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Jacket is directed by John Maybury and written by Massy Tadjedin. It stars Adrien Brody, Keira Knightley, Kris Kristofferson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Daniel Craig and Kelly Lynch. Music is by Brian Eno and cinematography by Peter Deming. Film is loosely based on a true story that would make up the novel of the same name written by Jack London in 1915 (known as The Star Rover in America). Jack Starks (Brody) is serving in the Gulf War when he suffers a bullet wound to the head. Making a recovery but suffering with amnesia, he returns to Vermont. But an incident out on the snowy road will see Jack accused of murder and placed in an asylum. Here he is pumped full of drugs by a well meaning doctor (Kristofferson) and after being fitted with a straight-jacket, he's then placed into mortuary body chamber to hopefully aid his mental welfare??. The Jacket is an odd film in many ways, most pertinent is that it is easy to pigeonhole in terms of genre familiarity, yet still have a freshness in how it goes about unravelling its time travelling mystery. There have been a number of dramatic-come-weird time travelling movies brought to the screen over the decades, some edgy and great, while others have been known to have some sci-fi purists spitting feathers. In more modern day cinema we have seen prior to The Jacket's release, 12 Monkeys, The Butterfly Effect, Donnie Darko and Jacobs Ladder, and post it there has been Dj? Vu and Source Code. While we can comfortably add Primer and Memento into this interesting group of films. The question is, is The Jacket worth the interest of the film fan after a bit of time travelling weirdness?Well it has some problems, main one being that in spite of it gnawing away at the grey matter, the plot is simple and telegraphs the finale some way before it arrives: sadly tying things up too neatly after blurring our perceptions of Jack Stark's current state of mind. In fact, calling it a conventional murder mystery wrapped around one mans possible time travelling psychosis isn't far off the mark. But it does have the power to unnerve, weaving a tale that pulses with paranoia, self doubt and that thick atmospheric air that begs the question on what is real and what isn't? Maybury and Deming give it a smart muted colour sheen, cleverly reinforcing emotional states of characters, and the cast, led by a smartly reigned in performance from Brody, all give good value for money. The journey undertaken by Jack marks this out as a must see for fans of similar filmed treatments, the final destination, sadly, not so. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good sci fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Initially I didn't know what to make of this film - it seemed very clichd - the traumatized war vet, the sadistic mental hospital doctors and staff, etc. I was able to "hang in there" initially despite the overall distastefulness of it all due to Adrien Brody's acting, and the fact that I kept noticing recognizable actors such as Kris Kristofferson and even Daniel Craig (in a role unlike any he is famous for). Then (SPOILER) when the science fiction factor kicked in and I realized Brody's character could (for whatever reason) time travel when subjected to the doctor's horrific treatments, and have a concrete impact on others' fate (i.e. it wasn't all just a delusion or nightmare) it became really interesting. This movie is preposterous for those who demand logic, realism and clear-cut explanations but as a sci fi film it is commendable, and I found that interest in the characters' fate grew as the film went along.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mind bending thriller that some how manages to get by without to many outrageous twists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not many thrillers in todays day and age can set a mood,and atmosphere set by this one. I also expected this psychological thriller to contain a fair amount of gimmicky twists, I was pleasantly surprised it did not.The plot is interesting: Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) is injured during war and has been diagnosed with being psychologically unstable, and sent to a mental hospital where he is experimented upon.One may now see why I thought many twists may have occurred during this movie.The cinematography was excellent ranging from warm lighting of a house, to a cold and solitary lighting of a mental institution. There also many claustrophobic shots that were done brilliantly displaying panic and fear. During these moments the camera flashes and does rapid cuts that only emphasize the frenetic emotions one can experience in darkness. The writing is good, and the fact it still manages to build tension without any particularly urgent issues is quite amazing (most of the tension comes from the acting). Some of the characters are quite weak and pointless, but for the most part are able to fit in with the story quite well. The acting is a mixed bag. I thought Adrien Broody did a spectacular performance almost on par with his staring role in "The Pianist". However I thought this may have been one of Kiera Knightly's weaker movies,she is able to emote her distress but compared to Broody's depiction of a possibly psychotic man it falls quite short. The rest of the characters are good, and while not spectacular, make the mental institution feel cold, desolate, and "professorial". "The Jacket" is a great movie worth a viewing. It is able to emulate a "Shutter Island"esq atmosphere and tension without the budget, and also manages to get by without any jump scares and limited twists.7.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ambitious thriller which flirts with fantasy, and delivers well enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Jacket is a movie that starts off with little or no heart and by the end it has a fair amount. It grows on you with each passing scene. It has a sort of muddled set up, but director John Maybury is able to clear a path of coherency part way through. The fantasy element of the plot is so well disguised that it takes us a while to recognize it. The Jacket finds a good balance between realist fantasy, and psychological thriller. If that sounds appealing, then this should be a good watch.During his tour in the gulf war, Jack Starks takes a bullet to the head. It doesn't kill him but he suffers some brain damage. One year later he is back in his home state of Vermont, but is arrested and accused of murdering a cop. Because he is unable to remember, he is not jailed but send to an asylum, where the doctors begin to run some very sadistic tests on him. Starks is put in a strait jacket, drugged and shoved in a dark locker, where his mind takes an epic journey, and somehow he is able to see fifteen years into the future. I'll give credit to the Jacket where credit is due. It is ambitious yet handled well enough to get a story through. It's a good idea with an equally good execution. That was enough for me.</fullReview>

After months of this treatment Jack begins to have flashbacks to events in his past and future.Jackie Price, (Keira Knightley) appears in Jack's life along with other nurses and friends who desperately want to help Jack tell them about things that happened in his life during 1993 and the Year 2007.Kris Kristofferson, (Dr. Thomas Becker) plays a great supporting role as the doctor who treats Jack and the close up's of Kris's eyes will give you the chills, almost like you are looking into a devil's eye.

		<fullReview>I just finished watching this movie and i have to say it is now one of my best impulse watches. If you love Donnie Darko as i do then you will just fall in love with this film. While not as complicated and with not as many ways of comprehending it as Donnie, it makes for an easier watch. That said if you want an easy-to-grip storyline this movie is not for you. But as i said at the start if you hang on then all is made crystal clear and it will leave you wanting so much more. This movie should definitely have more fans, especially with movies as awful as premonition getting a lot of watches. If you want a genre smashing thinker, with characters you will generally feel for, this is definitely for you!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Jack, the jacket"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the beginning this movie had a great potential to become an excellent surreal and/or supernatural film. The first time Jack (the main character, played by Adrien Brody) was locked in the morgue, I felt myself suffocated, because the scene is really intense. It's dark, soundless and you can almost feel how much terrifying and claustrophobic a situation like that should be? The memory flashbacks are also great. It all gives an intense, surreal and unusual beginning to the movie.Until then it just was being excellent, but then started the clichs, the morality, and the endless stories from the guy who's travelling to the future to change it in a better way? Why? Why had this film, great at its beginning, to become just one more "I've seen the future, and oh my God it's so terrible, that now I'm here to help you to change it" story?! Since the moment I realize this movie was about "Time Trips" and not just a "Post-Mortem" experience film, as I initially thought, it started to disappoint me? First because I'm tired of that kind of stories; second because the Post-mortem experience would certainly be a much better subject for a psychological and surreal thriller (and even more credible/close to the reality, I think!), that is what I suppose this film wanted to be? In spite of having a disappointing plot, I'll score this movie with 6 out of 10, because of some special-effects, the "good" claustrophobic scenes and the nice soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adrien Brody is a vet of the Gulf War. He was discharged after recovering from "dieing the first time" in a horrible incident that left him shot in the head. Starks roams restlessly about the country roads (a la Rambo in First Blood) when he runs across a woman and her daughter stranded with a broke down truck. While the alcoholic mother is busy blowing chunks he and the girl named Jackie fix the machine. Jackie takes an instant liking to Jack and asks Jack for his dog tags. Being a softy for kids he obliges and all go on their merry way. Continuing on his cross-country trek, Jack accepts a ride that starts him on the road to his own personal hell. Next we see him on trial for murdering a police officer. He has no recollection of anything that day except the mother and daughter. Due to his mental condition he is tossed in an asylum. Dr. Becker (Kris Kristofferson) subjects Starks to a radical and unnerving procedure where he pumps Starks full of psychotropic drugs wraps him in an old and musty strait-jacket and throws him in a morgue locker for hours. During these claustrophobic "sessions" Jack somehow goes from 1992 to 2007 and during his brief visits to the future where he learns of his death and needs to find out how to prevent it. While in the future he meets and falls in love with a now grown-up Jackie (Keira Knightley).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far from a classic, but a good rental...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That is, if you like somewhat artsy sci-fi films. I felt the acting was pretty much excellent from all involved, and the direction was slightly uneven but pretty much great. Cinematography was terrific, some real eye candy there. The main problem, IMO, involved the script. I've said quite a few times in my IMDb reviews that Hollywood has run out of ideas, and I believe this completely. Seeing the deleted scene in the extras with the protagonist in an ice bath really sealed this in my mind... straight out of Jacob's Ladder. Basically, this film is an amalgam of several others... One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Jacob's Ladder, 12 Monkeys, etc. Many other reviewers have noticed this as well.Overall, a very watchable film that will never become a classic like Jacob's Ladder or 12 Monkeys, but is certainly worth a Saturday rental or something. You'll likely forget it soon afterward. The ending rather let me down (too pat, little emotion, lacking in cleverness and originality) but after seeing some of the deleted endings I'm very glad they went with the one they did. Most were a direct imitation of Jacob's Ladder, I mean literal ripoff. I feel the director did made some good choices in not directly ripping off the films I've mentioned, while more subtly and appropriately borrowingfrom them, just as a screenplay with very few original ideas could be expected to do. 7/10 (maybe 6/10, can't decide).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I for one love this film. It is refreshing to see a story as original as this one. There really are no slow or boring parts that you find in many films. The story is one that is kind of mind boggling. It follows this story of a man, who upon returning from the war is accused of murdering a cop, of which he didn't do. When he is arrested instead of sending him to jail they send him to an insane asylum. In this place the doctor tries a new treatment on him. During this treatment he visits a ghost from both his past and the future. The cast could not have been a more perfect fit. Keira Knightly does an excellent job with the American accent. If you didn't already know that she was a British actor one would have no problem believing that she was an American. This is a story that I find very hard to sum up. So I would just have to say that it is fantastic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe that when people saw Jack in year 2007 they were not seeing really the physical guy, but their feelings of guilt, melancholy, love, etc... So, through my perception... The movie is not fantasy or sci-fi at all. This movie is as big as The Machinist or The Fight Club (both about dementia). I HIGHLY recommend this movie specially for people with Borderline mental troubles (as I do). It's one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. So get the File-Sharing software going, download the movie and then BUY IT!!! Support good films. Well, so, all I wanted to say is that if you want to give this movie a higher value, adopt my perception of it. It's not about traveling space and time, it's about feelings as in guilt.

		<fullReview>The Jacket is an original, if confusing, look at alternate realities. Adrian Brody is very good in the title role, while Keira Knightley proves not all Brits are hopeless at bunging on an American accent.Brody plays Jack Starks, a man haunted from his memories as a soldier in the Gulf War. On his return to Vermont in 1992, Starks hitches a ride on an icy road in Vermont. He soon blacks out and when he wakes up, Starks finds he is on trial for murder. He is remanded in custody and ordered to a mental institution. Under the care of Dr Becker (a mysterious Kris Kristofferson), Starks undergoes severe experimental treatment which renders him able to view the world in 2007.The flash forward sequences are addictive viewing as Starks tries to piece together his life and find out what happened on that fateful day in Vermont. Brody perfects the vague, empty look of a man whose life has been turned upside down. He keeps going from strength to strength following his awful performance in 'The Village'. Like I said, the perfect mid-week DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Had to see the film twice. The concept of time travel to a point that you realise your own real time is tragically short in 4 days and in that short spasm of time to 'reset' the lives of other unfortunates begs the question as what we would do with that certain knowledge. The film was provocative and intermingled with sharing life with another - once when Jackie was a child who had the sensitivity to keep the dog tags and to the young one he fell in love with in a future that was to be as short as his present existence in the asylum for a crime he did not commit. Shame they didn't identify the real perpetrator but that may have distanced us from the real theme!

The plot would have felt stuffed in two movies so they just leave many strings unattached and making the film filled with large plot holes. The director tries to make you forget this through frantic editing and wonderful visual effects. Not to mention some very good performances. The plot is basically about how we think we are completely sane while we could be completely insane. It is also about what goes on in our mind and how we can create stuff ourselves in our minds that we actually believe are real. It is a very profound plot and would make a great movie but this movie plays out like a simple thriller and really doesn't work. The performances as I mentioned earlier are excellent. Daniel Craig in particular is amazing but Adrien Brody and Keira Knightley are also very good. The Jacket really fails but being honest to myself I had a fairly fun time and the performances were good so I give it 2 and a half stars out of 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They Haunt Us!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I started watching this movie thinking that it would be your typical "guy sees further than us," but it's the movie that teaches us what we should already should have learned. The acting is very well done for the most part, but its the moments in between the dialogue that is most striking. It opens with a cryptic sequence where a Marine in the first Gulf War comes back after being pronounced dead, but he has already said that that was the "first" time he dies. After that scene, which is one of the most honest Gulf War sequences I've watched, the viewer is left wondering about his final demise - but that has little to do with the connection that this movie makes with its viewers. We all wonder what we are, what we should be, and what we might have become. "The Jacket" isn't about restraint, it's about discovery. Vonneut said "we're here to help each other through this thing, whatever it is" - and that's what this movie is about. In the case of Mr. Bordy's character, he embraces that sentiment. Searching for his own destiny, he becomes intertwined with the destiny of others, and must decide how he will use unintended associations. I think that this movie makes us all wonder the significance, not of our life, but of our days, our hours, and our minutes. I found the plot intriguing, but the hour after the credits rewarding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A kind of reversed Butterfly Effect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie about the things one chooses to do once he knows when, how and where he is going to die. Lightly science fiction, it reminded me of The Butterfly Effect, only this time the travel is in the future, when the past is already set.What bothered me was that all the things the main character did was to help others, not himself, when he clearly was able to influence the future. Somehow, it felt like a suicide rather than an altruistic gesture.But in the end it is a rather good movie, with actors playing well, an original storyline and a dark consistent atmosphere. A bit long for my taste, but worth a see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A suspenseful tale reminiscent of Hitchcock and so much more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As soon as I read the brief synopsis on the back of the DVD sleeve, I knew this was a film worth watching.From the get go, we see life through the eyes of Jack Starks (Adrien Brody), a Gulf War vet stricken with amnesia after being wounded in the Middle East. Starks is sent back to the US where he undergoes minimal medical treatment and is sent off into the sunset with an honorable discharge from the military. After arriving in Vermont, Jack experiences a series of events that later land him in jail for the murder of a highway patrolman. Convinced that Starks suffers from post Gulf War syndrome and amnesia spells, the court rules him to be criminally insane and thus sentences him to a state mental hospital.The dark and cynical fun really begins when Jack undergoes a series of illegal treatments administered by a seemingly unmerciful yet sanctimonious Dr. Becker. During these treatments, Jack finds a way to master a form of time travel in which he can go both backwards and forwards in time. The eerily beautiful quality of this film is that the "how" and "why" of Jack's time traveling abilities is not addressed, however, it is the choices that he is forced to make while grappling with this unfortunate gift that lie at the main focus. Another good thing to be appreciated is the great way in which all of the characters were interwoven to support a complex and intricate plot.The simplistic yet tragic portrayal of Starks by Brody lends much to the story. This movie is definitely worth the time and money.</fullReview>

It's a wonderful movie, light hearted, deep, in some ways, and definitely worth watching. Twice or three times over. OK, it's SCI-FI-ish, but let that be for what it is, and enjoy the theme, camera-work and above average acting.Something else: I think more people should live their lives with the last line in mind!

Hopefully there will be many more similar films released soon which deal with the spooky subject of time travel. The future James Bond, Daniel Craig, appears in this film but he doesn't quite crack the southern drawl, though his role as a nervous mental patient is very well acted.

		<shortDescription>Nice Supernatural Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine a sort of mix of "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest," "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," "Sixth Sense," and "D.O.A.;" toss it in with "The Time Machine," and you've about got "The Jacket." This is an entertaining bit of film making, a nice little ghost story which is a bit like those other films, but mostly an original piece of work. Despite the rather meandering seeming beginning, it tightens up like a knot about halfway through and keeps you guessing right up to the end.The camera work is unremarkable, and the film has a grainy, documentary-style texture to it that makes the atmosphere seem ambiguous at times. The Vermont-in-winter setting, however, with its unromantic and grubby environs, probably helps push what little character development we get into the foreground.This is a neat little movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting attempt but uneven script and direction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The jacket is an interesting attempt to combine several different genres together in one celluloid hit, but unfortunately due to this it fails to hit the mark. You are left wondering if any of it happened at all or if jack really did die at the films beginning, as for the nasty hospital staff has this not already been dealt with to much better effect in 'one flew over the cuckoo's nest'? There are massive holes in the plot that are never explained such as the transformation Jackie has between her first and second scene, she goes from being horrified and angry with this stranger who claims to be from the past to being his'Watson' and then lover in what i can only assume is a few hours in the space of 3 days. however if you don't analyse it too much it is an enjoyable movie, Adrian Broady is good if a little over the top, however it is in the supporting cast that the casting shines, the likes of Daniel Craig, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Kris Kristofferson are as always fantastic to watch and utterly believable, the most surprising thing of all though is Keira Knightly who although not fantastic gives a solid performance as the love interest/alcoholic mess up, she is captivating in her first intensely dramatic role and shows bright promise for the future. Unfortunately the direction is the biggest misfire, scenes grate on each other and the 'sex scene' utterly unnecessary for the story. In all an interesting concept but weakly put together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Jacket was a good film that was above average yet still had some problems in its plot. The characters were built up pretty well, especially protagonist Brody and antagonist Dr. Thomas Becker (Kristofferson). However there were some parts of the plot that were a bit unclear and unrealistic. It was written a bit differently by Massy Tadjedin, whose screenplay was at best average, Maybury's directed was also decent, but the acting is what carried this movie. Brody, Knightley, Kristofferson and Jennifer Jason leigh all gave good performances, although Brody overacted a bit and wasn't as convincing as in Polanski's The Pianist. The best performance of the film came from Daniel Craig, who was awesome, continues his great work as seen in Matthew Vaughn's Layer cake. The film is good, but had some flaws in the writing. 8/10 #279 on my list of all-time favorite films</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the film seemed to me more promising than it really was, there is one moment that caught my attention. Have you ever read Jack London's novel "Star rover"? It is a story about a guy in detention who is wrapped in a jacket. When he loses consciousness because of the pain, he travels in the past and lives his former lives once again. I know it is not quite it, since the "mind travel" here happens in the opposite direction and the story is by far not as wide, but still...The plot of the film is interesting, especially the maker's ability to keep attention almost without any blockbuster effect. There is some shooting and a few documentary flashbacks from the Gulf war, but that's it. Later on, the story becomes obvious, but if you like unconventional ways of narrating. This movie is exactly for you.</fullReview>

I say "surprisingly" because my girlfriend pulled it off the shelf at Blockbuster without knowing anything about it. When we got home, I pulled up the IMDb.com rating and uh oh, it was a 6.2. I was prepared for a loser movie, but since I had picked the last movie and it was really a loser, I had to be willing to watch anything she picked without complaint.When a movie gets a low rating here, and it turns out much better, I feel obligated to enter my own rating. No need for another synopsis here, but I will say that this work is a harmonious confluence of elements -- casting, acting, the "look" and the sound of the movie. A bit like Memento and Butterfly Effect in tone, but with much heart and feeling for people. Although the story is based on a structural "gadget", it was my sympathy for the characters and their situation that drew me in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie at first seems to be in the vain of The Butterfly Effect with reality switching from the past to the future. The Jacket is a better movie than The Butterfly Effect because The Butterfly Effect contained unpleasant characters and events. This movie stars Adiran Brody as a Gulf War veteran framed for a murder he didn't commit. He is sent to an insane asylum where he is experimented on by an unscrupulous doctor played by Kris Kristofferson. During one of the experiments where he is a morgue slab, he is transported forward in time where he finds out he has been dead for almost 15 years. How did this happen and can he change it? Unfortunately, the answers to these questions are a little too easy for this complex type of movie. Still the performances by Brody, Kristofferson, Keira Knightly, and Jennifer Jason Leigh make this film watchable. The film make not make much sense in the end but it is better than most repetitive remakes and sequels that have been out lately. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read some of the other reviews, and I think the problem with a lot of the people who haven't really enjoyed the movie as fully as they should have is because they're constantly comparing and contrasting it to elements that they've come across in other films. Others seem to have issues with characters and portrayals and/or accepting the film for what it was and generally just being guilty of over analysing the film to the point of going over it with a fine tooth comb.Personally, I enjoyed the journey the film took me through and actually connected and felt for the lead character. The unjust. His perseverance through turmoil - what a brave person. The heart of the movie was in the right place. Ethically/Morally it ticked the boxes. I guess the end is open to interpretation or the decisions the lead takes - and or/what we personally might have done.The thing about this film is, we don't go into the past - only the future. So the question is, what can/should I change now to influence that future? All that aside, watch the film with an open mind, accept it for what it offers and what it is. I loved Adrien, he suits the role perfectly. Keira was sweet. Kris Kristofferson did a great job too.I watched this film and felt moved at the end with a small tear in the eye.Nice film - for me anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Jacket</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure if I heard about this film or not, but when I read the interesting description and saw it had a good number of well known actors in the cast I was keen to give it a chance. Basically Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) is the wounded Gulf war soldier returning home to Vermont after a year presumed dead, but he is suffering amnesia after a shot in the head. After we see him helping out drunken Jean Price (Kelly Lynch) and her daughter Jackie (Laura Marano) while hitchhiking, he gets picked up by a Stranger (Brad Renfro), but the driver is stopped by a policeman who he kills. Jack is arrested and sentenced wrongfully for the murder crime, but with his condition they cannot imprison him, and instead see him as doing the crime because of his mental status. Therefore he is placed in the mental institution for insane criminals, Alpine Grove, which means him having to wear a straight jacket most of the time, and be locked away in the basement morgue body drawer. Jack is under the watch of Dr. Thomas Becker (Blade's Kris Kristofferson) carrying out this experiment, as well as the attention from Dr. Beth Lorenson (Jennifer Jason Leigh), and while there he mingles with fellow inmates, including Rudy Mackenzie (Daniel Craig). But during the course of his treatment Jack finds he has the ability to travel backwards and forward in time, so in his past he sees his life during war and before becoming unstable, and he sees what could be his future. In this future he finds a grown up Jackie Price (Keira Knightley) and they fall in love with each other, but he also foresees that he is presumably going to die in four days, but he doesn't know how. So begins a personal journey for Jack to intervene in his present and future, possibly with the use of his jacket, in order to change the course of time yet to come, whether this happens in the real world is another matter. Also starring Steven Mackintosh as Dr. Hopkins, Brendan Coyle as Damon and Mackenzie Phillips as Nurse Harding. Brody may have a very odd career of good and bad films, good being The Pianist, bad being The Village, but here he is alright, and so are the beautiful Knightley, the reliable Kristofferson and an unexpectedly weird Craig. The story may have been the tiniest bit confusing in places, but it has to be because of the mentality premise, and it is a quite fascinating and quite gripping psychological thriller. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" The First Time I died, I was twenty seven years old "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you first see this movie, please note the title " The Jacket. " The reason for that is, once you've seen it, other similar movies will come to the fore. For instance, The Buttelfly Effect. Still, this film, directed by John Maybury, is a new rendition of that haunting genre. The movie written by Tom Bleecker, has a number of reasons why it will snare your attention. First off, leading a great cast is Adrien Broody who plays Ex-Gulf War soldier Jack Starks, who unfortunately is shot during his tour of duty. Like so many surviving soldiers, he finds that although he returns home, not all of him remembers what followed. To piece the fragments of his memory back, he finds himself in an asylum where the treatment or cure is seen as being worse than his fragmented flash-backs. His attending physician, is Dr. Tom Becker (Kris Kristofferson) who tries his best to understand the damage patients, is haunted by their untimely deaths. For the appreciative audience, there are added treats within the film like having Daniel Craig (James Bond) play Rudy Mackenzie and Brad Renfro as the stranger. In addition there is Keira Knightley, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Kelly Lynch who become life lines for the returning soldier. The movie is well received, the story is memorable and the contents will certainly spur this movie into the realm of Classic. Recommend to any Ghost Story lover. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film centers on a wounded Gulf war veteran who returns to his native Vermont suffering from bouts of amnesia. He is hitching and gets picked up by a stranger, things go pear shaped when a cop pulls them over and is murdered by the stranger. The vet. is wrongly accused of killing the cop and lands up in an asylum. A quack doctor prescribes a course of experimental therapy, restraining him in a heavy duty straight jacket-like device, and locks him away in a body drawer of the basement morgue. During course of his treatment he gets flashbacks and visions of his future, where he can foresee he is to die in four days time. The catch is he doesn't know how. Thus commences the classic race against time.This is one weird movie. Of course, all time travel films are weird and sophisticated. I like time travel movies, although not all, for a reason: It makes you think. You know, your head messes up when you think of loops and pasts, presents, and futures. They give you a great brain workout after you've finished these time travel films.Although some aren't as complicated as others, they are still really good films. If you haven't noticed, this was a really good time travel film. It has a way to end one clich in time travel films, which I applaud them for. And yes, this film is pretty sophisticated and really weird. Time travel films like this also makes you frustrated because there are so many paradoxes.Another thing that is weird are the performances by Adrian Brody and Kiera Knightley. This is one of Adrian Brody's best performance so far. Kiera Knightley's performance was also really good and it's my first film that she doesn't speak in an English accent. It's weird for you to get used to her talking in another accent.This film is dark, twisted, and disturbing. It messes with your head, like it does with the main character's and it is done is a weird wacky way. The cinematography was also really twisted, with flashes of pictures and lights popping out with the editing.If you're a fan of time travel films, this will satisfy you. If you're looking a film where you don't have to think, then stay away from this because there are some pretty sophisticated things going on around here. With great performances, a well written script, and beautifully shot, this is one time travel movie you don't want to miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Stark (Adrien Brody) is a war veteran and on a journey to his hometown when he's been accused killed a police officer. Due his condition, the court decides to send him over an asylum rather than a prison. In the asylum, he must wear a strap and put in a body drawer, courtesy the program of Dr. Thomas Becker (Kris Kristofferson). Suddenly the scene jump into a view years later and he meet with Jackie (Kierra Nightley), the girl he ever helped before. The surprise is it happened in 1992 and when Jackie is only a little girl. From her he find that he already dead in 1993. So, what is really happened to Jack and how come he enduring this unpleasant situation?Considering the plot, The Jacket is more a fine psychological thriller with a macabre revelation in a good sense. But sadly, it doesn't have a better attention than it should be. I must blame the promotional team of this movie when they decide to promote it as another brainless horror movie when it don't even close as one. Yes, it has thrills, suspense and mystery but it's actually really a dark and moody drama with some bleak or intense moments. Whether it's good or bad is depend on different perspective of different people. The plot is quite simple actually, but John Maybury, the director, chooses not to do so in the execution. At first, I thought it going to be a puzzle-like plot, but I was wrong where it just run in a parallel pattern. The jump scenes are easy to follow so we can grips to the narration. In the acting department, every cast plays their role decently. Adrien Brody is quite repetitive from his latest role but Kierra Nightley who's shining through. I never really thought that she could manage a good American accent. The only minor problem here are some characters appears just as device for the plot not because they wholly integrated to the plot. So, whenever the script needs them, they appear. The plot is also fall in many implausible scenes. Nevertheless, The Jacket actually fairly good to delivers it purpose. Just don't expect it as a horror movie, because it will ruin your expectation and than this movie will goes flat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movies like Hitch, War of the Worlds (new one), and Flight Plan just absolutely annoy me. They are big budget and have a typical plot. Than your movies like Stay, The Machinist, and THE JACKET which all have the budget of maybe Tom Cruise's salary are movies worth watching.The movie stars Adrien Brody and Keira Knieghtly and was quite bizarre. Adrien Brody's character, Jack Starks, dies in the first scene but he wishes that was it. He forms a bond with Kneighlty's character, when she was a little girl, and than sees the same little girl grown up with the sad life her mom has. Jack Starks finds later in the movie that his job is to save the little girl's life. That is one of the plots in the movie and it is quite original.Not all huge budget movies are bad. Such movies like . . .ok I can't think of one at this moment but it might come to me later on. The best part of the film to me was when Jack Starks tries to explain his life with narration. The editing on top of it was a perfect B-role and really helped paint a picture of how it would be in that situation. OK, so it's impossible to relate at the highest degree.Overall I would definitely watch this picture again. Very good phsycological thriller that gives hope for more of the independent film industry than what we have now.I give the directing a 9, acting a 9, storyline a 9, message a 8, and editing a 9. This film was one of my favorite of the year.</fullReview>

Jack Stark, Adrien Brody, gets shot in the head by a young Iraqi boy, that he tied to befriend, and is pronounced dead. It's then that his body is brought to a on-sight military morgue to be identified and shipped back home for burial. At the morgue Brody suddenly comes to life and within days is almost as healthy as he was before he was shot. It's now a year later, 1992, and Brody is hitch-hiking his way through the state of Vermont and comes across a mother Jean Price, Kelly Lynch, and her ten year old daughter Jackie ,Laura Marano/Keira Knightley. The two unknowingly to Jack at the time are to play a major role in Jack's life over the next year or so and even after his death some 15 years into the future.Fixing the Price's car and giving Jackie his Army dog-tags as a gift Jack later get's picked up hitch-hiking by, unknown to him, a fugitive (Brad Renfro) from the law. It's later when Renfro is stopped by highway patrolman Officer Harrison, Jason Lewis, he pulls out a gun and shoots him dead. Jack who was caught in the crossfire is knocked unconscious and the killer plants the murder weapon on the out cold innocent man. Then takes off in his car leaving him in the snow, together with the murdered officer Harrison, to be found by the police.With no witnesses, and being the only one on the scene with the murder weapon, Jack is arrested and put on trial for the murder of Officer Harrison. Because of his Army experience in Kuwait Jack is found innocent by reason of insanity and sent to the Alpine Grove Mental Institution for the criminally insane until he's deemed to be cured and ready to be able to resume his roll as a normal member of society.It's at Alpine where Jack is put under the most extreme anti-psychotic medication and intense shock therapy imaginable by the man in charge Dr.Thomas Becker, Kris Kristofferson. During this therapy Jack is somehow able to transcend the world of 1992 to the future of 2007. In 2007 he can see what not only happened to him but to those that he knew at the hospital as well as Mrs. Price and her daughter Jackie! I's Jackie that he meets in the future and convinces her that he's really the man who fixed her mom's car and in the end ends up, by changing the course of future events, saves her mothers life.It was when Jack was doped up and put into a vault, strapped into a straight-jacket, for hours at a time that his mind left his body and took him ahead in time into the year 2007. Terrified at first to be put into the vault Jack later looked forward to it knowing that he's going into some kind of time machine. Jack also knows, from what the grown-up Jackie told him, that he doesn't have that much long to live; dying within a week on New Years Day 1993.Not believed at first in both the present and future Jack convinces both Jackie in 2007 and Alpine Grove psychiatrist and friend Dr. Beth Lorenson, Jennifer Jason Leigh,in 1992 that what he's telling them is true.In the end not only does Jack makes peace with himself but makes believers of everyone he told, including the very skeptical Dr. Becker, about his time travel experiences.Jack in fact not only meets Jackie but also both Dr. Lorenson and Dr. Becker who mistake him for a son or uncle. Not realizing that Jack was the same Jack Stark that was confined in the institution that they were working at back some 15 years ago.Somewhat unorthodox time-travel movie but still very thought-provoking about how time is not the study flow of events that were used to in this form, or dimension, of existences but is like a book video tape or DVD that you can turn the pages, back and forth, fast forward or rewind. In the case of Jack Stark he can change the story-line to give the persons he's involved with in the future,or even past, a much better life. If not in the world that he's part of but in some kind of undiscovered, as of yet by modern science, mirror or parallel universe where we, or our doubles, exist without our knowing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going into the future without the invention of time traveling can happen. In "The Jacket", Jack Starks(Adrien Brody) is a Gulf War veteran who goes to the year 2007 after his "death" from head trauma. Being put in a straight jacket are supposed to restrain the patients form doing harm to anyone including yourself. However, the place he went to after having no memory of a cop-killing incident goes through the experience and gets more details to prevent other tragedies from happening. After giving the dog-tags to a young girl named Jackie Price(Keira Knightley, "Bend it Like Beckham") who lost her mother in the future had to go along with what Jack has to say. Uncovering the truth is a lot at stake, knowing who to trust was a major factor as well. Going back in the present was all it takes to make things right really was the key and most of all, Jack had to fulfill his destiny as well so he can find peace for himself. If you have seen "Altered States", this movie is a must, and it's highly recommendable to anyone who have had this experience. Rating 4.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Unique</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Jacket is an extraordinary 'out-of-the-box' movie. The storyline is one that came quite unexpected. What began as a scary movie transformed into an unusual tale of reality. Adrien Brody and Keira Knightley, along with the other actors and actresses, formed an incredible cast. The acting was extremely believable and had me hypnotized to the very end. I rated this movie a 9 based on the fact that it is such an unusual story and very different from the re-makes of TV shows, boring sequels, and hatch-em-up and torture 'em horror movies. It would have gained a rating of 10 if they had chosen one of the alternate endings, in my opinion. Not necessarily a must-own, but definitely a must-see. Be sure to watch the special features that explain "The Jacket" in greater detail, and especially the alternate endings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found the Jacket to be a Pyschlogical Thriller like none I have ever seen. I was riveted to the screen as Jack Starks goes through the horrors/delights of his horrendous treatment. All of the actors, both British and American were great. Adrien Brody re-establishes what a terrific actor he is! He kept me enthralled by the way he played Jack Starks. Incredible portrayal of the man in out-there land!!. What an unusual role for Kiera Knightley as the American...nice lack of her usual thick accent! She is a very intelligent Actress who, obviously by this measure, can play a wide variety of roles in Film!! Very unusual film, but to be expected from the British Film Maker, Peter Gruber, and his team. What terrific and mind blowing special effects!! Highly recommended!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange, but good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was expecting a movie that was a little strange, and I got what I'd anticipated. A film that might leave you wondering what happened, by the end of it, and perhaps even during it, 'The Jacket' is anything but dull or boring. Jack Starks (Brody), an American soldier in Iraq in 1991, takes a blow to the head, leaving him with a memory loss. After he returns home, while hitching rides on a deserted road, he comes across a small girl with her drunken mother, whose car has died. He helps them out, and gives the little girl his dog tags. Hours later, after leaving them, and continuing on his path, another car comes along and offers to give him a ride. While talking, the driver is pulled over by a police officer, and the man who was driving shoots the cop. The cop, aims for the driver but misses and shoots Jack, leaving him unconscience. The driver takes off, and sets the crime scene up, making it look like Starks has committed the murder. After a trial, Jack is committed to an institution, for the crimanly insane. While in the institution, they pump him with drugs, and put him in a stray jacket, which covers his entire body, and then put him in a morgue drawer for hours at a time. What later results from this, is Jack's ability to see ahead into the future, and solve mysteries in present day. An all-star cast, including; Jennifer Jason Leigh, Kiera Knightly, and Kelly Lynch, but still making you forget, that the film is not reality.It was strange, a little creepy at times, bizarre, and somewhat disturbing, but a great watch! Definitely not for everyone, it's an acquired taste in film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't let the story line scare you away.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not just one of many movies, but perhaps the best to make a logical inconsistency slip through the cracks. "Jacket" refuses to make the expected analytical links that clumsily try to make sense of time travel, and lets the viewer roll with the punch. You can let yourself be jarred every once in a while by the cosmological questions that must of necessity come to mind. But its easy to let yourself return to a genuine sense of caring about the characters, who are consistently crafted by fine talent. For the most part, the cast seems to be doing what it does best. The overcritical eye can cut this picture to pieces. But even an intelligent viewer can nod his head with approval as the credits begin to roll. The picture ends at the right point, in the right way. Or at least, in a way that works. Just stop asking yourself why and how it works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>intense acting, rather good psycho-drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Jacket' is a combination of time travel and psycho-drama, with echos from several other memorable movies of the last few years like 'Memento' or 'Eternal Sunshine...' but without really getting to the heights of any of those.The story is the weakest part of the film. A veteran in the fist Gul war, Adrien Brody's Jack Starks survives the war (or maybe not) to find himself in a semi-amnesiac state, accused of murder and interned in a mental treatment facility. Here he is submitted to a series of sadistic treatment in the hands of a maniac doctor, Kriss Kristofferson, and will die a second time (or maybe not), but not before acquiring the capacity to travel in time and fix some of the aspects in the lives of people around in the present and future reality.If all this sounds crazy, it looks much better on screen. The cinema skills of director John Maybury and the splendid acting of Brody succeed in bringing to the screen the disorientation, desperation and fragility of the character. Despite the cold setting of the winter landscape and the asylum, there is a feeling of warmness emanating from this film, especially in the scenes acted by Brody and Keira Knighley. Despite the lack of veracity of the story, we really end by caring for the characters. Not a bad thing for a horror movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that couldn't figure out what it wanted to be about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The biggest problem with this film is that it doesn't know what it wants to be about--so it gives up cohesiveness and tries to distract us with being overly weird. Some might say that the weirdness was part of the "style" of the film, but I say it was poor attempts at building tension and suspense into the film. Needless to say, it didn't take me too long to get tired of all freaky split-second montages accompanied by excruciatingly loud sound effects... maybe 20 minutes, tops. Then I got bored, wondering if there was any point to the movie--yeah, that bad. The frustrating thing is that all the elements are obviously present. All the elements, I mean, that are needed to create truly excellent films. They had great actors (Adrian Brody, Keira Knightly, and the rest are all excellent in their roles), the director and production team had a great sense of style that could've served the picture well, but no; we had to spend the entire first act of the film just getting around to finally being told what the film is about. *sigh* Essentially, I feel like there was too much WEIRD, when the film (at it's heart) wasn't about WEIRD. Well, that and that it just wasn't paced tightly and structured cohesively enough to get the audience from beginning to end entranced and entertained. Like I said, it's really a shame, because the core idea is excellent, and the cast and production team outstanding. It could've been a classic. My guess is that this is just another film were the people involved didn't set out with a clear vision of the film they wanted to make... because it seems like it wants to be a horror, but isn't convincing as a horror; it wants to be a psychological thriller, but just dabbles at it; and, it also wants to be a romance movie, but it's too busy stumbling over itself to do any justice to a romance (although it nearly succeeds).</fullReview>

There he is involved in a shooting were a cop is left dead. Not remembering what really happened, he is deemed criminally insane and sent to an asylum. There a doctor uses a highly controversial method to treat his patients. The patient is drugged, put in a straitjacket and then locked up in a box. During his treatment Jack has visions of both future and past. Or is he just insane? Comment: An intriguing story that gives the possibility for the audience to find out for themselves what is really happening. At one point I had four different theories that could explain what was really happening. However, you could just sit back and enjoy the ride as well I guess. Strong performances from the cast, most notably from Adrien Brody of course, as he was given most space and time. Time is an central aspect of the movie, as some kind of time travel is involved. Unfortunately, time travel is tricky business, and there are some inconsistencies in the story. Fortunately they are only minor and might as well be overlooked in the over all picture. Anyway, I enjoyed it very much.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting psychological thriller with several layers of story and drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Jacket (2005) was a very good movie that surprised me. I was expecting another cheesy drama masquerading as a horror film. Boy was I wrong. It turned out to be a fine thriller with layers of twists and intrigue. Adrien Brody continues to impress me as an underrated actor who still doesn't receive that much respect from the general public. But I have respecting his work ever since SON OF SAM and his career making role in THE PIANIST. Keira Knightly was perfect in the roles as a chronic drunk in training.Adrian Brody stars as a 1991 Persian Gulf War veteran. He received a fatal head wound in combat. But he somehow survives his mortal injury and receive's a medal. A couple of years later, he's wandering the back roads of America. One day he helps a mother and daughter with their broken down truck. He gives the girl his dog tags. Hours later he hitches a ride from a mysterious stranger. Miles down the road, they're pulled over by the police. The stranger pulls out his gun and pops a few caps into the stunned trooper. The shocked vet finds himself on the ground next to the dead cop with an empty pistol next to his person. In court he finds himself on murder charges. He's constantly grilled on the stand. But his answers are vague. He just doesn't remember. What really happened? Where does the story go from here? Who's responsible? Why can't he remember? The answers all lie within this movie! I don't want to spoil the movie for you. But take my advice and give this movie a look. If you want a taste for something different. An overlooked film that needs a second chance. It's real melodramatic and weepy in parts, but it's par for the course. I was surprised by how good this movie was. I hope you grab a copy and check it out. Adrien Brody is a star and people just don't know it and Keira Knightley's looking good!Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lack of stimuli</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts with the famous First Gulf War images which made war look like a video game. Soon we see real people running for their lives. Seconds later, the camera goes down to the battlefield and you enter the ugliness of war. As you watch the overhead shots without emotion caused by the lack of sound and sight, the lack of external stimuli is used again, as Jack, a veteran with Gulf War Syndrome and other illnesses, undergoes the experimental treatment of Dr. Becker and starts seeing in the future while locked up in a tiny cell in his jacket. The lack of stimuli is also worked upon in the movie by using remarkable little music (minimalist music of Brian Eno) and a limited color palette of grayish and bleak hospital colors.As Jack can take a look in his future, he tries to save his own life as he foresees his death in four days. (By the way, time travel, when possible, can only be a one-way ticket to the future, but let's just forget about that). Therefore he has to know the cause of his death in order to prevent it. The names of the characters Jack and Jackie already give away a lot about the ending.The Jacket is an interesting experiment in commercial film-making. The story is mundane, simple structured and told at an amazingly slow pace. The trick is then to keep the audience involved, and they do so here by the excellent camera-work and cinematography. I saw the name of Soderbergh as producer on the credits: He often uses the same strategy and some shots have the quality of his work, here combined with the beautiful cinematography by Peter Deming (Lost Highway, Mulholland Dr.).The time travel story is kept relatively simple here and they could have elaborated on that by including more flashbacks, dreams and keeping it all ambiguous; it just has an ending and story that is too neat and clean. And it has many similarities in style and content to The Machinist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Awkward Version of 12 Monkeys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was something grating about The Jacket, primarily in the dialogue and, particularly, the main character's frustrating manner of his speech. The content and flow of Adrien Brody's lines felt artificial or distinctively vague. It's almost as if he's in pain to avoid saying anything meaningful or real. While the movie has that art film feel to it, it never really comes off as crisp and sharp as 12 Monkey's perhaps the classic time travel movie. I never connected to the characters, especially the lack of interaction between past and future memories among the primary characters where Mr. Brody's intrusion into both the lives of these characters didn't seem to really dawn on any other characters in a natural, real way as if the scriptwriter just wrote something that supposedly would help the plot somehow but not the execution.Overall, the movie did make some sense, the morality tale tied up by the end. Yet even the ending was a bit too cute for the heavy tone of the movie. While the effort was good, the movie somewhat intriguing, it misses the mark. Six out of Ten Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1.What IF you knew when you were going to die? 2.What IF you could look ahead into the sordid lives of people you had only briefly encountered or known? 3.What IF- before you died- you were able to travel back and make profound impact on those lives? So is the dilemma of John Maybury's "The Jacket"; a sharp and intriguing look at time-travel and moral consciousness.I have never been a real fan of serious movies depicting any sort of time-travel, as I usually find the jumping around of scenes and plot to be more confusing than entertaining. However, "The Jacket" proves to be an intoxicating standout of the emerging genre.1991. Gulf war veteran Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) has had it pretty rough lately. While in Iraq, Sgt. Jack Starks experienced himself quite a dandy head injury. After being shipped back to the states with some sort of shock related head trauma, we come to find Jack wandering a snowy cold highway. He comes a cross a car, apparently broken down, with a mother and a young daughter seemingly stranded by the side of the road. Mommas not looking to good, and she hardly acknowledges Jacks presence. Jack does meet daughter Jackie, and offers to help fix the car while Jackie tends to Mommy, who's now puking in the bushes. After repairing the car and giving cute little Jackie his dog tags, Momma flies into an outburst and hurriedly drives away with daughter in tow.Jack is able to hitch a ride from another fellow, but that is the last thing he remembers before facing trial for the murder of a state trooper. Due to his head trauma and experience in the Gulf War, Jack is declared "insane" and sent to a state psychiatric hospital. There is he is subjected to an experimental process by Dr. Thomas Becker (Kris Kristofferson), who pumps him full of psyciatropic drugs, straps him in a full body straight jacket, and slides him in a morgue drawer for hours at a time. During these sessions, Jack is forced to live through a series of hallucinations, realities, and events- some of which have not taken place just quite yet.2007. As the audience, we get to see what happens years later, as Jack is reunited (coincidence?) with a now adult Jackie. Seems Jackie (a fantastic Keira Knightley) has become quite the shadow of her own mother. She's a chain smoking, boozing, angry and depressed young woman with the demons of her past haunting her each day. Through a series of encounters the two begin to grow fond of each other &amp; begin to unravel what exactly has happened to Jack between 1991 - 2007, which he has no recollection of -for the most part."The Jacket" is quite a compelling film. Brody and Knightley shine through the darkness that they are surrounded in. A nice subplot with Jennifer Jason Leigh as one of the institutions doctors helps the film come full circle."The Jacket" will leave you moved and satisfied by the time it wraps up. Sad but touching, the movie goes not exactly where you expect it to- but instead right where you hoped it would.Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having read tid-bits from the premise of the story, there are obviously some sci-fi tricks sprinkled in this movie that frankly don't make much sense, neither to me, nor to other more pointy realism-super-freaks.You can choose to have these big question marks ruin your enjoyment of this movie, or just dive in for the ride. I had chosen to pursue the latter course, and was not disappointed. The story is relatively solid, and most questions are in time answered, with a reasonable level of unpredictability. There are no dull, boring moments, although the story does take time to build up to its full entertainment value.I found that the cast really delivered, everyone was in character, which also contributed to my enjoyment of this whole affair. While I thought I'd be watching a semi-psychotic horror movie at first, it really developed into some sort of feel-good movie, at the end of the day. I am not sure I would have felt fully satisfied watching this at the theaters, but for a DVD rental, it was well-worth the money.Adrien Brody 8/10Keira Knightley 7/10Kris Kristofferson 7/10Jennifer Jason Leigh 7/10John Maybury 7/10</fullReview>

Perhaps the director just used the "time-travel" merely as a vehicle to state a fairly simple question. How different would our life be if, throughout it, we had opportunities to make different choices.? I mean, how many of us has thought I wonder where I'd be if...... so perhaps Jack lived one of the scenarios but is always thinking I wonder where I'd be if......I mean I've often thought, gee if I stayed married to my son's dad where would I be living? How many kids would I have? Would my mom be alive because maybe our relationship would have been different. You know what I mean? Perhaps in those moments before he really "dies" we are taken through the "what ifs" of Jack's life. Well, at least these kind of movies (like Butterfly Effect, etc.) serve their purpose - to get us all to think, right?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever seen a movie, and said to yourself, "Hey, I have seen this before"; even though, you've not seen that particular film. Well that's exactly the feeling that I had with this picture; however, the film I thought I was watching was The Butterfly Effect. Two very similar films, with different sets of circumstances; however, the very same end state.Adrien Brody stars as Jack Starks, a Gulf War veteran, who is shot and killed in the opening sequence of this film. Jack, however, recovers from this injury, but is left with limited memory recollection capability. The film jumps forward, and Jack is now walking on some abandon highway. After providing assistance to a mother and daughter whose truck had stalled along the roadway, Jack is picked up by a wayward drifter in a stolen vehicle. A police officer stops the car on a routine inspection, and the drifter shoots and kills the policeman. Jack is wounded, left for dead and convicted of the crime. Unable to remember all the details of the events preceding the crime, Jack's is found innocent by reason of mental defect and sentenced to a mental health facility for psychiatric evaluation.Jack is kept heavily medicated, while under observation. In this vegetative state, he is removed from his room and taken to the morgue in the basement of the psychiatric hospital. He is forced to undergo treatment, in which he's strapped into a straight jacket, injected with a serum, and stuffed into a cadaver drawer. While in the drawer, the hallucinogenic drug has a cascading effect on Jack's mind as mental images start flooding his head. Past, present and even future events start to formulate in his head. It's these future images which begin to perplex Jack. While under this psychotropic treatment, Jack is able to see his own future and impeding death. He is able to determine that his death will occur in the very near future, and he has only four days to prevent it from happening. As the film progresses it becomes of film of desperation as Jack races against time, must fight for his continued treatments, and hunt for clues to the cause of his looming death.As I said at the beginning of this review, the film seems very familiar. Though the circumstances surrounding Jack's treatment are nothing like the Ashton Kutcher film; the memory sequencing scenes do seem very similar nonetheless. Although I did enjoy this film, it's really does leave you feeling that you've seen it all before?. Anyways, the film is worth taking a chance on.http://farisreel.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a relatively mindless movie that takes a lot from recent films such as the aforementioned "The Butterfly Effect", but I think it is most indebted to the 1962 film "La Jete". Taken in a less grand context, of course -- saving one's life as opposed to humankind in general -- "The Jacket" still smacks of the same love-driven time travel themes. However, it fails to pull them off intelligently and sugarcoats everything that was darker in Chris Marker's film. As for said love story, the relationship that progresses between Jack and Jackie transitions far too abruptly and without any emotional development, leaving the viewer unfulfilled and craving the first scene Brody and Knightley shared together, which was rife with raw feeling. Nonetheless, "The Jacket" is an interesting film when taken in and of itself, and Adrien Brody does give a touching performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent film with some interesting ideas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An interesting concept with some very cool ideas that never really reaches its potential. Instead of exploring the implications of time traveling, the film sidetracks into a very rushed and hasty romance, one that never really makes sense. The scenes in the mental hospital add nothing new to the stock stereotype, and the ending is telegraphed a mile away. There are a few interesting ideas on time travel that are bandied about, but they ultimately go nowhere, and the military scenes at the beginning seem to serve no purpose for the rest of the movie. The story is flawed, but it's still interesting, the performances are great, and the visuals are kinda cool but nothing outstanding. An interesting concept turned into a decent film.The thing that bothered me most was the entire point of Knightley's character Jackie. At first I just thought she'd be a sign to Jack that he's time traveling, but then she ends up helping him and being the love interest? How'd that happen? There's a rather large leap from her throwing him out of her place to her going out of her way to help him. It felt like there was a scene missing. In fact, all the scenes in the future seemed to ignore continuity and logic altogether. It was a bit disjointed, even for a sci-fi movie.The ideas brought up by this movie on time travel have been discussed much better in other films and works of literature, so the film doesn't add much more to it. The movie's a decent watch, never causing you to lose interest, and the pace is perfect for this kind of film. It just doesn't seem to add up to anything special. It actually could have used a bunch more depth to it, to fill out the characters and inject some emotion and realism into the film. Still, it's an interesting movie, at the very least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Slack Mind-Bender</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Jacket is like a lost episode of The Outer Limits - one that should've stayed lost. It's almost impossible to imagine a film being more inept when it comes to the fundamentals of suspense. The director, John Maybury, is so in love with dreamy pacing punctuated by slam-cut-schlock-effects that he neglects to involve us in his drama, the tale of a Desert Storm vet (Adrien Brody) who's thrown in a mental home and subjected to experimental sensory-deprivation therapy that appears to transport him forward in time. The film's essential flaccidity is compounded by some of the more insufferable dialogue in recent memory, most of it uttered by one of Brody's asylum-mates, who appears bent on winning a role in the revival of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest that's going on in his brain. Brody himself is more-than-adequate to the task of capturing the protagonist's mental anguish, but the actor seems adrift amidst all the stock reality-bending and obligatory horror-movie imagery. The delectable young Ms. Keira Knightley fares somewhat less well than Brody; her performance as an angst-ridden waitress is too dependent on the sort of actor-tricks (rolling a glass against her lips, biting her lip, picking her teeth with her fingernails) that bad directors feed young actors who don't know what they're doing. The film is an astonishing waste of time right up to the end credits, which are a shameless rip-off of Stan Brakhage's avant-garde classic Mothlight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a perfect TIME traveling Movie with Great Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I almost never ever give a number 10 to a movie. The last time I did that was for "The Crow" with Brandon Lee.And I'm watching 3 movies a week the last 5 years.Adrien Brody is performing very good (outstanding) The movie is even very interesting in the beginning. You got the feeling that you wants more, and you will ! The further we move on the more interesting the film become.While seeing this movie I remembered "the butterfly effect". But that doesn't compare to this one at all.I must admit that I was a bit afraid that it would end in a disaster. It did not !The end is great.... Not an all American Dream end... no, just a perfect end with a great endsong too.Don't expect hot pursuits.... If you only love hot pursuits and breathtaking special effects. Than don't watch this movie.But if you want a good story about time and changing the future. Than this is your movie.Just sit down, relax and enjoy.I DID !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Damion Crowley's Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>7 of 10/70 of 100 I agree with many of the other reviews/comments posted here. The 'Jacket' is the kind of the movie that you can enjoy if you don't think about it too much. Unfortunately, many of the plot holes are doing the Lindy right in front of you, so disregarding them is no minor feat.Adrian Brody plays an Army vet who receives a head wound that takes him briefly to the realm of death. It seems that he is discharged about a year later (minor flaw 1), and becomes a bum. He bumps into a little girl and her drunken mother on the side of the road and repairs their broken-down vehicle. The mother fears he's a pedophile and chases him away. He then is picked up by an outlaw who gets him involved in a shoot-out. The outlaw then vanishes, leaving him the only suspect.He is admitted into an institution for the criminally insane, where he is experimented on by a doctor. The doctor uses a morgue drawer and a strait-jacket (thus the title of the movie). The set-up for this, while artistic, is more than a trifle unrealistic in the last decade of the twentieth century. While locked in the drawer, he discovers he can travel forward in time, where he meets the girl(now a young adult)and tries to rehabilitate her depressed life. Through-out this, the acting is fine, if a little uneven, and certainly takes large leaps of faith in the characters and plot plausibility. The conclusion is very confusing as the director seem to be torn between make a dark, original ending or the happy Hollywood ending, tried making both and ended up with something that was just odd. Nothing about this movie really requires the large screen, so waiting for this to come out on video won't dampen the experience. If you can catch it on matine or bargain theaters (if you are an ardent theater-viewer), that will more likely guarantee your money's worth. A flat seven on the ten-point scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Works well as a sort of grown up fantasy film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Jacket is a weird mix of genres, but it made me think of a more adult take on a children's fantasy story. The basic formula I'm talking about is where an unpopular kid who leads a boring life discovers that stepping into his bedroom closet transports him to a fantastic world where he can live an almost alternate life as a great knight fighting off dragons and wicked witches of the west.In the Jacket, you've got Jack Starks (Adrien Brody), a troubled ex-soldier who is locked up in a mental institution after being convicted for a crime he didn't commit. His existence in the mental institution is really bleak, but he finds that when he gets put in a straight-jacket and stuffed into a morgue-like drawer, he gets transported into the future where he's able to spend time with a beautiful young woman named Jackie (Keira Knightley). Naturally, there's more to this relationship than we are first led to believe.The relationship between Starks and Jackie is the heart of the movie and this aspect of the story worked really well for me. The chemistry between these two troubled characters was excellent. I was really drawn into this aspect of the story and was touched by what Starks did to help Jackie.There's also a psychological mystery aspect of the movie with the entire movie itself being a kind of giant puzzle. Jack and Jackie are trying to figure it out at the same time as the audience. The mystery of what's real and what's not is left open to interpretation. This aspect of the movie is slightly more muddled. I thought I had it figured out, but the very last line of the movie threw me. I suppose my main complaint is that it leads to an explanation that I'm not sure I'm happy with.Overall, I'd recommend the Jacket with the warning that it's definitely not for everyone. 7/10</fullReview>

Mature fans of science fiction, or anyone who has ever contemplated human mortality and spirituality will enjoy this film and appreciate its deeper meaning. This movie is NOT a thriller and should not have been marketed as such. It is a slow meditation on finite human existence in an infinite universe. "The Jacket" deserves its rightful place in the genre of beautiful transcendental/existential films such as "Jacob's Ladder", "12 Monkeys", "K-Pax", etc.... It's kind of like watching a version of "Session 9" with a smile on its face, if you understand what I mean.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Jack London connection?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's odd that not even the San Francisco Examiner's reviewer noticed the likely origin of some of the key story concepts for this film.Jack London, author of "The Call of the Wild," wrote a reincarnation novel published under the title "The Star Rover" in the U. S., and (!) "The Jacket" in England. In the novel, a convict at San Quentin is periodically subjected to torture in a compression device called "The Jacket." He learns to endure it by "willing himself to die." That is, he says that through an act of self-will he actually dies every time he is put in the jacket, and returns to life at the end of the session. During the times when he is dead he travels into the past and experiences incidents from his past lives.Jack London does not appear to be credited, but one has to wonder whether the names "Jack" and "Jackie" are intended as homage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loose Thread Don't Keep The Jacket From Working</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Jacket has more than one little plot whole to sew up and a few loose buttons here and there but, at the same time, it is a fascinating, thrilling and spectacular story about the human mind and what it can sustain.Adrien Brody plays Jack Starks, a wounded solider who has amnesia. He was shot in the head during Desert Strom and has now been shipped back to the US with nothing more than a pair of dog tags to tell him who he is. One day, heading down the high way and looking for a way to hitchhike to some reality, he meets a young girl named Jackie who is sitting with her mother because their car has broken down. Jackie's mom is too wasted to do much about the situation so Jack takes it upon himself to fix their car, which he does. He sends the mom on her way with a fixed car and to Jackie he gives the dog tags. As he trudges along, a rough, college dropout looking man picks him up. After a while the man asks Jack if he has ever been to jail and the question corresponds with a cop pulling them over to tell them they are driving too slowly.And essentially, that is all Jack knows.After being convicted of killing the cop he is sentenced not to prison but to a home for the mentally insane. Here we encounter the strange Doctor Becker (Kris Kristofferson) and his unusual and disturbing way of treating his patients. After tying them into straight jackets, he shoves them into morgue drawers. The first time we see this happening to Jack it appears like a version of human torture more than a treatment. But Dr. Becker tells us "You can't break something that is already broken".But once Jack becomes accustomed to the drawer and the jacket, he begins to see things. Sometimes he sees the past and sometimes the future. In the past he sees what happened that day he supposedly killed the cop and in the future, he meets Jackie (Kiera Knightley) again. He meets her Christmas Eve, having no idea who she is, but discovers the dog tags in her house. But when he confronts her about them, she becomes hysterical and tells him that Jack Starks is dead.The first half of this movie is like one long acid trip, with quick cutting camera angles and bursts of bright colors. The next half is more subdued and becomes less about the horror of Jack's situation, as he is now used to the drawer and even wants to be put back in so he can discover more about the future. Although the production design gives the feeling that the dead should be rising (just take a look at the poster art) the story has many softer notes to it such as therapy sessions Jack's secondary doctor, Dr. Lorenson (Jennifer Jason Leigh) has with her friend's mentally retarded son and the love story, although unnecessary, that develops between Brody and Knightley. Although there are maybe one too many times when you say to yourself "Now wait a sec, that could never happen," this is an excellent story about making a future with what you've got. ***1/2 out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had so much potential to be a great thriller, but it just fell flat. The acting by Knightly and Kristofferson was good and Brody was alright, but they just didn't click. There were a lot of holes in the story and there wasn't any moment in the movie that was scary. The love making scene was just silly-many people around me in the theater laughed- and many others in the theater were heard mumbling how bad it was. I saw both "The Butterfly Effect" and "Eternal Sunshine" and thought they were good-and I "understood" them just fine- but how in the world can you even compare this movie to those?? This was one of the most boring films I have seen in years. Do not waste your time with this film, if you need to see it,wait for the rental. 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good and Intriguing Rip-off of "Jacob's Ladder"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1991, in Iraq, the military Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) is shot in the head and presumed dead. When he blinks his eyes in the morgue, the doctor is called. One year later, after being discharged from the army, while hitchhiking in a road in Vermont having amnesia problem, he helps a drunken woman, Jean Price (Kelly Lynch), and her daughter, Jackie Price, fixing their car. Later, he gets a lift, but the driver is stopped by the police and kills the policeman with three shots. Jack is also shot in the head and incriminated by the real killer, who leaves his gun close to the fainted Jack. He goes to court and is sentenced to the mental institution Alpine Grove for insane criminals. Jack becomes the experiment of Dr. Thomas Becker (Kris Kristofferson), who drugs and dresses him with a jacket and locks him in a drawer for corpses in the morgue. While locked, Jack travels to 2007, where he meets a grown-up Jackie Price (Keira Knightley) and they fall in love for each other. Jack envisions that the only exit from the institution is though the jacket."The Jacket" is an intriguing movie, with a conclusion open to interpretations. Unfortunately, the idea is not original, and actually it is very similar to Adrien Lyne's "Jacob's Ladder". In the Extras of the DVD, there are three alternative ends, and I believe the director did not use any of them trying to avoid a total rip-off of "Jacob's Ladder". In spite of the plagiarized story, I liked this movie, mostly because of the excellent actor Adrien Brody and the gorgeous Keira Knightley, who has also a great performance and chemistry with the lead actor. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Camisa de Fora" ("Jacket")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brainless version of Jacob's Ladder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"This movie is very open to interpretation, and that's why I think people will love it." - Director's comment from DVD extras Right.For me, "The Jacket" is a very unsuccessful rendition of "Jacob's Ladder", with a big difference that the latter movie is brilliant and the former kinda sucky.If you haven't watched "Ladder" please stop reading this comment and go see it. It is such a good movie - it has almost the same premise as "Jacket", and it has a very logical and satisfying ending. It's not as *shudder* "Open to interpretation" as "Jacket" but rather ties up loose ends beautifully and truly rewards repeated watchings.Both "Ladder" and "Jacket" have similar protagonists, veterans living on borderline insanity as a result of some war trauma, and they even end on similar note (not to say any more on the subject to prevent spoilers). But to distance itself from "Ladder", "Jacket" doesn't make a lot of sense and is actually proud of that.While Jacob from "Ladder" saw demons and had disturbing hallucinations, Jack (Brody) time travels. Yes, I know. The thing is, Jack is in a psychiatric institution where a sadistic doctor straps him in the jacket and puts him in a morgue drawer. While in there, he time-travels to the future. And it's not that he just sees the future, he seems to be physically there, he interacts in people (in many ways, including having sex with a woman who is supposed to be a small girl he met in "true time").I must say after watching it (twice) I failed to see the director's point. With these kind of movies where you follow the point of view of a more or less mentally disturbed individual, the key is always to discern what was "real" and what was "in his/her mind". But in "Jacket" it's not so easy, and it seems not to be intentional but rather to be a direct result of sloppy screen writing/directing. It is one thing to have a goal in mind and then put layers over layers of ambiguity over it to allow room for interpretation, and totally the other not to have anything in mind but rather just slap mindlessly some ambiguous stuff together and then exclaim proudly "This is open for interpretation".I'm sure many people will discuss and dissect this movie here on IMDb forums, and it is kinda sad because it will be totally pointless. Don't get me wrong, I like talking about movies, analyzing different opinions and theories, but the movie in question has to be worthy of a discussion. "The Jacket", quite simply, is not. It's just a psychological thriller with high ambitions which only achieves the levels of average Hollywood timekiller flick.5/10, and this grade is open for interpretation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Darko's not looking over his shoulder for this one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could just about give this movie a vote of seven out of ten - just! This movie starts off on an interesting premise. The protagonist sustains a head injury in the Gulf War, returns to the US and ends up being implicated in a crime which he cannot remember the details of but which is presented on-screen as being perpetrated by another man. He is found not guilt by reason of insanity and this results in him being sent to a mental institution for treatment which takes the form of a combination of being straitjacketed, injected with drugs and placed on a morgue drawer. Naturally he trips out and has visions of the future (more specifically the year 2007) in which he finds out that he has died on New Years 1992/1993. There's a plot involving Keira Knightley's character as a combination of a love interest and a link to his past and the crime for which this man has been sent to the mental institution. Unfortunately the movie fudges any issue which comes up and most people seem to have little problem believing a mental patient who says that he's seen the future. It tries to be Donnie Darko and Jacob's Ladder but fails to be as convincing or compelling as either of these movies and it's only the feelgood factor, and the fact that I really wanted to like it because it's a bit different, which really redeemed it - though on another day, this may have resulted in it getting a lower score from me. Brody's performance is actually quite good while Knightley's is strained and overwrought although she's probably there more for eye candy purposes. Don't go out of your way for this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In Tour de Force Performance, Adrien Brody Knows Jack! :-)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's up with Adrien Brody playing guys named Jack? First he played Jack the slippery con artist in LOVE THE HARD WAY, now he plays amnesiac Gulf War veteran/accused murderer/asylum inmate/time traveler Jack Starks in THE JACKET, and Brody just wrapped Peter Jackson's (another Jack, sorta :-) KING KONG remake, due for Christmas season release, in which he plays playwright-turned-unlikely-hero Jack Driscoll. Is this Jack motif a superstition with Brody, like Paul Newman and his string of "H" movies (THE HUSTLER, HUD, HOMBRE, HARPER, HARRY &amp; SON)? Indeed, THE JACKET is chock-full of Jacks, in its title, its hero, and even love interest Jackie (Keira Knightley, looking like a cross between Helena Bonham Carter in FIGHT CLUB and Winona Ryder in BEETLEJUICE. Boy, her voice is deep when she's doing an American accent! :-). Too bad the folks at Warner Independent Pictures didn't know jack about properly publicizing THE JACKET, which opened with an anemic $2 million at the box office and only sank further. According to THE NEW YORK TIMES, the studio spent $10 million on advertising (acting like it was a big deal. I bet that's a fraction of the advertising budget that Universal will use on KING KONG...but I digress...), but they certainly didn't use it wisely. I didn't notice any TV commercials, newspaper/magazine ads, or posters at theaters for the film until the week it opened, and the advertising art is the ugliest, most unenticing imagery I've ever seen for a major release. There were interviews with Brody and with Keira Knightley on TV and in magazines and newspapers *after* the film had already opened (unless you happen to have The Sundance Channel, in which case perhaps you caught Alan Cumming's brief interview with the JACKET cast and director at the Sundance Film Festival during their FESTIVAL DAILIES series), but it was too little, too late. It's a shame, because while THE JACKET is flawed, even derivative -- it could have been titled TWELVE MONKEYS CLIMB JACOB'S LADDER SOMEWHERE IN TIME AND EXPERIENCE THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT -- it's nevertheless a compelling, emotionally-charged viewing experience, showcasing Brody in his best intelligent, angst-ridden, Young Pacino/DeNiro mode. Brody is one of the few actors around who movingly portrays anguish without chewing the scenery. (One nice, if slightly offbeat detail: as Brody lies on his back sobbing in one scene, you can actually see the poor man's tears dripping into his ears. And hey, is it me, or does Brody's angular face look like a theatrical tragedy mask when he's really crying his eyes out? I noticed that in THE PIANIST, too. Details like that intrigue me!) Certainly far worse thrillers have made a profit at the box office, or at least had a strong opening weekend. The atmosphere is appropriately eerie, and the trippy story sure keeps you guessing in a good way, even though some of the plot threads and possibilities aren't quite followed up on. For example, I half-expected Jackie to turn out to be a figment of Jack's imagination or his feminine side or something because of the similar names. It looks like it was simply a lack of naming imagination on the part of screenwriter Massy Tadjedin, working from a story by Tom Bleecker and Marc Rocco. No, the DVD's deleted scenes don't include any that prove my original theory right! :-) Brody and Knightley have a tender chemistry in their love scenes; I can see why there were rumors of a romance between the two during filming. In interviews, director John Maybury has described Brody as having a "Valentino-like" quality in these poignant yet sexy scenes, and I agree. Brody and Knightley are ably supported by a fine cast, particularly Kris Kristofferson as the sinister doctor, Jennifer Jason Leigh as the sympathetic doctor, and Daniel Craig as one of Brody's fellow inmates. One of the film's highlights is a loopy scene at a group therapy session in which Craig and Brody spout off about "The Organization for the Organized." It made me want to see Brody (and for that matter, Craig) star in a really good comedy one of these days! At its best, THE JACKET feels like one of those Japanese horror films in the RING/GRUDGE mold. At its worst, however, it feels like Maybury didn't trust the busy storyline and fine performances to hold viewers' attention, piling on weird visual F/X that, while unique for being inspired by experimental and silent films (this is also interestingly covered in the DVD's bonus features), often struck me as more distracting than enhancing. (Perhaps Maybury was inspired by Michel Gondry's similarly distracting directorial style in ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND! :-) Ironically, while Maybury's bells and whistles occasionally provide arresting imagery, particularly his use of color, I usually found the atmosphere and stark beauty of the outdoor scenery (Scotland does a fine job of standing in for snowy Vermont) much more emotionally resonant. Brian Eno's pretty yet vaguely spooky score helps, too; stay through the end credits or you'll miss Iggy Pop's (!) soulful rendition of "We Have All the Time in the World." Ah, well, maybe THE JACKET will develop a cult following, or at least do better on home video. The more attractive, compelling package art certainly couldn't hurt. As far as Adrien Brody's movie hit track record is concerned, here's hoping KING KONG is a king-size smash to make up for it! :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watchable movie if you're busy making our or something.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say first and foremost, as a physics buff, that although I expect most movies that claim to be science fiction to have truckloads of inaccuracy, this one took the cake when it comes to time travel. I mean, if you travel through time, if that were possible, it's generally assumed that you'd physically leave the place of your present, and cease to exist there, when going into the future. Otherwise, an exact duplicate of yourself would have to be made and sent into the future while your original stays behind in the past. I saw no cloning going on in this movie, but I did see some of that other gibberish. You can't travel into the future in your dreams and be physically there, unless we're talking as a ghost. This movie may have ineffectively tried to be haunting, but there weren't any ghosts...... As far as the rest of the plot goes, I guess it was watchable, but it was nothing like the previews or even the movie posters implied. more like a boring and surface value love story with a Winona Ryder wanna be and a splash of very crock of crap science fiction. I've wasted money on worse movies, but not in a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, GOD no</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*spoilers* There's an explanation for this, really there is. See, a bunch of actors auditioned for "Eternal Sunshine" and got turned down, so they dived through the dumpsters of Hollywood till they found a time-traveling script to call their very own. How else could a bunch of A-list stars end up in a Twilight Zone reject? Brody's a war vet who gets framed for the murder of a state trooper. His Yossarian status is rendered patently obvious by his spiky, artfully-disheveled 'do, as well as an opening sequence where he gets shot by a little kid. Obviously, this is Brody in lovable-loser mode. Judged criminally insane because of a vague "amnesia", he is placed in a mental institution of the "Cuckoo's Nest" variety. He ends up in the hands of a troubled psychiatrist (kristofferson) who subjects him to a unique "therapy" involving some drug cocktail and confinement in a straitjacket and a morgue drawer.Which is where the movie introduces the gimmick. See, when he's in the morgue drawer, he travels forward in time. Arriving in 2007, he crosses paths with a young woman (Knightley) who was 7 years old in the film's introductory sequence. He ran into her and her mother when their car had broken down, and now, wouldn't you know it, she grew up, she filled out. The good news is, she does a mean Wynona Ryder impersonation. The bad news? Brody's character died 7 years ago.So Brody needs to putter around the future, researching his death so he can prevent it in the past. Clever, huh? In the past, he gets to do his Kevin Spacey K-PAX schtick, giving one of the other doctors futuristic medical advice and playing all kinds of hell with Kristofferson's character. In the future, he runs around looking for answers while the clock runs down.With a plot this convoluted, you'd expect the director to do something original. Too bad. All of the "blockbuster" ingredients are in place. Mid-game sex scene? check. Malleable chick sidekick? check. Sappy, ridiculously well-tied-up conclusion? check. Abuse of special effects? check.What really gets my goat is, there is a decent movie under all the crap. Maybury clearly knows his tracking shots from his titles. When Brody travels back in time to the present, he just vanishes. No stupid computer tricks, no star dreck soda gasses. Just gone, giving Knightley an acting opportunity above and beyond the men's magazine disheveled mope (which is what she does in the movie, mostly). This, and the plot's potential, makes the bad parts so much more intolerable. The illusion of a halfway-decent movie is more or less maintained until the end, where Brody manages to parlay an apparently worthless hand into a royal flush. Whatever potential the film has evaporates in the last 5 minutes.The most spectacular disappointment I've had in years. Recommended for masochists only.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very very disappointing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Indepent films (most of them) is what film-making is all about especially guerrilla independent film-making. So I was very anxious to see this film, an intense psychological thriller that included time travel. I thought this was going to be along the same lines as "Jacobs Ladder" or even "The Butterfly Effect" or "12 Monkeys" Then when I saw it I barley made it through the film. It was so disappointing, I almost got up and left a few times, but I stayed just praying and hoping sometime soon it'll get better and it never did. I heard the director in an interview complaining about how the film was wrongfully advertised as a psychological intense thriller and now I know why the studio advertised like that. Because no one would go see it otherwise! First off the film explains absolute nothing at all. The doctor straps the main character in a jacket and stuffs him in a morgue drawer for no apparent reason, then all of a sudden he is transported into the future again for no apparent reason, sometimes it seems like the doctor know about it or is doing an experiment, but then he doesn't. Why did the doctor put him in the door in the first place? How and why is he time traveling. None of these questions are explained to the audience. the first few flashbacks you feel some intensity or as if "here we go" but that dies very quickly as nothing is explained by them, the first couple of times he is in the drawer your in their with him as he starts to panic and freak out but again that dies quickly and the little sound effects they use with the eye movements were annoying. The film was very slow moving and annoying. The director tries to misguide the audience or tries to make certain scenes intense and do some twists and turns but it fails. With so many questions and holes that go unanswered and unfilled I don't recommend this film. Hopefully they'll release a directors cut on DVD which explains more and has more detail, until then don't bother and don't be fooled into it seeing it by the trailers. If you want to see a great psychological thriller that yes also includes time travel, rent "Donnie Darko", "Butterfly Effect", "12 Monkeys" or "Jacobs Ladder" **out of five</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Absolute Disaster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was absolutely awful. Adrien Brody was a not a good choice for the lead role. With his prancing walk (the same as in his Diet Coke commercial) and annoying passivity he could not realistically portray a Gulf War veteran with a mental disability. Even worse were the gigantic plot holes. I love watching movies and I understand that at times it is necessary to suspend disbelief and accept the film world as its own reality. This was impossible in this movie. How does Brody's character time travel? How is his actual body n the future? What is the process? Why are the doctor's torturing him?There seems to be an entire scene missing at one point in the movie. We see Knightley's character screaming at Brody's to leave her apartment and the next we see them together is at a diner where Knightley's character has helped do some research for him. How did they get to this point? when did she agree to help? Brody's character's crime and trial is so disjointed and impossible to follow that there is no way to know what is going on. Shouldn't we find out what really happened? Doesn't it make sense that if Brody knows info that could help exonerate him that he would use it? Knightley gets naked in this movie, something I normally would be very happy to see, but the nudity was unnecessary and seriously disappointing from a good young actress like Knightley. The nudity and sex scene had NO real point. Nudity can add to a movie when it serves some purpose within the plot, but when it is there for no reason we have to wonder if the producers just thought this would sell a few more tickets! The ending was "happy" but would the film and story would have been better served with a bit more realism. It would have been a better ending to have Brody's character die and then find out that what he accomplished during his time helped Knightley and her mother have a better life. Instead we get a fairytale ending where the bad guys get their due and the good guys live happily ever after.Some people who saw this at festivals may have seen a different film because I would recommend they burn all the prints and scripts so no one else wastes $8 on this movie.I wouldn't even recommend this on video!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Jacket needs its own straight jacket.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It comes o'er my memory, As doth the raven o'er the infected house, Boding to all . . . ." Shakespeare's OthelloI am as intrigued by time travel as the next critic and even more about the games memory plays. I established my credentials by extolling Memento, as convoluted a trip down memory lane as a film could be. Memento keeps attention to details at premium and jarring quick cuts at minimum to result in an intriguing treatise on memory's imperfection and our bondage to time.The Jacket needs its own straight jacket to keep it focused for the attention span of an audience that has to wait far too long to get directions to where Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) is going, into the past or the future or both and why. He has suffered a Gulf War trauma (think Manchurian Candidate) leading to experiments performed by off-center Dr. Becker (Kris Kristofferson) that mainly put Jack inside a morgue holding slot. The hospital resembles Hannibal Lecter's lair, another example of how director John Maybury borrows without updating and without favorable comparison. Jack's visions of the future are disturbing both about himself and those close to him, such as Jackie Price (Keira Knightley), a child he helps at one time and becomes closer to at another, when she's a 20 something waitress. So don't be disappointed because you thought immediately that Jack could change the past, as if you were the first one to speculate about that clichd dilemma in a film which could be called thriller or horror or comedy depending if you are a geek or discerning film critic. Jacket so wants to be Memento that it ends up being a wax museum knock off, looking good from afar but unreal when up close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oddly Bad (and don't read the studio plot outline/spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are much better movies of the time-shifting genre than this. For example Butterfly Effect, or even Slaughterhouse Five.The first 40 minutes were so grimly unpleasant that I was wondering why I was sitting there watching it. There was no sense that it was going to be anything but, and in the screening I was in, some people left part way through. Finally the plot started getting interesting, but it was rather weak and minimal as time-shifting plots go.Acting was good, direction was, say, "stylistic". Many pivotal moments were minimalistic rather than fleshed out. The movie would be much better if the set-up took only 4 minutes rather than the 40 it actually took, and then if a real science fiction writer had gotten involved in working out interesting things to do with the set up, rather than the same-old boy-girl romance writer that seems to have been involved instead. Also, some dialogs are overly minimalist, better suited to zombies.p.s. I'm trying to reveal very little about the plot, but the movie's own publicity reveals most of what goes on, and rest of it is guessable from the gushy final sentence. What studio moron did that?!?. I'm very glad I didn't look at any of the publicity before seeing it, since the publicity description covers maybe the first 2/3 of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack and Jackie just missed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Another of my favorite genre, the psychological thriller, "The Jacket" just misses being one to remember. Despite a terrific cast lead by Oscar winner Adrien Brody ("The Pianist"), director John Maybury seems unable to seize the crucial moments and really explore the human drama in this story line. Keira Knightley ("Bend it like Beckham") shows that she is more than a soccer player or archer and can draw upon her dark side very nicely. We will undoubtedly see more from her. Great to see Jennifer Jason Leigh in a "normal" role. In the past, she would have been one of the patients, not one of the doctors, at the asylum. Rounding out the cast are Kris Kristofferson (his understated droning work fine here), Kelly Lynch as a strung out mom, a grown-up Brad Renfro (he was the boy in "The Client"), Daniel Craig (Paul Newman's gutless son in "Road to Perdition") and a torn up, but still alive Mackenzie Phillips. For those too young to remember, Ms. Phillips is the daughter of John Phillips from Mama's and the Pappa's fame, was a child star of "American Graffiti" and "One Life to Live", and may be best known in Hollywood for all of drug problems. The movie does a nice job of capturing the hell that would be the combination of a straight jacket and morgue drawer; however, never quite makes the connection between the Brody's current situation and his future world. Much more could have been made of the Brody and Kristofferson relationship and the final 15 segment is pure made-for-TV material. Brody is masterful at posing and strutting and often appears to be straight from an Abercrombie and Fitch ad. He does emote very well, but Mr. Marbury seems more interested in having his star look cool rather than act. If you have seen "The Butterfly Effect", you have seen this movie. If you have not seen "Jacob's Ladder", you should - it is much more representative of a quality thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tired thriller that fails to emotionally connect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with most movies made in this genre "The Jacket" is ,if you can believe it, a second rate "Butterfly Effect". It's a time sequence movie that leaps back and forth between the present and the past,the real and the unreal.I saw both the "Butterfly Effect" and "The Jacket" at it's opening night Sundance premiere and enjoyed the "Butterfly Effect" much more. Do not be fooled. The Jacket is a mediocre film with limited emotional connection that is masquerading as a deep psychological thriller with a serious and important message. It's best performance is wrung out by Keira Knightly as Adrien Brody's love interest and connection to the past and future. While Adrian Brody does indeed have a strong screen presence his acting seems almost lost and dominated by the heavy handed ham fisted overwrought direction of John Marbury. In the Q and A after the movie Marbury answers were bloated with his own self importance and his arrogance was palpable.Brody on the other hand gave intelligent,well thought out and truly thoughtful articulate answers to his Q and questions and he demonstarted why he is truly is a world class actor and human.I sensed that he knew that Marbury was way over the top and needed to step infor the Q and A and cool the hostility that Marbury was projecting.I also sensed a strong dislike for the director from all of the cast members including Keira Knightley and maybe this is why the movie did not connect in a convincing and personal way.Too bad the direction of this movie compromised Brody's world class ability to emote to the full extension of his psychological abilities. Most of the cast move about like an animated paint by numbers picture saying paint me paint me!Marbury did not paint his characters enough. There is no reason to see this picture. Wait for the rental. It is obvious to me that the director had no feel for the human side of this movie and he must have a problem expressing his own emotions in real lifesince this movie had several moments that could have made it great. The Jacket fails because it cannot connect with that human side of the story.With the CG and the quick cuts this looks like the director simply did not know where to go. See Jacobs Ladder or Altered States for a well directed story and great characters coupled with a superb representation of what the human mind can do under fantastic duress.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is really in 'The Jacket' ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I must say the acting was indeed very good. Adrian Brody and Kiera Knightley were excellent in their roles and really added a different edge to a movie which so desperately needed it.There was not the sense of excitement that the film promised and there seemed to be an overall lack of activity ... It looked like a Vin Diesel movie without the action and slowed down 5 times.I thought that there was a genuine lack of depth to the characters that were depicted and the performances by the actors were not capable of salvaging it.One redeeming factor though was the way in which the story was told. It was told in a very lazy but yet interesting way and though the storyline seemed a little bit like a dilapidated membrane of a rock band's drum, it managed to still produce the magic that the bands manage to.The emphasis again, is on the way the story was told and how it was portrayed and not the story itself. But I guess there cannot be too much excitement when you hear the tale of Humpty Dumpty for the millionth time and at that point it does not matter if a nursery teacher says it or Lady GaGa.The Verdict: Watch this if you are in the mood for a slow but dramatic movie but do not expect too many twists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Acting redeems the scattered, trippy "Jacket"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Jacket" if nothing else, sets the Hollywood record for most British actors speaking English in a feature film. Thank god they're talented.It's an interesting movie, but "The Jacket" really succeeds more as a drama than a sci-fi time travel thriller. Its strengths are Adrien Brody, Keira Knightley and Daniel Craig among others. They bring some convincing characters that are rather interesting, but it only partially saves a plot that isn't very gripping like a good sci-fi film ought to do. The characters wouldn't be worth caring about either if it weren't for the talent. Brody gets a lot of pity and Knightley surprisingly does despite playing a chain-smoking, emotional head case. The credit goes to them and not so much John Maybury or the writers. The film doesn't seem to know its most prized possessions are its actors. Without them, not only would the Jacket never have caught anyone's interest, but wouldn't be too good. Instead, the directing style lends itself more to sci-fi, trying to be trippy with flashes of images of past events that are more a headache than anything else. It's not horrible, but it's not all that terrific.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well wrought, scary psychological puzzle-thriller with an unconvincing ending, but much to admire along the way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adrian Brody stars as a young Gulf War veteran, who, while suffering from amnesia, is accused of murdering a policeman. He's committed to a mental institution, where he's injected with drugs, straitjacketed, and forced to spend hours in a morgue drawer. He imagines himself into the future. There he meets (miscast) Keira Knightley, discovers he's destined to die in 4 days time, and tries to save himself from death. Sounds crazy and absurd, doesn't it? It's not ? thanks to brilliantly atmospheric direction (John Maybury) and photography (Peter Deming), and excellent acting from Brody, Kris Kristofferson, and Daniel Craig. You are drawn into a nightmare world, and a puzzle, which envelops you as grippingly as the jacket itself. Unfortunately, towards the climax, the tone of the story and Brody's character change unconvincingly, to service a sweet ending. Nevertheless, there is much to admire here. A genuinely scary and fascinating film ? definitely not for kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has inspirations, doesn't fully make its own rules.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that's a lot more interesting based on its influences than it is as a stand-alone piece of art. The story, as it were, is something of a mesh of Jacob's Ladder, Memento, and La Jetee, all very fine films (La Jetee is among one of the best movies ever created, ever). As an individual piece of work, it supports decent acting and cinematography and at least gives one something to do for a couple of hours.I at first didn't believe that the creators of this movie (the producers including Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney) would know of such films like "La Jetee", expecting that they must have gotten their ideas from 12 Monkeys or something. But when the credits role over a direct homage to Stan Brakhage's "Mothlight", well, gotta give this movie credit where it's due.However, not all of the inspirations are important, nor really put to good use. The whole part of the plot involving the Gulf War was really pointless and wasn't even well fabricated (methinks at best the filmmakers were aiming for a comment on our current war in Iraq, the subtext of which we can live without thank you very much). And the ending is a definitive moment where a good mood is broken by sentimentality (just let the ol' woman die!).Otherwise, I think this movie is important because it proves my theory that Keira Knightley CAN act, it's just most of the time the directors don't require her to. Hopefully more people with vision will tap into her potential instead of just keeping her around for a pretty face in a corset.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good and creative thriller that deserves a better reputation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a shame this movie never really got the recognition it deserved. For "The Jacket" is a good and original and creatively put together movie, even though the story reminds of numerous other well known genre classics."The Jacket" is a well made and good looking thriller that has some nice twists in it. The movie mostly leaves you guessing till the end and the movie has some well handled psychological-thriller elements. It's too bad the movie was poorly and wrongfully advertised, for "The Jacket" really is a movie that deserves to be seen and better known, all over the world.The movie is well- and creatively directed by John Maybury, who normally only makes short movies. Some of the sequences are really great and beautiful looking. Although this movie also makes it's obvious that Maybury will probably never reach the level of true brilliance, he still shows he has a great style to make some more good looking and interesting movies with. It's mostly the story and storytelling that makes this movie still a rather flawed one.The story is complex and features time-traveling. In the end the movie probably will still leave more questions than answers but the story is not as philosophical or thought-provoking as it might sound. The movie for most part remains never more than just a 'normal' thriller, a well made and good thriller I would like to add but all in all nothing too remarkable or memorable in the end-, as it perhaps could had been with a different and more thought out approach.Adrien Brody gives an overall good performance, even though his character is far from well handled- or made out to look as interesting as possible. It takes a well to get accustomed to Keira Knightley's heavy American accent but once you get used to it you should be able to enjoy Knightley's fine acting. Really well cast were Kris Kristofferson and Jennifer Jason Leigh, who gave both a more than great performance. The movie further more features well known and established actors such as Daniel Craig and Brad Renfro in some small roles.The movie good looking with some nice nice looking settings and cinematography. It's creatively molded and put together all by John Maybury, who delivers with this movie a good and creative thriller that in the end would perhaps not leave a terribly huge lasting impression but its a perfect quality movie to kill some time with.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific direction makes it more than worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Starks is a Gulf War vet who survived, by a great stroke of luck, a shot to the head during a combat situation, but it is left with amnesia. Now back in the USA as he is walking home he hitches a ride only to be arrested when the crazy driver kills a cop and Jack takes the blame. Claiming that he didn't kill the cop, but doesn't remember who did, Jack is thrown in an institution, by reason of insanity he is subject to an unconventional treatment. One that he begins to use to figure out his past... by going into the future...From the get-go this film doesn't exactly scream 'originality' in its subject matter. Amnesia from head wounds, figuring out the past, is it all a dream? Or real? All that is pretty much here again for you to consider and think about, but don't let that stop you from checking this film out. The direction is superb for a psychological film - combining a vast array of visual elements, both CGI and just old-fashioned fancy film editing. The sound is also note-worthy and it is just as trippy as the visuals and all that put together make for a very interesting journey into a troubled human mind.The film wasn't a real hit at the box office despite a known cast, who give strong performances, probably since people might have though it to be a retread of 'The Butterfly Effect' with it's time-traveling psychological element, but while 'The Butterfly Effect' is in fact a very good and interesting movie in it's own right, this is too. Even more so I would say due to it's much superior direction from John Maybury. 9/10Rated R for grim/violent content and some profanity</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome concept... But, I feel in some ways amateurishly done...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, yes, OVERALL this is a good film with some really nice touches throughout; but I feel that it was many of the little things that annoyed me. Primarily if you simply edit out all the extraneous parts and the over emoting and the over clichd touches (for example, like how she was holding her cigarette when they were talking... it's not only the 'let's do the usual holding the thumb up to the upper teeth with the cigarette in the hand clich', but 3 TIMES IN 10 SECONDS!!!???... I know, I know, VERY petty sounding, but honestly they add up and become annoying after a while. Also, the stretched out, COMPLETELY unnecessary dialog, long drawn out pauses for 'effect' etc.This is a good film that just makes me ACHE to be able to re-edit it; if you could simply trim off all that totally unnecessary stuff and concentrate on the story and visuals and general mood it would be perfect (like 'The Butterfly Effect' as mentioned by another poster, except more 'arty', ethereal, and ambiguous...) I strongly disagree with another comment here that the direction was SO awesome. Yes, the overall concept and visuals were handled well, but it strikes me VERY strongly that the film is from a person who is a great music video director and incorporates the 'art' into the film well, but does not have a friggin' clue how to elicit proper performances from the actors. Come on, even veteran Jennifer Jason Leigh came across as stiled and amateurish, and there is NO bl00dy way that it's HER fault! However, even with all this I must say quite honestly that Adrian Brody pulled his performance off perfectly; he never came across as stilted or artificial in any way or at any time, even with what I consider a rather amateurish script (it's hard to say which hurt the film more, but a truly GIFTED director can make a bad script work) For all of you who likely wanna kill me about now : ) I will say that the last 20 minutes or so were handled beautifully and make up a lot for the rest.All in all a good film, just please excuse me for being so dang annoyed by all the added, unnecessary, and I feel strongly detracting touches. For example, the scene where he is going to visit Jackie's house; they get there and there is this interim scene in the car where they both sit there kinda awkwardly and say a couple of goofy things. Just have them come up to the house, have Jennifer Jason Leigh offer to go with him and have him say that he's okay, snip out the dopey interim scene of about 30 seconds and merely show him then getting out of the car to go in. Simple as that; just multiply EXACTLY what I just said by about 20 or so and you have it. So, it's not that the film needs to be completely reworked or anything, but I feel that just snipping out maybe a total of about 10 - 15 minutes would do the trick and make the film MUCH more streamlined and ultimate FAR more effective...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Jacket showed up on Sky last night and when I spotted the title, I set a reminder on it, I had a vague memory it was time-travelling sci-fi film and loving my horror and sci-fi, I wanted to see it. So when it started, with it's Gulf War montage and eerie plot start of Stark's death, I wasn't sure if I'd remembered the right description. Then of course, the time travelling does begin but I would never quote 'sci-fi' as the Shy description does, I don't think it's that genre at all - much like Memento or Identity are not. It was the first film I'd seen Adrian Brody in and 1. Boy is he skinny - like soooo skinny! 2. He is great, likable, changeable, all imploring eyes (enhanced by the skinniness!). His performance keeps the film alive. The new Bond also puts in a disturbing turn, with brown hair - doesn't work with the ice blue eyes! Kiera Knightly has a flawless American accent (but as my partner says - why don't they just get people from the country required??). She does a great job and there is real chemistry between the two. Which leads me to my title - of a book spoiling it. The book is of course "The Time Traveller's Wife" by Audrey Niffenberg and is a fantastic book, I cannot stress this enough. It was written long after this films inspiration but I hit the book first and it coloured my enjoyment of this film. There are so many similarity, the time travelling - sickening and just disappearing, the 'across time' love story, including the man meeting his love as a child and a woman. The senseless but foreseen death, not as murky as predicted but a mere accident (I believe the cosmos' way of stopping all the to-ing and fro-ing!). So many times during the film I thought, was this inspired by that book? Is this a weird adaptation? But that's just me. It's worth a look, don't get tied up in time continuity and stuff, as with all time travel concepts just accept it, if you start 'But this couldn't have happened if he changed this...' etc. It's a thriller, a love story, has horror elements everything. Great performances, eerie settings (I am petrified of mental institutions) and is subtly handled by the director, no overpowering score, no unnecessary shots - good stuff, go see people!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I truly enjoy films that make you think, and this one does, though at any given moment you aren't exactly sure what it is you are thinking. I find Adrien Brody's depiction of Jack Starks was quite believable, and I found the character was well rounded. You can see that he's a kind and caring person right from the start and you know that the turns of events that happen are not deserved.I was rather surprised by Keira Knightley's performance. I'd just watched her in Pirates of the Caribbean and it took a few moments for me to realize that it was indeed her. The supporting cast were all well suited to their roles as well... Jennifer Jason Leigh and Kris Kristofferson were also unexpected actors, as well as Mackenzie Phillips.I do recommend this film to others who like to not know what is going on.... even after the film is over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and well acted, but nothing really special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is hard to tell what the intentions of director John Maybury were with "The Jacket" because the story tries to be a lot of things, and while it is not a complete failure at that, it feels incomplete and confusing. It is sold as horror as the tag-line implies, but at its core, it is a drama complete with a love story that may disappoint those expecting a psychological thriller.Oscar-winner Adrian Brody is Jack Starks, a soldier who was almost killed in the gulf war when a kid shot him in the head. Back home he suffers amnesia and has hallucinations; so, when he is accused of a murder he is not sure he committed, he is locked on a mental institution where a psychiatrist (Kriss Kristofferson) will use him as a lab rat. During the experiments, Starks travels to what it seems to be the future, in year 2007, where he finds Jackie (Keira Knightley), a young woman who he had met years before when she was only a child. He also finds that he died years ago.The story is quite clever, and had a lot of potential to go anywhere it wanted; sadly, it seems to me that the writers took an easy exit and developed the story as a formulaic suspense/mystery film. We follow Starks, helped by Jackie, trying to find out how and why did he die in the past. It almost sounds as a pilot for a TV series.Still, the movie manages to be entertaining, and while the way it flows is not the most original, it is decently directed and has a good rhythm. There is imaginative camera-work, but, as the script, it never tries to be too imaginative. Quite a shame, because it almost feels as if the crew chickened out and decided to not make anything too different.The acting is outstanding for the most part, with Adrian Brody carrying the film with a very good performance. Kriss Kristofferson also makes a good job but Daniel Craig shines in a small role that truly steals every scene he is in. My only complain is for Keira Knightly, who gives an uninspired performance and her portrait of Jackie looks as a bad Winona Ryder impersonation. The rest of the cast is for the most part good with the few they had to work with, since is Brody who has the most screen time and development.I really would have liked that the movie explored more of its interesting premise, but it stays in safe ground very much like "The Butterfly Effect" did. I hope that next time director Maybury will take the dare of creating a more provoking movie because he has a lot of future.While certainly flawed, the movie manages to be entertaining and keeps the interest to the last scene. It could had been better and more original, but for what it is, I give it a 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly good "time travel" movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thanks to the likes of Star Trek and movies like Slipstream I have kind of gone off time travel. It's one of those topics that has been done to death and it's hard to bring anything new to the genre.So it was with a simple twist that I found this movie actually quite enjoyable. The twist? Instead of going back in time to change the present, the protagonist goes into the future in order to affect the present. How? You may ask, can events of the future affect the present? Information. The hero learns information from the future relating to his immediate present. Information that is not available to him (or anyone else) at the current time, but which is documented in the future. In the process of going to the future, he also rediscovers the past in the form of the then grown-up girl he helped in the past. The two fall in love etc. etc. Then comes the revelation that he is to die in the present in a few days time. A death about which little information is available in the future. What will he do? Will he be able to cheat death? Of course, as with all time travel scenarios, the paradoxical nature of the genre throws up all sorts of plot problems and difficulties. The final resolution of the story is predictable before the end of the movie, but they don't try and justify it in any kind of way. And that is the best way to view this movie - don't try and make sense of the time paradoxes, just go with it. If you do, the movie gets more and more interesting as it goes on and the resolution, though predictable and Hollywoody, is satisfying nonetheless.Well worth the effort of watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take away all the bells and whistles, this is "Back to the future", with a variation. Rather than GOING INTO THE PAST to affect certain events so that a different life line develops FOR A BETTER PRESENT, the hero achieves this by GOING INTO THE FUTURE to obtain certain information which can be used to affect certain events in the present so that a different life line develops FOR A BETTER FUTURE. Complicated? Not in the least, after you have watched the movie.Those bells and whistles include making the hero a Gulf War veteran, which for a moment would lead you to suspect that this movie may be an updated version of "The Deer Hunters". Not so. The Gulf War, if relevant at all, has only a small significance in giving Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) certain mysterious power to travel to the future, something that may well be achievable by any other types of traumatic experience that have nothing to do with any war. The "One flew over the cuckoo's nest" setup is a little more relevant, but this is a far cry from an accusation of mental institutes the way "One flew" is. The "mad scientist" persona here (played by Kris Kristofferson) develops, for treating mental patients, a "womb like environment", which is really a replica of the drawers used in morgues for storing dead bodies. It's the worst version of solitary confinement because the victim is also strapped in a straight jacket. It brings to mind the horrors of Edgar Allen Poe's "Premature Burial". The complete irony here, however, is that only in this state can Jack gain complete freedom as it is the only way he can "travel" to the future.I won't get into the details of the plot other than that it involves a love story between Jack and Jackie Price (Keira Knightley), plus the few sub-plots. The movie is shot with abrupt, split-second images aplenty. The location Vermont, however, provides an opportunity to balance some of these disturbingly dizzy sequences with some of the most serenely beautiful snow scenes you can find in any movie.Both Brody and Kristofferson are perfect for their parts. Knightleys take up a different role as a haggard, smoking, drinking waitress but makes up for it with the last few minutes (in the alternative life line) in the way we know her best, in radiant beauty. There is a good supporting cast. But then I can't for the life of me figure out what on earth Daniel Crag, our 007-designate, is doing in this movie. It looks almost like he happened to be passing by the set and someone grabbed him and asked him to make a couple of cameo appearances. His name appears last in ending credit roll, preceded by an "and". A cameo, decidedly.Go and see Jack and Jackie in "The Jacket". You'll enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh how I wish that I could give this a ten. I have just watched "The Jacket" for the first time, and am enamoured with it. When I read the synopsis of the film, it seemed a bit far fetched, but Adrien Brody and Keira Knightley's performances are outstanding! Yes, the main character is suffering from the effects of a head wound in the gulf war, but then when he returns to America he is wrongly convicted of a murder he didn't commit. The film raises questions about reality in the way that the Matrix did, it raises questions about memory in the way that Memento and Donnie Darko did, and it raises many questions about America - least of all, the eternal question, What Is Sanity? This film doesn't attempt at answering this question, and nor should it. Accept it at face value, or at any level and this is a film of absolute class. I don't want to give it a ten based purely on the fact that I have only seen it once. When I buy it (which I definitely will) then I can make an accurate decision whether or not it is worthy of the sought after 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

The look, style and superb cast complement perfectly what is already a rich plot and story.Keira Knightley really proves herself as a talented and versatile actor, whilst Brody, Jason-Leigh and Kristofferson do not disappoint audiences who have come to expect remarkable performances of them.It is another post-9/11 film that encompasses themes of violence, humanity and inhumanity. Interestingly, The Jacket (although I am conscious of how undesirable it is to categorise such a film) is another in a line of productions, such as Gothika, which examine notions of (in)sanity, psychiatry and supernatural phenomena.For movie lovers, The Jacket is an absolute must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I watched this movie I was, for whatever reason, completely mesmerized by several engaging factors. First, Brody is outstanding and very believable as a kind, vulnerable and grounded guy being pulled through these bizarre life experiences. Second the music is so perfectly fitting and gripping and I don't mean the songs but the theme music that plays in certain moments in the movie and at the very end. There is just something about it that grabs the mood of the movie. Third, the love connection between Brody's character and Kira Kightenly (spelling?) is compelling enough to move the audience to wish them together. And finally, the story line, I couldn't wait to see how all of the pieces came together. I've seen this film 4 times and I still enjoy it and learn more every time.</fullReview>

This is not the sort of movie dominated by the idea of shocking the audience (in spite of its being quite creeping) but relies on his lead great performance and on a clever story. It's different from other supernatural thrillers for having ingredients of everything: medicine, war drama and science fiction, so it's definitely a change from nowadays horror and mysteries pictures. All things considered the product is not enough powerful to be judged as a masterpiece but it's an interesting experiment</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can a film come out so obviously based on the story of a book, but not give a credit to the original author? London's book came out in 1913, perhaps the copyright has lapsed so the publisher wasn't too concerned about stealing ideas.Jack London's The Jacket (also known as Star Rover) is a beautifully crafted piece of writing, thought-provoking and challenging to the reader, and also damning of the US penal system of the time - the reason, it is said, that the book was banned from publication for decades. The fact is, as some have already alluded in their comments here, this movie's basic story isn't just similar, it's near-identical.I'm surprised Tom Bleecker and Marc Rocco, credited with "Story" for this film, submitted via the Writer's Guild of America, can sleep at night.andy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the trailer, it seemed to me that The Jacket used (ripped-off?) several elements of the excellent film Oldboy. Accused of a murder he didn't commit, being locked away for years, use of psychotropic drugs, search for answers, and other things that those who have seen Oldboy will recognize. Now that I've seen it, The Jacket is a different movie, yet all those elements I mentioned are in it (with a scifi twist). Take from that what you will. Personally, I'm suspicious. Anyway, The Jacket was a decent movie (despite the annoying fact that the method of time travel is never really addressed) but Oldboy is far better; see it instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is a very interesting film and reading other comments on IMDb I was surprised to see that my understanding of the film was completely different. Why? For me, it's obvious that there are no time travels, nor changes in the future, nor any stuff like that. There is only and only the mind of Jack Sparks, who suffers violent changes by the combined effect of experimental drugs and panic of being on a morgue drawer. The final change in future is once again a product of his mind, as he dies more peaceful imagining that he was with Jackie. So, I think the film ends to be a beautiful love story between Jack and Jackie (notice the curious name's link). Unfortunately, this love story is only a product of Jack Sparks imagination, under the effect of drugs. I think the film is very close to Jacob's Ladder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Smart and Intriguing On-the-Edge of Your Seat Kind of Thriller That Is Something Rare to See These Days</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Maybury's film 'The Jacket' is something we haven't seen in a while. In the start of the new year of 2005, the only movies that get released are basically crap. I call it the beginning of the year brain fart movie season. It is for the most part. All the sappy and unintelligent teen comedies or mindless action flicks starring teen heartthrobs Ashton Kutcher or Vin Diesel is pretty much what to be expected in this most tedious and boring of seasons for movies. When seeing the coming attractions to 'The Jacket' it didn't seem like it belonged in this movie season. It looked like it would actually be enjoyable and maybe thought-provoking. It even has great actors like Adrien Brody and Keira Knightley in it. But, I was very pessimistic about seeing it also. I figured it was one of those films that looked really interesting, but would turn out to be an absolute bomb. I was wrong about that. 'The Jacket' is an interesting, mind-bending and unusual movie, that takes the place as the best film of the year so far (as of the first week of March).You know you are in for an intriguing yet neurotic treat when one of the first lines of the movie is 'In 1992 was the second time I died' (or something like that -- it's not word for word). That comes from the narrator of the story and the main character, Jack Stark (Adrien Brody). After being resuscitated from the dead, minutes after being shot in the head by an Iraqi child during an invasion in Desert Storm, the story begins. I can't really tell you anything about it though, without ruining it for you. All I can tell you is that one day later Jack wakes up in a mental hospital and has no clue why he is there and what happened previous. Peculiar events take place after that including experimental treatment, two different realities and the woman of Jack's dreams (played by Keira Knightley). It's very confusing to keep track of the story though, because it keeps skipping from the mid-90's to the year 2007. Jack tries to explain this to people in both realms, but they just think he's crazy, and he doesn't know if he's really moving from one reality to another, or if he's just insane like people tell him.'The Jacket' is a very intriguing splice of cinema, but it also has it's down points. The movie is a little slow, stiff and uninvolved towards the beginning, but once it starts rolling it doesn't stop, and that is when the fun begins. The film is extremely intriguing, but it is also very confusing. If you lose concentration for one second you'll be lost. So, when and if you view this movie don't blink for a second. The acting is very decent in 'The Jacket'. Recent Academy Award Winner Adrien Brody gives a wonderful performance as the story's hero. The actor perfectly captures his character's mood and mental illness. Adrien Brody is one of the few actors that a play a great mentally ill person. Keira Knightley does a great job as the semi-leading lady, while Jennifer Jason Leigh provides fine work as the other semi-leading lady (she plays a doctor working at the mental hospital Jack is institutionalized in.) Other cast members include Kelly Lynch (Drugstore Cowboy), Daniel Craig (Layer Cake) and Kris Kristofferson (Blade) who turns in a good performance as the creepy and seemingly bad head doctor working at the mental hospital Jack is in. The film's writing is very creative and flows smoothly for the most part, but some of the film's directing seems overly flashy and a slight sore to the eyes. When everything is said and done, 'The Jacket' proves to be a good movie. Not a great film, but a good one that is worth paying the price of admission to see in the theaters. If you can handle the weirdness of it and are willing to pay close attention to the plot twists, I think you will thoroughly enjoy this supernatural thriller. Grade: B- (screened at AMC Desert Ridge 18, Phoenix, Arizona, 3/12/05)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Full Mental Jacket</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can sum up this movie for you in one sentence: 12 Butterfly Monkeys Flew Over Donnie Darko's Ladder.The Jacket is really a stew made from pieces of Donnie Darko, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, the Butterfly Effect, 12 Monkeys and Jacob's Ladder. The thing about this stew is that the flavors all mesh nicely, and don't compete too much. It's a little bland, and probably doesn't deserve a full-on BAM! but it's better than canned soup.This movie is a weird kind of psychedelic time travel paranoid thriller. Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) is a soldier in Desert Storm, and he gets shot in the head. Flash forward to years later, he's wandering down a lonely stretch of road and he runs into a little girl and her mother who are broken down by the side of the road. He fixes their car and continues on his way, until he's picked up by some guy who goes on to shoot a highway patrolman and frame Jack for the murder. Jack is found guilty by reason of insanity and sentenced to treatment at a mental facility. The head doctor (Kris Kristofferson) utilizes some strange methods in his attempted treatment of his patients. The orderlies strap Jack into a straight jacket, fill him full of drugs, and stick him in a morgue drawer for 8 hours.While Jack is in the drawer, he somersaults through time to find the little girl that he helped by the side of the road all grown up now. They fall in love, and she tells Jack that he died inside the mental institution. Now Jack has to figure out how he died and who killed him before time catches up with him. Basically, every time they take Jack out of the drawer, he knows a lot of stuff about the future that he shouldn't know.It's a fairly interesting little concept, and it would probably be a lot more entertaining if it didn't feel so familiar. It's well-acted and directed with style. I can't find any flaws with the execution of the movie, and the production is slick and glossy. The main problem with the movie, and the reason I'm not giving it a higher grade, is that it's too familiar. That familiarity comes from having seen elements of the Jacket in all the movies I mentioned above. If the Jacket had been made before Donnie Darko or 12 Monkeys, it might have felt vanguard and unique, but as it is, this just winds up being a little bland for my taste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Jacket just looked interesting enough to take off the shelf. I'd never heard of it before, knew it was coming or anything about...it just looked like it might be interesting...well to say the least. The film is mind blowing, it's comparable to another good movie The Machinist in the way that it is so open to interpretation. Is he dead? If so when did he die? At what point is there reality, and at one point is all fabrication of his mind? Is he hallucinating? and so on and so forth. But even with all these questions you're left with such an incredibly, different and unique captivating film.The Jacket is the story of Jack Starks, a former officer in Gulf War: Operation Desert Storm. "The first time he died" as he puts it was during a raid on a camp where he discovered a young boy inside. Looking into that boy's eyes he sees fear and loneliness and tries to reach out to him and the boy shoots him in the head. By some miracle Starks is still alive even after being pronounced dead and after recovering he is sent on his way. Starks is hitchhiking on a cold, deserted highway when he comes across a young girl and her mother stranded on the road. The mother is drunk and the girl begs Jack for help. While Jack fixes their car he also gives to the little girl his dog tags and continues on his way. He is finally offered a ride by a man who is later pulled over the police. In the flash of an eye, and very little of Jack's memory the driver kills the officer and leaves Jack to take the fall. Found not guilty by reason of insanity, Jack is sent to stay at an Asylum and undergo treatment at the hands of Dr. Becker who is using a state of the art idea to attempt to help these people recover. He begins with Jack, drugging him endlessly and then every night locking him inside a straight jacket and then leaving him in a morgue drawer. When Jack is inside there he suddenly finds himself leaping forward in time. He comes across the little girl he helped on the side of the road, except she is grown up now, without her mother, and she is angry and heartbroken at the world. Jack falls for her almost immediately determined to care for her. When Jack discovers that he actually dies within a few weeks of being in the Asylum he sets out with the girl to figure out how his death comes about. When he eventually excepts that his death will not change he does his best to change the life of the woman he loves before he dies.The cast for the Jacket is brilliant, but in all fairness they have an amazing script to work with. After watching the DVD extras on the film (which I highly suggest) the original script for The Jacket was enormous which is unfortunate because this film does truly leave you wanting more and more and more. You want more information, you want to see more of these characters and I would love a sequel despite the fact it might ruin it. Adrian Brody as the lead Jack Starks is desperate, emotional, kind, loving and at the same time disturbed. You almost wonder if he was responsible for the murder at times. His mind is so confusing. The lovely Kiera Knightley plays Jackie Price, Jack Starks love interest and these two on screen are hot!! Chemistry like I haven't seen in a long time, they are awesome together but they are together so briefly which makes you feel and understand their position. Kris Kristofferson is perfect as the aging Dr. Becker who is not the bad guy. He really, truly does mean well but unfortunately his approach is wrong. We see this when Starks talks to him in the future and he begins to cry. Jennifer Jason Leigh's character I thought was almost pointless for her. Granted I am not a fan but still a stronger actress could have made a bigger impact in that role. After watching the DVD extras I found a dislike for director John Maybury on a personal level. He seems like such a jerk but I guess I have to show him some respect because he made an incredible film. If there is any downside to this film it would simply be that it leaves you desperately wanting more. It's a mix of sci-fi, romance, drama, action...you name it!! It's probably the most unique film you're gonna see this year. It's simply amazing!! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good movies are hard to come by, but what exactly defines a good movie? Obviously good direction and good acting but one thing that many movies lack in nowadays is originality, and the Jacket has all of these things. There was an intrigue about the Jacket that made me interested in watching it in the first place... I never saw a trailer nor a TV commercial about it... maybe it was the creepy looking movie poster or the fact that the red hot keira knightly (Pirates of the Caribbean) and adrien brody (oscar winner for best actor in the Pianist) are in it. Anyway I went in on a hunch with no expectations to discover that this time my instincts didn't fail me.An iraqi war veteran Jack Starks (Brody) suffers from brain damage and is later committed to a mental institute for reasons he cannot understand or recollect... but his time in the looney bin only makes him that much more looney... Under a special treatment by Dr. Becker (Kris Kristofferson, Blade and The Hulk)... Jack starts to get delusions which he soon realizes are images of the future. With this newfound ability Jack uses his knowledge of the future to unlock secrets from his past to learn more about himself and the mysteries behind the people in his life.This movie is a trip. You can imagine since the movie is seen through the eyes of a crazy man, and Adrien Brody does a damn good job of being crazy. He's crazy, confused, curious, angry and violent, and you would be crazy for not being all these things if you went through the things he did. Considering all the emotions this man goes through, you just have to give Adrien a pat on the back... or maybe a shoulder to cry on... he was so convincing you wonder if Adrien really does have issues.The same can be said for Knightly's character... a stranger named Jackie who Jack finds plays an important role in his future. In contrast to the bright characters you've seen her play in her other movies like Bend It Like Beckham and Pirates, Knightly shows her darker quality and at the same time her versatility and skill as an actress... and she's hot with black hair.Everything goes back to originality. The idea of it almost seems reminiscent of The Butterfly Effect, which was sloppily put together. The Jacket has so much more depth to it: the mysteries behind the plot and behind the characters themselves. The Jacket was simply written better... and the fact that we follow a crazy guy makes it even more fun for the director to play with.The Jacket was fun. It was interesting. It was well-casted and well-acted. It was disturbing and suspenseful. It was original in its own right. I don't want to end with some corny line like "Don't stay out in the cold... get yer Jacket." Instead I'll just say that The Jacket is a good movie.</fullReview>

I will say, I didn't feel it was as complex as Butterfly but the acting is solid and the story is interesting. I felt satisfied that I chose the right movie to see this afternoon.As a litmus test (so you know if my movie tastes completely disagree with yours or not), I would rate the The Butterfly Effect as a 9 and this movie as a 7.0-8.0ish.

		<shortDescription>S10 Reviews: The Jacket (2005)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) is a veteran of the Gulf War. He was discharged after recovering from "dieing the first time" in a horrible incident that left him shot in the head. Starks roams restlessly about the country roads (a la Rambo in First Blood) when he runs across a woman and her daughter stranded with a broke down truck. While the alcoholic mother is busy blowing chunks he and the girl named Jackie fix the machine. Jackie takes an instant liking to Jack and asks Jack for his dog tags. Being a softy for kids he obliges and all go on their merry way. Continuing on his cross-country trek, Jack accepts a ride that starts him on the road to his own personal hell. Next we see him on trial for murdering a police officer. He has no recollection of anything that day except the mother and daughter. Due to his mental condition he is tossed in an asylum. Dr. Becker (Kris Kristofferson) subjects Starks to a radical and unnerving procedure where he pumps Starks full of psychotropic drugs wraps him in an old and musty strait-jacket and throws him in a morgue locker for hours. During these claustrophobic "sessions" Jack somehow goes from 1992 to 2007 and during his brief visits to the future where he learns of his death and needs to find out how to prevent it. While in the future he meets and falls in love with a now grown-up Jackie (Keira Knightley).I almost chose to wait for the DVD on this one but upon reading a local review I was compelled to take in a Friday showing. Boy was I glad I did. Directed by John Maybury, The Jacket is an excellent film. A compelling story that draws you into the plight of an instantly likable war-hero, which is played brilliantly by Adrien Brody (who is fast becoming) one of my favorite actors) and the things he has to live through. You instantly take a liking to the character and feel for his situation. Knightley (a hottie) gives an excellent portrayal of a slightly gothed out alcoholic woman who has a weird connection with Starks Rounding out the cast are Kristofferson (always a pleasure to watch) and Jennifer Jason Leigh (one of the most under-appreciated actresses in Hollywood). The casting is perfect all the way around. People will always complain about stories involving time travel but that particular aspect takes a backseat to excellent acting and well-defined characters. True there will be "loop holes" and "paradoxes" but who care? The script is solid. The "science" is forgivable and doesn't need addressing. I can't say that I have heard of English director Maybury before but with the interesting visuals on display here, he is certainly on my watch list now. The Jacket is very interesting visually. There always seems to be some interesting sequence or way of setting up a scene. The jacket sessions where he trips to the future are very claustrophobic and well, trippy. Some of the ways he sets up simple exposition scenes (like focusing on eyes or a mouth) are killer. The music is often chaotic and even haunting. Very well done too.I'm glad to have walked into this one. The best release of the year so far and possibly some Oscar contention for next year, if they can even remember this far back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does the jacket become a time machine, or is it something else??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Different' isn't always good, but in this movie, "The Jacket", it is something different AND very good. Adrien Brody is Jack Starks, badly wounded in the Gulf War by a small boy. Or was he really killed, we don't know for sure. The discussion boards have many theories on "what this movie is really about." To me it is one of those movies you can get into, then apply your own thoughts on where it really goes, and what it really means.Much of the movie takes place in a mental prison of sorts, in late 1992, after Jack is wrongly tried for murder of a traffic officer, and judged legally insane. One doctor is played by Kris Kristofferson, Dr. Becker, who tries radical treatment, that includes drugs and a night in a dark morgue space. While in there Jack has strange experiences, seemingly being transported 14 years into the future. But is he really going, or is this all part of a vivid dream?Jennifer Jason Leigh plays another doctor at the institution, Dr. Beth Lorenson, who appears to be distrustful of Dr. Becker's techniques. Mackenzie Phillips, who plays Nurse Harding , has not aged gracefully. I hardly recognized her. SPOILER WARNING AHEAD. When Jack goes to 2006 the first time, he meets Keira Knightley who plays Jackie Price, waitress and poor. Not even realizing what time period he was in, and with no place to crash, she brings him to her place, where he sees his own dog tags, which he gave to her as a little girl 14 years earlier when helping to start their stalled car on a snowy road. He makes a couple of more trips, and in one writes a letter of warning to Jackie's mom (Kelly Lynch) who had died from a fire started by her own cigarette, and in another tells Dr. Lorensen of a treatment she will try to help a sick boy. At the end, on the date of his official death, January 1, 1993, when he slips on ice and falls, hitting his head, he tells them to put him in the jacket and the chamber one last time. He goes to 2007, meets Jackie, who now has a nice new car, works at a hospital, and her mother is still alive, thus history has been changed. This time, since Jack is already dead back in 1993, he cannot go back and instead remains in 2007, and he and Jackie have a chance to build a life together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good story complemented by good acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In many ways this film is similar to "The Butterfly Effect", but it is different from it in even more ways. "The Jacket" is a mixture of drama, mystery, and sci-fi. Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) is a psyche patient that is experimented on with a special jacket which allows him to see the future. With the absence of white knuckle suspense or action, "The Jacket" relies heavily on the story itself as well as good acting. Fortunately, "The Jacket" delivers both a good story and good acting. This movie was surprisingly superb in its simplicity. There was never any huge conspiracy to uncover, nor did Jack Starks have to perform any acts of heroism to topple a big nemesis. He learned simple truths that had huge impact and shared them. It is a feel good story that is powerful and moving. I'm shocked that I'd never heard of this movie before. I would recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting premise that goes nowhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While serving in the first Gulf War, Jack Starks was shot in the head and nearly died. After returning home to Vermont, he is left with memory problems which will play a part in his being falsely accused of a murder. He can't remember what actually did happen and ends up being sent to a mental institution. And here things get interesting. Well, at least they should get interesting but they really don't.Jack, played by Adrien Brody who unsurprisingly is the best thing this film has to offer, is subjected to some rather bizarre treatments. In the course of these treatments he is transported years into the future, the year 2007 to be exact. In the year 2007 he learns he has actually died years earlier. When the treatments end and he returns to the present day, he's in a race against time to find out how he died and prevent it. Sounds good. But then the movie just kind of sits there. There's very little in the way of plot and what plot there is has enough holes in it big enough to drive a truck through. Matters aren't helped by the fact the young woman helping Jack whenever he ends up in 2007 is played by a woefully out of her depth Keira Knightley. Knightley apparently believes that facial contortions are what acting is all about. Whenever she's in a scene with Brody or the more experienced, reliable Jennifer Jason Leigh, who plays one of Jack's doctors, the contrast between good acting (Brody, Leigh) and silly pouting (Knightley) is painfully obvious.Anyhow, the movie keeps skipping back and forth between the present and the future. You'd think there would be some sense of suspense here but somehow there's not. It all seems rather dull. Brody does a good job, Leigh is fine and Kris Kristofferson also does well as another of Jack's doctors. But Knightley is hopeless and for all the back and forth through time the story never really moves forward. In the hands of a more capable director this film might have been something. As it is, it leaves much unanswered and at times defies any kind of explanation. It's as if the filmmakers didn't know what was going on and hoped maybe you could figure it out for them. There are some pretty good performances here but the whole thing comes off as rather amateurish and disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>so much better than it could have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviews had been mixed so I was going in prepared that I might not like the movie. As a result, I was delighted with how good it was. But it could so easily have been a disaster; these sorts of stories operate on a very specific level that must be balanced just right. Fortunately John Maybury seems to have come to the film with the correct attitude: yes, it is just a quirky bit of pulp fiction, but that doesn't mean it can't be done with sincerity. On the other hand, some hack director might have decided to equate sincerity with pomposity, and think how awful The Jacket would have been then. No, here there's an undercurrent of humor, accepting but not belittling the plot's inherent absurdity (or perhaps fantasticness is a better word). As an example, consider the "group therapy" scene, which goes that little bit further into craziness than you might expect (and the wonderfully perfunctory shot of what happens to Jack straight afterward). The second thing in The Jacket's favor is the cast, notably Adrien Brody's high-wire act. He's given a line late in the film that is pure movie clich: "What's the matter? You look like you've seen a ghost". Brody's character knows it's a clich and delivers it knowingly but there's also an almost despairing bitterness in his voice that's just right for the plot at this point. Many actors, under many directors, would only have managed the "knowingly" bit. I came out of the cinema feeling good, like I'd just seen Twelve Monkeys filtered through Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent... a fresh story filled up with taut suspense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently it's another time-travel story that gets messed up in time paradox. Adrien Brody plays Jack Starks, a soldier who after surviving a terrible intra-cranial bullet wound is sent to his homeland while still suffering from bouts of acute amnesia. Soon he's charged for committing a murder that he cannot remember and is sent to a psychiatry hospital. There a doctor puts him in sessions inside a morgue drawer wrapping him in a jacket-like device. In those sessions he experiences visit to the future and meets a girl (played by ravishingly beautiful Keira Knightley) and finds out he had already died in one of those sessions. The identity of the girl.... well, you better find out the rest!The movie neither explains how that jacket induces time-travel experience nor how Starks could alter the future of his loved ones. In fact most of the things remained unexplained. A possible theory could have been multi-verse etc but the movie never attempts to apply that explanation directly. Then why is this such a nice sci-fi film? Because instead of applying weird scientific details and unnecessary visual effects, it simply focused on the main story in order to make it more exciting and suspenseful. It has got a nice cast too. Oscar-winner Adrien Brody took the lead responsibility well in his masterful hands. Jennifer Jason Leigh is also worth mentioning. The location and the time of shooting are just great to go along with the natural gravity of the film. There's only one thing to complain, that's the ending where it seemed overtly sentimental, but it is quite excusable, depending on the nice experience the film offered throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ending as I saw it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you remember the beginning of the movie, Jack Stark does not permanently die,at least not due to head injuries. He is shown to have died and come back to life shortly after due to head injuries twice, once in Iraq and once shot by the cop. So let's first go to the issue of whether or not he dies at the end of the movie. Nope. Sure he momentarily "dies" as he always does, but as usual he will wake up from this death. So now with this time travel: Jack is doing some time traveling. How else would he know how to help the Woman doctor's friend's son, or the names of the people Dr. Becker had done this too, or where Jackie lived. So we have to except that whatever Dr. Becker is doing to Jack he is able to interact in the future. So then we get those confusing last 5 or 10 minutes. In 1993 Jack goes to Jackie's house, gives her mom the letter. Her mom then changes their future. BUT up until that moment in 1993 the past is exactly the same. In the original future, Jack "dies" in 1993 and is found in the woods and Jackie ends up being a degenerate waitress. In the new Future, Jack "dies" in 1993, but manages to time travel to see how Jackie made out on more time, and Jackies life is all good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A smooth psych thriller that was not what I expected...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Jacket is being advertised as a "oohhh scary and suspenseful psychological thriller", I guess that in some ways it is. However it is not, it's not really a scary "boo!" in your face movie, you follow the story of Jack Starks, a Gulf War vet who confesses to have have "died the first time" in 1991 when during an engagement lets his guard down to a young boy, who in turn shoots him in the head.He is left for dead, and later while in the med ward, is discovered to actually be alive, miraculously. He is medically discharged, and in a quick scene the doctors say he has amnesia and Gulf War syndrome, before a quick cut to Brody walking around in a snowy Vermont.I have definitely seen more disturbing images in other foreign films, and even some older U.S. films like Apocalypse Now, however the movie isn't so much about war as it is about Jack Starks's self-analysis. In a Donnie Darko type move the movie starts to evolve into something else entirely. I Jack Starks dead? Is he crazy and delusional? Is he time traveling? Is he still dead on the field of the Gulf War battle? This movie features excellent performances by Adrian Brody who portrays a wide range of emotions well, from melancholy humble, to terrified, and angry. I was more impressed with "lunatic mental hospital scenes" with 12 Monkeys and The Princess and the Warrior BUT, the other hidden surprise here I thought was Knightley, she didn't do too bad, and since the story ends up focusing on the "what ifs" of these two, its a great thing they had some chemistry on screen.I definitely liked this more than the goth-teen-emo flick, Butterfly Effect (although in all honesty wasn't that bad), and put this in the same vein as The Machinist. Excellent performances, but weak ending/not a complete story telling experience. I will definitely add this to my movie library.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A half hearted effort on a truly inspiring plot, combined with some lacklustre performances.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Jacket sparked some interest for me when it came out because of the unusual plot and the knowledge that it had filmed in Bangour Village Hospital in Scotland. IMDb describes the plot as A military veteran goes on a journey into the future, where he can foresee his death and is left with questions that could save his life and those he loves.Sounds really interesting doesn't it? It certainly did to me, and it suggested that the plot could be complex, involved and very consuming...yet it kind of failed to deliver for me.Adrien Brody was quite good in the film, and his performance was at times very strong emotionally. Some of those scenes where he was about to be locked in the morgue drawer were quite intense, but then during other scenes he just seemed to be there and working through his lines. Now that could have been because he was supposed to be withdrawn, but that's not how it came across at all.Keira Knightley did a similar job, she was good and not as emotionally charged as Brody, but there didn't seem to be anything for her to really get into. Jennifer Jason Leigh seemed awkward and out of place, a very stilted performance from her.Someone who did stand out, and give me a big surprise at the same time, was Daniel Craig, the new Bond. He really did seem out of it and quite on the edge, he showed off some of his acting which I hope to see in the new Bond movie.Now, to the story. It had a lot of potential and built itself up well, knowing that the character was going to die on a certain date and that he was racing against time to discover what was going to happen and how to prevent it, yet that journey became quite drawn out, sidetracked and was ultimately pushed to the side. This was, for me, the hook of the movie, the big question mark that would provide the quest and the thriller elements to the movie, but it was lost. As the character tried to find the answers he was sidetracked by meaningless scenes, or his questioning just stopped when he could have and would have pressed harder to find out what someone know about his death rather than saying thank you and leaving.Some of these sidetracked story lines were good and made some sense, and one even goes on to be the ultimate message of the movie, yet he never really does seem concerned with saving himself when someone really in that situation would be. It just never quite rang true for me.In the end the possibilities of a more complex and insightful ending are wrapped up for simplicities sake and to make the ending seem much warmer and caring. Yet it could have been so much more, something much more thoughtful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey kids, did you love Jacob's Ladder? Appartently the people who made this derivative flick did.Welcome to one of the most disappointing films of the year. Some fine performances by Adrien Brody and Jennifer Jason Leigh are overshadowed by a dismal screenplay that makes no effort whatsoever to bring any original ideas to the time travel genre. Of course even if they had a story it would had been sabotaged by a atrocious performance by the usually reliable Keira Knightley who is out of her element and over her head in this film. Kris Kristofferson does the best he can with the material and Brad Renfro shows up just long enough to register on the eye before he vanishes. Perhaps the most amazing thing about this film is exactly how many people are willing to overlook its obvious similarities to better films as they hail it has a masterpiece.Do not be fooled. If its on TV, it may be worth watching but it is not worth the cost of a rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Jacket (1/5 stars)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The kind folk at IMDb have warned us of putting "spoilers" in our reviews. I don't think there are any spoilers in here, but I do give a rather in depth plot summary. I try not to give anything away but if you are really picky then I suggest you move on. Thank you.Synopsis: "The Jacket" is possibly one of the most convoluted and silly movies of the year (and yes I know it's only March). When I came into this film I wasn't expecting much--maybe a two star horror flick (the kind of thing one sees when nothing else is playing). However, what I watched was not worthy of such praise--oh no--far from it. "The Jacket" was instead was one these modern 'thrillers' that lack everything from logic to the thrills. Adrien Brody (who I liked very much in the "Pianist" and not much else) plays a Desert Storm veteran named Jack Starks. For some reason an Iraqi child attacks him and he suffers a severe head wound. The next thing we know Jack is back on his feet (hitch-hiking no less) and helping some drunk woman and her young daughter with their car. Before Jack leaves them, he gives the girl his dog tags from the war, and then heads on his way. Now here is where Jack makes a big mistake: he catches a ride from the wrong sort of fellow. As Jack and the driver are cruising along a police officer decides to pull them over. What ensues is stupid, but I won't tell you because I'd rather not ruin it for you. Anyway, Jack gets blamed for what happened but because of amnesia he is found innocent by reason of insanity and is therefore sentenced to some scary-ass mental hospital. Here is where I had my first real problem. Why the f-ck does every mental hospital have to be betrayed as some sort of dungeon, and for that matter why does the head psychiatrist always have to be betrayed as some sick freak? Because I can tell you right now, that not all are like this...anyway...The mean old doctor (Kris Kristofferson) decides that the best course of action would be to shoot Jack up with the medical equivalent of speed, put him a straight jacket, and lock him in a drawer. Yes, I am serious. The doctor locks Jack in a metal drawer, and not just any drawer, but one that is used in the hospital's morgue (this is the kind of thing you would see on CSI). Now why exactly the doctor does this is never quite explained, but hey, who gives a rat's ass? Now this in itself is dumb enough, but somehow, while locked in this little metal prison, Jack manages to travel to 2007. How does Jack do this? Why does Jack do this? Who the f-ck knows! They never tell us. Now if you think these plot holes are enough to sink the ship just wait, it gets better. While in the future Jack meets the girl he gave his dog tags to (yes that girl) and soon finds himself in a whirlwind romance with her. And this is where I began to laugh my ass off. This girl (played by the not so talented Keira Knightley) reveals to Jack that he will die in 1993. So now Jack has to find out how. But here is where I began to think about how incredibly illogical all of this was. Jack travels to the future for no reason, meets this chick that thinks he is dead, and then in about two minutes he suddenly convinces her that he is actually Jack? Although it's the truth wouldn't she need just a little more convincing? And another great thing is that this girl and Jack know each other for about a day and then decide to shag like wild wilder beasts (at least you get some nudity--even thought it is quite senseless). What ensues from here is Jack going into the future then going back into the past and then going back into the future and then Jack going back to the past again, all so he can prevent his own death. I am not going to say what happens in the end because like I said earlier: I do not want to 'ruin' it for you (not that there is much to else to salvage from this shipwreck). All I am going to say is that the ending makes no sense--it really doesn't when one thinks about it (the movie breaks its own rules it was using for time travel--let's just say Jack wasn't able to change anything and then he suddenly was). Even if the viewer makes up a viable ending for this piece of poop (as many have done on IMDb) he/she cannot ignore the gaping holes all throughout the film. Now I do realize that in some films we need to suspend our sense of logic and belief but this one just pushed me too far. For all of the above reasons I give "The Jacket": 1 out of 5 stars.NOTE: 1/5 stars = bad 2/5 stars = OK 3/5 stars = good 4/5 stars = great 5/5 stars = classic</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is there a future in your past?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Haphazard futuristic babble. A Gulf War veteran, Jack Starks(Adrien Brody), survives a bullet through the head. After wrongly accused of murdering a cop, he is placed in an asylum for the criminally insane. Self-serving Dr. Thomas Becker(Kris Kristofferson)starts a battery of experimental drugs on his star patient. Stark is periodically restrained in a "jacket" device and locked away in a morgue body drawer; there his mind journeys back and forth between the future and the past...Stark can actually see his own death. He ponders ways that his life may have been saved and suffers the turmoil of shaping the future of his few meaningful relationships. At times, following this story gets very confusing. Filling out the cast is a diverse ensemble of various degrees of talent: Keira Knightley, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Brad Renfro and Laura Marano. Brody profoundly fills the bill and Miss Knightley is a dream walking. You may need to be strapped down to view THE JACKET from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The creepy "Thriller" that really thought It could !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good cast.Oscar-winner Adrien Brody in the lead; sexy rising it-girl Kiera Knightley; Jennifer Jason Leigh; Daniel Craig (he's British?!); an unrecognizable Brad Renfro-- casting like this may equal a fair to above-average film. Possibly a sleeper.NOT ! This film seemed to have a rough-cut-feel to me, like it was still in production, but being shown to test audiences since the filmmakers knew that something just was not quite right. Well, duh! First of all, the story was so convoluted like a 70s Bond film's that I tuned out halfway. That, and the outlandish acting by Ms. Knightley (whom I was very surprised of) and Kris Kristofferson (who masters the constipated look to a science now) helped me form a quick opinion about this movie. Brody probably looked at the script, laughed, and then saw the paycheck they were offering him. That's the only thing I could come up with to why he did this flick. Daniel Craig really stole the show because it really seemed like he was enjoying this, whereas Jennifer Jason Leigh delivered her usual cardboard performance looking like she was in pain from oral surgery the week before. Brad Renfro's career has been reduced to doing films like these, so it was no wonder he had about 2 minutes of screen time.The theatrical trailer once again showed all of the film's good parts (something that ALL filmmakers do these days), and I bought it since I had no idea what it was about. It captured my interest until shortly after the opening credits were over. Or was it when Kiera spoke? I think she really lobbied for this film, although she knew in her deep down that her American accent was yet to be attempted, let alone vocalized. And the sex scene (whatever you call it) between her and Brody was about as sexy as watching a rape. And in hindsight, it WAS rape since he saw this same girl at 8 years old.It was just a bad film that tried to extract stolen elements from other films that were a helluva lot better from this one like "Memento", and even borrowed from bombs like "Gothika". The director could not convey the message he was trying to deliver, or it was just sloppy writing on his account. Either way, it sucked.</fullReview>

If CONSTANTLY chewing your fingers and biting your glass or having constant facial spasms instead of expressions is what a drunk, hard-boiled young woman is supposed to be, then throw her the Oscar.The director was very pedestrian with his style (except for the beginning and a couple of other cool shots). This is a good story idea! Go nuts! What, did Keira eat your balls by accident, dude? If you want to see a movie like this, but done WAY better, I HIGHLY recommend "Jacob's Ladder." Unfortunately, this is still my favourite movie this year. I'm waiting on bated breath for "Sin City."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer for this film, I thought it was going to be psychologically intense. It was for about 10 minutes, then it goes into "Somewhere in Time" territory. This film could have said something about what we do to soldiers, what we do in war, but it becomes like a Hallmark card at the end, which I didn't buy in the slightest. I won't give anything away, but people don't change like that. Especially not under those circumstances.And one more thing, Keira Knightley may be pretty but she cannot act. I actually found her performance during one of the scenes intensely distracting. (Enough of the lip pulling and glass gobbing Lolita!)Adrien Brody is a fine actor. And even though I don't usually like Daniel Craig, he's about the only reason to sit through this dross. What a disappointment!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the 5th worst movie I have ever seen behind Lady in the Water, Swimfan, Wolf Creek, and the remake of Funny Games. The movie is disjointed and jarring but not in a good way. It is built up like there is something you are supposed to figure out or try to understand about what is going on, but the story is actually far less complex than that. Sound design is god awful. It goes back and forth between Adrien Brody, one of the least inspiring actors of all time, sobbing and whispering sweet nothings to himself and blaring loud cut scenes to what he experiences while in "The Jacket." Think Requiem for a Dream drug use montage... but awful, and very VERY VERY loud.I did not rate it a 1 because the only way a film can get that rating from me is if I literally have to turn the movie off without finishing it. I was able to sit through this entire movie, though I didn't enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some films are just too taxing and confusing to bother with, and this piece of pretentious twaddle certainly falls into that category. I don't think I'm dumb, but I can't for the life of me figure out what is supposed to be going on here - except somebody with influence managed to persuade a talented cast to perform what presumably purports to be a deep and meaningful tale. Poppycock. It's self-serving and pointless.On the plus side, Keira Knightley acts well, looks gorgeous and is even sexier with an American accent - one that she pulls off quite well, unlike Craig who resorts to what most Brits do - a cross between an Italian New Yorker and an Alabama red-neck.If you want to think you're deep, artistic and clever, by all means watch it and discuss at will. I on the other hand, have a life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an absolute mess this plot line is. There is no way someone with a common sense could tie up all these loose ends and see this story as even a half-logical whole. I mean: first of all: guy is locked into a morg's drawr. Turn out (without any explanation), that this drawr functions as a time capsule and send a man into a 14 years later, always to the same place at same time. How does he exactly appears and disappears from one to another dimension, remains unknown. Everybody else around him are taking this as a normal thing however. In a newer dimension he meets the girl he breefly met in previous - falls instantly in love (and to bed) with her. Then he keeps manipulating doctors to get into the drawr again and again - to save his the mystery of his death and - all of a sudden - takes the faith of a girls junkie mother so personally, that changing her destiny becomes his main goal. Actually... I won't bother to continue, cause the further I'd go, the less sense it'd made.To sum things up - writers and director created such a mess, that a viewer can only follow the simplest events - like founding someone, got her believe in something, go back to somewhere etc. - without being able to come even close to fully understand, what's the mystery is all about. And not understanding a big picture - a viewer can focus on simple plot line as love, changing a little bit of destiny, then clever getaway and happy ending. Lame. If someone wants to prove me wrong - please give me a clear and full overview of the logic of happenings of this movies plot line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adrien Brody is perfectly cast as the amiable Sad Sack of WW-II fame. And Kris Kristopherson's face, that eye peering out of a chaos of wrinkles as he bumbles through a pale version of Dr. Mengele, is just too much. Poor Kris! He was such a towering figure of a man in his youth. Oh, well, at least he had a few days work.But weep for poor Jack! Mortally wounded in the Gulf war and then snatched back from death by the mere blink of an eye. Then, mind-blasted, he wanders from crisis to coincidence, not unlike Candy, only Candy had fun. I think -- it was so long ago, all I remember is "Give me your hump!" as she balls a hunchback. Ah, Candy, they don't make pictures like that any more.Convicted of a murder he didn't commit and can't remember, our Jack is sentenced to a weird lunatic asylum that would put the Cuckoo's Nest house of horrors to shame. For daring to proclaim his innocence to Kristopherson's dictatorial psychiatrist, he is trussed up in a strait jacket tighter than a Christmas goose and thrust into a morgue drawer, left to reflect on his plight in Stygian darkness. And again and again, every time he crosses Kris. Every turning point, it seems, is a shot of Jack in the Jacket, showing nothing but his pleading doggy eyes. Oh, the horror, the horror! But he does have a few moments of true love. As if that could redeem his suffering.I don't think I liked this picture, although it did hold my attention.Join the Howard Beale Memorial Society.

		<shortDescription>Did He Really Die?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see this movie as having two distinct interpretations. In the first, most literal, Jack dies in Iraq after acts about which he feels unfathomable guilt. He, who perceives himself as the guilty party, is killed by an innocent, only to find himself in a situation in which he is innocent, but regarded as guilty. His experiences after seem roughly akin to Purgatory, a time during which he is able to come to terms with his guilt and realize that he is a good man (he sees things turning out wrong and wants only to make them right). This brings him to what some cultures refer to as "the second death", during which an earthbound spirit at last makes its way into the afterlife. Which it seems may well be a happy one....we are left to decide for ourselves.Jack also could be using "death" as a metaphor for loss of memory/identity. It happens the first time during the Gulf War, the second when he takes another bullet to the head from a policeman shot by a man who has given him a ride (this scene is so brief one could miss the critical moment), and the last (just when the movie has us expecting him to meet up with a violent and sinister end) when he slips on ice and suffers yet another head injury. The "future world" of 2007 may merely be the point from which he looks back on the disjointed fragments of his memory, trying with little luck to make sense of them.If this film has flaws, they lie not in the non-linear story structure but in the nest of loose ends the filmmakers leave, perhaps in a deliberate attempt at ambiguity, perhaps out of carelessness. For example: how could there be no evidence to support the existence of the man who actually shot the policeman? No tire tracks? The officer didn't radio in the license plate on the truck while making the stop, as is routine? And the note delivered in 1993 with information Jack has learned only in 2007--did he actually do so? Or is he merely more comfortable believing he did? Jack Starks knows. Those of us in the real world can only guess, and wonder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Jacket' opens with Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) explaining that the first time he died he was 27 years old. Jack was shot in the head while serving in the Gulf War and mistakenly tagged before doctors realized he was in fact critical, not dead. Months later (the year is 1991) Jack is hitchhiking in Vermont when he comes across a broken down pick-up truck belonging to a drunken mother named Jean (Kelly Lynch) and her young daughter, Jackie who he gives his dog-tags to as a gift After helping the pair Jack then goes on his way, accepting a lift from a man in a car. Flash forward with some swish camera tricks, and Jack is being tried in a small-town court for the murder of a police officer, and found guilty but legally insane due to the mental scarring received at war. These flash-backs reveal however, though Jack is unable to piece together the truth from his fragmented and disturbed mind, that he was not the killer but the man who offered him a lift. But now Jack finds himself in a mental intuition under the care of Dr. Thomas Becker (Kris Kristofferson) who has some fairly dated and suspicious methods for treating his patients; Injecting them with drugs, strapping them into a jacket and shoving them in a morgue-like 'drawer' for some solitary confinement in which they are supposed to be unconscious. Jack however, is fully conscious during these 'treatments' as he travels into the future, to the year 2007. Here he coincidently meets the grown Jackie (Keira Knightley), the same girl who he helped on the side of the road. After telling her his name is Jack Starks, the frightened Jackie tells him that's impossible, since Jack Starks was found dead at the side of a road with a blow to his head, and according to Jackie, Jack's death is supposed to occur in a few days time. Now it's a race against the clock for Jack to figure out the way he is supposed to die, so he can try and prevent it; but to do that, he has to keep going back into the jacket and the 'drawer'. Dealing with time-travel in the same sort of way as "The Butterfly effect" did, the idea that something triggers the journey, and we can change ours or other people's fates, makes for a very interesting film. "The Jacket" does it better than "Butterfly effect" though, as Brody and Knightley give impressive performances with a dark and intense storyline that doesn't always provide edge-of-your seat action/drama, but is very thought-provoking. Director John Maybury has made a very artistic film. I heard that he really experimented, doing things like putting moth's wings over the camera to give the shots a really different, creepy look. And it works. The flashback sequences are beautiful and exhilarating and the overall murky, washed-out look of the film sets the tone perfectly. Adrien Brody is fine in the film. He isn't stand-out and I'm pretty sure that there was some actor out there who would have been better suited for the part; but Brody is fine, just not great. Knightley however, is. The accent is beautiful, her character is hectic and damaged and what's really great is that her performance is different from anything else she has ever delivered, very original. 'The Jacket' was advertised as an action/thriller with maybe a hint of horror. Be warned, its not. It's more a psychological drama which asks some fairly 'out-there' questions. That's not to say it's not a good film, it just had very warped advertising. Overall, I'd say a 7/10. It crawls along a bit and interest may wane, but stick with it to the end, it is surprisingly enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mixed Bag of Stories Glued Together by Brody's Galvanizing Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE JACKET is a tough film to categorize much less to get your mind around. It is as though writers Tom Bleeker and Marc Rocco had a wealth of thoughts for a story that includes near-death experiences, mind manipulation, time travel, and messianic ideals and tried to weld them all together in a script for John Maybury to manipulate and direct. The result is a weird mishmash of a film that has some terrific moments sparkling in the meandering mess of a plot. The film would be a loss were it not for the inestimable talents of Adrien Brody who somehow makes it all fit together! Jack Starks (Brody) is first seen in 1991 in the Gulf War where he approaches a small boy who shoots him in the head. Mistakenly taken for dead, Starks shows a bit of life in the triage facility and is shipped back to Vermont to recover. After release from the hospital Starks is walking the roads in the snow, befriends a child Jackie (Laura Marano) who stands by her stalled car while her mother Jean (Kelly Preston) sits on the roadside vomiting from wither pill or alcohol abuse. Starks gets the car started, tends to Jean who reacts violently and tells him to get out. Starks continues to hitchhike, is picked up by a stranger (Brad Renfro) and when the car is stopped by a highway patrol, the stranger kills the policeman and Starks ends up being arrested for the crime.In court he is sent to a mental hospital for the criminally insane, falls into the hands of a strange Dr. Becker (Kris Kristofferson) who attempts mind control experiments on him, placing him in a straight jacket then sliding him into a morgue slot for unconscionable isolation. The attempts to alter Starks 'perverse sense of violence' result in hours of isolation when flashbacks occur; these flashbacks ultimately result in flash forwards. Without meaningful editing we see Starks unchanged in the year 2007 where he encounters the mature Jackie (Keira Knightley), a drunk whose mother Jean is dead from burning from falling asleep with a lighted cigarette. With some manipulation Starks gradually convinces Jackie he is the one who saved her in 1993 and the two try to figure out (along with us, the viewers!) just what happened.At this point we have few clues as to the difference between 1993 and 2007 except those provided by the good Dr. Lorenson (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and by some input from one of the more talkative patients in the mental hospital - Rudy Mackenzie (Daniel Craig). The tale becomes more intricately twisted until at last we see the point of all the threads tie together as Starks is able to share his futuristic visions with Jackie in order to prevent occurrences less than desirable.If you can follow that synopsis (probably just one version as seen by one viewer!) then you have an idea how much you have to work to make this film come together. Why there are so many big name stars (Leigh, Craig, Kristofferson, Renfro, Lynch, etc) in throwaway cameos is puzzling. But even with heavy handed special effects, wild camera work, and insecure direction, Adrien Brody makes the film worth watching. He continues to take on roles that are challenging and on the edge - and he does them very well! An interesting diversion of a film for those fans of Brody who also have adequate patience.

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Jacket</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the trailer alone, The Jacket looks like a clone of Ashton Kutcher's The Butterfly Effect, with the protagonist able to transport himself through time in the hope of changing his past/present/future, only that the premise and effect is different - the "jacket" refers to a mental patient's straitjacket.However, Jack Starks (Adrian Brody) is not criminally insane. Sure, he may have died once in Desert Storm, and miraculously survived, but circumstances a year later back home in a horrific homicide condemned him into an asylum.The out of body experience in this film is never explained, no whys, no hows - it seems that it's due to the effect of a cocktail of drugs administered, together with the unorthodox and experimental practice of confining the patient in the morgue's dead-body closet (the claustrophobic effect sort of reminded me of Beatrix's in Kill Bill Vol 2, where she was buried alive in a coffin).So Jack suddenly finds himself 15 years ahead in the year 2007, where he chances upon Kiera Knightley's Jackie Price, whom he once helped on that faithful day of the homicide (again, how he came to meet her is never explained - it just happens). After gaining her trust as a time-traveller / dead man "resurrected", she helps him in a journey to discover the events that led to his apparent death in the asylum, and at the same time falling in love with her good Samaritan, while he flits in and out of future time. Also, it seems he can only travel between the two time periods, and nothing beyond either, beyond his control.As with all time-travelling films, there is always the paradox which one should never ever ponder (it's the huge plot holes exposed if you do) - what you know in the future, when applied in the present, surely will change the way the future is presented the next time you visit it, no? I think only the Back To The Future trilogy dealt with this paradox in a convincing manner, and shown on screen as well.The 2 leads give convincing performances, as do the supporting cast of familiar faces like Jennifer Jason Leigh and Kris Kristofferson as doctors in the asylum. My only gripe in the local screening was the unwelcome abrupt interruption (read: poor censor workmanship) of the love scene between Brody and Knightley.The ending, like The Butterfly Effect, is your typical Hollywood cop-out ending, but something which I feel the audience would expect as they secretly root for the protagonist to emerge victorious. But again, given the many unexplained plot devices and an ending which still leaves you with ONE major question (probably up to your discretion), this is a film that could have been a time-travel classic, but turned into one of mediocrity.</fullReview>

Brody's acting was solid and believable. This role was pure gold for Knightley. It completely broke the mold of the characters she normally plays and allowed her to explore her depth as an actress. Her consistent American accent was very pleasing, as changing accents is a downfall for many actors and actresses and can be really distracting. I thought they had dubbed her voice when I first heard it.The ending, which I won't give away, was very uplifting after a relatively dark and somber film.

		<fullReview>This not-so-distant cousin to THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT and JACOB'S LADDER finds Gulf War veteran Adrien Brody serving as the unwilling subject of a horrible medical experiment wherein he is injected with an anti-psychotropic drug, straitjacketed and placed in a morgue drawer, for hours at a time. He begins to time-trip, and our story thus unfolds. To say more would be to give everything away. Brody is terrific as a sane man being driven insane, and Keira Knightley, Mackenzie Phillips, Kris Kristofferson, Kelly Lynch and Jennifer Jason Leigh lend able support as people whose lives are inextricably (or is that inexorably?) linked with his. The film probably cost a buck and a half to make, and it was released as a Warner Independent Picture. Both of these factors actually play in its favor, as it has the look and feel of an indie project, even if the ending is straight outta Hollywood. Things get pretty intense, although any astute film fan should be able to figure out where it's headed by the second half. Supposedly suggested by a Jack London story, about mental patients being injured and hallucinating after being tied too tightly in their straitjackets. If nothing else, it sure beats THE VILLAGE, Brody's previous outing in which he played a genuinely insane guy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Cast, Hobbled by Poor Script.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nice cast, all of whom have done interesting work elsewhere. It's good to see Kris Kristofferson still working after all these years. He's stretched his skills to encompass heavies and here, darkly bearded and wrinkled, he fits the role of the Medical Director, half sadistic, half bedside manner. Jennifer Jason Leigh is good as well in a low-key part as a humanistic psychiatrist. Adrian Brody has played characters so obnoxious ("Oxygen") that my appreciation of him as an actor was tainted, but he's since redeemed himself in my unimpeachable opinion. He keeps his performance under restraint here, so to speak, and manages to do a convincing if highly improbably love scene with Keira Knightley. And this despite his having a nose that, like Cyrano's, marches on before him by a quarter of a mile.But who put this mish mash together? Brody, a Gulf War vet, is framed for a cop killing and sent to a hospital for the criminally insane. Like Randall P. McMurphy before him, he upsets the routine and is tortured for it. He's strapped down on something resembling a morgue slab, shot full of dope, and slid into a closed drawer where he hallucinates to beat the band. Something about time travel enters the picture. It's all confusing and not very believable.I'll give one instance of the improbable. Brody is shabbily dressed, an escapee from a funny farm, bearded, disheveled, standing by a roadside telephone on Christmas eve. The sultry Keira Knighley happens to be a waitress at the nearby diner and, seeing this dangerous-looking stranger, offers him a ride. "Where are you going?" she asks. "I don't know," he replies distractedly. Let me ask you, the experienced driver who knows the lay of the land and has seen slasher movies involving deranged hitch-hikers -- what would YOU do at that point? What SHE does is take him to her home, invite him to fix something to eat while she bathes, and puts him up on her couch for the night. All that's missing is the sign over her front door: "Welcome Serial Murderers." The direction is no help in understanding this olla podrida of unrelated episodes. While on the morgue slab the camera descends into Brody's iris and this is an excuse for multiple flashbacks in high contrast and black and white, only seconds long, and empty of meaning.I didn't bother watching the end. Maybe the creature lifts itself out of the muck and wobbles on to a satisfying conclusion. Isn't it pretty to think so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well... I watched this film and was deeply disheartned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was strung out longer than a runner bean. VERY Tru Calling and also very dull in places the title is a misguided concept it is about the drugs or the mental state when placed in a "morgue hole" the industry's infatuation with 2 hour films meant a lot was said at the beginning to pass time to that golden 2 hour PLUS if that wasn't a lick in the b**s a lot is left unresolved DID he kill the cop DID he die DID was a big question I asked my partner a lot. Danial Craig makes a brief appearance and even then with a dreadful USA slur. Not well cast. I wish this film had more questions answered and less questions made to be asked that are left unanswered. Now, don't get me wrong I know only to well about making a film asking you yes YOU to ask yourself some questions but this time in this film they really did need answering. In places it was very tender but that was really just messed up by the rubbish in between. I was very disappointed, you see I love time travel at any pace but WITH a walking frame too??? was one step too slow if you will pardon the pun</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Jacket is a psychological thriller with fairly interesting but totally unoriginal ideas (borrowed from Jacob's ladder, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Memento) and poor ways of executing them. Gulf War veteran Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) suffers from amnesia and when he is wrongfully charged with murder, he is placed in a mental asylum for the criminally insane. He gets electrical shock therapy and a series of other unorthodox treatments that really mess him up. Now, the problems that The Jacket has mainly bottles down to that it takes itself too seriously by having its cast over-emote to get us to understand. At the same time that it tries to be serious in this way, it has an altogether implausible storyline featuring complexities of time travel and hallucinating. But also developments in the characters that are completely unrealistic when taking their history into account. For example, why would a jaded, alcoholic woman (Keira Knightley) who has trusted no one her whole life suddenly BLINDLY believe Brody's mentally insane character and decide to help him when he rants about time travel? I don't think so. It ends up a frenetic, disjointed babble and there are far too many unresolved issues touched on.What was most disturbing about this film was not the mental state of Jack Starks as it would have us believe, but the terrifyingly husky sound that escaped through Keira Knightley's lips. In The Jacket she's worked with a voice-coach to get an American accent and the result is terrible. It got to the point when it was actually really distracting. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poor mans Jacob's Ladder (one of the 10 best movies I have ever seen) but a lot more pleasant to watch as it is basically life affirming. You'll have to watch with a blind eye to obvious plot flaws...such as the the highly unorthodox treatment given the patient. And even if the premise is a familiar one...this is well done and beautifully filmed with a big surprise talent coming from Kierra Knightly...did not think she had it in her. Arain Brody is his usual intense and spiritual self...a good choice for this particular character. However, I fear he is being type cast which is a waste of his abilities.As I remember...Jacob's Ladder was the first time I experienced a movie that portrayed psychosis in a way that I could identify with what it must be like for the person suffering from it....schizophrenia in particular. I have always wanted to watch it again to see if it has held up over time but it was such a painful experience...don't know when I can muster up the courage to re-watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not quite sure how to describe "The Jacket". Adrien Brody plays Gulf War vet Jack Starks, who suffers from amnesia. This proves especially strange for him when he gets arrested for murder. His only choice is to try to see into the future when they put him in a restraint case known as the "jacket". Young Jackie Price (Keira Knightley) may be the missing piece to the puzzle that is his future.This wasn't any kind of great movie, but it was fairly interesting. It certainly does not give one a positive view of America's mental health facilities. I would advise you to avoid this movie if you have a weak stomach.</fullReview>

He then goes through a series of events which lead to a climax not many could predict. If you cant save your own life, save another's.It wouldn't have been the same without Adrien Brody (The Pianist) and Keira Knightley (Pirates of the Caribbean). If there was a rating from 1-10, i would give it an 11 or higher. It's originality is one of the qualities which i admire most. Nowadays there are plenty re-peat movies that are like all the others.If you want to go to the movies - sit back and let Adrien Brody take you through the movie this is the perfect film for you to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Maybury's film "The Jacket" is about Jack Starks (Brody), a Gulf War veteran who, after being shot in the head during combat in 1992 miraculously survives, but is riddled with amnesia as a result. After he is discharged, he returns to the States and is walking down a mostly deserted road when he comes upon a little girl and her mother whose truck has broken down. When he discovers that the mother is completely high on drugs, he helps calm the little girl and gets their car working again. Further down the road, he is picked up by a young man who ends up killing a police officer after they are pulled over, but not before the officer shoots back, hitting Starks; a convenient turn of events for the guy since he eventually frames Starks for the murder. Because he cannot remember anything about the events, the damages he sustained during the war deemed to be the reason, so he is sent to a mental institution and comes under the care of Dr. Becker (Kristofferson) who uses a highly dangerous method of treatment wherein he puts Starks in a straight jacket and closes him up in a drawer for hours, which causes him to remember various events. At first, this is received as a form of torture, but eventually Starks is able to use it to his advantage when he discovers he can use his mind to travel into the future. When he first does this, he ends up befriending Jackie (Knightley) who turns out to be the little girl at the side of the road, and since it is now 15 years in the future and he looks exactly the same as when she was 9, it's a hard sell for him to make her believe that he is really Jack Starks, particularly since Jack Starks died in 1993. Since Jackie's mother died years before, her life has gone into a downward spiral, culminating in alcoholism and a pretty miserable existence. Eventually, Starks has to find ways to make Dr. Becker put him into the jacket so that he can travel through time in order to save himself and redeem Jackie's life."The Jacket" has an incredibly detailed and somewhat confusing storyline (some parts of which I omitted based on their necessity and some which I'm sure I just plain forgot about) that just kind of left me with a feeling of ambivalence. While in the film I found it to be confusing, but most of the loose ends managed to get cleared up so I didn't take issue with that too much. Although the person I saw it with, who is infinitely more into science fiction themes than I am made the point that time travel films are hard to swallow because there are SO many ways the script can fail, and I think that if one were to examine "The Jacket" pretty thoroughly, (in terms of the time travel theme) there would be a lot missing. I didn't dislike the film, but I didn't seriously dig it either. Part of the problem was the marketing of the film; I didn't know a lot about it (something I try to do so that there are as few preconceptions as possible) but from the trailer that I saw, it seemed it was going to be a little scary, but most definitely a thriller. "The Jacket" is certainly psychological, but I would not call consider it to be a thriller; it's more of a highly stylized drama piece with some cool jump cuts.There were several characters in the film (Jackie's mom, played by Kelly Lynch, Dr. Lorenson, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh) that really did nothing to further the story. As a matter of fact, Dr. Lorenson's story arc could have been more integral and just fell flat. I had a strong reaction to the two main performances in the film, however. Adrien Brody was as good as he always is. Considering there is not really a definable character study for Jack Starks, he really took this role and made it his own. I have now seen him in five films and every one of his roles has been stunningly good. He garnered a good deal of sympathy with this character, against the odds of a script (and as a whole, film) that was a challenging one. Unfortunately, I had the exact opposite reaction to Keira Knightley's performance. Understandably, her character is an alcoholic and her life has not been an easy one, but the body posturing, hair in the face and lip-tugging, countered with the fact that she basically spit out her lines in a bad American accent like a machine gun was just too much for me. I'm not entirely certain, but I'm pretty sure that I wasn't supposed to involuntarily burst out laughing during one of her "dramatic" episodes, but unfortunately I did, and it really did a lot to mar my opinion of the film.I literally walked out of "The Jacket" saying "Meh. It was okay", and no amount of soul searching or reflection have been able to bolster that review. It's not that I wouldn't recommend it - I think it's worth watching - but I would wait until it was either free or on rental. If you're going by the marketing, don't believe that it is a thriller or a horror film because it's not. It is what it is ? an unusual drama with a great performance by Brody, a performance that bumped the film from a straight middle-of-the-road rating of 5 to a 6/10.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A supernatural psychological with cleverness. It is just a story &amp; not social commentary. It is hard to say what this movie means. I think Adrien Brody's character was simply a character to whom strange events happened.A clever and interesting movie about a soldier who is accused of crimes and sent to an insane asylum. It is unclear if he is sane or crazy. He receives a drug treatment during which he is straitjacketed and put in a morgue drawer. He has visions of the future in the drawer, and perhaps becomes a ghost. He meets a now-grown child that was involved in the crime, and together they try to figure out the movie's reality.A clever and engaging movie. It is a psychological thriller with a supernatural twist. The performances and photography are solid. Kris Kristofferson's performance was good. Adrien Brody had some good moments, but not outstanding.Lots of false color pictures of his eyes. I liked the green night-vision opening.It is wrong to nitpick a movie like this for believability, but I kept thinking real girls don't trust strange men this much because their afraid of sexual assault. He also shouldn't have been touching the young Jacky so much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't make sense at first, but the second time around this is a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of Adrien Brody, he's a fantastic actor. But I was a little concerned with this movie because it seemed like in the trailer, this movie wouldn't do him justice. One of my friends said that this was a good movie though and to give it a chance. So, I let my guard down and watched "The Jacket" and enjoyed it.The first time I watched this, I didn't catch a lot of things. I think you have to watch it a second time because things kind of go by quickly. The acting: we have Adrien, Keira, and Kris. All great actors of our time and they were very believable in this film. I think I have to give credit to Keira, she has come quit a long way since "Bend it like Buckham". Her and Adrien are great together and you could see the chemistry. Adrien, what a great job in the drawer. The feeling of claustrophobia, darkness, and death is very frightening. He was sobbing, screaming, and breathing heavily. He was so terrific, I don't' know how he does it. He has an amazing gift.The whole movie in general is a trip. Like I said, the second time it makes more sense. The only thing I didn't like about it was the ending. It made you have to decide what happened afterwards. I normally don't mind that, but in this film, I did. But you have to see it for yourself.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wont claim to have understood it completely but it was still a good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adrien Brody has done a lot of good work in his career, there is no denying that. This is not his best work, nor Keira Knightley's, nor Jennifer-Jason Leigh's but it still had several good elements.First of all, to enjoy this film you can't ask questions like "Why has nobody gotten Kris Kristofferson arrested for putting this guy in a box?" Because you will never get a particularly good answer. As with most films involving people supposedly shifting back and forth through time you have to abandon your sense of reality.As for dialog, I think there were a few lines in there that they put in so they could make the trailer sound good. In the trailer for this the have the classic "don't act like I don't know whats real line" that is absolutely essential in any film with a mental patient protagonist. The line sounded great in the trailer but it seemed completely unmotivated in the context of the actual story. This annoyed me a little bit but there was still some very good dialog in the film.Again, Adrian Brody is a good actor and he did a fine job with this film, certainly nothing special, but he performance fit. Keira Knightley did a good job of getting rid of the accent, but I still don't think she felt comfortable with it, she slurred her speech a little and much many of her lines didn't seem like they were delivered naturally. Still, her character development was much better in this film than in "King Arthur", and I did feel that she understood what was going on in the characters head.The story was pretty interesting, yet it did defy logic in places where it shouldn't have. As I said earlier, film like this are not supposed to be logical or realistic. They are meant to confuse the heck out of you and make you feel for the character's. Overall, this task was accomplished. These were characters that you could feel for even though they are in a predicament that we can never truly understand, that is the dilemma that most filmmakers face with a project like this. How do we make people understand what this guys going through when no body in the history of the world has ever experienced something like this? The answer is you don't make it a film about a guy shifting in time and finding out about his own death and trying to change the future. Instead they made it a film about confusion, which is some thing that we have all felt and something that we can all understand.It was filmed very well too. They obviously used a fast film because there was a little bit of film grain that was visible but it gave a gritty feel to the film that really worked for me. There was also a good use of dramatic lighting, and it was lit so brightly that you really got a feel for setting in which this film takes place.I would suggest seeing this, but again, allow yourself to overlook the parts that are never fully explained or are completely illogical and you will have a good experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Slaughterhouse 5" meets "Altered States" meet "Jacob's Ladder" meets "The Terminator" meets "Somewhere in Time" -- and it almost works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had the director of this well-made science-fantasy thriller been half as concerned with his characters as psychedelic razzle-dazzle, this picture might have stayed in the theaters longer than two weeks. As it is, one can appreciate the individual elements and talent that went into it -- and there is considerable talent on display here. And though it misses the mark of being a great film, or a film that really connects with audiences, I enjoyed much of it, and especially appreciated the naturalistic performances of Adrien Brody and Keira Knightley.The problems, though -- unfortunately -- are many. Originally written five years ago as sort of a Jacob's Ladder-inspired version of a Jack London novel, where a prisoner escapes, psychologically, from solitary confinement through self- induced hallucinations, the script was bogged down by two many different story threads. The protagonist in early versions was rooted in the 1960s. The war was Vietnam, the opening scene was inspired by the My Lai massacre, and the hero, by the film's end, attempted to thwart Martin Luther King's assassination!Though many of the political and other non-essential elements were wisely removed (often scripts try to do too much for their own good), some facets that helped the story make sense were left by the wayside. This, of course, is what often happens in the rewriting process when producers or writers get too close to a project -- they forget about of the basic storytelling elements and get caught up instead in the minutiae of the dialogue, scenes and locations.Among the basic components dropped from the original script in the seven-year journey to getting this picture to the screen were a reasonable explanation of what the jacket is, where the "jacket" came from, and what the original intention of the isolation experiments were in the first place. We are also missing any sort of dramatic buildup as to the entire "jacket" experience. Yes, these topics are touched on -- but not in the way the first draft screenplay dealt with them. In the original script, there was talk and anticipation about "the jacket" -- fearful talk among the inmates of the asylum. Just what is it? Straightjacket? Torture device? In the final film, everything happens so fast and matter-of-factly that much of the drama is lost. We almost forget that these are morgue drawers that people are being put into. We have no real fear of Dr. Becker's bizarre procedure. He just shows up, puts Brody in the jacket, and boom! He's in the drawer. Moving on, next scene! Never mind that it makes little or no sense -- other than a wacko doctor torturing his patients.And speaking of making no sense, no real reason is ever given for Brody experiencing the alternate realities or traveling through time. Compare this with "Somewhere in Time" or "Back to the Future" or "The Time Machine" --time travel films that actually make a lot of sense! In "Somewhere in Time," Christopher Reeve goes into the past because he wills himself back. "Back to the Future" and "The Time Machine" involve devices created for time traveling. Sure, there's something to be said for a "La Jetee" or a "12 Monkeys," where there are a lot of questions. "La Jetee" functions more as a mood piece than anything else -- and "The Jacket" seems inspired by it. And like "Jacob's Ladder," "The Jacket" also contains all kinds of symbolism and hinted-at meanings and tons of metaphysical connections one can make, if one so wishes. The asylum as Hell? Snow-covered countryside as Heaven? Sure, there are a lot of interesting and thought-provoking touches.But there's also confusion -- and such an absence of humanity that any type of happy ending that's tacked on (and this film ideally should have gone the "Brazil" route in terms of the conclusion) just doesn't make an impact. Keira Knightley, while good, has about as much warmth as Helena Bonham-Carter in "Fight Club," while Adrien Brody specializes in playing tortured souls, not romantic leads trying to help out women in distress while engaging in tragic romances. Adrien should definitely not have been floating in the ocean doling out words of wisdom to Kate before dropping forever into the sea! Leo was the one for that job -- and the billion dollars in revenue proves it. Same thing here. This film could have used a little of Leo's charm. A little something. A little charm. A little humor. A little WARMTH, for crying out loud!Considering the subject matter, a gay, British music video director might not have been the best man for the job here. Still, he does a great job with the extreme closeups of Adrien's eyes, and the CGI and sound effects teams did a hell of job with the psychedelic transitions into the future (though the zooms into the pupils of the eye revealing the scene he's about to go into could have been a bit more clear, and a little less flashy -- as it is, we barely register what the hell is going on. Anyone even pick up on that?)As far as the time travel paradoxes, this territory has been well-covered in films like "Back to the Future" and apparently "The Butterfly Effect," which I haven't seen. Writers like Ray Bradbury and Phillip Dick and David Gerrold, of course, have been mining this territory for years -- so this part of the film, for me, is nothing really new. Speaking of Bradbury, it'll be interesting to see if "A Sound of Thunder" makes an impression in the time travel genre. It was always one of the definitive short stories on the subject, in my opinion. Hopefully the balance between sci-fi and humanity will be a little better than "The Jacket." Sometimes a little heart can go a long way! Just ask the King of the World.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murky drama never succeeds at being compelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We have seen time travel films before and they usually succeed with either the angle of the story (Jacob's Ladder) or the chemistry of it's actors (Time After Time) and one of those factors would have benefited this film greatly because this effort definitely lacks that something special. Story takes place in the early 1990's where we see Gulf vet Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) who after being injured in battle starts to suffer from amnesia and blackouts. After the murder of a highway patrolman (which he doesn't remember) Jack is sent indefinitely to an asylum where Dr. Thomas Becker (Kris Kristofferson) injects him with psychotropic drugs and shoves him into a drawer in the morgue.*****SPOILER ALERT***** While being stuck in a drawer Jack finds himself teleported to 2007 where he finds Jackie Price (Keira Knightley) whom he knew when she was a child. Jackie is a hard drinking and heavy smoking waitress who still feels anger about her life and how her mother Jean (Kelly Lynch) died years earlier. In between the time traveling experiences Jack convinces Jackie about who he is and they try and figure out the circumstances about his death by visiting the doctors who treated (or mistreated) him during his stay at the hospital.This is directed by John Maybury who's a good and solid filmmaker but here he seems to be at the mercy of a script that just doesn't have anything special to offer. One of the real head scratchers is the Dr. Becker character played by Kristofferson who never really explains his methods for shoving patients in morgue drawers for long periods of time. Experimentation in hospitals is one thing but Brody's character is so mistreated that it's a miracle one of the hypodermic needles didn't break off in his arm because it's shoved into him with such brutality. Jennifer Jason Leigh is one of the best actresses in the world but she's woefully underused here and is mostly regulated to asking Brody how he feels today. Brody is an exceptional actor who has his brooding persona down pact but with the exception of one scene his character needed to exude more urgency considering that he spends the majority of the film trying to convince people of who he is. Many viewers and critics consider Knightley miscast but I was not one of them and instead looked at this role as something that a young actress should do if she wants casting directors to consider her as more versatile. After the lightweight "Bend It Like Beckham" and the commercial "Pirates of the Caribbean" it's obvious that Knightley would like to be taken more seriously as an actress and to help her cause (and ours!) she engages in nudity in a couple of scenes. I didn't hate this film and for the most part the good cast keeps things interesting to watch but it's still a film that fails on just about every angle the story takes and is ultimately unconvincing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't believe all the bad reviews...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the most interesting I've seen recently. There are not many films that can keep me thinking about them this long, trying to figure out what they might mean. There are questions in my head: Did he really see the future? Were they just hallucinations? Was he somehow absorbing information about other people without knowing it?While I ponder these things, let me take a moment on the cast. Adrien Brody was excellent as Jack, and he was totally believable. He went from Gulf War soldier to mental patient, and I hardly ever thought "This is Adrien Brody playing Jack." Rather, he *was* Jack. Keira Knightley was also excellent, and I think that this film demonstrates her acting ability, and her range. She can indeed play a character outside of Elizabeth from Pirates of the Caribbean, or the teenage footballer in Bend It Like Beckham, etc. I could have done without Kris Kristofferson though, and I think that numerous different actors could have filled that role. I would have preferred to see someone like Peter Stormare in the role.If you as the viewer cannot suspend disbelief, then yes, this film will seem confusing and useless to you. However, if you can sit back and let yourself consider it afresh, without letting the questions overwhelm you, then this film will be enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch something, anything, other than this!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't understand why so many people have been singing the praises of this film. As others have pointed out, this film is a none-too-subtle ripoff, primarily of "Jacob's Ladder" (which, in itself, was inspired by "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge") but also of elements of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," "Twelve Monkeys," and probably other classics of the sanity-bending genre that I can't recall at the moment. We were not even five minutes into the film yet when I turned to the friend I was watching it with and said, "Is this going to end up being a 'Jacob's Ladder' remake?" That's how blatant it is. By thirty minutes into it, I was mentally naming the films that each sequence in the film was stolen from whenever there was a scene change. There was even a shot in which we see Adrien Brody's character staring into a coffee cup, and the camera slowly descends toward the surface of the liquid in an exact copy of a similar scene in "Taxi Driver." Now, I'm well aware that stealing (aka "influence") is a hallowed tradition in all fields of art, and being influenced by one's predecessors is not in itself a bad thing. The problem is that this film is not even a tenth as good as any of the films it steals from, and is not even a hundredth as original. The film's intent seems merely to try to give you the same sense of creepiness and dread that you get in its sources, but it completely lacks their depth. "Jacob's Ladder," "Twelve Monkeys" and "Cuckoo's Nest" were great because you delve deeply into the souls and mental confusion of the central characters. All of the characters in "The Jacket" are as interesting as cardboard cutouts and I never came to care about what happened to any of them. The only reason I even gave this film three stars is because of the incredible acting talent (Brody, Jennifer Jason Leigh, etc.) that is wasted in it. How Adrien Brody was able to stomach this after doing "The Pianist," I have no idea. Their talents are worthy of greater productions than this. Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is NOT a thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came out of this movie very disappointed. I was expecting a high tension psychological thriller bolstered by solid if not superb acting. Well, I was 1/4th right. Adrien Brody is convincingly crazy, as well as his friend in the psych ward. Knightly is overacting and so is her mother, whoever the actress is. Anyways, the movie is pretty much a very thin time travel love story. If you have seen butterfly effect or even frequency, you don't need to spend your money here. Now, if you have not seen either of these movies, still, don't see the jacket. There is very little about it that is thrilling or even remotely disturbing. The director has spent too much time on set-up and virtually hands you the ending about 30 minutes in to the film. His style also become gimmicky very quickly. There are many flashbacks and the first time you see them, you might tense up for a second, but then you realize that must of the time getting to the flashback is just a lot of nonsense that pertains to nothing. If you are a huge Adrien Brody fan, if you want to see Kiera Knightley topless (not much to see), or if you are in desperate need of sleep, go plunk down your 10 dollars and wear the jacket.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't waste your money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a poorly executed film that takes itself far too seriously, and breaks the fundamental rule of good film-making - you have to care for the central character, and Jack Starks is not even remotely likable. I didn't know anything about this guy to care what happened to him, and what was revealed about him was a smart ass, cynical jerk. About an hour into the film, I just thought "so what - throw him in the jacket, shut the drawer, leave him there and run the credits so I can go home."The film also makes the huge mistake of relying on what we've seen before - the mental patient who won't cooperate with the asylum, the alcoholic loser played by Keira Knightley who turns her life around because of "love" and suddenly can find a computer and the internet to help "save her man", the misunderstood doctor who's means justifies the end, the side-kick mental patient who is whacky but has a good heart even though he tried to kill his wife, blah, blah, blah.Also, the film takes too many liberties with driving the story forward by forcing characters to act against their own frame of reasoning. Why would a jaded, alcoholic woman suddenly fall for this guy and believe his story, after she had lived a lifetime of trusting no one? Why would the druggie, alcoholic mother read the letter and decide that the message of "stop smoking and save your daughter's life" be believable? This film reminded me of a student thesis with some tricky artsy-fartsy effects thrown in.My impression was that the director had A.D.D. - he tried to address too many issues and couldn't stick to a central theme, leaving the viewer confused and unsatisfied because nothing gets resolved.I saw this at a special screening, and half way through - people started to walk out. I stayed for the end, and found myself wondering, "why didn't I just get up half way through? I really don't care how this ended."The only good point to this film - the titles were fantastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel like it's my fault rating this movie so low, but believe me, I tried. I thought the movie was completely different from what it actually is.It is basically a mix between "The I Inside" and "Awake", a category of films that I dislike. It gets boring, confusing, I was looking forward for it to end, but sadly I didn't reach this mark.There isn't even good acting here to save some points, it's just all a mess that leads the spectator to fall asleep. I also tried to understand the "intriguing" part of this but didn't find. If Jack is insane, if he's lying, if Jackie is lying, who cares? Their lives won't change a bit. Overall: totally not recommended, get away from this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well intentioned mess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would only recommend this film to someone who was bored. It is neither a horror, nor a thriller, nor a science fiction film. It fully falls into that category one might call 'have another go, mate.' The people who inhabit this world are actors, not real people. I have never met anyone who behaves like Keira Knightly's character Jackie Price when stressed. The only time I have is in movies. Actors ought to watch real people and not other actors. Adrien Brody is affable. I did not believe the supposed horror that he was going through. In fact it was slightly laughable, because, like Knightly, one saw he was acting! Everyone in this film is acting. I simply could not suspend my belief. As a time travel tale The Butterfly Effect knocks this out of the ring. As a horror, well, it is not even a distant relation to Alien, and as a thriller, forget it.This film could have been so much better if the director John Maybury had more guts. A childish film for childish people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>time traveling at its worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was a bad movie, and its box office totals certainly reflect that. This film wants us to believe that a doctor in a psych ward drugs his patients and then straps a weird jacket on them and puts them in a morgue drawer for a while. And all this allows the patient to time travel in his mind and apparently in reality. The doctor had no idea this would happen? Also, the film never told what type of results the doctor was expecting by putting a patient in a morgue drawer.While in the drawer, it shows many close ups of Jack's eyes, then starts showing flashes of images. And then some how Jack winds up about 15 years in the future. During his first trip, he meets a girl, Jackie, who he remembers from his past. She doesn't know him. But, she picks up this stranger and lets him stay at her place? Not believable. And then later she sleeps with him?Jack gets Jackie to help him investigate his death from 15 years earlier. He thinks it was foul play. Then there is a side plot of him helping one of the other doctors discover what is wrong with a sick child. Why was that part even in there? It just added to the confusion of the film.FINAL VERDICT: I like films that have a story that makes sense and not so confusing. So, I don't care for this one and don't recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a re-hatch of other sci-fi's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw this movie the other night I had the best intentions of liking it. As the movie went on, however, I soon realized that I had seen all of this not too long ago. The Jacket is simply 12 Monkeys with a slightly different plot. The Jacket even has a mental institution as a focused setting, and in the mental institution a slightly crazy guy helping Brody out for whatever reason.I will say this,though, both Brody and Knightly were excellent in the movie. All the acting was well done, a terrible ending in my opinion, but i haven't seen the alternate ending yet. Where The Jacket fails in originality it is only saved by the acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disjointed thriller makes the most of its broken telling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The style of the telling is all in this very off beat thriller (drama?). The story of a mentally unclear asylum patient who begins to time trip when locked in a morgue drawer is, to say the least, fractured. The telling of the tale is as broken as our hero's memory and its there that the film finds its strength and creepiness. The disjointed nature of the telling keeps us off balance, and if it doesn't drive you running to the exits, will keep you feeling very uneasy afterward. The films flaw is that once you get to the end and are able to restructure the plot into a linear telling the film doesn't seem so special. As with most films told out of order The Jacket doesn't work when put straight. If you can accept the film on its terms its quite good but if you are looking for anything remotely normal stay away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Premiere at Sundance 2005 Film Festival by far!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was fortunate to watch this excellent flick at its last showing where I enjoyed in my opinion an interpretation of those who are good in life are rewarded in miraculous ways, some may call or refer to heaven. What goes around comes around and no matter how difficult it may be now theirs always a better tomorrow in this life or the next. Adrian Brody (the Pianist) is spectacular and truly believable in his search thorough his mind for answers. Kierra Knightly (Pirate of the Caribbean) which I was lucky to meet plays the American stereotype divinely as an angel in his dreams of a better future for those he could help. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone without any hesitation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm no film critic but this is a good film. This isn't a film about war, hospitals, restaurants or any other surface themes per se. Its about making changes in our lives. The ending rather reminded me of Brazil.Everyone seems to be missing the point. I would give this at least an 8. I had no problems following the 'time' events. And its obvious by the ending that the letter to Gina worked and she did something about her situation.This is a thinking persons movie and not meant for a cheap distraction that so many movies fall under.And in the end it is said 'how much time do we have?' Well..........how much time do YOU have?Anyways..........that's all folks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting psychodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Jacket focuses more on a man's internalizations over what's happened to him and his journey to figure out exactly what that is, rather than a huge metastatement about the Gulf War as some people think it is. Jack Starks was sent home from the war because of a shot to the head, but that really ends up being just a tiny piece of the plot. What people really need to focus on is his trying to unravel what happens afterwards and the incredible things he discovers through radical -- and possibly unethical -- treatments. Adrien Brody carries this movie by himself, since Kiera Knightley is solely picking up a paycheck for wearing lots of kohl eyeliner and sitting around open-mouthed. Nice work if you can get it. What makes this film different from most psychological dramas is the fact that the person in the midst of the problem, in this case Jack, readily accepts what's unraveling around him, rather than fight it and spew out long, angsty monologues about the world and his place in it. A very different (and mislabeled) drama, but a good one if you don't mind a little thinking while you watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i remember way back when i saw a commercial for it while going to see another movie, and i thought, wow thats going to be an awesome movie, and since that date (about early December) i have been waiting to see the movie, and i just got back from the movies tonight, and i have to say, i was NOT disappointed. Some people might not have done that in any circumstances thats true -- but that doesn't mean there aren't people who would put others before themselves, and people who think that may be selfish themselves, which is why i was shocked to see that many people found the comment on the movie information page useful. It is a great thrilling movie, which takes you from reality to fantasy through ones mind creating a turning tale of one man trying to save his life, and help others with their own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the "Surprise Film" at the Jameson International Film Festival - shown on February 20th. Only the second showing in the world, after Sundance - so we were told. John Maybury himself was there and held a quick Q&amp;A session after wards.Having never heard of the film before I was quite worried at the start. I thought it was a war film - I know there are many fantastic ones but in general I'm not a fan. I really enjoyed this film. It was a bit "out there" but that's my kind of film. It was a good casting, even if Maybury didn't want either originally. Don't think I could've taken Mark Wahlberg as seriously in the role of Starks.I enjoyed it. I'd recommend it. "One to watch" so to speak. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well if like me your a fan of the wonderful butterfly effect you are going to like this also. In some ways its better as the direction is very good,but in others butterfly effect takes the gong. If you read the forums on here about this film you could spend months trying to decide exactly what happened at the end but i will leave that up to you to decide. Me well i still don't quite know but what i do know is its probably one of the best films i have seen so far this year. !!! Although if you want to be entertained and not have to spend the 1st 30 mins of a film wondering what the hell is happening then skip it LOL</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay what was the thing with the guy who supposedly shot the deputy? At the end they showed him with a green string around his finger, and they showed mckenzie watching jack go into the hospital, and mckenzie was twirling a green string also. Not to be rude, but all of you putting so much time and effort into coming up with theories on this movie should seriously go read a book. the performances were good, but the director and writer were garbage. The premise was interesting, but even if the director was attempting to portray some bizaar redemption story, or an even more bizaar Christ allegory, the whole thing didn't work. It didn't make much sense and it never flowed together into anything coherent. Plus the time travel was dealt with very poorly. Anyways, if anyone can answer my earlier question id appreciate it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rip-off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ladies and gentleman I'd like to announce The Jacket the movie which ripped-off the most number of films single handedly. So far the movies it was "influenced" by goes something like this:Jacob's Ladder - obviously.. 12 Monkeys and the final nail in the coffin...La Jetee.Most of all La Jetee. This movie so shamelessly rips-off La Jetee it is criminal. The only originality is probably The Jacket being shot in colour. Watch The Jacket to learn how you can make a movie by patching up story parts from other BETTER movies. But do not discuss about it. There isn't a DEEPER meaning or a RIDDLE or a PHILOSOPHICAL question in this movie because it is hollow as a Thanksgiving turkey.Watch La Jetee and you'll understand what I mean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE JACKET (2005) ** 1/2 Adrien Brody, Keira Knightley, Kris Kristofferson, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Daniel Craig, Brad Renfro, Kelly Lynch, Laura Marano, Mackenzie Phillips. Odd combo of "Jacob's Ladder" meets "La Jette" and "12 Monkeys" with "Memento" by way of "The Twilight Zone": injured Gulf War vet Brody (the epitome of ' haunted' and does a credible job of treading the waters of the crazed/sane) finds himself sentenced to an asylum for a violent criminal act where he is used as a guinea pig involving psychotropic drugs administered as he's tethered to a straight-jacket and placed in a morgue's drawer where he inexplicably is propelled into the future where he meets up with Knightley (eerily channeling Winona Ryder, I kid you not) who met him in the past and may provide some clues to his possible future. A serious mindf***ing I grant you however the familiar subgenre of sci-fi meets identity thriller gets old fast as does director John Maybury's scattershot visuals compensating for the half-baked screenplay by Massy Tadjedin (based on a story by Tom Bleecker and Marc Rocco).</fullReview>

This guy travels forward in time so that he can accidentally have a relationship with a girl who was 7 years old the first time he meets her. Wasn't this the plot of Beautiful Girls, with Tim Hutton and his obsession with Natalie Portman. But THIS movie finds a way around it. Oh, and in case you were wondering, Jennifer Jason Leigh is the Time Pimp...she so gets around. The montaged scenes of war with the fluctuation between night vision and real time were lovely. The close-up images of Adrien Brody's sweaty brow and eyelids were also very beautiful, however, it seems that they could have tried harder to make it plausible.</fullReview>

He falls in love with a girl, whose mother has been killed -the veteran is accused of being her killer, but he's innocent! He can also travel along his past -and modify a series of things, not only to prove his innocence, but to prevent the crime he's charged with as well! I summarized the story and tried to simplify it as much as I could, but I assure that it's much more complicated. One hour after having seen the film at the movie theater, I couldn't remember the scenes and the plot any more.A uselessly obscure film, bad made; that's another product of paranormal (and paranoiac) thriller genre.
