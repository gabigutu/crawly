		<shortDescription>Bad Boys is Bad Ass (Retort to "bad is the right word for title")</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think us movie buffs sometimes forget that not all movies are made to have some sort of under lying message that can or will change our lives. That's why it pains me to see some users give this film a bad review because "the dialog is weak" or "the scenery isn't vibrant" or something along those lines. This is not a stab or an insult to you, but what I'm saying is; sometimes movies are made with one intended purpose... ENTERTAINMENT! I could careless if this film had poor actors, poor script, poor lighting, that doesn't matter when you watch an action film. This movie delivers your monies worth too, in my opinion Will Smith and Martin Larwence make such a great team that part of the fun is just watching these two get into it from time to time. And with Michael Bay directing, you know you're going to get some good action scenes. Let's face it, Bad Boys II has one of the best car chase scenes ion recent history, it dominates the dismal over played chase in Matrix Reloaded which was the other big summer sequel of that year. I think all that needs to be said here in a retort is the movie is an action movie ans needs to be looked at as an action movie. To hell with the elements that the Academy looks at, appreciate the film for all the stuff that blows up and the laughs the cast can bring you to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate reading these reviews putting this movie down. This movie kicked ass plain and simple. It's a fun movie to watch and enjoy!!! Sure, there's not much of a plot but if you wanted that why would you go to see this film?? The only reason to see this film is because you want 2 1/2 hours of entertainment!!! That's what this is, pure fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a movie, people.......if you don't like it, stay home!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really get a kick out of all the people crying about how violent, profane and indecent they found Bad Boys II to be. Hello!!! It's an R-Rated action movie(and a damn fine one at that) so what exactly were you expecting, Finding Nemo? I like the fact that Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer had the balls to release a take-no-prisoners action flick like this instead of a "pussified" PG-13 movie like everything else Hollywood has given us this summer(Hollywood Homicide, Tomb Raider, 2 Fast 2 Furious, Charlie's Angels Full Throttle, The Hulk, etc). If you don't want to see a movie with a lot of violence and profanity, the solution is simple.......STAY HOME! There are plenty of other movies out there to see this summer so it's your own fault for going to a movie you know you're not going to like in the first place. I agree that a couple of scenes were probably unnecessary(I could have done without the morgue and the bodies falling out of the van), but other than that I thought this movie was the perfect action film and the best thing I've seen this summer. It's funny as hell and the action is non-stop from beginning to end. What more can you ask for from a summer movie? Don't listen to all the pompous movie critics because they don't like action films in the first place and they are very biased in their opinions. All they want you to see is movies like Seabiscuit or The English Patient. Well, screw that! I like movies where a lot of s**t blows up and as everyone knows, Michael Bay blows s**t up better than anybody in Hollywood. Go see Bad Boys II and actually get your money's worth from a movie this summer(a rarity indeed).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great summer action flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a hell of a lot of fun to watch. The action sequences were really well done, and there was tons of them. It was a lot more violent than the first one as I noticed. I thought the scene with all the cadavers was really unnecessary. It was kind of gross. And the chemistry between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence is great. The arguments really reflect from the first one. I was really enjoying the tense scenes where the cars were flying off the truck. A great movie. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ten times the action, total hardcore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well after that blunder of a motion picture called "Pearl Harbour" Micheal Bay bounces back with a better movie here. To his credit though in the few short films he has made so far none of them have bombed. This movie was 10x the action definately, and was actually way funnier than first one. Will Smith was definately more built, much tougher and more in charge, Martin Lawrence stole the show with his silly remarks every 5 seconds but I loved it. The car chase scene on the highway was way better than the Matrix Reloaded's car chase scene, it puts that one to shame. But this highway chase scene will definately rank up there with T3's. Some parts in this movie were a bit overdone such as the morgue scene, won't get into it but I'll leave it at that, and the rats...that's it! :)If you are looking for a solid type performance from Will Smith to be a good actor don't bother, this movie was all about pure action, and mindless fun, if that's what you want then go see it, if not don't waste your 2 hours and 40 minutes seeing it. Funny thing is, it didn't feel that long.Can't wait to see this out on DVD in superbit. A great sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The coolest action/comedy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing Bad Boys 2 and it was the coolest move ever. It had so much action in it topped off with comedy. For a 2 and 1/2 hour movie it didn't seem that long at all. I loved that it didn't have a whole lot CGI effects in it. I liked how they actually destroyed the cars and how they really blew up that mansion, no fake model stuff. This was just as cool as the first movie was but a little bit better and cooler. I don't know how the critics in different areas rated the movie but the ones in my area only gave it 1 and a half stars. I think it deserves at lease 3 and a half to 4 stars. I can't what for this movie to hit DVD I be there to get it definitely the first day it hits shelves. If you haven't go and see this BAD movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Action Packed Movie That'll Have You Laughing!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, if you need action or comedy, this is the movie for you. It was a perfect mix with Big Willy and Martin Lawrence.It was a bit long. It felt like I watched 2 movies, but that's not a bad thing. The action was fast, but the realism of the movie was not believable. Way too many close calls, the way action movies usually are.The comedy gets an A+ in my book. So far, this is the funniest movie I've seen of the year. There was A LOT of comedy, note that I stress the words, "a lot." I was laughing from start to finish. Very few lines were weak, but there not noticeable.Overall, this is the perfect film if you want to sit back, watch some people die, and laugh your ass off. You didn't need to see the first one to understand the story, so don't worry. But I do advise you, it was a very gory movie. They showed a lot of disgusting parts, and I'm not talking about sex, I'm talking about gore.9.1/10-Aren~</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loads of fun ---7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a really fun movie to watch. It has some intense action sequences. Actually, a lot of intense action sequences. The shooting never stops and the explosions keep on coming. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are hysterical, again. And Joe Pantoliano makes every movie better. The two funniest scenes are when Burnett and Lowery are scaring the hell out of Burnett's daughter's date and after the chase scene with the dead bodies and Captain Howard goes off on the two. Absolutely hilarious! My only gripe is that it seemed that the writers were running low on material and resorted to gross-out humor like rats having sex and corpses losing their heads. Not funny. Otherwise it was very funny, due to the amazing chemistry between the two leads. I still prefer the original Bad Boys, but this is still a great time at the movies. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A huge budget sequel to the dumb "Bad Boys." I guess it was inevitable.I saw the HBO special on this movie and watch how Will Smith, Michael Bay, and Jerry Bruckheimer went on and on about how great this movie is. What was really happening was that Michael Bay and Will Smith were happy that they received a fat paycheck and Bruckheimer was happy that he will make another huge pile of money with the release.They said "we finally got it perfect." Perfect? Perfectly over-blown trash maybe. There is not the slightest distant glimmer of anything that faintly resembles originality here. It is all one boring dull mindless cliché after another until the viewer is literally ready to puke.The "story" starts with Will Smith, who is hot for Gabrielle Union who is Martin Lawrence's sister which is a a cheesy love vs family problem that is addressed so poorly that it shouldn't be there. And guess what? There is a twist! Gabrielle Union is an undercover cop working on what maybe the same case! Oh dear! We are also treated to a big loud car chase in which well over thirty vehicles are totaled along with the bad guys. But the good guys? They don't even get hurt. Some cops manage to land in critical care, but after flipping over in a car going 80 mph straight into a massive fireball in the middle of the highway you'd be dead. Yes the T-1000 survived such a feat, but he is a futuristic robot.Moving right on from the pathetic story and horrible action is the humor. It is also dumb, cliché, and overly vulgar. I mean are rat sex and junior high school level gay jokes something you'd expect to see in a movie not by John Waters? Types of humor have their placement in film, or as Michael Bay demonstrates so well, misplacement. Moving on we come to a sick excuse for a plot device. Towards the end our heroes got save Gabrielle Union who was kidnapped. They pack their service pistols and prepare to go to take on an entire drug cartel. But guess what? The police chief's friends are in the CIA and they decide, out of the goodness of their heart, to help two hotshot loose cannon detectives! So now, with the help of a bunch of CIA commandos half of Cuba is blown up and everyone goes home safe. Preposterous on all counts.There are entertaining movies that follow this kind of preposterous formula. James Bond, for one. He is just as ridiculous as this movie, but he has a light side. He doesn't take himself too seriously. Those films have a tongue in cheek nature that constantly reminds us that we are watching what is basically a fairy tale. Not here. This film takes it self so seriously and tries to be ultra cool and slick. Thankfully it fails on all fronts of film making. Let's hope we don't see anything like it anytime soon.Sick, disgusting, unoriginal, a horrible waste of money, superficial, unentertaining, unfunny, vulgar, and just plain terrible. This sort of Hollywood junk put the word 'bad' in the dictionary. Either that or the Bubonic Plague. Well, I guess they are both bad. 1/10 Rated R: excessive violence, relentless profanity, and all around bad taste</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little overdone but still a good watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was very entertaining. It had me wanting to watch all the way until the end. It was about 30 minutes too long I'm afraid though. There were many times that I thought there were scenes that could have been cut and still made this movie funny and with great action. Some of the parts were a little overacted as well. All in all I thought this was a good film and I will watch it over and over again for a few scenes. It does have some horrible language in this movie so do not let you kids see it unless you don't care if they repeat what they see. Check the movie out if you are of age. It's a good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'd give it a rating of zero if I could</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was quite looking forward to this as I quite enjoyed Bad Boys.It started with some wild action and wise-cracking from the cheeky duo, but as the film moved on I started to feel more and more uncomfortable.First of all, repetition set in early. How many shootouts, car chases, and arguments between Smith and Lawrence do you need in a film? How many different ways are there to eviscerate someone? And the plot? The plot is this: Smith and Lawrence bust a drugs gang........again.There is much jollity from Smith and Lawrence amidst total carnage. And this is my biggest problem with it. If it was just a bad movie, my comments would have ended in the last paragraph. This is a very very nasty film. Bodies explode, people are shredded by gunfire, limbs sawn off, and heads are sliced off and our two heroes wise-crack their way through all the devastation. Not just wise-crack, but laugh about it. Oh, but it's good fun to wave a gun in a humorous way in the face of a teenage boy whose only crime is to fancy your daughter. And let's have a bit of fun with some dead bodies shall we? The scene that really did it for me though, is when Lawrence is hiding in the mortuary under a sheet with a naked dead girl. I sat in the cinema feeling very uncomfortable. True, this is a "comedy thriller", but why such cheapness with human life and sickening use of women? Strangely enough, the film gets serious when Lawrence's sister or daughter(I can't remember which) is kidnapped. The wise-cracking stops and the audience is invited to share Lawrence's pain. I didn't. I wanted her to die so that Lawrence's character learned the value of human life. But, she is rescued and the moment she is safe, it's back to comedic carnage. This was rated 15 for the audience in the UK and I just worry about those young minds watching this. It should have been an 18 certificate (or R-rated in the USA). Better still, it shouldn't have been made at all.I could forgive it for just being a bad movie, but this is sadism and cruelty dressed up as coolness for the 21st century.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad Boys 2... what can one say about it? well, put it this way, it's much much better than the first and has one of the best car chases in history.Will Smith and martin Lawrence are two cops have a lot in common, especially their attitude, are sent to investigate the a Cuban drug smuggler who smuggles drugs in America. What a wild, surprising and funny time they have! I know the storyline doesn't sound very convincing, but, this movie is not 'okay' as most people put... it's the action movie of the year! The storyline is, as I said, probably not very convincing and that lots of movie have been made like that and you think that you've seen every on of them...But if you watch this movie, you'll be really, really surprised. The director, Michael Bay, is one of my favorites and this movie is one of his action masterpieces.Rating: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atrocious sequel that overblows the action and comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Lowry (Smith) and Marcus Bennett (Lawrence) attempt to stop a drug baron exporting ecstasy across America.1995 and Michael Bay shoots a successful Bad Boys, a gun ho thriller that exploded The Fresh Prince onto the film stage and started a trend of Michael Bay action.Bay has had criticism over the years for his over the top immature approach to story telling and action and based on this film, those echoes are fully justified.There was a reason Bad Boys did well and it really had little to do with the director. Lawrence was on top comedy form and Smith the fresh smiley face was in full swing of refreshment. Having two young comedians tackle two heavily sought after roles was a shift into the unfamiliar for a buddy cop movie, and it worked a treat as the pair bounced verbally and toughly off each other.So where did it all go wrong in 2003? As we see the pair emerge undercover at some unexplained religious celebration there is racist banter, an over the top and unrealistic eventual shoot out and some gross out jokes that fill your mouth with bitterness.Yes, when the pair emerges there is a cool low angled slow mo shot but Mr Bay never seems to stop pumping this motion. In the abandoned house, as Smith emerges in a purple blazer, as a mine flies in the air etc. It's not The Matrix as much as he thinks.Perhaps the director isn't to be blamed for this film's overblown portrayal of testosterone. Ultimately this crime comedy boils down to one of the most poorly pencilled scripts in all of crime films.Seriously, what is the purpose of trying to justify comedy in the way of drugs, car chases and rivalry? Those elements are enough for the usual good cop film, leave out the comedy. The opening title sequence is reasonably well established as the plane once more glides over the Miami sign and the set up for the boat drop could have been worse but the descent into the ordinary exaggeration of detective work is ridiculous. Clues seem to be too easy to find, whenever there seems to be too much talking there is an inclusion of overly long action to compensate and in case something was missing, there are ridiculous stereotypes thrown in.These inclusions of rough gangsters doing drugs and a soft looking ruler just add to the sheer egregiousness of the overall picture. These included presumably getting some laughs but I struggle to see the humorous factor of Martin Lawrence on x, rat sex and a swimming pool breaking.Perhaps the fact Smith and Lawrence are comic geniuses makes this disappointing as they are not funny exempt for brief one-liners.Bay, the destroyer, has overblown the proportion of action with so many inclusions of bullets it is unforgivable not to mention numerous car chases that never result in a realistic crash. The franchise sadly looks to resume in 2012 but it surely won't get worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad Boys II is waste of money in all senses of the expression. Wasting money from production point of view for something as stupid as BB II is just incredible. The movie is full of spinning camera angles in about 97,6% of the time. C'mon Mr. Bay, the effect of the circling camera works about once in a 90 min movie if well placed. It is not cool at all when used three times (in slow motion) for every 90 seconds all the way.The dialogue -- well, what dialogue?? Does anyone use the word starting with 'mother' in every single sentence in real life? Mr. Smith and Mr.Lawrence do. The bud chemistry that sort of worked in BB I, is nowhere to be seen in this one. Moving on to the comedy side?? Well, I laughed once for 'Marsupial', enough said.And then the violence. Do we need to see all those bodies created and handled in imaginable ways for humor's sake. I don't know may people who get amused seeing dead corpses decapitated on the freeway. Obviously, Mr.Smith and Mr.Lawrence see that as an appropriate spot for throwing a catchy one-liner as the excellent script defines. BTW, can't recognized actors use own judgment and refuse to deliver the worst stupidities. Obviously not. SPOILER AHEAD: "So, let's attack Cuba just the two of us... Wait, there are twenty volunteers coming along, thank God. Nothing can stop us now".As I realize, BB II made well at the box office, which means that we'll see this sort of "entertainment" in the future as well. Too late to change that, but whatever you do, don't buy the DVD. Show that a consumer can have a say of things to come. Don't waste your money, please. *** 1 out of 10 ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just when you thought summer blockbusters couldn't get any worse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bad Boys II" is quite likely the worst movie I have seen this year, and in a summer that gave us both "LXG" and "From Justin to Kelly", that's saying a lot. I left the film feeling irritated and angry that two and a half hours of my life were spent exposed to unoriginal, vulgar, poorly edited and written tripe. I enjoy a good action movie. Chase scenes and things going SPLAT and KABOOM can be fun, but Michael Bay manages to drag every moment for what seems like an eternity. Several scenes manage to plagiarize one another, and often felt like clips from the trailer instead of part of the movie. The continuity is horrible, and a chase scene that ends with the "heroes" crashing their car into a body of water, is immediately picked up on a road somewhere! The fun interaction between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence that made the first "Bad Boys" enjoyable is pretty much entirely absent. Between their constant bickering, and dialogue so full of swearing tossed in for kicks, watching them literally becomes a painful experience. In the place of any real humor, the writers decided to resort to gay jokes to get some cheap laughs. (Nothing like the threat of anal rape to get the crowd roaring). Every actor in this disaster was reduced to a pathetic caricature: the brassy femme who wants to prove she is as good as the boys, while doing it in a bikini; the hard-boiled chief who has seen enough of the crime that is tearing his city (and consequentially his mental state of being) apart; JOE PANTOLIANO - WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!!!The movie itself is just so cold-hearted. To catch ONE drug dealer, the "heroes" of this movie cause 2 major highway disasters, and plow over a shanty town in like the 600th chase scene of the movie. Oh hooray, we got that awful drug lord; sure we killed dozens of people in the process, but at least the kiddies won't get their E as easily anymore. "Bad Boys II" was a bloated mess of a movie. Way too long, Way too poorly stitched together, and way too stupid to waste any of your time or money on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you hate Michael Bay, why did you see this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never understood this bizarre hatred of Michael Bay that so many so called film ethusiests have. I mean, what is it about HIM that struck a coard with so many? People don't bash Simon West,Martin Campbell, Tony Scott, or Dominic Sena the way the bring the hammer down on Bay. It's not like he was the first guy who was really good at style over substance. I for one am gonna defend the guy here. And no, i'm not some idiot teenager who thinks Charlie's Angels is the best movie ever made. I am an avid film watcher. I probably see close to 100 movies a year IN theaters. Big movies and small alike. I appreciate any genre of film if it's done well. But obviously my first love is, and always will be, action. And I think Michael Bay is one of the best action directors around. As good as James Cameron, John Woo, Ridley Scott, John McTerninan, John Frankenhiemer, and any other guy named John.Is Bad Boys II too exrtavigant? Too explosive? Too indulgent? It's not your money, why should you care? BB2 is action filmaking in it's purest, most volitile form. I can't remember seeing an action movie with this much, well, ACTION in it. This thing drills you like a jackhammer in a way that The Rock could only dream of. It comes close to the "Enough Already" level of action as in Armageddon, but holds off with all the humor brought by the stars. Was there one too many car chases? Yeah, probably, but I'm not complaining. Two and a half hours looks just fine too me. Personally, I like my action movies to exhaust me.And what action it was. The car transport chase is easily better than anything in the Matrix Reloaded and even T3. Not only that, but it's great to see full blown R rated action in all its bloody glory again. Ahh, just like the good old days, when men were men, and action movies were all rated R.Look, if you're all about hating Bay, and blaming him for all of scociety's ills, as well as acusing him of being the antichrist - then what in god's name are you doing watching this movie? It's been pretty well established since The Rock, and especially Armageddon, that you don't like the guy - so why do you keep going to see these movies if you know you're going to hate them? Do the rest of us a favor, get off your high horse and drop the condescending art house jerk act, it's as old as the first Bad Boys, but not as enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>utterly disgusting at times and unoriginal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first I thought this movie was on pace to be an action movie classic. The freeway chase scene was just incredible (it blew the Matrix Reloaded highway scene clean out of the water). Then, I began to see why most of the critics smashed this film. It became unnecessarily repetitive. Shoot out after shoot out lost all meaning. Also, the utterly disgusting lack of respect for human life was beyond unnecessary and totally gross. Why did they need to feature, mutilate and pull things out of dead bodies?!? The slo-mo bullet scenes worked here but ripping off `Smallville' tricks is hardly original. If the director would've just cut the repulsive morgue scenes and about 30 minutes of other pointless, overly bloody, and unfun stuff, this one would've been a winner. Instead, it's not even a serviceable action movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It begs the question, in a movie, just because we can blow something up, does that mean that we necessarily should blow something up? A question that Bay and Bruckheimer really need to start asking themselve</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay team up to make a movie, you can count on a few things-it's going to be big, loud, explosive and annoying as all hell. Their track record certainly supports that, after all, this is the team that brought us such films as `Armageddon,' and `Pearl Harbor.' It was especially funny to see Bay directing the latter two films considering they were marketed strongly towards teenage girls. When you consider that this man has only done hard-core action flicks prior to the two films listed above, it drove me to one conclusion; Bay is in fact a fourteen year old girl trapped in a grown man's body. Okay, all jokes aside, Bay has now brought us the unwanted and completely unnecessary sequel to the 1995 film, `Bad Boys II.' So where can this sequel go that no other action flick has done before-absolutely nowhere. It's obvious and obnoxious from start to finish. And the worst part about it all is that it is far too long for it's own good. We team up with Miami cops Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) eight years after their first big drug bust. This time, the two are after a Cuban named "Johnny" Tapia (Jordi Moll?) and his drug cartel that are responsible for supplying Miami with ecstasy. Beyond the aspects of their job, the two cops confront the notion that Lowrey has been seeing Burnett's sister Sydney (Gabrielle Union), who is also an undercover cop on the same case to crack the dealers. It becomes not only a mission to stop the drug dealers, but also a personal vendetta against Tapia when he kidnaps Sydney. If you have ever seen every other buddy cop movie in the history of buddy cop movies, then you have already seen `Bad Boys II.' But the film mostly resembles that of `Tango &amp; Cash,' the 1989 flick that starred Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell. I won't deny that Smith and Lawrence is a good screen pair-they are fun to watch and provide a few good laughs. But for the majority of the film, they are just screaming the f-word back and forth while their guns are blazing. The effect looses its comic appeal after the first ten minutes, if it had any comic appeal to begin with. Beyond the rehashed story, the film is completely outlandish. You can tell this when you see the poster and the first thing that comes to mind is `Black Hawk Down,' another Bruckheimer flick, but one that was actually quite good. But `Bad Boys II' treats Miami as if it were Mogadishu. Machine guns are constantly being fired, cars driving out of control, helicopters and speed boats trying to stop the flow of ecstasy into the city and a few KKK members just around the ride. It's as if the Miami police and the drug dealers have declared war on each other. The whole thing feels so stupid to watch, regardless of how well done the action scenes are. It begs the question, in a movie, just because we can blow something up, does that mean that we necessarily should blow something up? A question that Bay and Bruckheimer really need to start asking themselves. Enough said, `Bad Boys II' is a waste of your time and a waste of celluloid. **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Evil One has outdone himself this time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I begin this brief review of Bad Boys II, let me inform you that I am not a prude. I love exploitation films. I love sex and violence. But this movie simply crossed the line. Forget Hershell Gordon Lewis - he was Walt Disney in comparison. Forget all of the grande guignol Italian horror directors of the '70s - their zombie and cannibal movies are like the Teletubbies compared to Michael Bay's latest monsterpiece. Hell, even forget the collected works of Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider and Tom Green..this movie..this movie. this movie.This movie will go down in my long years of extensive movie watching as the crassest, most offensive, most bloodthirsty, most repulsive film ever made. Not since the release of the actual Nazi Holocaust footage have I seen so much mindless destruction and heartless killing on screen, fuelled by endless supplies of unbridled hate. Never have two supposed `heroes' caused so much collateral damage for so little reason. The film's supposed `gags' consist of nothing but homophobia, necrophilia, corpse mutilation and seriously offensive ethnic slurs, the punch lines usually resulting in more impersonal unnecessary killing, filmed in that pornographically violent style we've come to expect from Bay. This is violence without consequence - most of the time the movie doesn't even address it (such as the scene where a Hummer crushes dozens of shanties and their inhabitants).And you know what? It wouldn't even bug me that much if the film had any halfway decent action scenes. Zilch. Bay's direction can only be described as incompetent to the very extreme. To quote Roger Ebert: `The movie is so choppy in its nervous editing that a lot of the time we're simply watching senseless kinetic action. The chase scenes and shoot-outs are broken down into closeups that deny us any sense of the physical relationship of the actors or the strategy of a chase. It's all just movement.'I had little idea of what was going on during the film's countless chase scenes, or why they were necessary.This movie has officially surpassed Pearl Harbor, Attack of the Clones Batman and Robin and Freddy Got Fingered on my list of worst movies of all time. Congratulations, Michael Bay. After Pearl I didn't think it could get any worse, but you've outdone yourself this time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Smith and Lawerence, in one of the most resoundingly unfunny and brutal movies ever filmed, stink up the screen for what seems like an eternity. Smith can act. Lawrence can ... well, whatever it is that he does other than "act". Put them together and add liberal amounts of Michael Bay and you get this piece of dreck.Bad dialogue, bad acting, bad writing. Attention, stupid American moviegoers: this is NOT how an action movie is made. If you can pry yourselves from the TV long enough, go rent Hard-Boiled or The Killer or A Better Tomorrow and see how balletic gunfights and action are done.If you absolutely positively MUST have car chases, try The French Connection or Bullit.But back to this horror...Will Smith rattles off his lines with all the intelligence associated with a 'hood gangbanger. Martin Lawrence just throws a chicken-on-acid headtwitch and semi-coherent "Yeah!" in periodically. If he did more, it was drowned out by the up-to-eleven sound volume and "music".-10 out of 10. Please, please, please don't go see this offense to everything. P.S. - racism is still racism when it comes from a black man; apparently neither Lawrence, Bay, or Smith thinks so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WILL AND MARTIN SHOULD BE ASHAMED !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know, how about next time Will Smith and Martin Lawrence do a movie -- how about having a PLOT !! These two talented actors took the easy way out -- 8 years between BOYS 1 and BOYS 2 - isn't long enough. Teenage boys who love SHOOT-EM-UPS / BLOW-EM-UPS might like it -- or somebody who's been hitting the pipe, but it didn't work for me. This film was mindless, over-kill, too long, too loud, obnoxious, and punctuated by all the EXPLOSIONS. Even the slim subplots were silly -- OOOOO, Cuban Drug dealers, where did they come up with that great, fresh idea -- Johnnie Cockran's defense of OJ ?? The chase scenes have been done over and over......French Connection did it better but that was 32 YEARS AGO -- or do BIGGER and MORE EXPLOSIONS automatically mean that it's better ? I don't think so, but what do I know, I'm a mature adult !! Disappointed, you bet !! I LOVE Will Smith, when he picks GOOD projects. What's next for Will Smith, Ali or Wild Wild.....never mind. Martin's stunk it up in the past as well, but with MAMA, he HAD returned to silly, but VERY entertaining movie making !! These rehash, buddy, cop movies that trys to blow-up more things and people than the last movie has gotten old, and INSULTING !! But again, that's just me. The only good thing -- I didn't have to pay to see it -- they stole my time, it would have been worse, if they stole my money too !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Look at the fire nymphs dancing in the flames!" Is this one of the thoughts running through Mr Bruckheimer's head as yet another explosion occurs to tie up a loose end or hole in the plot? Seriously, this film isn't even a good bad film. The whole story moves at pace without purpose or direction and rarely makes any sense. Cats? As for the supposed comedy, I haven't seen a less funny film since Scary Movie 3, which I saw yesterday. Can Will and Martin really hope to take on and beat many issues such as racism, sexism and communism in this joke of a film? I think not. And what the shameless destruction of a shanty town (a lot of which explodes for no apparent reason) which is a poor imitation of Jackie Chan's Police Story? I hope I never have to see this again.Avoid this film like the plague, on fire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually sequels tend to disappoint (Shrek the third, Xmen3, Lehal weapon2 etc) but not this time. I found this film to be as fast paced and action packed as the first one but with one difference- more action.This has all of Bay's trademarks- colourful cinematography, spectacular car chases, orange filters, epic soundtrack and what I loved most about this film was the chemistry between Smith and Lawrence again.Why critics seemed to dislike I don't know but if there's one fault I could find with it is that it does go on for a long time (but not in the bad way in which Pearl Harbour lasted for nearly 4 dull hours). Other than that I can't really find fault with it. The opening car chase scene is amazing benefiting from its amazing sound effects and colourful cinematography.If you liked the first one then there's no reason for you to not like this one. If you haven't seen the first one then don't worry as this film is easy to grasp. I just hope they carry this series on!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Sequel To A Buddy Comedy Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, where do I start? This is a sequel to the buddy classic of 1995, Bad Boys. Again we have the usual camaraderie of two old friends who are also partners in the police, non-stop action and stunts that keep the average action junkie interested like myself. As for plot and storyline, I would say Bad Boys 2 has a reasonable one. I could compare Bad Boys 2 to the original, and come up short with anything new but what I do come up with is the same as with the original. Bad Boys 2 gives us more of what the first film had, only this time in 2003 and not 1995.Weapons change, cars change but the same gist of the film remains the same. Action galore in fact for us action junkies, car chases that end in havoc and chaos. Explosions that tear city blocks apart and the occasional joke preceding each one. A good sequel to follow off from the original and yet again another great action flick for a late Friday night in with your friends.</fullReview>

The action in the movie is unlike any movie, the only movie I've seen with better action was another Michael bay movie and that was transformers. Bad boys 2 is great all around, great action, great acting, great music, and amazing cars. The movie is very entertaining, it goes back and forth between action and comedy all the way through.

		<fullReview>Bad Boys is one of the Best Cop Buddy movies I've seen. Two hours, packed with Action and Comedy. Will Smith is back in a Comic role and delivers a good performance. Martin Lawrence is one of Hollywoods underrated funniest actors. He is ever so funny in this sequel to Hit movie Bad Boys. Part One was very funny and enjoying. In my opinion, Part Two was more funnier and had some good violence and stunts. The funniest scene is when they both have a conversation alone in the electronic shop and it gets recorded and misunderstood. Some Great Stunts including the car chase sequence, where cars get chucked at. This is one non stop entertainer, not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read countless reviews for this movie. Most professional critics gave it one or one and a half stars. And after spending two and a half hours watching Bad Boys 2 it's safe to say that these critics were totally wrong. They rated this movie WAY TOO HIGHLY. I've never seen such a jumbled, incoherent, profane, slop of a film since I watched home videos of my drunk friends on spring break. You mean to tell me that people were actually PAID to make this and WE are currently paying them by seeing it? I saw it last night for $7 and I was overcharged $10. My girlfriend treated me to and I felt that I had violated her. Will "I'm-Too-Good-To-Curse-In-My-Songs" Smith spent more time cursing than Martin. The entire movie was one car chase followed by a gunfight after another car chase follwed by yet another gunfight followed by...you get the point. I didn't know if I was watching a movie or footage from Iraq. There was more blood on this movie than in OJ's Bronco, and more shooting than a P. Diddy night out. I just don't understand how ANYONE could have liked this film. I know everyone has their own opinion but wow. And was it just me, or did the producers choose only one song for the film's score. I think I heard Tail Feathers more times in this movie than I have on the radio this summer, and THAT is too much. The directing is ugh, the acting is worse than Belly, the action is so over the top that you wonder if the height will make your ears pop, the chemistry of Will and Martin was wasted and used to concoct all the uneccessary explosions, the pages in the script where the plot was written was apparently used for toilet paper, the movie was longer than Roots (even the Chicken George part), and you leave the theater mad at the world. Trust me. If all that doesn't bother you, then hey I guess you'll be cool. If this is the direction movie are going in then I guess I'll stay in from now on. Excuse me, I'm having flashbacks. NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!</fullReview>

It was hilarious Will and Martin were really funny especialy Will in the scene where some poor kid comes to take Martin's daughter out to the movies. The main reason critics were unkind with this movie is because it had a lot of racially motivated jokes and unfortunately critics are trying to be politically correct and not loosen up.

		<fullReview>Michael Bay can blow almost anything up and still make it look good on camera, and this he insists for almost 3 hours in BAD BOYS II. I've purposely avoided this overstuffed, overlong sequel to Bay's first film BAD BOYS. I don't hate Michael Bay nor his approach of mindless and over-amped blockbusters, but I wouldn't want to waste my time on the 2 and a half hours of empty-headed drivel that BAD BOYS II had to offer. But when it was on TV, and with time to spare, I thought it couldn't be all that bad. I mean, I'm probably one of the few people who like a Bay's Armageddon or PEARL HARBOR.And yet, despite a few enjoyable moments, it really was THAT bad. The action is brisk and exciting at first, but then it goes on and on and on until Bay has nothing more to blow up. The filler of a story (I tried my best not to refer to it as a "plot") concerns our Narcotic agent heroes Marcus (Will Smith) and Mike (Martin Lawrence) going after a drug kingpin (Jordi Molla). But it's really just an empty barrage of action scene after action scene, each one bigger than the last. Worse, Bay can't help thinking of himself as an auteur by shooting the action sequences in either slow-mo (a trick he over uses here) or with fast cuts that make it almost impossible to know what's happening.BAD BOYS II is so loud and obnoxious that Bay couldn't even keep it down a notch during the "talking" scenes (in Bay's world, everyone talks trash). Plus the idea of humor in the movie is beyond tasteless. Smith and Lawrence's banter are occasionally amusing, but a chase sequence where Smith and Lawrence run over a couple of corpses dropping from a truck or a scene where they see two rats having sex in a graphic manner are just too much (and painfully, there are more). I find no problem with a big, loud, and dumb blockbuster, but BAD BOYS II insists that it can bigger, louder, and dumber than usual. It represents the most aimless attempt any blockbuster could commit: aim low and miss desperately. This is Bay's worst movie until his recent TRANSFORMERS sequel.Rating: *1/2 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lights, Camera, ACTION! plenty of it, I wrote my review for Bad Boys over a year ago, I couldnt wait for this movie. I am a big Bruckheimer fan because I like action. Critics who keep bashing the movie forget that Micheal Bay is known for shooting action. So if you don't like to see some amazing action sequences, and you have a weak stomach, then stay away from movies like these. I thought this movie had more action in it than all of the Lethal Weapon movies. This is "the" buddy cop movie. Their should be a part 3 now that this movie clocked in over 40 million in its first weekend.I already said enough about the action in this film, but Martin and Will are hilarious in this one, even though the plot has nothing to do with several of their skits. It feels like they were 2 different movies here. But nevertheless, the chemistry was good between them, and they had me falling off my seat. So do not miss this movie because a critic says so. This movie will make way more than it cost to make ($200,000,000) but it will Cha-Ching, much more just like Pearl Harbor was bashed, along with Armageddon which are Hollywood Classics. I admit Bay is not my favorite director to see work with Bruckheimer, his closeup hand-held camera shaking movements always bothered me. Instead I like the Scott bros. Ridley and Tony who should direct Bruckheimer movies from now on. *** 3 stars out of 4. Go see this film, just get the advil ready afterwards</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It must be awesome being Michael Bay. I mean, can you imagine any other director who is given mega-budgets every few weeks and told to blow up more than he did in his previous movies? In the first Bad Boys film an air-plane hanger was blown to bits and was swiftly followed by an asteroid being nuked in Armageddon and the destruction of Pearl Harbour in...uh, Pearl Harbour. Not to be undone, Bad Boys 2 has him indulging in not one, but two chaotic car chases where muscle cars which most of us would spend our lives saving up for are torn to pieces like yesterday's newspapers and rounding everything up by detonating a sizable part of Cuba. If this trend continues, there won't be a building left standing in the whole of North America once Transformers is through. Not bad for a smug little geek with a rubbish haircut.If you've seen the first Bad Boys film, you'll know what to expect. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence return as Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett, a pair of loose cannon cops whose only similarities are their penchants for arguing and getting into gun fights. Lowrey (Smith) is all laid back cool, stylin' and profilin' his way through the Miami underworld while charming the pants off every woman that crosses his path. Burnett on the other hand is an insecure, neurotic and over protective family man. Not only that, but he has a bit of an anger management problem as well and has been half a step away from a severe nervous breakdown for the majority of his adult life. So far, so very similar to any cop orientated buddy movie you've ever seen, but Bad Boys 2 overcomes the total lack of originality thanks to the natural charisma of the stars and the sheer spectacle of its action sequences.The plot of course is throw away guff designed to hurtle Smith and Lawrence into the thick of as many explosions as possible, but when they bounce off each other this well it's difficult to care. Martin Lawrence has never been a great leading man but somehow, when partnered with Will Smith his career makes perfect sense, his manic edginess being the perfect foil to Smith's effortless charm. You could argue that being on screen with the World's Most Charismatic Man would make anyone look good, but then you'd clearly not have seen the terrible I, Robot, where nobody looked good. Not even the robot.And then you have the aforementioned action sequences. Yes, we all know they're going to be over the top, but lord almighty, it's still an adrenaline pumping thrill to see them happen. The opening John Woo impression with the Ku Klux Klan is just the starter to a main course that consists of a destruction derby car chase, a close quarters battle with some Rastafarian gang members, a fist fight on a train carriage, ANOTHER insane car chase and a dessert set in Cuba, where a mansion gets destroyed. Throughout, bodies fly off overpasses to go crashing into glass phone boxes, men are riddled with machine gun fire and the balls of fire get bigger and more firey the later they appear. Bad Boys 2 might not be subtle, but it sure as hell is fun.However, there is a drawback: the running time. It might be an energetic exercise in flashy excess, but did it really need to be two and a half hours long? Entertaining though it is, there comes a point when you've seen enough faceless henchmen getting holes drilled in them and just want to see the villain being brought down. Given the extreme running time, isn't also a bit unusual that Joe Pantoliano's role as the best clichéd police chief in movie history is so small? Maybe they were worried he'd pack the movie into his bags and run off with them like he did the first time around...Those grumbles aside, there's little complaint to be made about Bad Boys 2. Sure, it's so shallow that I could just as easily have written "Will Smith and Martin Lawrence destroy stuff" and summed up the entire enterprise, but it makes for an exhilarating action movie and the natural successor to all those ones produced in the eighties when brain cells were exchanged for body counts and biceps. Try not to take it seriously and you'll have a blast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like it's prequel, 'Bad Boys II' is not the sort of film you should watch if you like deep-thinking, philosophical dramas. But if you're just wanting to be entertained by plenty of action, sarcastic jokes and wisecracks then this is a perfect blockbuster for you.It doesn't pretend to have some deep plot-- the storyline is the very simple premise of catching the drug dealers and getting the girl-- but it is pure popcorn entertainment complete with car chases and gun fights. The interplay between Will Smith and Matthew Lawrence is hilarious (the 'Bad Boy' films are the only time I can tolerate Lawrence); a more up-to-date version of Riggs and Murtaugh in the Eighties classic buddy flick 'Lethal Weapon'.Very enjoyable action comedy that should please most fans of Hollywood blockbusters and cop flicks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All Hail the King of the Summer Movies!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Violent, loud, relentless, and without question the coolest film of the summer. Michael Bay's action epic is the action movie to top all action movies. It's as if Bay and producer Bruckheimer are saying, "we dare you to top this." For Will Smith, the film is a breath of fresh air. What Smith is doing with this picture, is showing that he can do something more than entertain the PG-13 crowd with his alien fighter shinanigians. It's nice to see Will Smith play a pi**ed off angry cop, as opposed to his usual Mr. Nice Guy shtick. Martin Lawerence shows that he does have talent, if he works with the right people. My advice to Lawerence is don't make any movies except BAD BOY movies.Much has been said about the film's violence, and frankly I'm surprised by it. Yes the film is violent. There are a lot of people getting shot and killed. What do you expect? It's a cop movie. Most critics have mentioned the scene involving dead bodies, used for comedic value. This is the same type of humor you see in movies like Final Destination 2, where the laughs come from the deaths. I don't find it offensive, because the scene with the bodies is an important slice to the narrative, and hey, it is FUNNY.As an action picture, no other film this summer comes close to Bad Boys 2. The Matrix Reloaded tops Bad Boys 2 as an overall movie, but if you are just to measure the action scenes, Bad Boys 2 wins. Many have been comparing the chase scenes of this film and Reloaded. Let me say this, the freeway chase scene in Reloaded beats the chase scene in this film. The difference, the freeway scene in Reloaded was the main action scene, while the chase scene in Bad Boys 2 is one of seven amazing action scenes. No other Hollywood movie can compare to the amount of action that is in this film. So because, as of right now, Bad Boys 2 is the definitive action picture, you owe it to yourself to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was bar-none the best action I have seen in years!!! I am not only one of the most critical people I know when it comes to movies but I'm also not a Michael Bay fan. Oh My God!!! Most action films now-a-days are just ho-hum and use warmed over effects and stunts from other films, but this one pulls out all the stops. When I first saw the ads for this film last year, I said to myself, "Why are they making a sequel to that film?" Not only that, but why did they wait 8 years to make it. Needless to say, I didn't have much faith in this film. The underwhelming trailers didn't help either. Boy, was I wrong. This was the summer film I didn't know I wanted to see. Most action films are mere spectacle, but I actually felt this one in my gut. None of the sequences give up one inch of slack. This film is on major steroids. Oh...and did I mention the comedy? The exchanges between Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are completely raw and off the chain. I don't even like Martin Lawrence!!! This had to be one expensive movie, especially at 2.5 hours long. I was so pumped up after leaving the theater that when I got home I immediately put on some Slayer. This film is that good. This is by no means an Oscar winner, but who cares.Forget the Matrix Reloaded, Terminator 3, The Hulk, and all those other weak imitators. Go see Bad Boys II five times and make it the highest grossing film of the summer. 10 out of 10!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Boys II is an all-out brutal assault on the senses. If you can handle that, then you are in for quite a ride.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bad Boys II rages across the screen for two and a half hours. By the halfway point I was pretty drained, but this worked to my advantage. Michael Bay movies tap a different part of the human brain. Bad Boys II brings the viewer to the darkest parts of the mind, but Bay filters it through a sense of child-like immaturity. This tactic allows the viewer to submit to the images put forth on screen. Instead of being disturbed or repulsed by the extremely dark nature of the humor present, a submissive viewer will go along with this and laugh out loud. A lot of laughter will come from the disbelief of what you are seeing.The stars of the movie, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence return as detectives Mike Lowery and Marcus Burnett. These two are quite possibly the most hateful, immature, sadistic, and despicable movie cops ever. Bay doesn't shy away from portraying shallow and (subjectively) unlikable characters (Pain &amp; Gain, Transformers 2 &amp; 3, Pearl Harbor) but he can ground them in such a way to make them somewhat sympathetic. In this case Mike and Marcus are the rudest most annoying teenage boys you've have ever seen, but dammit aren't they funny? The villain is Cuban drug lord Johnny Tapia played by Diego from 2001's "Blow". This is the character in the movie that is most modeled after Bay himself. He's rich (like Michael Bay), selling a product that stimulates the senses(like Michael Bay movies), and he's got babes everywhere (this is a Michael Bay movie). But as always the main star of a Bay picture is the chaos, and boy does he deliver and over-over-deliver. It's hard for me to decide which Bay sequel is truly "Bay Unleashed", Bad Boys II or Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. In terms of overall scale and sensory overload, Transformers 2 is the winner. But by default it goes to Bad Boys II if only for one reason, the "R" rating, Bay doesn't hold back whatsoever. This movie kicks your ass relentlessly for 148 minutes, if you are feeling any sense of morality while watching this and feel the need to complain, please shut it off immediately. If you can submit yourself to the chaotic realm that is Bad Boys II then you are in for quite a ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very rare genre of movie that was pulled off with great success (in my opinion). Bad Boys 1 was equally as good, if not better for it's time, which I have also seen an unbelievable amount of times. Friends say that I am a huge Will &amp; Martin fan, but I'm actually not, I am a huge fan of their characters in the movie along with Michael Bay's larger than life cinematography. With the combination of the Miami setting, the raw humor chemistry between Mike Lawrey and Marcus Burnett, the characters line up (from the KKK to the ruthless Rasta Zoe Pounders to Miami's finest), the Dr. Dre scores, and the action, action, action makes this movie, along with Bad Boys 1, the best I've seen. Being a Teamster in the motion picture industry in Hollywood and actually knowing real life people much like the Bad Boys II characters (with their ballin' lifestyles, foul language and spontaneous/hilarious comments), I can truly relate to this movie. For those of you who don't understand my review, basically Michael Bay has captured this genre to a tee... Great Job!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive, funny action epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the spring of 1995, there was a little action movie directed by a then unknown music video director by the name of Michael Bay and starred two rising stars named Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. This film was known as "Bad Boys" and was a mid-level hit for Columbia Pictures and turned Michael Bay into a action maestro and most importantly solidified Will Smith and Martin Lawrence status as future box-office stars. Eight years and many movies later, Smith, Lawrence and Bay return, bringing us the much anticipated sequel "Bad Boys II." First off I want to say that this movie exceeded all my expectations. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence proves again that they still have the chemistry together. Bad Boys II was well directed, visually stunning and much whitier than it's predecessor. I'm perhaps most impressed at the character development because if you seen the first film, you would noticed that Smith's character was the laid back, easy going type and Lawrence's character was the uptight, edgy, ready to bust a cap in a mother's face type of guy. In this film the roles are reversed and works perfectly.The stunts are so elaborate and proves that Michael Bay is definitely the king of action movies. The freeway scene, is probably one of the best action sequences in recent years and totally kicks "The Matrix Reloaded" freeway scene's arse. I never understood why this film got so many bad reviews. This film is probably one of the better action films of the 2000's.Above all, if you're a fan of Michael Bay, Will Smith or Martin Lawrence, this movie will sure to please you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't expect it to be as good as the first movie ? that what I got to say in case you think that with more money and better production this film will be better. No it doesn't.Since we all know what the movie about (always about drugs) and who is in it, I'll cut to the chase what Bad Boys II actually offer the viewer: Bad Boys II doesn't have much of the story into it. It is like 80% action and 20% substance. And 80% in two and the half hour ? trust me, that was way too much. It even bored me at time. With never ending cars chase, and fighting, and when you thought it is finish it goes on and on and on differences places just like Speed 1 and 2.Don't get me wrong, Bad Boys II is an action pack film and I do enjoy watching it. But it has lost its style, humor and sophistication cause too much of something that bad and this time ? too much action.Recommendation: A Real Action Movie Lover Would Have Like It. But I Don't.Rating: 5.5/10 (Grade: C-) Please Rate My Review (Yes or No) After Reading It ? Thanks</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie Ratings: ***** Unmissable **** Excellent *** Good ** OK * Bad Stars: Will Smith, Martin Lawrence, Gabrielle Union, Jordi Molla, Peter Stormare and Joe Pantoliano. Plot: Mike Lowery and Marcus Burnett are on the case of illegal ecstacy getting smuggled into Miami. They're target? Johnny Tapia. A ruthless spanish drug lord. While the boys are on the case they cant stop arguing and bickering like a married couple when it comes to their personal life with Mike seceretly dating Marcus's sister Syd... If only Marcus knew about it. Marcus is seceretly getting a transfer for a new partner.. One that dosent get into car chases and gun fights every day. Plot Ends. Really, Really funny movie. Better than the original. Smith and Lawrence havent lost the chemistry they had in 1995. Never been much of a fan of Lawrence but the scene where he and Smith terrorise a 15 year old boy taking Marcus's daughter on a date makes Robert DeNiro in meet the parents seem like a puppy dog. If you like your action with one liners, sexy eye candy and explosions galore then this is for you. 8/10 There is a cameo by American Football legend Dan Marino and the films director the excellent Michael Bay.</fullReview>

Its just a vehicle to show as many gross-out scenes (dismembered russian mafia guy) as possible and even adding surreal scenes like the "horny rats" sequence.The complete absence of socalled "political correctness" in BB2 made this movie look very much like a typical 80s action flick.

		<shortDescription>oh, this isn't a good movie.... and yet I watched it, and didn't turn it off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure there may be some smart people out there who legitimately like, or maybe even love, Bad Boys II. But I would hope that those people, those of which I haven't met face-to-face, would enjoy it for all the wrong reasons. This is a guilty pleasure flick of such a high order that unless the person watching the movie is just in it for all of the stupid, horrid, racist (yes, racist) and mind-boggling moments in this film that add up to innumerable counts, you'll need a quick dose of Stephen Hawking to get your IQ level back up to speed. Believe me, there is a reason why Edgar Wright parodied this in Hot Fuzz - he saw what it was going for, perhaps even enjoyed it in terms of its plasticity as a film, and decided to mock it mercilessly. Even as parody, Hot Fuzz is Lawrence of Arabia when compared to Bad Boys II with regards to comedy, action, acting, storytelling, violence, and even intentional over-the-top hilarity. Oh, this is a bad movie indeed...And yet, hence the ellipses, I must admit that when when Michael Bay turns his own visual floodgates loose, it's... still bad. But in this case it's the kind of fascinating bad that you can't turn away from. There's no need to talk about plot - it's Miami Vice meets a 6th-removed-inbred spawn of Lethal Weapon - so let's jump into the meat of the potato, shall we? It's all about flashy action that is meant to EXPLODE the audience AWAY! Two capital letters, people! When we get a car chase, it isn't just a car chase, it has to include LOTS of machine guns and rapid-fire cuts to the people firing guns and people driving/dodging/crashing their cars, so much so it has to give John Landis circa 1980 an aneurysm. When we see Martin Lawrence and Will Smith banter, it can't just be banter - it has to be just a notch above jive-talking, sometimes just plain mean-speak (if too ridiculous like when the two ambush a 15 year old asking for Lawrence's daughter on a date and Smith just happens to have a 40 of beer).Oh, and when we are shown what Cuba is like, it has to be the kind of Cuba that doesn't mind its shanty towns (the kind one saw in such a sympathetic and poetic light in I Am Cuba) ripped to pieces by a Hummer (yes, one of those BIG-F***-YOU cars) and a, uh, other truck following behind. Oh, and if there's some schmaltz, like say Will Smith's cop looking at a goofy yearbook picture of himself when he was a NERD (and yes, it's shameful to be such a nerd in Bay's house of movie), or when the big twist occurs with Lawrence's cop's sister taken hostage, it can only last said two seconds before going on to the next idiotic joke, or the next retarded shot or cut-away, or, of course, such an action scene that will bleed your senses dry. If you happen to also be watching at home, get ready to scream at your television and have something to throw at the screen. It's one of those, oh yes.But did it ever get so bad that I came close to turning off the TV? Well, almost, like when Lawrence does a 'this is what happens when you get on E" scene, which is so painful to endure it made me pine for the leg-shaving scene in Cabin Fever. For all that Smith might try, he and Lawrence don't click in a way that is funny - unless if the kind of humor you enjoy is the rude and (ugly) sarcastic tone that Bay often carries being a 40-something frat boy - and many, many scenes meant to bring out guffaws left me dead cold. Which means, of course, there's a lot of dull time where Bay tells a superficial drug deal plot where one can feel his patience where thin during the running time. I can imagine his script notes in a scene of simple dialog: "Ok, this is all good, but... where's the explosion! I need something HUGE to knock this f***er to the ground! How about a random fire or a landmine? Can we put an armed nuclear robot in the scene somewhere - ah, here it goes!" So as you can imagine, Bad Boys II is junk of a high order. Sometimes, like during that big car chase on the bridge I did my best to get into it, I laughed at the wretched talent on display, of Bay's slick knack for composing shots and then disgust at the shambles of the result in the editing room. It's what Bay and, not to forget, Bruckheimer do best, I suppose. Not a fan, you could say, but in this case, curiosity got the better of me... or worst. Grade: D-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most disgusting, xenophobic and irresponsible film I have ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Give a five year old a movie camera and tell him to film playing cowboys and Indians with Tonka trucks and you have Bad Boys II, a disgrace that somehow took 8 years to reach fruition. It's probably the most racist, homophobic and degrading experience you'll ever see. I don't even think Michael Bay knew he was making such a movie which only adds to his incompetence.The basic logic of the movie is something like this, if you are a cop then it is okay to kill as many people as you want in the most brutal way possible (inadvertently causing our 'heroes' to become fascists, bigots and subliminally eviler than the main villain). There is also subtext, something along the lines of; all ethnic minorities are either murderers, drug dealers or some kind of foul human being and all country-dwellers are inbred, racist Klan members. The movie spews hate in the faces of every audience member who has been misled into believing they are watching an action-comedy.Miami is a place with a very diverse ethnic population and I think it is completely irresponsible for the filmmakers to have behaved in this way. Maybe a five year old with a movie camera would have been too grown up to have allowed this.As you can tell by one of my older reviews, Bad Boys was hardly a unique or original movie but it worked because the style made up for the lack of intelligence and Mark Mancina's musical score was very strong. It gave every scene a beat, tied them together and sounded mighty cool. Well, that is gone! Mancina's buddy Trevor Rabin took over scoring duties for this movie and the cool Bad Boys theme is completely gone and replaced with an endless and dull drone. In fact I would suggest that the score for this movie doesn't actually exist.And there are far too many unnecessary scenes of absolutely nothing that contribute in no way to the already clichéd plot (drug dealers, oooohhhh that's not been done before). It proves that Bay was given far, far too much time and money to do whatever he wanted. The result? A 2.5 hour mess of unremarkable car chases (also highly original, you'd never expect an action movie to have a car chase would you?), constant, unironic profanity and sexism.And can someone tell me how the slimy main villain seemed have constant stubble without ever growing a beard? Several days pass by, he doesn't shave and he never grows a beard. The movie would have you believe that all Cubans are this way. A pretty bad representation methinks. Trust me it's not that way in real life. For all this movies attempts at hardcore action the mix with cartoonish violence comes off as incongruous. This is not a no-brainer. It's a racist pile of trash that can be labelled a no-brainer as a desperate last-minute excuse by Michael Bay.It took FIVE writers to come up with this. The fact that they or Michael Bay have been playing Grand Theft Auto:Vice City far too much is clearly evident. Almost every single part of this movie is stolen from some part of that game. From locations, to car, situations, characters and plots. And still it is no.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Action speaks louder than words! And as its the case with Bay, his films seem to follow the same principle. I am not a Michael Bay fan, but Bad Boys 2 is my favourite Bayhem film (Pain and Gain being the number two). Bay is known not for his storytelling, but for 'action-sense' or 'Bayhem' .. and Bad Boys 2 proves that he is one of the best in the business.The film follows the story of two partner cops who are on a trail of drug traffickers in Miami. From Will Smith, to Martin Lawrence and Peter Stormare, this film has got stock of great actors, but again, this film is not much about acting.Bad Boys 2 delivers some of the best shot action sequence till date. Amir Mokri (DOP) is magical with his work. Every gunshot and explosion seems right in your face, along with what can be called THE best car chase in the history of action films. Technically, Bad Boys 2 was way ahead of its time. Some might disagree but I miss this kind of production in today's age. Hence, Bad Boys 2 is like a bookmark for me in my movie watching timeline.Conclusion: Don't miss this film, if you are an action film buff! And if you have already seen this movie, you know what I am talking about."WOOOOSSAAA!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whilst the first outing of the Bad Boys shocked me by how good it actually was, this one left me a little disappointed. I was hardly expecting an Oscar winning deal here, as this was always going to be a Michael Bay adrenalin rush, but for a film with a two and a half hour running time, the adrenalin came in too short a bursts.Bad Boys was Bay's first film and was but a taster of his over the top film making, which first arrives in The Rock a year afterwards, but this made eight years later was obviously going to take this to the next level, if not several levels further than that. But to me, it didn't. Granted, the action was thrilling, outrageous and very enjoyable, but the character development was barely visible. They bicker, Lawrence moaned a lot and Smith was cool and likable but there was just a shell of what there should have been. The entire story, including what's left of their character dynamics are only present to set up the next great action sequence.Then, the was the taste issue. The crux of the plot as it developed was that the drug dealing villains where using corpses to smuggle drugs, and this was used to "Comic Effect" in two major set-pieces. Though in the first, a car chase, it was black comedy as bodies came thick and fast from the back of a van to be run over by the pursuing cars, the second was pushing the boundaries in a to a more disturbing area.A criticism levied at Michael Bay by British critic Mark Kermode has been that he is a filmmaker with "pornographic sensibilities". Not just in the literal sense, but in the way that he views everything from cars, women and explosions for example. But this was no more clearly re- enforced than in a scene about 90 minutes in, when our two 'bad boys' are searching a morgue and after pulling back the sheets on fat white guys, they reveal a large breasted young woman, who is refer to as "The Bimbo" if my memory serves. It's worrying because I don't know whether this was being played for laughs or was supposed to be a titillating shot of a well endowed woman? Is it right to show a dead woman, who looks to have been strangled to death and referred to a bimbo in a mainstream 15 certificated movie?I don't want to sound like a prude but the tone of this and pretty much every scene with the bodies being used, seemed to be in plain Bad, BAD taste and though this humour can play well in the right genre of movie, this just simply wasn't the film to do it in, in my opinion. But, that criticism aside, my main issues are the pacing. It was just too hollow to sustain its running time and my mind was beginning to wander from time to time between the spectacular action and the few moments of decent comedy.It just didn't have the magic of the 90&#x2032;s actioner, a genre which had faded considerably by the early 2000&#x2032;s, and without offering anything new besides improved action, which was worth the ticket or DVD price in its own right, or even retaining the original character of the original, this was a sequel failed to hold its own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Bay is an offspring of the 90s action craze, which delivered about a dozen or so decent-to-incredible rated-R movies that pulled no punches whatsoever. Bay himself was responsible for two of them: The Rock and Bad Boys. However, starting in 1998 he became a softie with the weak Armageddon and even weaker Pearl Harbor. After those two softies, he treads back into familiar territory by crafting a sequel to the film that put his name on the map. Combining the same elements that made the original watchable (and rated-R within the first few seconds) and then expanding upon them infinitely, Bad Boys II was prepared to rock your socks into the stratosphere.Bad Boys II does just that, deliver enough action to make you cheer, cringe, and cover your eyes even. There are head shots, butt shots, neck shots, shoulder shots, forehead shots and even eye shots. In this film we have at least 3 chases, at least 5 shootouts, and an on-screen death count that's among the highest you'll ever see in a measly buddy cop flick. Bad Boys had a slew of action within one city; the sequel's action spans different countries. Not bad for a couple of frustrated cops.In the second installment, the relationship between Mike and Marcus (Will Smith and Martin Lawrence) begins deteriorating as partners and friends while at the same time there's a major drug operation busting loose between dealers in Miami and dealers overseas. The writers the second time around didn't touch the script of the original, which explains the different sort of cinematic flavor here. Bad Boys was rough around the edges and gritty, yet realistic. Bad Boys II cranks it up a couple of notches and turns it into an explosion-fest that uses more pyrotechnics than a war film. The script also allowed for plenty of improvisation between the comedian Lawrence and the always-reliable Smith, and the payoff isn't as strong since most of the time was spent bickering. Two movies in, the bickering gets old.But you are not here for the character development (Don't worry, there is none). You are here to see fights, explosions, rage, carnage, and enough machoism to make the movie itself threaten you with a rusty utensil. Michael Bay absolutely loves blowing things up and making things crash until the set pieces become unrecognizable. Bad Boys II is an entire deck of cards in terms of action. Unfortunately, the better hands are dealt in the beginning, with the top action piece being the well-constructed chase in Miami involving plenty of cars. Bay's direction improves slightly over the two softies by delivering long shots of the action and some clever camera movement. Granted CGI is involved with the moving, but we won't complain as three cars launch themselves towards the screen.What prevents Bad Boys II from being a totally grand throwback to the late 80s-early 90s action phenomenon is the immense amount of violence the movie actually contains. Surely movies like Commando, Die Hard, and The Rock had their share of deaths, but the deaths were delivered with at least an ounce of respect. In this case, dead bodies were used as jokes, and a lot of times. We see little to no respect for the fallen, and it becomes a guilt trip getting through some of these scenes and not feel a little disgusted. This movie isn't for the weak, and even the manliest of men might feel impure seeing just how destructive the chaos is.Bottom Line: By the time the movie wraps up, there will be enough blowing up for the screen to increase in temperature. Bad Boys II is an admirable effort, but character chemistry and down-to-earth behavior is replaced with?.explosions and?.more explosions. Just like Transformers, the action is what keeps the movie afloat and bearable. There are indeed some amazing-looking scenes in Bad Boys II, but don't expect for the waters to run deeper than that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another small film that is only entertaining and silly like a French cow with five legs. I must be scratching the bottom of the barrel or scraping the dust in an empty drawer. Speaking of drawers, you may lose yours if you watch too many of these films. Stunts and stunts again, and in between more stunts and so many nice houses that are blown up just like fancy models made of matchboxes and toothpicks. But it is funny because it never ends and they are cops. They disturb more collateral peace than any real war would do. But it is funny and definitely not too tiring for the mind, the brain, or what you may be using in the place of that in order to think about straight, crutches for example.

		<fullReview>Although pretty enjoyable to the point of ridiculousness, Bad Boys II is the most overblown, unsubtle, cliché action film you will ever see. I know action films are meant to be entertaining and lack narrative cohesion and realism but this takes it to a new level with every scene bordering on the implausible and laughably stupid. The whole thing is so overblown and predictable it will give you a headache. Throw in Michael Bay's typically showy, pompous slow-mo, swooning, swish-panny camera, a predictable storyline that tries to create conflict, your stereotypical euro-villain and a sense of how much money and talent and destruction one can throw in every scene and you have a completely overblown, brains at the door action extravaganza.5/10</fullReview>

The other chap is entertaining but a real bad man. I don't like him and i think he should leave this film. I have this on VHS and i tried to tape over every section featuring the Martin Lawrence chap in it, i tried to show this to my kids, but they didn't know what was happening?! I enjoyed it though, i felt without the Martin guy it was a superior film, but a bit illogical?! But i'm babbling.Overall its a fun film with a big action explosion, and features some witty dialogues, but not witty enough i say! Give me real smith's role in this film any day, but get rid of the rest i say, real stinker.I conclude that this movie is riddled with holes like martin Clarence should be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mild spoilers aheadI put this movie on once because there wasn't anything else to watch (plus, it got a recommendation in Hot Fuzz, which I loved). I didn't look at the running time, figuring "It's only going to be an hour and a half, how bad could it be?" Well, stuff blows up real good and cars smash into things. That's about the only thing this movie has going for it. Otherwise, the plot is clichéd, the characters irritating (it's not a good sign when you root for Klansmen to kill your protagonists), and the dialog makes you anxious to get back to the action. Even the action is annoying in that it is frequently filmed in the post-MTV shakycam with too many cuts.Final verdict? I heard this movie sucked, and I was not pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loud &amp; noisy action film that doesn't know the meaning of the word subtle...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bad Boys II is set in Miami in Florida where PD partners detective Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) &amp; detective Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) are working on a case trying to bring down Cuban drug lord Tapia (Jordi Molla), after a hit is made on a huge shipment of his money they discover that Marcus' sister Theresa (Theresa Randle) is working undercover also trying to bring down Tapia. Que lots of explosions &amp; dead bodies...Directed by Michael Bay who also has a small cameo in the film as the driver of the rubbish car Marcus tires to commandeer before the Mercedes this is the sequel to the successful action thriller comedy Bad Boys (1995) only like all good sequels it's bigger, louder &amp; even more action packed. I must admit I'm in two minds about Bad Boys II, I really am. The predictable script by Ron Shelton &amp; Jerry Stahl goes for the whole mismatched partners who argue &amp; disagree but ultimately stand by each other until the very end no matter what type story with lots of one-liners, sarcastic dialogue &amp; swearing. There's some great action scenes but my main problem with Bad Boys II is the script which is awful. The by-the-numbers plot is as simple as they come, two cops track down drug dealer &amp; blow lots of things up in the process &amp; that's really all there is to it apart from a predictable sub-plot about Marcus' sister being kidnapped (did anyone ever actually think they wouldn't save her?). The main villain is poor, the story is poor &amp; downright silly at times, it goes on for like literally forever at almost two &amp; a half hours &amp; I really despised the the main lead character's Marcus &amp; Mike who swagger around Miami blowing things up, killing &amp; maiming people while cracking jokes without a second thought &amp; even seemingly enjoying it, putting innocent cops &amp; bystanders lives at risk with huge attitudes like they own the place &amp; are above the law. I can't remember seeing an action film which has two more unpleasant, mean spirited &amp; unlikable leads than Bad Boys II, the scene with the kid who wants to take Marcus' daughter out, the scene when they abuse the prisoner as well as numerous others really makes Bad Boys II hard to watch &amp; enjoy. It's certainly not funny either with it's racial insults that the makers seem to think are funny &amp; constant usage of foul language that becomes really tiresome really quickly.While I have absolutely no problem in saying the script is terrible &amp; really unpleasant I will admit that director Bay does a wonderful job here &amp; Bad Boys II has some simply stunning action set-pieces. The action packed freeway chase with crashing cars &amp; speed boats is maybe the best single car chase from the past decade, it's amazing &amp; the scenes with the cars being let off the car transporter &amp; flipping over are incredible. I'm sure a lot of CGI computer effects were used in this sequence but you would never know, it looks brilliant &amp; it's simply exhilarating. There are huge shoot-outs, another two brilliant car chases including one at the end, exploding mansions, some truly wonderful &amp; spectacular stunts &amp; plenty more over-the-top action. That's my dilemma really, generally speaking I hate Bad Boys II as a film with it's cynical &amp; cold character's but I absolutely loved the action scenes &amp; the style Bay brings to the film. So what do I do? There's lots of violence &amp; gun-play so those who don't like that sort of thing should probably steer clear.With a supposed budget of $130,000,000 Bad Boys II certainly wasn't short of money &amp; it show's with some truly outstanding action scenes, some of the best in fact for years. I didn't like the acting at all, Will Smith is alright but Martin Lawrence was awful &amp; he is not an action star. They put in really unlikable performances with plenty of attitude &amp; no sympathy or compassion for anything other than themselves.Bad Boys II is a film which I am in two minds over, I hated the dialogue, the character's &amp; the simplistic plot but loved the hugely impressive action set-pieces. Even though I didn't like it I think I would definitely watch it again though just for the action scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Boys II</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The critics give it a hard time, but Nick Frost in Hot Fuzz an my brother say it is a great film, and I can see reasons to agree with them, from director Michael Bay (Bad Boys - his debut film, The Rock, Transformers). Basically partner police narcotics Detectives Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) are back together again to bring down more drug lords. This time it is Hector Juan Carlos 'Johnny' Tapia (Jordi Moll?) who is infamous for exporting Ecstacy into and from Miami. Marcus and Mike believe he is trying to ship the drugs, but in fact he is shipping the millions of cash he needs to make this flow of drugs possible. There is also a tiny subplot with Marcus's sister Sydney "Syd" Burnett (Gabrielle Union) undercover and having a fling with Mike, which Marcus obviously is not completely happy with when he finds out. Also starring Peter Stormare as Alexei, Theresa Randle as Theresa, Joe Pantoliano as Captain Howard, Michael Shannon as Floyd Poteet, Jon Seda as Roberto, Henry Rollins as TNT Leader and a very brief Dan Marino. The film has plenty of spectacular and gripping chases, with cars and dead bodies being thrown at them to stop them catching up, and also plenty of gun fights and explosions that they or the bad guys are creating. Also there is the same bickering between Smith and Lawrence and good bits of comedy, best being the scene in the video shop where everyone sees some shagging, and then them talking about erections. The only problems I personally have with it are the length, just over two hours long, the slightly unnecessary opening with some KKK members (one obviously being the villain), and the anger therapy psychiatrist or whatever telling them to calm themselves by saying the word "Woosah", which is repeated quite a lot. To be honest, with the two star (out of five) rating I thought I was going to hate it, but it was actually almost as good as the first one. Good!</fullReview>

This is a film that knows what it is, and not only doesn't try to be anything more, but takes those expectations and revels in them. Gigantic car chases, gratuitous violence, and a whole lot more of the comedy that made the first one more fun. Lame plot? Check. Cliché villain? Check. Pointless subplots? Check. Helluva lotta fun? Definitely. This is a long movie at 2 1/2 hours, but it's "Pirates of the Caribbean" long, not "Hulk" long. You don't feel it at all, nor do you really mind if you do, 'cause it's a lot of fun.As clichéd as it sounds, the truth is if you liked the first one, you'll love this one. If you didn't, well, go see Johnny English instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a review as such, but a review of some of the critiques of the film. Firstly, they are not playing to be 'hereos' they are normal human cops who are seriously cheesed off about this drug dealer, who is, indeed, very very dangerous. When they searched the corpses in the mortuary they HAD to do it in order to get the evidence. They never said they were proud.Sure, a couple of tasteless jokes were made, yes, but this is actually human nature. Have you people never made a comment about somebody or someone without really thinking about it, then feeling guilty afterwards? That is what was happening here, and in context they don't really care since they throw away their job and concentrate on getting their man. It's the same as any police officer. It's the same as a officer punching the heck out of a murderer they couldn't catch out of frustration.Again, same with driving through that mini village. They were trying to catch a mass murderer, drug dealer, and all around nasty piece of work. YES, it IS tasteless, wrong, and out of order, let along something they should have been fired and arrested for. But it's REAL in some context.They are NOT trying to be angels, they are NOT trying to be heroes, they are bad guys trying to get the bad guy.Over the top, YES, tasteless YES but NOT out of context.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For pure adrenalin and action, BB2 gets high marks. Throw in some pretty funny lines and funny scenes, it gets more high marks. Bad Boys 2 was very comparable to the first one. BB2 did go a little over the top with the drama and the feats that Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowery (Will Smith) performed; but the amazing feats were overshadowed by the comedy so as to take your mind off of: "No way is that happening." I think it was classic how, even in the most dire situations, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence were able to provide laughs. I think that is a lot better than them taking themselves too seriously, because then we'd have to call into question just about every stunt. The ending was a bit of a fizzle. After being somewhat light-hearted and humorous, the movie started to take a serious turn with a supposed portentous and riveting moment. Then there was the whole going into Cuba with a full tactical team thing. Still, BB2 had great car chase scenes, almost "Heat" like shootouts, and plenty of laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to seeing Bad Boys II, because my friends and on IMDb, it looked like for the most part, most people enjoyed this movie. Not to mention that due to the first Bad Boys movie caused me to have a huge crush on Will Smith. But this movie for some reason didn't work that well for me, I mean, there were a few good moments that made me laugh, but this movie over all seemed kinda hateful for some reason. These two actors just didn't have the light spark like Lethal Weapon or Rush Hour.Marcus and Mike start off busting a horrible KKK meeting, when a shoot out happens, Mike accidentally hits Marcus in the rear with a bullet. Marcus is just about having it with Mike, and Mike is also having a secret relationship with Marcus's sister, Syd, to top that. They now have to uncover a drug and money ring that is being sent around the world through a morgue. But Marcus and Mike need to work things out since Marcus is planning on transferring the police department.Over all, Bad Boys II is a pretty decent action movie, but like I said, something rubbed me off wrong about the film. While it had great action sequences and some pretty funny moments, Will and Martin don't seem to have a certain spark that other buddy cop movies have. But, it's all good if others dig this movie.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was so much that could have bee done, such as make the film shorter. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith's banter with each other doesn't have the same appeal that it did in the first one, as here it looks like they went mainly for the laughs, and the jokes come off somewhat forced. yes, there are many explosions that will satisfy the average viewer. But there are some scenes, and several other items that seem off. First off, how many EMT's do you know of that swear while on the radio, and use ethnic slurs. Here, the writers are not aware that yes, business and other places that use CB radio's do in some respects have to abide by FCC rules. But in the scene where Smith and Lawrence break into the Shady Palms mortuary, the undercovers swear left and right, and use racial slurs that were completely not needed. Second, John Sally's Fletecher character has gone from a convict in the first film, to being a member of the police department! I'm not sure how Florida's law may work in reality, but I'm not sure of many police outfits that allow former felons to join their ranks. There's also way too much convience for my taste, seeing how a member of the police force has a brother who is a member of the underground movement against Castro in Cuba, and the captain has connections to the CIA. ?! Much of the final act of the film is rather implausible in many respects, and no care seems to be given for the drivers of the Hummer that gets Smith and Lawrence's characters into Tapia's compound. Just the ease of which we are led to believe Lowery and Marcus arrive is utterly implausible. Had the producers tried to not outsmart themselves, had the final act not felt so force, and had the film been at least twenty minutes shorter, the film would have been great. Too much excess, too much banter for the action to be taken seriously, and way, way too many implausible instances hurt the film. There is a thing called suspension of disbelief, but this film ask for discontinued belief. After the long layoff following the first one, this Should have been way better. Alas, Bad Boys bows out with a muddled mess.</fullReview>

But what impressed me most is how the movie changes tone so much - one moment it's a high comedy, then a touching buddy movie, then a violent crime caper with truly vile Miami drugs lords, then a farce which goes right to the limits of bad taste, then a fully-fledged commando action flick...it never draws breath. In theory it should have been all over the place but the whole thing somehow hangs together brilliantly. It's also laugh out loud funny a great deal of the time (Will Smith/Martin Lawrence superb). I think it's radical. You have to hand it to Bruckheimer, this kind of thing is much harder to do than it looks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>mokri + bay + bruckheimer = a masterpiece in it's genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A masterpiece of an action movie is what you get indeed. I recently bought the 2 disc special edition and I must say it's worth every cent. I wish I could have seen it on the silver screen, but you'll still be thrilled with excitement when watching this one! Michael Bay (I know lots of users here don't like him) is in my opinion the God of action movies and one of my personal favorite directors to be walking on this earth. If you have seen The Rock, with Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage, you have to admit you weren't exactly falling asleep.I can't quite remember what the first Bad Boys movie was about, but that's not necessary to understand this one though. The sequel is a whole new story, but fortunately with the same 2 main characters. I wish I could explain what the sequel is about... The fact is, it's about so many things that you might start to think (after you've seen it) that they were like 3 movies in one. Read the plot outline for more information :) Another thing that's rather unusual for an action movie is that it goes on for 147 minutes!! That's just wow, because i can't stand 90 minute movies with lots of action and poor characters. This is a great ride, filled with exciting characters, humor, unexpected plot turns and of course, lots of car chases and crashing cars and so on. Just sit back, turn on your surround system and enjoy the show.And then Amir Mokri. I bet you've never heard of this man, but o.m.g., he is (in my eyes) the *best* director of photography in Hollywood. He also did The Salton Sea, with Val Kilmer. What I personally like so much about him, is his very effective use of colors and camera angles. If you compare, let's say Romeo Must Die, to Bad Boys 2, you'll laugh at the poor cinematography of the first one. In the end, Mokri and Bay are both responsible for the look of the movie, the intensity of the characters, the surroundings, the feelings you get and the overall atmosphere. I'd say that's a big responsibility! Luckily they're so talented to make it all look very professional and very 'never-seen-before'-like.I have little to say about the actor's performances. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith do as usual, a bit better even. ;-) Maybe a bit over-acting by Jordi Moll?, the main bad guy. Peter Stormare is as freaky as he usually is ;-) One last piece of advice, don't switch off your DVD player before the first half hour. I turned mine off when i rented BB2 the first time, regretting it now, of course. You might expect a story about people doing drugs in night clubs, but it's not. Give it (Bay + BB2) a chance, keep an open mind, don't go criticize the movie when watching it, just look. Keep your brain locked in a closet. If you're into romantic comedies or drama's, don't give it a low rating just because you don't like action movies. And if you're a professional critic, at least try to appreciate the work that's been done behind the scenes. It's a masterpiece in it's genre. 10/10</fullReview>

The actors I am speaking of are Jordi Molla(Johnny Tapia) and Peter Stomare(Alexei), both of these guys gave top notch performances.True to form director Michael Bay goes the extra mile with a very lengthy and destructive chase scene. I found his editing to be choppy which didn't allow the story to have a flow to it.If Michael Bay is thinking about directing another sequel I think he should get the proper writers and producers to complete that film.

What I saw was everything done wrong.In the first Bad Boys, the "bad boy" attitude was tempered with an implicit understanding between the two lead characters. In this sequel there is no understanding, just lots of stupid, unnecessary bad attitude. They just swear at each other. In fact, I can't remember any dialog other than Mike (Will Smith) and Marcus (Martin Lawrence) swearing at each other. Every comment is met by a poor quip or a swear word. That's just not entertaining. There was none of the chemistry between the two leads that was oozing out of the original.Then there's the awful plot. A war between five factions (Jamaicans, Russians, Cubans, the Miami PD and the DEA) basically rages on the streets of Miami. We are expected to believe that, despite the ridiculous carnage, nobody other than bad guys and cops gets to die. And we are expected to believe that the vigilante maverick behaviour of the two leads is only punished by - you can guess - swearing and yet more swearing.One of the subtle sides of making a good cop movie is that the leads have to behave like cops. Police have to operate within certain boundaries. Those boundaries can only be pushed when needs be - something the original movie pulled off with finesse. Sadly, all this movie contains is senseless violence, leaving the viewer with no sense of escapism.Another subtle side of making a good cop movie is to build a relationship up between the viewer and the lead characters to the extent that you, the viewer, really want them to win any situation. In this sense, a strong point of the original movie was the focus on the lifestyles of Mike and Marcus, with a constant comparison between the two. However, this time around the appearance of Marcus' wife can only be described as cameo and the only thing you know of Mike is that he's dating Marcus' sister. So, unless you watch the first movie immediately before the second, you share no empathy with the lead characters and as such you don't really root for them when it comes to the constant gun battles and car chases. In fact, given how annoying some of their dialog is, you almost find yourself willing the bad guys to win just to shut them up.I could go on and on and on about the bad aspects of Bad Boys 2. There are awful continuity errors - for instance how does an articulated lorry instantly catch a 4x4 that has a 30s head start? Not even Will Smith's presence could add to this movie, his character is just that poorly represented in the script. The screenplay is jumpy, inconsistent, and utterly unbelievable - everything that you don't want from a cop movie.To be fair, there is some great action with the car chases and slow motion effects - y'know, the 'oh ah' moments that are supposed to supplement a good movie. You're left feeling the reverse - that the dialog and storyline are simply supplements to the action in this movie, merely serving to give the violence some form of context. In fact, the only notable parts of the screenplay are the references to the original (the slow spinning camera angle and the, "From now on, that's how you..."). If you switch your brain off for 2 and a half hours, you're sure to have a laugh. Personally, I expect a little more than big explosions out of a movie.The original Bad Boys was Michael Bay at his brilliant best. This sequel is Michael Bay at his woeful worst. This movie is bad, and unfortunately I mean that literally - 4/10 for me and all 4 of those marks are for the action. Another entry into the bulging "could and should have been great" category given the excellence of the original, without the reputation of which this movie surely would have bombed at the box office.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW! This film is amazing! An easy piece of viewing (which makes a change for me)with incredible set pieces and some of the most incredible car chases ever witnessed in Hollywood (although the last chase in the yellow Hummer is taken straight outta Jackie Chan's Police Story)I have never laughed so much in a cinema before (mainly because American Pie is NOT funny) and after viewing this I felt really good and had a smile on my face for the rest of the day.This is one of the greatest on screen partnerships since, mmm oh yeah the first Bad Boys 10 years previous. Will Smith is immensely cool as Mike Lowrey, the cool, smooth and trigger happy renegade Narcotics Officer. As for Martin Lawrence, he is fantasic as Marcus. Seriously angry and severely funny. This is the ultimate Buddy movie.As for the actual direction, Michael Bay shines. His influence is clear throughout (Brian De Palma's Scarface was a strong influence both visually and with the content. Also Vietnam war films, Apocalypse Now in particular gave influence to the visual style of the film) But Michael Bay excels in fusing side splitting humour with slick action and it works perfectly.As for the soundtrack there was much promise, with artists such as Jay-Z plugging the film and adding to the soundtrack, and the films theme 'Shake ya tailfeather' performed by Nelly, P-Diddy and Murphy Lee. But apart from the original score what did we get? Just 'Shake ya tailfeather' over and over. Apart from that it was pretty kick ass.All in all this film rocks. Watch it. And its better than its original. When was the last time I said a sequel was better than the original, it must have been Terminator 2. Wow. That was a long time ago...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie quite thoroughly. The stupid humor, the endless action and that was absoloutely heart beating and the audience cracked up. Will Smith and Martin Laurence are exceptional actors and their contrasting physical apperance and attitude makes them an excellent team.This movie was great all around except the dead bodies got a bit too excessive, there just wasn't a need for so many and the thought of hiding ecstacy in dead bodies really made a new line for how low humans can journey in disturbing thoughs. Martin Lawrence sleeping with that dead girl was very disturbing. Otherwise the movie was pretty good up the part where they went to Cuba, that was just going beyond being New York police officers that is a mass army operation and they found all the links to help them catch the baddie.. wow what a conincidence.But otherwise 8/10 for me, action and humor was incredible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well you have to give the makers of Bad Boys II one thing. They tried really really hard to impress. Unfortunately the only that impressed me is how the numerous, public shoot-em-ups/explosions/car chases managed to avoid any civilian casualties. What with all the bullets, shrapnel and cars (not to mention a boat) flying all over the show, you'd think the population of Miami would have inevitably diminished by at least a few bystanders. But no. The shine on the badges of Mike Lowrey and Marcus Bennett remained untarnished - their bullets only (miraculously) kill bad guys (not to be mistaken with the `bad boys' of the title).Having thoroughly enjoyed Bad Boys the original I was thoroughly disappointed by this sequel. I realise this is an action movie that is not intended to be cerebral fare, and usually I am quite prepared to forgive action movies their leaps of logic. However, the leaps in Bad Boys II are of a quantum nature and even I was unable to suspend my disbelief for this movie.The banter between Smith and Lawrence is also disappointing. What was refreshingly enjoyable in the first movie has lost its 'off the cuff' feel and is now stale and contrived. Mike and Marcus were originally genuinely funny characters, but are now reduced to try-hard caricatures.If you enjoyed Bad Boys, then don't see Bad Boys II. I suggest re-watching the original instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's get one thing straight; I loved the first Bad Boys movie. It had a certain panache, a certain style; the right equilibrium/fusion of comedy and action and drama. In my view its a classic. The sequel, however, is a different story altogether and seems to rely on the watery substance of Lawrence and Smith's jingoistic one liners (that more often than not, fall flat.) The photography seems to defy any attempt by the human eye to track any one singular object, and what is left is a blurry, vaselined confusion of images that do little to promote the director's obviously intended urgency. But that on it's own - singularly - is not the reason that I so detest this movie: consider the scene where a vehicle carrying mutilated cadavers - (they have been hollowed out, filled with narcotic substances, and then sewn raggedly back together Frankenstein style) - is pursued by our 'Bad Boys' through crowded suburban streets. The backdoor of said vehicle becomes unhinged and bodies tumble out onto the road where they are - (unsurprisingly) - crushed and mutilated in various ways by oncoming traffic. At one point we are made witness to the dismemberment of such a cadaver, and in a presumably comically intended moment, a greyish corpse lands on the bonnet of Smith's car; these dead bodies were -once upon a time - somebodies son, mother, friend, father; yet Smith and Lawrence demonstrate absolutely no morale cognition of this fact, a theme that permeates and repeats throughout the course of this film - (the shanty town built on a hillside which is ruthlessly destroyed in the films climactic rampage for example; where, presumably, innumerate - not to mention innocent - civilians lose their lives!) I hate to morally philosophise, and it is only a movie; but filmmakers do have a certain responsibility in terms of sending out the right kind of message to an often young and impressionable audience. This film felt flat, there were no characters for me to gravitate toward, and it was exponentially long! Bad Boy's III? Dear God, I hope not!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2003: the year of the average movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say this time? This was another movie I was really looking forward to. I mean, Bad Boys, the original way back in 1995, was an OK movie, what it lacked in story construction it made up in heart. So I expected a lot from BBII, thinking that, since it had taken 8 years to get around to a sequel, they had to be making a decent job of it, right? Wrong, SO WRONG!This movie is so bad in so many ways I just couldn't get it all into the 1000 word limit.***MAJOR SPOILERS COMING UP *** (although how you can spoil a bad movie I am not sure!)So we have a plot, that is just dummmmb - I am sick of all this cops-getting-into-therapy crap, wooo haaaaaa, or whatever they were saying all the time. I want real cops, and sure they can have therapy if they want to, but lets cut the crapola out of the dialog, is makes me want to puke.Mike falls for Marcus sister, who of course is gorgeous, that seems OK, but of course it's a secret, a la Lethal Weapon IV. Then she has to be DEA, which would be good except she starts the movie off seeming incredibly competent, brilliant driving skills, Ok with her gun, then she turns into this bimbo who just is in the plot for the sake of being there and looking good since she really has nothing to do - very predictable.But, apart from the gratuitous violence of some of the drug mob characters (and some of it, especially dismembering people, which seems to happen a lot in this movie and quite unnecessarily), and the ludicrous car chase scene, what is there left? Not much.What I would like to know, and I pose this question to everyone who has seen this movie, is this... why doesn't the Cuban drug lord just shoot Marcus' sister and leg it with his dosh? I mean, why would he drag her along to Cuba, other than so we could have a ridiculous rescue the damsel in distress and blow some sh** up sequence? And how come she just went along with him, without even putting up a fight at all? Considering the drug lord dismembered a Russian dude just to prove a point to his Russian boss-friend, the idea that he would bother to drag along the DEA bimbo is stupid, but what the hell, the entire movie was a let down, why should I have expected anything more.Bad Boys (the original) had so many writers on it that apparently the major writing contributors refused to have their names put in the credits, they were that upset by the end result. Well my God, I wonder who really wrote this dross, because if it was me, I certainly wouldn't want my name to come up on such an unoriginal, totally forgettable, bland and ludicrous script as this.Shame on everyone involved in this movie - the one redeeming part of this was the pairing of Lawrence and Smith again, it's just a shame they didn't demand a better script to work from - I gave this 5 out of 10, but I really do feel now I was WAY overly generous!</fullReview>

Some of the cop buddy-buddy stuff is a little overdone, but some of it had me (and a large proportion of the cinema) in stitches.

		<fullReview>Martin Lawrence and Will Smith reunite with director Michael Bay for Bad Boys 2, where to start with bad boys 2 the film has copped its fair share of criticism which i believe is very unjust the film is a great action piece which i dont think takes it self to seriously, the film is set numerous years after the first the action still takes place in miami with Marcus Bernutt (Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowery (Will Smith) hunting down a drug dealer who is importing drugs. It was good to see all the original cast member back from thresea randle to joe pantoliano even the actors who played the kids form the first one were back briefly but they were there which is rewarding thing for fans of the original. With all the action movies you see flooding the main stream right now it is great to see one that is done with such gusto from the opening 10 min to the last 10 this film takes the genre and grabs it by they balls, for people who didnt like the movie what did you think you were going to see when you walked into the cinema, this is action at its best michael Bay shold stop fiddling with projects like pearl harbour and settle into what he knows making kick arse action films like the rock, bad boys and now bad boys 2 but when he does there is no one better.

		<fullReview>- Bad Boys 2: 6.5/10This was definitely better than the original, which I found really boring. Smith has improved as an actor since then, although is still not great, and Lawrence, while still one dimensional, was more eccentric in this. This is about 2 1/2 hours of extreme violence and mean spirited humour. Like, I didn't get offended by anything as I'm not easily offended, but I still didn't find a lot of the supposed humour funny, such as corpses falling out of vans and being decapitated by moving cars, or a 15-year-old boy with a gun to his head for dating Burnett's daughter. However, the movie moved fast and was usually entertaining, with lots of explosions and shoot-outs to keep you interested. The action scenes were sublime, very well shot and produced. A movie of this sort doesn't really need to be 2 1/2 hours, but this wasn't boring or anything. I'd recommend it to people of mature age, but DO NOT let kids near it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I decided to go to the movies I really did not have great expectations, I only hoped to see some good action scenes, and that I give the film.But what what I couldn't expect was the massive blood shed I witnessed. I expected some level of what I call "unjustified violence", that is, the sort of violence that is there "per se", just for the fun of it, and not with an specific purpose, but this movie goes way beyond it.The care taken in the shooting scenes is amazing, with slow motion takes of penetrating bullets, blood spills, falling corpses, etc. etc. One might even say it's a highlight of this movie. and that is just the beginning, there's plenty more meat for audience's excitement. That includes a visit to the morgue, where hands are stuck in bodies, organs are pulled out and thrown away, brains are exposed, all very, very natural. It follows a city chase with flying and ran over corpses, a jeep race through a cuban shanty town with the america's own "hummer" and for the "gran finale" a detailed slow motion head shot, with skull explosion, over land mine landing and complete body blow up!!!The extreme violence itself would be bad enough, but when you mix it with comedy all at the same time, you make it into a distasteful, stomach wrapping adoration of violence. I know this sort of stuff is been there for a while, but even though this movie has managed to impress me.May the americans feast themselves with it! GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are the boys badder than before?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Bad Boys 2 this Thursday on the opening day and was literally blown away by all the explosions and gunshots. It looks like Michael Bay decided to step up a few hundred notches for this film, with the increased amount of explosions, dead bodies, blood &amp; gore and swearing this film actually started to look like an American action movie. The original was classic, with some of the best one-liners about having picnics in cars and borrowing brown sugar, but Bad Boys 2 attempted to recycle a lot of the original glory, which was painstakingly obvious. When I see a film I like to get into the moment, suspend disbelief and pretend the film is actually happening, but the "reality" of this film is extinguished when the two Miami cops staring down a barrel start singing to their enemies trying to mimic the moments that worked so well in the first film. Despite the recycling which seems to be inevitable in pretty much all sequals, Michael Bay did a very good job. The film was action packed, some of the new characters worked well (swap a french criminal with a latino drug lord, nobody seems to notice) and they kept enough of the originals to actually make it look like it was the same people in the storyline. Tea` Leoni, how hot she may be, did annoy the hell out of me in the original, so I was glad to see her go (or not see her for that matter),the only other downside was getting rid of Chet the doorman played by Saverio Guerra...he bought such light to Bad Boys 1...he will be missed...Anyway, 8 years in the making, a BIG budget, excellent talent in front of and behind the camera has made Bad Boys 2 quite entertaining...excuse me if I didn't find the deep down message from this film, I was too busy watching things blow up!~Tonyz (Melbourne Australia)~</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kinetic misanthropy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the original Bad Boys was a movie about friendship under duress and the violence of urban policework. This sequel by director Michael Bay couldn't be bothered with that; Will Smith, Martin Lawrence, the plot are all just excuses to showcase something else. Bay's new preoccupation is a fascination with violent human death. I noticed a burgeoning hate or mistrust of humanity in this film that is absent in his previous work. Bay seems completely ambivalent to capturing character development, as a result Lawrence and Smith's bonding sequences are pitiful interludes concoted to give the audience time to recover from heady action sequences.Not that I'm complaining, though. Dramatic director Todd Solondz's misanthropy is so quietly despairing by comparison. Bay trounces Solondz by salivating over the effect of pistol rounds popping craniums like over-ripe fruit, as blood gracefully arches out from the point of entry. And is if Bay weren't eager enough to violently destroy every thing in the film, his snorry cams mounted on vehicles provide picture perfect Point-of-View shots; sending boats, bodies, tin roofs, the kitchen sink flying straight at the audience, which smash off the audience's vantage point and shudder the camera.This film is an acquired taste, but a tasty film nonetheless. Here's to new directions for the action genre. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I kept laughing a lot, which was good, because there were some scenes that made me sorta sick to my stomach. When Martin Lawrence threw-up, I felt the same way!! I jumped out of my seat when the dead bodies were falling in the streets and the cars ran over them!! (And when the heads Fell Off!!!) And the dripping blood scene!! Was this an action film, a comedy movie, or a gory horror movie????The action was almost non-stop! The car chase scenes were UNBELIEVABLE!!!! This has really been a good year for car chase movies, with "Matrix 2: Reloaded", "Cradle 2 The Grave", "Spy Kids 3D", "Terminator 3", "The Recruit", "The Italian Job", "Lara Croft 2", "LXG", and "2 Fast 2 Furious". Did I miss any?, there were so many this year! But the car chases in BB2 made the "Matrix 2" chases seem almost boring. The only comparably great ones were, I think, the ones in "Terminator 3" and "2 Fast 2 Furious". Gun shoots-outs everywhere you looked!!! So many dead bodies!! I enjoyed the dead Cubans in Cuba the most! Yea! Dead Commies! But.. so much blood!! A Vampire would LOVE this film!! (If you are a Vampire, then be sure to see it!)The comedy was really hilarious! I especially liked the 15 yr. old boy trying to date the teen girl!, the heart-to-heart talk in the electronics store!, and the effect of ecxtasy on Martin Lawrence and his body part!!! The scene with police captain Joe Pantoliano having a fit in his office was really funny, AND THEN I COULDN'T STOP LAUGHING WHEN HE WAS SCREAMING ABOUT ALL THE DEAD BODIES FROM THE MORGUE IN THE BANK LOBBY AND IN THE STREETS, AND THEN he asks Will Smith if he was into kidnapping too. It was just too funny!!Movie Philosophy: Kill as many people as possible, as fast as possible, as funny as possible, while grossing out the audience AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE! AND destroy 1 MILLION+ cars and trucks while you're at it! And an entire shantytown to boot!If it hadn't been so gory, I would have given it a 10/10 for excitement and action and comedy! But I just gave it an 8/10 for grossing me out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say. This movie absolutely blew me away. I mean, I expected an action movie but this went way over my expectations. I joked with my friend before the movie started, how Michael Bay is the king of explosions. Let me tell you - he outdid himself this time. He's practically made it into an art form in this one. Hello! The action sequences are so up tempo, high energy, that all I could do, was just sit there and release some "Whoa's!" and a lot of laughs with frequent intervals. In my opinion, this is the best action movie so far in 2003. Heck - best one this century even. And that is with Reloaded and T3 fresh in mind - which I loved. But the Hummer scene for instance had my jaw on the floor! Now that's how to shoot a car chase. Outstanding!On a pondering note, I gave this movie a 9, but I saw that almost as many people gave the movie a 1 rating as people gave it a 9. I realize that taste is different, but 1?? In my opinion you have to rate a movie for what it's for. You won't see intricate dialog or life changing philosophical questions argued too much in this movie. It's an action movie! And it's supposed to be rated with that in mind. Just my two cents, s'all. Now go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked the first "Bad Boys" and of course like many out there I was looking forward to seeing the sequel. Well, disappointment is the mildest word of all, which describes my feeling after seeing the movie. Complete rubbish.The plot was almost nonexistent; whenever there was one it was a rip-off from the "Scarface" with the rest being just a number of super violent action scenes glued together. The jokes were so stale and just so unfunny. And to crown all, the scene with the boy who wanted to date Lawrence?fs daughter. This 15 years old boy was called Negro, asked whether was a virgin, asked if he had slept with a man and whether he would like to. This boy was interrogated guess by whom: our bad boys Lawrence and Smith, as at one point even a gun was pointed at him. I couldn't believe my eyes and ears. So humiliating.With the exception of very, very few action scenes mainly involving car chase this movie is, I said it and I will say it again, complete rubbish. The famous Cadillac from the second Matrix is also here. I don't know what is that GM is trying to achieve with this advertising campaign: if you want to get shoot at buy our Cadillac. 4 stars out of 10.

		<fullReview>From the awesome production duo of Don Simpson and JerryBruckheimer comes the incredible sequel to a great movie. For those of you who've seen the original Bad Boys, you'll agree that it was a hit. Action-packed and hilarious, the first installment was a box-office smash.As an experienced moviegoer, no one knows better than I how much a sequel to a film as good as Bad Boys can suck. So to paraphrase a popular cliche, I was prepared for the worst and expecting mediocrity. Someone slap me. Not only was Bad Boys II better than the first, but it was freakin' awesome. You know how funny the first one was? Multiply by 10. The first's nearly-constant shoot-em-up action? Can't touch this! The level of action was off the charts, but unlike some films in the same genre, the violence wasn't too gratuitous. But why, you ask, didn't I give this excellent piece of work a 10? The fault lies in 3 distinct places: Gabrielle Union (who, as usual, underacted); home-life (Bay should've cut out some of the personal stuff); and last and most importantly, Martin Lawrence's newfound spiritual views (really started to tick me off). Bottom line: If Oscars were given for action movies, this one would win by a landslide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whatcha gonna do?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching the previews for this and going "Bad boys, bad boys...whatcha gonna do?" I saw the first one back in 1995, and loved it. I've been a fan of Martine Lawrence and Will Smith, who in this sequel reprise their roles as Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowrey. Now I won't go into deep detail for the story line, cause that blows away the point, but the trim version of it, is, two narcotics cops Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnnett head up a task force investigating the flow of ecstasy into Miami. Their search leads to a dangerous kingpin, whose plan to control the city's drug traffic has touched off an underground war.Gives you an idea, doesn't it? Its masterfully directed by Michael Bay (The Rock, Armageddon, Pearl Harbor) with stunning stunts and special effects. Although really funny at times, the comedy in this movie may not be appropriate for all viewers. At moments, the humour becomes...well a little sick.For example, Reggie, a 15 year old boy, wants to go out with Marcus Burnett's daughter. This is the converstation:Marcus Burnett: You a virgin? Reggie: Yes, sir. Marcus Burnett: Good. Keep it that way. I don't want no f***ing going on tonight. Mike Lowery: You ever make love to a man? Reggie: No. Mike Lowery: You want to?Although funny for me, some people may feel offended, that, poor b*****d Reggie, is simply asking for a date, and has to deal with this s**t. He eventually gets a gun pointed to his head...all for comedy. Kinda pushed to the extreme. Then again, here's another small little joke that...shouldn't ruin the movie...Marcus Burnett: Oh s**t! They ain't normal rats! Mike Lowery: What he means is that these are a special breed.Roberto: What the name of this special breed? Marcus Burnett: Big motherf***ers...Now that's hilarious... Overall, the movie, has alot of action, alot of humour...it all depends if you like this genre. This movie is not for all audiences.Rating: 7.5/10 Quote: We ride together, we die together. Bad boys for life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad Boys 2 is overlong, self-indulgent, and doesn't make very much sense, but works as a "popcorn movie" and is ready to satisfy anyone who doesn't ask for much in an action movie. The extremely routine storyline doesn't serve a purpose other than to shove enough gore, swearing, and T&amp;A (well..sort of)into the audience's face. Not that there's any problem with that.6/10BTW, how many more times do we need to see the action-sequence-followed-by-police-boss-yelling-at-main-character(s)-for-"cr eating-such-a-mess" opening? S.W.A.T., Exit Wounds, Rush Hour, etc. have rubbed it into the dirt by now, and it's become quite a cliche.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Narcotics cops Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Bennett (Martin Lawrence) head up a task force investigating the flow of ecstasy into Miami. Their search leads to a dangerous kingpin, whose plan to control the city's drug traffic has touched off an underground war. Meanwhile, things get sexy between Mike and Syd (Gabrielle Union), Marcus's sister. Most of the scenes are shot in Miami but changes to Cuba later on in the film. It is a good story line. I liked this film because it has loads of action in and people getting shot very exciting and also keeps you glued to the TV but it do drag out the story to long. I would give this film 3 star out of 5.</fullReview>

All the action, clever chatter, stunts, explosions and buddy-cop movie standards that made the first one great are here again.Martin Lawrence and Will Smith make a fantastic team playing off each other with comic perfection in a big budget, action-packed, fast-paced blockbuster. Gabrielle Union was a great addition to the ensemble, the story-line and the inter-play between Martin and Will also.My only complaint is that we didn't get to see enough of Joe Pantoliano as the Captain.A solid 8 in my books.But that's just my 2 scents. ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too long!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually expected this film to be even worse that it was. (You might notice my review is nearly 2 years after the film was first released.) But I watched it on one of those nights where I just felt a need for some mindless, high-quality shoot-'em-up action. BAD BOYS II delivers on that score. There is a highway chase scene early on, where the bad guys are driving a trailer lugging a bunch of cars on their way to a dealership. One by one, they start throwing the cars off the trailer, and the consequences are quite spectacular. The effects are convincing, lots of things explode, crash, fly into the air, etc. Later, a large boat is used as an obstacle, with even more mayhem ensuing. In the car, Martin Lawrence and Will Smith exchange witty banter to show how cool they are (or at least, Smith is). It's a satisfyingly effective, exciting and expensive scene. I dare say it gives the now legendary car chase in MATRIX RELOADED a run for its money. There are some other nice action sequences (a shoot out in a Jamaican bad-guys filthy lair is amusing and stylishly shot). Michael Bay certainly has his own style. It's not actually a GOOD style overall, but it's unmistakable. Extremely brief scenes one after another to make exposition seem exciting. Swooping camera angles. Over the top sound mixes. It's all designed to provide a treat for the senses, I guess..but it becomes a bit much. I can't believe he was allowed to get away with a nearly 2.5 hour movie. This is a popcorn action flick and its most disposable, and yet just when the movie ought to be over...there's a long and frankly poorly executed rescue scene in Cuba. It hasn't got half the adrenelin rush that the early chase scene did. Yes, it has the biggest explosions, but it's somewhat confusing and by this time, we just want it to be OVER!! Will Smith gets to cuss a lot in this movie..but otherwise it's pretty much the same schtick he always gives us. Martin Lawrence's character is all over the place. Is he a reluctant cop dealing with anger issues? Is he the comic relief? Is he Smith's equal in the action department? Who knows and who cares. I know some people like Lawrence. Count me out of that bunch. Joe Pantoliano is wasted in a poorly written role as their captain, who gets to go on tirades about the destruction these guys cause. (Frankly, if a chase scene like the one we see ever happened in real life, it would be MAJOR, MAJOR national and international news...not just something your boss yells at you for before telling to go "get back out there and get those guys." I can't help but think that in the scene as shown, probably 50 people died and about 200 cars were destroyed, along with millions of dollars in property damage. But in the world of BAD BOYS II, no big whoop. The movie needed tightening up, more than anything. Let's stick to the action, cut needless "character development" scenes, which Michael Bay couldn't pull off convincingly if his life depended on it (you can tell he doesn't care about them), and confine Lawrence and Smith to the humorous banter and stay away from the loud, senseless, repetitive arguments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only good in pieces. Some random comments on a bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a well made piece of trash.For all the technical virtuosity this movie stinks There I said it.What is with the writing its awful. Martin Lawrence is given nothing to do.The action scenes are mostly dull, though the car chase about a half hour in is spectacular after a dull gun fight.This is a movie of posturing and posing.The movie works in moments the one chase an odd line here or there but nothing hangs together...Face it we don't really have a villain until an hour in. Until about an hour in the bad guy is just a guy.... awful.Worse is the pacing.Its horrible. This movie runs two and a half hours. I made it in only an hour and a half before I got up and gave up and hit the scan button on the remote. Scenes go on and on and on and on as if they used every sequence they had. The first 80 minutes could loose at least 35 minutes with out a noticeable loss to anything.What makes it all the more painful is it looks good. It looks like it should work, even in the sequences that don't (which is most of them) it looks like this should be working but its not, not by a long shot....Avoid the movie at all cost unless you want to be annoyed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the stupidest, loudest, and most fun movies to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen both Bad Boys and Bad Boys II, but hadn't seen Bad Boys II until after I saw Hot Fuzz (where it had been referred to many times by Danny Butterman - played by Nick Frost - who thought that police work is all-out action like the movies), so I decided to take a look.Personally, I don't understand why critics ripped it up in their reviews. Perhaps critics' opinions are different to how good the movie actually is (see my review of Distant Voices Still Lives). Will Smith and Martin Lawrence as well as being brilliant action heroes, are also a brilliant comedy duo in the Bad Boys movies. (The scene in the mortuary when martin Lawrence chooses his hiding place is pushing it a little, but that's my only complaint.) The movie is ridiculous, but that simply adds to the fun and the humour in it. The end fight in Cuba is probably the loudest and fastest in the entire movie, and also the most exciting by far. The film delivers, and the characters are great characters whom you actually care about.I would recommend this movie. If you haven't seen it, buy the DVD and watch it! NOW!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Good As The Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that I was excited to see another Bad Boys movie because I am a loyal fan of the original movie, which I have seen countless times. After seeing this movie, I can say that I'm still a loyal fan of the original but I can't say the same for this one.In the original movie, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence were both emerging stars coming from hit TV series and made history as two African-American actors co-starring in a buddy cop action comedy. Both of their characters were intelligent, cool, hilarious and tough cops that you wanted to emulate. The first movie brings you into the life of the smooth rich playboy yet dedicated supercop Mike Lowrey (Will Smith). Mike is bent on avenging the murder of an attractive friend and informant, who was killed by a French drug-lord, who has stolen evidence of heroin from the Miami PD. However, as the movie continues, the audience gets to learn more about Mike's edgy, less smooth but equally effective married partner Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence), who becomes the center of the movie, attempting to put the drug case together by protecting the witness (who believes he's Mike) while trying to keep his family none-the-wiser about his new police assignment. By the end of the movie, both heroes save the day and Mike gets his justice on the main villain.The sequel seems to follow the original eight years later but with a new twist. This movie begins by leading you into the personal conflict of Marcus Burnett, who is undergoing anger management and considering a break in his partnership with Mike in order to have a more peaceful and less stressful police career. However, as the movie progresses, it begins to center more on the supercop ways of Mike Lowrey, who is almost single-handedly trying to put a stop to an Ecstasy ring involving a Cuban drug-lord and a Russian buyer while at the same time trying to maintain a romance with Marcus' sexy sister, without his partner finding out about it. By the end of the movie, Mike, more or less, saves the day and gets the girl while Marcus gets back into the swing of the dirty world of cop work by finishing off the main antagonist in the final act.Both movies have their charm but the dialogue and the realism of the first movie is lost in the sequel. The sequel relies on cheap gags to gross out and shock the audience and less on the witty improvisational skills of Smith and Lawrence. Plus, the characterization of the two lead cops is too different that you sometimes don't feel like you are watching a sequel but a completely different movie. In the first movie, both cops could be funny and serious. Here, the screenwriters seem to have Smith tightly drawn as the brash action hero, with little chance to show any vulnerability. While Lawrence gets a few dramatic moments, for most of the movie he is stuck playing the goofy comic sidekick. While some may find this contrast to be an effective formula for the buddy cop genre, unfortunately, this strict straight man-funny man routine takes away from the realistic aspects that made the first movie work. Overall, this movie has some great action, with intense shootouts and car chases but a better script with stronger characterization and a natural exchange of dialogue that focuses on the chemistry of the two actors would have made this a more worthy sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 13 years old when this movie came out but it was released in India for only 2 weeks and was then pulled out of the theatres. So I didn't get to see it until I got a hold of the DVD. Before I saw the DVD I only watched the trailer of this movie many times. And that just kept on building up the anticipation for me. My friends saw it when it came out and they too were 13 so they kept on telling me that this movie was indecent and had a lot of bad language. But this movie's R-rated what do you expect? Anyways I finally saw this movie and I was so blown away by its action sequences I really did not give a damn about its bad language or its indecency. This movie was a ride that kept me going and I had no clue that 2 and a half hours just went by. The only thing though is that since this movie was more walk and less talk, some parts of the plot just had me puzzled and I wondered what happened to some of the characters.As a kid who grew up in the 90s buddy cop films were very popular, and I just wanna thank Martin and Will for bringing that back into the 2000s with some extra bang.And the soundtrack was tight, especially that song by Fat Joe, Diddy and Dre. Also this movie was one of the reasons why I became a fan of the Miami Heat.All together, if you want to stay at home and still have fun, get Bad Boys 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SEE Bay Boys 2! EXPERIENCE the plot! Watch it re-hash every cop cliché ever! Watch it dive into the realm of impossibility! Watch as it has little to do with anything aside from explosions! Watch as most of the screen time is devoted to things completely unrelated to it! WITNESS the performance of Will Smith! Witness his acting range! From his performance as Black Guy Of Some Authority With A Gun in 'Men in Black,' to his performance as Black Guy Of Some Authority With A Gun in 'I, Robot,' and even right up to his performance as Black Guy Of Some Authority With A Gun in 'I Am Legend,' Will Smith is truly an actor of many faces. So watch, in awe, as Will Smith portrays Black Guy Of Some Authority With A Gun in this film! Witness him use authority! Witness him use a gun! Witness his brilliance! WATCH the drama! Watch as Will Smith and Martin Lawrence harass a teenage boy for no reason! Watch them confirm stereotypes! Watch them fight! And then watch them predictably amend! Watch them shoot guns as they hold them sideways! Watch them go *BLAM! BLAM!* Watch as they blow things up! Watch things go *KLLLBLLLOOOOOOMM!* EXPERIENCE the avant-garde direction of Michael Bay! See how he forgoes characterization in favor of explosions! Notice his absence of originality! Watch him shoot a two hour film as if it were a music video! Watch him shake the camera as if it were dice! Watch him conduct himself as if he had talent! Observe the glazed-over look of the people around you! See that they have shut off their brain! Watch them gaze! Watch them blink! Watch them show no excitement or surprise or emotion at all! They are a testament to Bay's brilliance! Who other than Bay could make such a mind-numbing, cliché-riddled, unengaging, retarded, and pointless piece of cinema!?So see Bad Boys 2! See a truly unbelievable piece of art! See it on basic cable on Sunday afternoon, because that's where excellence lives! See in the DVD collections of 14-year-old teenage boys who live in suburban America and yet feel the need to emulate blacks for some reason, for they are truly excellent and eclectic in their taste! See it in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart, because that's where it belongs!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Boys II... Absolute Adrenaline Rush!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that bad Boys II is a great film!! Its an action movie, loaded with action and humour!! Bad Boys II is the sequel to the all time classic Bad Boys (1995), (i think one of the best action comedies ever), only difference being, the two loose-cannon cops are after a Cuban, and this film also stars the sexy Gabrielle Union as Martin Lawrence's sister in the film.I think Bad Boys II contains everything you need to make and action comedy, just all the ingredients put together and baked to come out with the perfect dish, this case being Bad Boys II.In this film there are slight differences such as the Burnett's and Lowrey's rival cops, of course a better car (instead of the 911 Turbo they switched to a Ferrari 550 Marinello, but in some scenes a Ferrari 575M), also the introduction of Burnett's sister, as played by Gabrielle Union ( as i have already described).If you are wanting to rent a funny movie, with tonnes and tonnes of action, i'd highly recommend this, its a 2 hour thrill ride that will either have you laughing or gasping, that will make your adrenaline pump like it never has before!!

The special effects are incredible. I'm hoping that Mr. Bay will make another one and Smith, Lawrence and Union stick with it, but this time work on as case that takes them to New York to help out on a case that has to do with Terrorism. Now that would give you plenty of material for Action and the Drama and Comedy will follow.Great Job Guys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Boys, Good Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bad Boys II" was a very nice surprise. When I initially when to see it, I figured this would just be your standard action flick with some nice shots and a few laughs. Boy was I wrong. This was a very excellent movie which always kept you interested and on the edge of your seat. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are excellent together and have very good chemistry. The supporting characters are just as good such as Gabrielle Union, Joe Pantoliano, and Peter Stormare. The story is good, nothing special or really original, but still good. The detectives are after a drug and crime kingpin Johnny Tapia which like many other crime lords in movies can't be touched. Once they think they finally have enough evidence to bring him down, Lawrence's sister (Union) gets kidnapped by Tapia. This of course complicates the situation and they go on an all out assault on Tapia. There is lots and lots of action in this movie. It almost never dies down. There are plenty of gun fights and explosions to go around. You will also get a few laughs from Smith and Lawrence seeing how they both are into a lot of comedy roles. To tell you the truth I think Will Smith is better in an action movie than he is in a straight up comedy. Peter Stormare's character a.k.a. "The Russian Grim Reaper" is really cool. I think he is one of the most underrated actors and deserves more credit than he gets. You don't necessarily have to see the first Bad Boys to understand this one, but it would help I think get you to know certain characters better. This movie blows away the first time, in which I thought to just be a decent movie. I give lots of love to "Bad Boys II".</fullReview>

Meanwhile, in all the kerfuffle, Mike is in love with Marcus' sister, Sydney (Gabrielle Union). I, most personally, LOVE this movie because it has GREAT action and GREAT stunts. One part in this movie that is my favourite is when Mike and Marcus are finding out clues about the Ecstasy case with Tapia in a camera store...and when the owner flips a camera switch, he and the whole store watch Mike and Marcus talk about Marcus' problems (along with a problem about Marcus' erection and other things). There's also the MacArthur Highway chase sequence, where it ended with an explosion and a whole load of burning cars (awesome!) **** out of *****</fullReview>

You really see the hundreds of millions of dollars burning in front of your eyes.It's exciting in a sick way. There is some quite dark humor (the scenes in the mortuary). It's interesting to see, how splatter and gore seem to be acceptable in a mainstream movie nowadays. Everything is perfect in this movie. There are many good/funny ideas.

		<fullReview>Bad Boys II consist of two cops Mike Lawrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence). Mike and Marcus are involved in a high quality case involving ecstasy and money dealing with Johnny Tapia (Jordi Molla). Johnny Tapia is smuggling ecstasy and money to Cuba in dead bodies while Mike and Marcus are trying to figure the drug circle out. However, Mike is secretly involved in the D.E.A., which leads t Syd's kidnapping by Johnny Tapia. This all leads to Mike and Marcus completing the case and rescuing Syd in Cuba.Director Michael Bay caught the attention of his viewers with this funny yet serious flick. The movie is rated "R" due to language, violence, and brief nudity. Once on a trail, Mike and Marcus find a way to cope to get through their struggles. This action packed film keeps the viewers laughing and on the edge of their seats.Stunts are unbelievable realistically, however not that common. Camera angles are fulfilling to every shot that is to be seen. A good flow articulates the movie to run smoothly. Mike is a top notch dresser compared to Marcus who dresses more casual. Bodies used as mules to smuggle ecstasy into Cuba had a realistic touch. The dialogue was sometimes bitter however was fitting to the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Boys II</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>by Ray HamiltonThe movie that l am reviewing is Bad Boys II. This movie begins in Miami, Florida. It focuses on two former Miami Police Department officers who struggle to stop the distribution of drugs.Bad Boys II is full of action. It includes shooting, fighting, car chasing scenes, and more. Without this action the movie would be really boring. The best action was the car chasing scene. This scene adds so much excitement to the movie.Another reason this movie is good is the drama. The dialog determines, more than anything, how the movie is going to be rated. Arguments improve the movie's drama and also it's humor. The last example of drama is the acting. This makes you feel the emotions of the actors.Bad Boys II is heavy with humor. My examples include the jokes, some of the action scenes, and the way some of the people talked. The producer tried to connect with the audience by making them laugh. Comedy is probably one of the best ways to persuade people to come and see the movie.Last, but not least, I chose this movie because of the suspense. One example came from an action scene when the actors were driving and the Haitians were throwing cars at them. You didn't know if they were going to get hit or what. Another example was an explosion that the actors were in. For a moment you felt they were burned in the explosion, but they made it out. The last example was when one of the actors almost got shot. Luckily, his partner came and saved him from getting shot in the head.As you can see, Bad Boys II is full of action, comedy, drama, and suspense. If you haven't seen it, then I would recommend that you do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie ever!-funny and best action scenes ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Best movie ever! You can watch this movie more than 10 times without getting bored.There are very good action scenes with the TNT and DEA squat and good, GOOD car stunts. The first movie with really good camera positions, you can see everything at the same time, not like in other action movies where you just see the gun shooting.Really cool guns!!!And best sound ever of them! Its really exciting when they get into Tapia's mansion, in Cuba.That's the best scene in the movie, they built tunnels, they use incredible weapons and really cool tactics. This movie is full of action/funny scenes. Even during action its funny, with the jokes they do or sometimes when they are in a difficult situation how they get out of it. This is one of the best action movies ever!!!I really recommend it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eight years have past and a lot has change between the special effects and the two leads themselves. Will has got buffer and Martin has got bigger.... just in the face. Yet for a movie sequel that's almost been 10 years apart, eight actually, it really does live up to the hype. And I must say that it is funny as hell it is still not better than the first one. Even though it came so close.Mike Lowrey(Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett( Martin Lawrence) are still partners after all these years and still have that love-hate thing going on. But un-notice to Mike, Marcus is on the verge of quiting and hasen't told him yet. And un-notice to Marcus, Mike is dating Marcus' sister, Sid(Gabrielle Union) and hasen't told him yet. And un-notice to both of them, Sid is working undercover to stop a big drug lord(Jordi Molla)'s ring of X pills smuggling. A case they two are working on as well.Now this film is utterly hilarious, improving up on more comedy than the first one. We got a$$ jokes, gay jokes, racist jokes, and a extra joke on rats, that well never make you look at them the same way again. Yet for a movie like these it is handle in a very light-hearted way. And the action is way more violent &amp; entertaining than the first one, going way over the top, which in these day and age what isn't. It had all the things set right to better than the first one, but it didn't follow it's story as well as the first one. The bad guy who is extremely eviler than Noah on part I, isn't shown that much. Which to me hurts the film, because without him none of these would take place, so without showing him respect he is in this 2hr &amp; 27min movie for at least 45 or 50mins of screen time. But other than that this is a great movie, but not better the first one. And I wish Peter Stormare was in this flick longer, for which he stole every scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The humor comprises two elements. One, the police captain (Joe Pantoliano, wearing a flattering flat-top wig that cuts a decade off his age) whose office is a repository of Buddhist imagery and who tries valiantly to contend calmly with the chaos his messiest cops inflict upon the world. At this he fails, and the attempt is funny. Pantoliano always leaves an impression - who can forget his recurring role in "The Sopranos?" - and the movie profits from his presence. The other humor is reiterative patter between the stars, comic Martin Lawrence, playing wary Marcus, who is in therapy and chants a pat mantra to ease him into a zone of acceptance when he is about ready to explode, or implode; and his life-long buddy, boys together, live or die together, something like that in their school year-book, Mike (Will Smith), who gets his charge out of risk-taking. Mike is taking a big risk dating Marcus' sister, Syd (Gabrielle Union), a Drug Enforcement Agency operative and at much risk throughout the movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the precursor to this movie, but I get the feeling I don't have to to know that this one is your average popcorn flick.Will Smith is a half-decent actor, and a lot better in comedy roles than anything else, so it almost worked having an action story with the occasional comedic relief. However, it's mostly flash and bang. The special effects are satisfactory and the cinematography is respectable, but the plot is really shallow. I could have cared less about what was going on most of the time. This movie is not a thinker, that much is clear. It's meant to entertain the part of your brain that likes explosions and watching people get shot for two hours. I'd put it on par with a movie like XXX.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>EXTREMELY entertaining sequel is TONS Of fun if you check your brain at the door. This was just as good as the original ( in the entertaining way that is). Now the original had a better script i thought and The this is somewhat of a rehash but a very good one actually but if you look past it's flaws you will have a LOT of fun. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith have amazing chemistry once again too and provided me with a TON of belly laughs especially all the Wusa Wusa stuff and the moment when Mike and Marcus visit the Captain . Oh! be sure to stay a bit after the credits because there is some funny stuff with Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. There is LOTS of blood and gore here. We get 3 bloody graphic gunshot wounds to the head with blood and brains spurting out TONS of bloody gunshot wounds to all parts of the body , Blow Up neck shot off ear, Tin full of Severed Limbs. with blood dripping, severed finger, corpse decapitated when hit by a car, Cadavers are opened up looking for drugs, a top of a corpse's head falls off, , Kidney gets pulled out , more bloody gunshot wounds, an explosion with limbs flying , and a body explodes into two halves with chunks coming out Gore Hounds should dig this movie. Will Smith is awesome here again has Great Chemistry with Martin and is One funny guy. this guy rules!!. The Same thing can be said about Martin Lawrence he is responsible for some of the movies funniest moments. He rules too!. Jordi Molla is decent as the bad guy but also kinda weak he does okay. Gabrielle Union is HOT!!! and does fine here and is very sexy. Joe Pantoliano is fine here again as the Captain. Overall i highly recommend this sequel for a night of great fun (even if it is a bit overlong). In fact watch the original back to back!. ***1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

This is more than provided by both will smith and martin lawrence. It is easy to find flaws in any film if u look hard enough but if u just try and enjoy the film for what it is then it is guaranteed entertainment. I recommend this film to all people and if u did not enjoy, then these sort of films are not for u. Furthermore, offence can be taken very easily when u watch this film, but it is what it is. Martin lawrence is hilarious from start to finish. As an action comedy i rate it 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good and bad, but couldve been much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>when one says bad boys, we all remember will smith and his $105, 000 porsche 911. when we say bad boys 2, we remember... not much at all actually.bad boys was a sleeper hit back in 1995, because it had solid amounts of dark humour, strong action and style. bad boys 2 delivers it in bucketloads, and its not necessarily better.in the first bad boys, everyone had something to prove. for bay, smith and lawrence, they all had to prove themselves in this movie. also the budget wasn't very big, so the action was 'condensed'. but in bad boys 2, there are no such issues. i loved bad boys, but i only kinda liked the sequel. so why?1. This is probably the biggest one. There is no core to bad boys 2. the original was set about will smith's anger to catch the man who killed max. but there's none of that in bad boys 2. the characters are basically just strolling through the story, even with the conflict between them.2. bad boys didn't take itself seriously, except for a couple of scenes, and to its benefit. the light drama works because of will smith's acting. the sequel tries to present a genuine conflict between marcus and mike, and also between marcus and his sister. the drama is too often hokey, because it is underdeveloped, and michael bay tries to get involved. face it, he cant do drama.3. The action. as i said before, the budget limited the amount of action in bad boys. so the action lasts only long enough to give us the adrenaline rush, and then the next scene comes in. in the sequel, the action is far more impressive, and a treat to watch, but it just keeps going for its own sake. the haitian house raid, for example, needn't be so long. it shouldve been a minor setpiece, but instead its overblown.4. also sadly missing is bad boys' colour pallette. there were some greatly lit scenes in the original, and some crafty colors. think of the orange hue in its opening scene. with the exception of the haitian's house and the opening bust, bad boys sadly lacks coloured light. it was one thing i was looking forward to in the movie, and i barely found it.now don't get me wrong, i enjoyed bad boys 2 for the most part. the causeway chase in particular still has me drooling. the comedy is also usually very funny, but again it also tries a little too hard to impress. but there are some moments to be had.I think bay may have lost touch with his audience. He doesn't seem concerned if there's too much action, even for male teens. its almost like he made this film because he can, not to provide entertainment. consider the running time of 2.5 hrs. thats far too long for a popcorn movie, no matter the content. that's my opinion and i hope I'm wrong.still, the movie works on some levels.ultimately, a mostly fun but deeply flawed popcorn blockbuster.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Which one is better? Back in the 1995, Michael Bay gave us a great action flick, full of suspense moments, great music score and a believable story packed with humorous "buddy-buddy" lines. After eight years of waiting, there's a sequel... ...which came as a little disappointment for me? Why? Firstly, because of the story. Come on...it's a fairy-tale for adults. The body count goes up to thousand and yet nobody of the good guys gets hurt. Also the movie is about half hour too long, but that would be o.k., if the jokes were at least half as funny as in first part. One the other hand, this one is packed with one of the greatest car chase and believable shooting scenes. Plus, if you like black humor and dead corpses, than this is the movie for you. I would say a slightly worse than the first part, but still suitable for one time watch, and that's why a mediocre5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>action masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BAD BOYS 2 is the film that justifies any prejudice against violent Hollywood cinema. However the trouble with current Hollywod cinema is the lack of violent and tasteless bits. Instead of providing the controversial juice, Hollywood cinema was submitted to political correnctness. BAD BOYS 2 breaks every PC rule and comes off as a hidden gem in season 2003. At last we face the contemporary police action comedy that is nutritious and deeply sunk into the unhealthy gravy of grindhouse cinema.MPAA distracted the evolution of violent cop flicks. This is why the formula or the genre failed to grow ever since the peaks from the eighties like LETHAL WEAPON or 48 HRS or early nineties as in THE LAST BOY SCOUT or POINT BREAK. The genre even retarded in the meantime. This is why BAD BOYS 2 makes me happy since it overcomes the missing links of genre evolution and shows us how exploitation should look like in 2003. It is especially significant since the BAD BOYS franchise relies on legacy of LETHAL WEAPON partnership chemistry and BEVERLY HILLS COP ethnic controversy. With the sequels it shapes the legacy of its` own.Action set-pieces are impressive, without too many digital shots. The action is imagined, staged and shot with flair. Bay spent a lot of money on this one and he tried to do whatever he could with mechanical effects. So the physical aspect of action is present and enjoyed in this one.Comedy is funny, dark, and dirty thanks to writer Jerry Stahl, the man who lived on the edge for a while. And guys like Shane Black, the guys who spent years living on the edge. Characters are mythically stylized and authors manage to persuade us for 144 minutes (golden rule-every masterful actioner is longer than 130 minutes) that there is a world where all women look like supermodels, where every car is the latest roadster, where bullets casually spin around, and where heavy gunfights witn enormous bodycounts are an everyday routine, and all cops look like as if they just stepped out of PREDATOR.BAD BOYS 2 carries a direct right-wing agenda. It feels as a reply to Michael Moore`s BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE. Without any restrictions, this film celebrates the machismo, the gun fetish and law enforcement jingoism. Beides BAD BOYS 2 feasts upon the xenophobic sentiment, anti-Communism (the villains are of Russian and Cuban origin) and the fear of domestic traitors (KKK deals drugs). This film also bashes bureaucracy and human rights initiative that are used as shelter for knon criminals with sm,art lawyers. Invasion of Cuba, in the climax, puts a smile on every right-winger`s face.To sum things up, BAD BOYS 2 is the major return to blueprints set by late Don Simpson, With Michael bay at the helm, this Bruckeheimer productiom marches toward Don Simpson`s roots. Simpson would like to see this crude and violent hyperkinetic piece of film. And he`d like to see his protege overcoming the status of low-grade quick-cutting pioneer. He`d enjoy seeing Michael Bay grow into a full-blooded auteur that comes of age with this film and delivers one of the bravest and most authentic blockbusters of the decade.</fullReview>

This time they are out to take down a Cuban drug kingpin Johnny Tapia (Jordi Molla) who is smuggling Ecstasy pills into Miami. Martin has some mental issues with his partner, and they squabble with each other all through the movie. Martin wants to break away from Will, and Martin has good reasons, especially, after Will shoots him in the rear. Martin does a great job in bringing humor to the movie. Some of the jokes will just make you laugh really hard. However, since this is a cop movie, there are a lot of bad guys getting killed. There is one fantastic car chase scene that is the best part of the movie. You will hate seeing all those new cars being destroyed. By the end of the movie, `They ride together, they die together, they are bad boys for life.' The sound is loud but if you love a lot of action, this 2-? hour movie is one to see. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad Boys 2 is the type of movie that everyone should like it. It has spectecular action scenes, spectecular special effects and humor that makes us laugh all day. The first movie was awsome and this one is even better. I don`nt know why some critics say bad things about this movie (they`re probably MAGNOLIA fans) because there is non-stop action. This is not one of those action movies where there are 10 minutes of action and than we have to wait for the last scene to see some action, no, Bad Boys 2 is one of the best sequels. The director Michael Bay makes a very good comeback after the disapoiting PEARL HARBOR he is one of the best directors of action movies there is no doubt about it and there is the big contribution of the best action/comedy actors there is. Will Smith &amp; Martin Lawrence = 100% of pure fun!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the calamity called "Pearl Harbour` Michael Bay has finally returned to his roots and made a bombastic hardcore action movie which will blow you out of your seat.The intense and excessive action - scenes are absolutely amazing and the amount of violence exceeds everything that you might have seen in an action - movie so far. Some people believe that it is unnecessary to depict how corpses get their heads chopped while Mike &amp; Marcus are running over them or making jokes while ripping kidneys out of corpses in the morgue but in my opinion that's the kind of sick humour that this movie needs and somehow it even fits! And don't forget: They are Bad Boys, not Riggs and Murtaugh!Unfortunately the German version is horribly translated. For example the poor 15 years old Reggie is no `Ludacris - lookalike' anymore but is suddenly called `Eminem - lookalike'. Of course no one in the audience was laughing because Reggie is hardly looking like Eminem!I guess if Bruckheimer was watching the German version he would vomit as much as Marcus did in the morgue. Even the fact that the German version was cut for around 5 minutes proves that people in Germany are very easily offended by violence. The other reason is that Columbia Pictures intended to gain a release for kids from the age of 16 so the movie had to be mutilated like this Russian guy in the Tapia mansion.If you have seen a few Bay - movies like `Bad Boys 1', `The Rock' or `Armageddon' and if you liked this movies you will also like (if not love) this one. The spectacular Highway - chase (which obviously has been done without any CGI at all) or even the 360 camera - scene are elements which no other action movie has demonstrated before.I was so incredibly entertained that I wished this movie would run twice as long but I guess in this case I'm the only one. If you are keen on plenty of entertaining testosterone - filled hardcore - action I can only recommend this movie. If your favourite movies are `The English Patient', `Titanic' or 'Pretty Woman' please stay out or otherwise don't complain afterwards!No doubt, it gets 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched this while I was deployed in Bishkek. This movie had me laughing non-stop. The lines between Martin / Will are priceless. I highly recomment anyone to see this movie if you are a action freak or enjoy a good comedy. I think the best scene was when they guy comes to pick up Martins daughter for the date. I can't wait to get this movie on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS AHEAD**VERY LONG REVIEW**I luv to have fun at movies and i want to be entertained. I had fun &amp; I was entertained at "X2," "Matrix Reloaded," &amp; "Terminator 3". Then came "Bad Boys II." I loved "Bad Boys," so i gave this a shot. I must say, that "Bad Boys II" wuz just way too friggin kool. I loved every damn second of it.Will Smith &amp; Martin Lawrence return to their roles as Mike Lowrey &amp; Marcus Burnett. They are just too damn great here. Their chemistry on-screen is just as enjoyable as it was in the first movie. This time around, Marcus is much more tense, working with Mike. While Mike, himself, is much more bad-ass in this film. Whereas in the first movie, their general lifestyles as a "family man" (Marcus) and a "playa" (Mike) clash, here in "Bad Boys II" the "zen/spiritual growth" of Marcus, completely contrasts to Mike's "easy-going/shoot-em first, ask questions later" attitude. The way these guys talk to each other is just plain funny &amp; real. They bag on each other, they swear at each other, and they make life a living hell for one another.... that'z the way it is for many people and how they deal with their friends, so don't cry over the "profanity." Who can honestly say that they haven't said the F-word, or the SH-word, or any other swear word? Damn, right. Despite all the tension between the two, they still, essentially have love for each other, are there for each other, and rise up to the situation ("We ride together, we die together... Bad Boys for Life").Supporting characters are great as well. Gabrielle Union's "Sydney Burnett" replaces Tea Léoni's "Julie Mott" as the female lead for the movie. Sydney Burnett is Marcus' baby sister, who works for the DEA. For the past five months, she has been dating Mike behind her brother's back. When Marcus finds out, it, obviously, pisses him off, and adds even more to the stress of having Mike Lowrey as a partner. Jordi Molla's villain, "Johnny Tapia" is the big-time ecstacy dealer. He smuggles illegal ecstacy to various parts of Miami (in a very creative way), which causes a lot of trouble when a few drug-dealers and dope-runners attempt at stealing ecs. Johnny Tapia isn't as intense as Tcheky Kayro's "Fouchet" from "Bad Boys," but he is a funnier character, especially when it comes to his daugher and his mom. But he, still, is a pretty bad-ass, considering he's willing to kill his own employees. Returning from the first movie is Joe Pantaliano, who plays Captain Howard. He was hilarious in the first movie, in giving the Bad Boys the low-down and getting pissed off at them for "doing another dead body." Here, he is even funnier. He delivers some really great lines, and all his scenes (at the station, near the bank, and at his home) are really funny. Also returning is Theresa Randle, playing Theresa Burnett; Marcus' wife. She didn't do as much in this movie, as she did in the first one, but it's okay. It was good for continuity to have her in "Bad Boys II."The plot, itself, isn't all that impressive, but it is simple. Basically, illegal shipments of ecstacy are flowing into Miami. The shipments spark wars between drug-dealers/gangs as they attempt to get hold of the ecstacy. TNT detectives Mike &amp; Marcus have to put the pieces together by taking on these various drug-dealers I.D. the dealer &amp; investigate the parlours of the drug-dealer in order to get sufficient evidence to put him away for good. Meanwhile, Marcus is really feeling the stress of being Mike's partner. Whereas Marcus prefers a bit more peaceful resolutions, Mike is the gun-totin' player. Things are worsened between the two when Marcus finds out that Mike &amp; Syd (Marcus' sister) are dating. Geez, that wasn't too hard, was it? I understood it all, during my first viewing.This movie is also HILARIOUS. This is good, clean, yet sick humor... I like it. I'm not some psycho, or some sick-minded individual, but this movie was pretty funny. the people in my theatre laughed, so I'm not the only one. The humor is very well-placed, whether it'd be bickering between the two main leads, or your classic situational comedy (ie. a scene in the video store, where Marcus &amp; Mike have a "heart to heart"). Some humor does seem out of place, but it is still REALLY funny (What Marcus &amp; Mike do to Reggie is mean... but damn it, it's just so funny... what father DOESN'T feel like doing that to the guy who's mackin his daugher... I thought so :P). Marcus' fear of corpses from "Bad Boys" is referenced, here in Part II. It's hilarious what he goes through at the morgue. The laughs don't stop there, though. They continue (very nicely) as Marcus tries to regain steadiness by taking a "nice" glass of water. The results are hilarious, yet at the same time, help move the plot of trying to nail the villain.Even with all the humor, there is still some drama involved, especially concerning Mike &amp; Marcus' dilemmas... it plays really well (especially the scenes following Marcus' discovery of Syd's kidnapping).Okay, people die, bullets are shot, cars crash, and CARS GO REALLY FAST!!!! Oh, my God, if I didn't know any better, I'd say it was an action movie... holy crap... it WAS an ACTION MOVIE!!!! The action is just amazing. The car scenes are visual eye-candy, and run nice and long. Don't complain, because it's not like BBII is the only movie that does this. This movie demonstrates how long car-chases SHOULD be. Nice &amp; long, &amp; lots of destruction. It's crazy. The gun fights are really good, too. I don't care what people say about Michael Bay, but he CAN direct. The gun fight between Mike &amp; Marcus and the Drug-Dealers in the house was AWESOME. The spin around the rooms with Mike on side, and the dealers on the other is really creative. It gives the viewer more of an interactive part in the fight, considering you witness the shots from various corners. Of course, people die, and bullets go through heads, and blood pours... cry me a freakin' river! This is an R-Rated movie and it warns people about violence... plus the title, "BAD Boys II" is a big giveaway. You can't have a movie about Bad-ass cops and NOT HAVE something like that. It is, in no way, IMMATURE to have something like that. If anything, it's MATURE, since any 10 year-old would be freaked. This is the big leagues; these are the Bad Boys.the Movie runs for 2 &amp; a half hours. Did i care? Not really. I was way too hyped over what was on the screen to care about what was on my watch.This review sounds like a ramble, but I LOVE THIS MOVIE. I'm not some freak hyped up on caffine. I had a great time at this movie. This movie got blasted by critics, like hell. This is, in no way, a big piece of art... It's a movie that appeals to all the bad-ass, easy-going, fun-loving ways of the movie goer. It delivers: Action, Comedy, Sexy Women, Funny Guy, &amp; a Bad-Ass Fresh Prince. It's great.I love "Bad Boys II." :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>empty, yes, but great fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two Miami cops, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, take on the Cuban/Hatian/Russian ecstasy cartel. The jokes and buddy squabbling are a bit predictable but still very funny. The ethnic and necrotic (about the dead) humor gets a bit thick at times, but the stereotypes broken down by two black cops with a white captain (rather than the usual other way around) more than make up for it. The furious police captain revoking the badges of his best but most irresponsible star officers is still there, for the most part, but Joe Pantoliano is still likable in the role.Okay, it's empty, it's gratuitous, but so is every movie that costs this much, and for a film that's nothing but a thrill ride, this one tops them all. It has a freeway chase scene at least twice as intense as The Matrix: Reloaded, and according to the director, none of it is CG. It has an order of magnitude of action more than Black Hawk Down, including, yes, some scenes with a Black Hawk full of Delta Force soldiers. It's much better than the first Bad Boys, not just in the amount of action but the camera work is all extremely stylized, and when I say extremely, I mean that every shot everywhere has something special about it. Whirling perspective pan out over several themes, red or blue glows to instrument panels, sweat drenched strip teasers, filthy gangsters counting fistfuls of cash, slow motion water splashing, dissected bullet impacts, drug capsules arcing through the air, beautiful panoramas of beach front manors. The editing alone probably cost more than most movies' entire budgets.</fullReview>

I had my doubts about this for film for two reasons Reason 1 XTC is not a serious drug to make a buddy cop film about its not even in comparison to drucgs like herion and cocaine.

Reason 2 they were making too much hype towards this film hype kills movies i.e. The Hulk, Potter, etcTime for the review this movie is not the kind of movie a film school student wouldn't enjoy seeing but more or less enjoy complaining about. Remember Siskel this is an action movie u take it on face value if all we did was watch the The English Patient, and Amelie we all be a bunch of critics. Don't get me wrong those kind of movies have their place but critics who only like those kinds of movies will never understand the simple joy of a good action movie. The people I'm speaking about wouldn't see the time and effort put into to making this movie as entertaining as it was for a moment during the craziest car chase scene I've seen in a while u have escaped u ordinary life and are in the movie that why these movies are good don't go out and critique a film that u can't even enjoy in the first place watch a movie on face value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disapointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some things never change - some should - the 2 is a clone of the 1st one with more chases, bigger guns and fancy new car for Smith's character. The "dead body - queasy Burnett" is back, we have seen that though. Overall impression is that the new cannot overshadow the 1995 freshness of the first installment. Other beside that the plot is paper thin, the duration of this is 2hrs 20 minutes - with a bit of editing one cold make it down to 1,45 minutes, there isnt really much substance in between the explosions and gun fights.The Ferrari car chase though, very dynamic, i could say even more so than the much lauded Matrix Reloaded freeway chase.Final words - by the end of the 2nd hour i was only hoping for it to end. Exhausting experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely violent, but still quite entertaining...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains PLOT SPOILERS, but nothing major.Bad Boys II is not a movie about a couple of cops. Sure, that's their "profession." They have a captain that yells at them when they cause too much property damage. They are supposed to have search warrants. But I wouldn't think that cops ever work like this. Racing down a highway, causing the destruction of 22 cars and a boat? Taking a helicopter, along with a lot of serious weaponry, into Latin America to save someone's sister with a small war? Oh wait, that's all irrelevant, cause they're bad cops anyway (no pun intended). I mean, they typically don't come away with any evidence until the inevitable small war at the end of a case. They're known by their peers on the force for being crazy. OK, plot holes explained.Wow, I really loved this movie. I mean, I've been anticipating it more than any movie this summer except Matrix Reloaded, but it was still better than anticipated -- an attribute I am always quite pleased to find out. Are there racist and homophobic jokes? Yes, but who cares? They were funny, and we know the filmmakers wouldn't deliberately offend anyone. Is the film violent? Yes, and extremely so I must warn, probably moreso than any recent movie. Be warned about a few corpses that get dropped onto the road during a car chase. A lot of this violence surprised me in its nature, which is rare, so please be warned.But you know, maybe director Michael Bay is doing us a favor by showing us, under the disguise of a violent movie that is supposed to have all the typical blood and explosions of a summer flick, how some violent acts would really happen. I mean, if someone is struggling off the side of a car door, while the car is driving up a narrow circling ramp, they might hit a column. If a bomb goes off right in the middle of several people, they will go flying in every direction. If someone falls flat on their back, due to a mortal wound, in the middle of a mine field, they will probably set off some explosions. Ok, I'm messing around here a bit with my "rationalizations." In truth, Bay probably just kept things so violent because he could. The R-rated version of Pearl Harbor wasn't shown in theaters. But the shock value made these quite exciting and amusing action scenes in Bad Boys II really effective.How about Will Smith and Martin Lawrence? I found them quite amusing, contrary to what many others will hear. Hopefully this will make some people forget about more recent duds from them (Men in Black II, Black Knight). By the way, the spanish house blown up towards the end was real. Bruckheimer bought it from people looking for it to be demolished. And the corpses? Apparently they were real. Disturbing. So for my personal enjoyment, I'd definitely give this flick a 10/10. Since I can handle the excessive violence, I really enjoyed all the thrills. Awesome car chases. Great shootouts. Some really funny parts as well. If I had to be objective, I'd probably say 5/10, but like I do with films such as The Phantom Menace and Lethal Weapon 4, I shall try to put objectivity aside.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read some of the negative comments some unfortunate misguided folks have said about this flick and I totally disagree with them. If you are looking for a funny, non-stop action, great effects movie then go see this one now ! Yes its a bit gory at times, yes there is cursing, yes there is drugs, yes there is adult themes, HELLO ?? What did you expect ??? You have to have a decent grip on reality to be able to appreciate this movie and not take it too seriously. Are some of the scenes over the top and unbelievable? Heck yes they are, its an action MOVIE, not real life but man let me tell you this movie delivers action and comedy in spades !! The rapport between M. Short and W. Smith was done very well and I personally could understand where both of them were coming from in there differences of opinion. I did not think their banter was overdone and I did not think the movie was too long. If your enjoying a movie don't you want to see it just go on and on? I do, much like I did with both of the LOTR movies which are long also. I'm telling you now if you understand you are going in to see an action MOVIE and don't try and take it too seriously you will have a BLAST at Bad Boys II !! For you naysayers I say: "Bad Boys Bad Boys what you gonna dooo, what you gonna do when they come for you ??" Later</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great sequel, it's amazing that a sequel for a hit movie outshines the former one nowadays. Clever, funny, and violent movie, at times gross and bleak with the subject of corpses falling out of funeral vehicles but overall a great movie with a clever plot line. It was explendidly long and I loved it. Just when I thought it was coming to an end at approximately the 2-hour mark an amazing turnaround happens and the whole story changes into a spicy finale. Who would have thought that the 2 bad boys would end up in THAT place (when you see the movie you know what I'm talking about). This movie must have costed over $140 million to make I'll tell you that right now. I never saw the first one and never bothered but I went to see this one and now I regret not having watched the first one (considering it's half as good as #2). I give it 5 stars out of 5, there's no reason to give it anything less, at last I see an action movie with an intelligent plot and no breaks or boring moments throughout the film. I wish I could say the same thing about "Terminator 3" but it disappointed me with their ridiculous and at times preposterous plot line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have to go around begging people for $8.50 to see 'Bad Boys' do it! This movie was great, it was a lot funnier than the first one. Although this movie had a lot of action, it was very violent.What's great about this movie though, is that it doesn't have one funny person, and one serious person (for example 'Men In Black'). Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are both very funny, making this movie hilarious.Overall this movie is great. You seem not to notice the 2.5 hours go by. The only problems are when the movie gets loud and explosive; it feels like there is an earthquake in the cinema, but the special effects were good. Another major problem is the Haitians!!! I am Haitian and I can tell you that those guys were not Haitian, they were probably Jamaican. There are many Haitian actors out there, they could have found some to play the parts, they didn't have to be lazy. Well, if you have some money in your pocket, don't hesitate to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Lowrey(Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett(Martin Lawerence) are back on the streets of Miami, trying to stop the flow of X into the United States by drug kinpin Johnny Tapia(Jordi Molla). This sequel to me is better then the first, it is more funny and better action then the first film. I mean the first 'Bad Boys' is one of my favorite films of all time, just because it took the old formula of buddy cop movies to another level. This ones continues that and takes it to another step, creating more violence and humor then the first film had.  Will and Martin continue their great on-screen presence they had in the first one, if you tried to make this type of action/comedy film with any other duo then these(try watching 'National Security'), you will see that these two just have a chemistry that can not be unbeaten. The two of them fighting back and forth makes you smile, and then they are there for eachother, you know they have love for eachother like true brothers. This film is my favorite film of the summer, has yet to be beaten by any film that has come out(though this one just beat out 'Pirates of the Caribbean') to take it's place as my favorite film of the summer, thought there are more weeks to follow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood action at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie can best be described as close-up, intense, non-stop, stylish action with lots of realistic gunplay, wild car rides, dead bodies, hardbodies and a light, crisp script. And all of it filmed, cut and spliced for maximum impact. Some folks call Bad Boys II a meaningless movie with a Miami Vice story line for the big screen. They're thinking too hard. I call it great entertainment. Far as action goes, very little went down that irritated me: you know, unrealistically volatile cars, bottomless semi-automatic clips and diving gunfire that always hit its mark. Oh those trite bits were there, but they flashed by so fast, I really didn't mind. I'd rank Bad Boys II as one of the best action movies of the year. Definitely better than Tomb II, A League of Extraordinary Gentlement, Arnold's T-3 and others I've forgotten. I saw a few kids in the theatre, but I wouldn't recommend you bring yours. For the kids, there was too much f-in' profanity, too many slo-mo Matrix-esque bullet entries and too many shots of flesh in wet skimpy suits or diced up in buckets. In sum: no Oscars here, but dang, what a fun movie for adults. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Martin Lawrence and Will Smith do it again. Funny, funny, funny. I know that cops don't drive expensive cars or live in big houses, but hey, "IT'S A MOVIE'!!! Great laughs even if the plot IS a bit shallow. I totally recommend this film, despite a few spoilers. Will Smith seems to have chemistry with all his co-stars, i.e. Tommy Lee Jones (Men IN Black), the list goes on.........</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a movie, people.......if you don't like it, stay home!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really get a kick out of all the people crying about how violent, profane and indecent they found Bad Boys II to be. Hello!!! It's an R-Rated action movie(and a damn fine one at that) so what exactly were you expecting, Finding Nemo? I like the fact that Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer had the balls to release a take-no-prisoners action flick like this instead of a "pussified" PG-13 movie like everything else Hollywood has given us this summer(Hollywood Homicide, Tomb Raider, 2 Fast 2 Furious, Charlie's Angels Full Throttle, The Hulk, etc). If you don't want to see a movie with a lot of violence and profanity, the solution is simple.......STAY HOME! There are plenty of other movies out there to see this summer so it's your own fault for going to a movie you know you're not going to like in the first place. I agree that a couple of scenes were probably unnecessary(I could have done without the morgue and the bodies falling out of the van), but other than that I thought this movie was the perfect action film and the best thing I've seen this summer. It's funny as hell and the action is non-stop from beginning to end. What more can you ask for from a summer movie? Don't listen to all the pompous movie critics because they don't like action films in the first place and they are very biased in their opinions. All they want you to see is movies like Seabiscuit or The English Patient. Well, screw that! I like movies where a lot of s**t blows up and as everyone knows, Michael Bay blows s**t up better than anybody in Hollywood. Go see Bad Boys II and actually get your money's worth from a movie this summer(a rarity indeed).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FINALLY, here´s our blockbuster for summer 2003</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of "Bad Boys (1995)" and "The Rock (1996)" for a long time, i wouldn´t have missed this movie for anything. My expectations were very low tho, considering all the "WANNABE BLOCKBUSTERS" I watched this summer. TBH all of them ruined my appetite for action flicks. Nevertheless I changed my mind and went to "Bad Boys 2" And I couldn´t believe it: IT ROCKED ! The problem with most comedy/action movies is, they put to much stress on the comedy factor, so afterwards the audience won´t even take the action/story seriously. BUT NOT HERE. Michael Bay knew what he was doing, so expect some "serious car chases and gunfights". Forget "A-Team Style" where they waste 10 mags of ammo and nobody is hurt, or cars spinning around their own lengthwise axis 10 times in air, crashing into a canyon and the driver climbs out untouched."POSSIBLE SPOILERS"There are lot of impressive scenes, so it´s hard to tell which one is the ultimate. F.e. a car chase on a highway, where the gangsters start dropping cars from their truck onto the roadway to get rid of their chasers. Or another car chase where a hummer "floors" about 30 houses made of steel plates (in the slums of Cuba), since they are full of chemicals for drug production u can guess what happens :)But this movie wouldn´t be anything without Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, they add this secret element that makes movies like "Bad Boys" work.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is definitly a crowd pleaser, that is, a crowd of people like me who are looking for top notch action and some original comedy. If youre looking for a great storyline, go see seabiscuit. This movie has some crazy action scenes that are very original and excellently crafted. Pretty much nothing in the movie looks cheesy or fake. The comedy at points is hilarious but is always pretty funny. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence prove again that they are one of Hollywoods better pairings. They are both hilarious and are both good actors regardless of there typecasts as Comedians. Definitly check this out, out of all of the sequels getting poured out this summer, this is one you wont want to miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a long time fan of the original Bad Boys, I've been waiting for this sequel for 8 years. It met every one of my expectations and blew some of them completely out of the water.The action scenes were amazing, except for some strange camera work that made the chase scenes a bit hard to follow. The way Marcus and Mike interact with each other is what makes the film great in my view. They have a great chemistry, the way that they deal/fight with each other is what makes them the funniest cop duo ever.The final scene where the two of them are sitting on the double raft as the pool breaks was one of the best scenes in the movie for me, because it shows their perfect chemistry together.I anxiously await the third Bad Boys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all i don't understand why everyone is complaining about the violence &amp; strong language in a film like this. The rating alone should give you the idea that this is not for the Barney (you know the purple dinosaur) lovers of the world. If violence &amp; strong language offend you in films, change genre (action,in case you not certain,i mean you need an IQ to understand complicated words) &amp; stop complaining about films that use it as means of entertainment. I mean the good guys kill the bad guys,does this not prove that good conquers evil. The story is pretty basic,cops fight the bad guys &amp; in the end they win.Clap clap!!!we all go home. The comedy mix in this film is brilliant, just as the case with its predecessor. The performances are by no means worthy of Oscars,but they are believable. This movie reminds me of what movies were made for in the first place. To entertain the target audience &amp; keep them coming back for more. If you didnt enjoy this movie,it is obvious you don't fall part of the target audience,so don't come back for more,i am sure there should be a Pauly Shore movie showing somewhere near you and that should keep you entertained till the crack of dawn. Step aside Matrix: Reloaded with its overdone visual fx and your over-the-top &amp; stupid story &amp; even worse performances,this films chase scene is by far better &amp; more believable &amp; as a film it is leagues ahead of whatever game the Matrix wanted to play. This is the definitive movie of the Summer,Fun,Fun,Fun,Fun,Fun.Oh yes i forgot to mention that this movie is Fun.Its so nice to watch a movie where you don't need a Masters Degree in Film Study to understand what is going on &amp; still be entertained. Go watch this now!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm tired of all the reviewers complaining about the profanity, gore, and violence. If you took the time to find some info about the movie before you saw it, the rating will tell you everything you need to know about the movie....Rated R for strong violence and action, pervasive language, sexuality and drug content... Movies have ratings for a reason people, so if things like the mentioned above bother you, well, then don't go see the damn movie! This movie was made to entertain fans of violent action movies. I give alot of props to this movie for bucking the Pg-13 trend in Hollywood. It hinders its Box Office, but wins it some respect from action fans. Like it or not some people find raunchy and racist jokes funny. Chris Rock has made a career out of it! Doesn't make you a depraved person because you find it funny. It's pretty niave to say someone "needs therapy" because they like this movie! If anyone "needs therapy" it's you for not recognizing the difference between pretend and real life! If you like hard action movies check this one out, if not, stay away and stay off internet sites about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sensational, Def #1 Action Movie of Summer 2003!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me first start off that it has been a long 8 years, I have been waiting for Bad Boys 2 the second I was done watching the first one. I have scene Bad Boys 2 twice in 4 days and plan to see it again. Now overall I must admit that the original is better just because of the plot, but other than that the two movies run hand in hand. I also love how Michael Bay explored new types of shots in this movie; with such slow motion matrix style shots and the camera angles in the car chase scenes will just leave you speechless. My favorite shot has to be in the Ferrari chase scene when Will Smith skids the ferrari to the side and pulls out the machine gun out of the window, the low angle is unbelievable. All in all I would have to say this movie is def aimed at the guys although i know a few girls that saw it that thought it was hilarious and great. So i will leave this review by saying, Explosions, Guns, Drugs, Chicks, Jokes, and Hot Cars; Gentlemen this is what we go to the movies for! Without a doubt Best Action movie of Summer 2003, Blows T3 out of the water. - Rick F 2003</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now granted I haven't seen the first one, which might have detracted from my viewpoint on this movie, but all-in-all, I'd say this was one of the most well-made movies I've seen in a while.Now, I like Martin Lawrence, but have never really thought Will Smith was that good of an actor. I must say though that Smith really showed his skill in this role. He's becoming a serious actor, and one with alot of potential for good roles like this one.Heck, I'd see this movie again just for the sake of the car chases. It's about time they show a V-12 Ferrari chasing a car delivery trailer while the bad guys cut loose the cars from the top trying to nail the Ferrari. Talk about eye-candy!I've always thought Michael Bay has a very rare talent in bringing out the best in movies he works on. He's kept his rep on this one for sure, definitely one of his best.Great movie, hope to see more like it soon, but I won't count on it, this was just too good!</fullReview>

This movie has everything: chases, explosions, blood and bodies everywhere, and jokes; some people have attacked this movie for all of these things. But then what summer action movie doesn't have these qualities? True there isn't much of a plot either and the movie is two and half hours long. These are only minor grievances and I enjoyed it a lot, despite having low expectations in the first place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better action and comedy than the first.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was shocked and pleased a lot during this film. I had never seen the first movie until I saw the trailer for this one. I rented Bad Boys and liked it, but hoped the second would be better and I was not disappointed. Although often the sequels are not as good as the first, every now and then they take what was a good concept in the beginning, and improve upon it. Bad Boys II has tons of action and despite what the critics say about that being all there was, there was a lot of comedy, and what I thought was a kick-a_ _ storyline. How can people say that this movie was just an excuse for over the top action without story? Did they pay attention? My only complaint is that there was a little too much gore for my tastes, but even that could not ruin the movie for me because it was just too damn entertaining, which afterall, is the WHOLE DANG POINT OF MOVIES PEOPLE!! I hate when I read reviews that say the same standard remarks- "it was too unrealistic; there was no plot; too much action, etc." Okay-- if you saw the trailer, then you already knew it was not going to be an academy award winning drama!! It shows a glimpse of the insane action, including the car chase scene. And as far as unrealistic goes, when are action-cop movies realistic? We have COPS for that. All entertaining police movies push the limits of reality- Lethal Weapon movies, Training Day to name some. At least the action was somewhere in the realm of believability, unlike the last Charlie's Angels movie, which was so far-fetched, but even I accepted that because you are not supposed to take it seriously- it's meant to be campy and fun! SO what I am saying is, this movie was amazing and don't review movies if you do not understand the whole concept and spirit of it. Take each movie for what it is. Even "Dude, Where's My Car" is a great movie if you go into it knowing that it is stupid humor. If that is not what you find funny, then it is not your thing. That does not make it bad. Okay, I'm done with the lecture, for now.GO WATCH THIS MOVIE WITH THE RIGHT FRAME OF MIND, PEOPLE! 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Violence, gore, spectacular chase scenes, unbelievable stunts, and two reckless cops who could only be real in the world of Hollywood fantasy.Bad Boys II is an orgy of carnage, drug dealers, gross out language, high tech pyrotechnics, and good chemistry between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence.Will &amp; Martin are a cross between Abbott &amp; Costello, and an extreme version of Starsky &amp; Hutch.The funny moments are very funny. The chase scenes are ridiculously exciting, and the rapport between Smith and Lawrence...very entertaining.Despite the negatives, Bad Boys II is the best action pic I've seen so far this Summer. Much better than a forgettable TIII.Check reality at the door when you walk into this movie. For shock value, thrills and spills, outrageous stunts, and entertaining chatter between Will Smith &amp; Martin Lawrence, Bad Boys II delivers.It's 2 - 1/2 hours for a reason. A tad long, but everyone cheered at the end of the movie after seeing it among a packed house on a Saturday night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last night I saw Bad Boys II at my local theater with a friend of mine. Before I went to see it, I had read all the reviews (most of them negative I might add), and went into the theater with low expectations. Many complain about the excessive gore, or the fact that it ends a little under 2 1/2 hours. With all of this in mind, I went to see it anyway. While I do agree the gore is a little TOO much, the movie is paced perfectly. It isn't too long or too short and allows the viewer to really connect with the characters and whats going on on-screen. Both my friend, everyone in the theater around us and I all seemed to enjoy the movie, which is most important. I give it *** out of **** for an exciting and sometimes funny movie.</fullReview>

I'll admit, a few scenes were a bit over the top, but that's what SUMMER ACTION MOVIES are all about!!! I thought the 2 and 1/2 hour run time would kill it for me, but I think the movie flowed well and it really offset the time.

Excessively violent and vulgar sequel to the popular buddy cop flick with Smith &amp; Lawrence reprising their undercover team this time out to dispatch a ruthless Cuban drug lord (Molla) with the aid of Martin's DEA sister Union. Frenetically fast-paced guilty pleasure popcorn flick abetted with criminal ease by director Michael Bay (who has a small cameo) and executive produced by testosterone driven Jerry Bruckheimer manages to ignite several fires under their stars' incentive to provide some fun amidst the seemingly relentless carnage that seems unnecessarily over-the-top.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No, it doesn't have a great plot, and would be better off without Martin Lawrence, but this is probably the best straight-up action movie (not counting war movies and scifi) since Die Hard 3.My only real faults with the movie is how unfunny and annoying Martin Lawrence is and the sometimes too-quick cuts and too-close shots - especially in the first car chase, where some wider shots would have really shown the scope, speed, and destruction of the chase.Go in to just have fun and enjoy the ride, 8 of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget about action this movie is funny,funny,funnnnny!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bad Boys 2 is a great popcorn action flick, with a whole lot of laughs and with plenty of bull$hit to go with it. Its got everything you want in an action movie, cool slow motion bullet effects like the Matrix. Big time explosions,insane shootouts, and alot car chasing scenes that are out of this world. The movie is extremely long, 2 and half hours. But with all the action it has you kinda don't realize it. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are comedy show throught out the entire movie. You'll be laughing from beginning to end. Every scene is comical I couldn't stop laughing. The comedy is the most positive and best thing about this movie, cause the story is not. But today's audience really doesn't care about a story. The best way I can sum up the plot is Scarface 2003 meets super cops that turn into War Heroes. There's alot of bull$hit in this movie. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are supposed to be narcotic cops but by the end of the movie they look like Vietnam War Heroes. They go through shootout after shootout,explosion after explosion and never make you feel like they're in real danger or even coming close to experiencing death. Except for one time and that's in the end. Even that is bull$hit too cause all the guy had to do was pull the trigger when he snuck up behind W. Smith with a gun pointed at his head and he would've been killed. Its like they're super duper cops that can be harmed no matter what the situation is. I couln't believe the goryness in this movie, its extremely gory. People getting their head runned over with cars,bodies getting chopped up and blown to pieces. Definitely not a movie for kids. Bad Boys 2 is a above average movie I enjoyed everything in this movie. I recommed this movie to anyone that likes pure good guys vs bad guys action flicks. The action is fantastic from start to finish and the comedy aspect of it is even better. But the plot is nothing you haven't seen before. I give it 7 out 10. Oh yeah by the way this movie shows small glimpses here and there towards the end of some fine @ss latin women in Cuba, my god.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard nothing but good things about this movie from numerous people I know and I decided to ignore many of the negative reviews I have read here and see it anyways and I sure am glad I did. Not only did I love the movie but the entire theatre was rolling in the aisles. Two scenes in particular had me almost in tears (Martin after "drinking the bad water", and the boyfriend at the door). Don't listen to any of the psuedo-movie critic wannabee's and go see this movie immediatly! I will admit that it has a lot of strong language, so if the way people talk in real life offends you, you might want to skip this movie. Otherwise, if non-stop action, jokes and supurb buddy cop scenes, and did I mention big (bleep) explosions and action, is your thing run out and see this. I highly recommend it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't understand any negative comments on this movie. this is a buddy cop movie and anyone who goes into this movie not knowing what that entails is, to put it kindly, an extremely uneducated moviegoer. it is an action/comedy and this flick had plenty of both. i saw a very late night showing of this movie after a full day of playing volleyball and was very tired. the action had me on the edge of my seat, constantly clenching my girlfriend's leg(and vice versa), and wondering what they were going to come up with next. some people are saying it's 'over the top', but i am very critical when it comes to the believability of chase scenes, etc. (like an 18-wheeler keeping up with a motorcycle in matrix 2???? c'mon now) and, i assure you, the stunts are not only 95% believable(o.k., a couple spurious moments) but also fantastic. the banter between martin and the fresh prince had me laughing out loud. joe pantoliano was again great as the on the edge captain with a healthy fear of culpability to the everpresent, but never visible, police commissioner. also more than worth mentioning were the klansman, the russian, the cubano, and, yes, john salley. In my opinion, this sequel, while building on the bits that made the first one great, far surpassed it's predecessor. to put it simply, it ROCKED!!!! 4 OF 5 STARS, 8 OUT OF 10. THIS MOVIE WAS DELICIOUS!!!! hope this helps, me</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bigger, badder, uncut. This movie gets going and never really stops. Some of the critics saw that this movie is too long at 2 and a half hours of movie. It really seemed as if was only 1 and a half hours because you are on the edge of your seat for the last hour or so. The jokes are better, especially Marcus' protecting his daughter from her date, and the gay t.v. scene. If you liked the first one, you will love everything about the second one. Unlike most sequels, i.e. Austin Powers, and many this year, this movie takes what was succesful from the first, adding to it in the second, and taking it jsut that much further.Smith is the ultimate bad-ass in his re-inactment of "trigga Lowry," the utterly believable action junkie, whereas Lawrence's return of the whiny brave when he has to be cop brings a return to his comedic brilliance. The arrival of the sensuously beautiful bad girl, Union, adds fresh action, humor and love to the film.The car chases are remarkably vicious and vivid. The firefight in the pink house is just all bad ass. The final assault is superb. Lawrence's intrepetation of an X'd up cop is just f@#king hillarious. Everything that you love about the first film will be everything you really love about this one.Not many sequels are as good as the first. The critics didn't like either one of them. Don't listen to them. Some times you just want to see some s*** get blown up. This is the film to see for that. Now thats how you make a sequel, from now on, that's how you make a sequel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gleeful action excess with a sick sense of humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*"Bad Boys II" is a throwback to the action movies of yesteryear. This is the kind of flick Schwarzenegger used to make with gleeful abandon. There was no regard for human life, no sense of living in reality and mass murder was hilarious. My God, this movie just didn't care one tiny bit. I loved it. "Bad Boys II" gives the critics the finger and hits a sledgehammer over the head of action movie fans for their blood and guts fix. It was a Road Runner and Coyote cartoon with dead bodies all over Miami. Beep Beep!Every part of my soul is telling me that it's wrong to like a movie that promotes such anti-social values as laughing at decapitation. There was horror movie level gore in this flick but it was all done for laughs. Look! His skull popped open! AH-HAHAHAHA!! Stop! You're killing me! Bodies are meant to be mangled and blown up. And mangled they get.So there was some story about drugs coming into Miami or some nonsense. That's not important. What is important is Smith and Lawrence destroying Miami as viciously as possible while cracking jokes about their chaos. Gabrielle Union shows up as Lawrence's sister and looks great in a bikini. That was a pleasant scene to help lighten up the carnage.It's very important that you approach this madness knowing that nothing you see has anything to do with reality. If real cops acted this way, they'd be executed immediately. The name of this game is car chase carnage. If you like wild, violent car chases, you need to see this movie. That's what it excels at. I was very pleased. The movie is a bit too long but when your excessive length is due to excessive violence, I'm happy to stick around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really love this film ten times better than the first movie. I would see it again and also buy the soundtrack CD. I favorate scene was when Mike and Marcus were in a gunfight with the Haitians in their own apartment and the camera pans around like the Matrix movie. So awsome. I love action-comedy movies. Michael Bay is good film director when it comes to action flicks, same for Jerry Buckheimer. When I finish college and earn my degree for film &amp; video, I will form my own production company and make films written by me and shot on MiniDV. Will Smith and Martin Lawrenace's performances were very funny and its cool. Its a definity must-watch movie. One of the greatest summer blockbuster hits of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith team up for this remake of the original, funny and successful "Bad Boys". Director Michael Bay turns this into a 2 plus hour marathon of ridiculous gun fights and car chases. Too many explosions to count and extremely weak banter between the leads and all other characters. Absolutely nothing of interest here ... even the bad guys are impossible to take seriously. And what's with the chunky daughter of the drug lord? Every chase scene and gun fight lasts at least 50% too long. The crisp dialog between Smith and Lawrence from the original is no where to be found. This is not worth the time investment. Best stuff is John Salley as the computer nerd - but even that is over the top.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, by an often unfairly judged director...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie can be looked at one of two ways. As a visually stunning cinematic achievment, or as a dizzying display of nothing more than explosions, car chases and paper thin characters. If you are a movie critic I'm sure you looked at it the second way. But as for me and everyone else in my theater, this film was well amazingly well put together. It disgusts me when I read some of the reviews by movie critics, I would like someone to tell me what was so awful about this script! I mean honestly, was it a character driven independent film? Hell no, so than why must everyone take such shock that in an action film involving drugs, cops, and a plethora of firearms that their were (brace yourselfs) deaths! and even worse...swearing! Grow up people, the script was written by adults for adults, I thought maybe that R rating would have given that away. The action sequences were brilliantly put together, and so what if they were over the top. I don't want to go to the movies and see what a real police stand off looks like. I could turn on cable television for that. Michael Bay I commend you not only for this picture but for everyone you've ever done. This is a man who is not only a success at what he does, but does it all with a**hole critics griping over every sequence, over every word of dialogue, over every actor, over every minute detail in his film. And he continues to make these films, and they contain to be more and more successful so tell me James Berardinelli of reel view (Bad Boys II isn't just bad - it's a catastrophic violation of every aspect of cinema that I as a film critic hold dear.) Do you think you are any better? Are five million people going to read your angst ridden little film review? NO!! This movie was honestly a work or art, visually stunning, great action, better than I anticipated acting, and finally another well done directing job by Michael Bay. I would give it 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was by far the best action of the summer. Not quite as good as the first, however, in this second Bad Boys the action scenes are just ridiculously sweet. It is a good ride the entire movie and the running time of over 2 hours was fine with me. The action sequnces are amazing and the car chase on the highway, might even be better than Matrix Reloaded's infamous car chase. I was waiting for a good action movie from Bay since his latest movies and been somewhat dismal. After awesome movies like The Rock and Bad Boys, I waiting for another one, and this was it. Only thing I missed in Bad Boys 2 was the movie theme from the first one by musician Marc Mancina, however, Trevor Rabin did a good job with the music for the action sequnces. All in all, this movie kicked ass and I am happy for once this summer. Pirates of the Carribean was good too...</fullReview>

You go to movies to have fun and bedazzelled by the thrills. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence do team up great together..movie is being criticized for being too raunchy and rough towards the audience, but it is just being true to its title bad boys, It is not a family movie to begin with its a movie bout Bad boys and yea it is going to have mature hardcore adult fun, to expect it to be a good family action entertainer its being just straight up naive. What is so bad about Rat mating we see that when we flip to Discover or animal planet. i mean movie was better then any other movies this summer or just as good as any other big movies this summer. It does live up to the expectation. it is good to see Martin Lawrence and Will Smith get back to what they do good, make good comercial cinema that hits the box office window right on the target. Will smith as good as ever, and martin Lawrence shows that he could steal couple of scenes even though teamed up with Smith. This summer had lot of disappointments and lot of surprises but this wasn't any of them what i thought i got. great fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How summer action movies should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, this movie clearly demonstrates that a cohesive well though out story is meaningless and almost pointless when it comes to making an action movie. It does not try to make any political statements about drugs, cops, dirty cops, or even woman taking part in a man's world. It simply has incredable action scenes accompannied by hilarious skits performed by Will SMith and Martin Lawrence. Also, it is very rephreshing to see an action movie that is not afraid to get almost disturbingly violent. In fact, many of the jokes are said within the most violent moments. About the only complaint I have about the movie has to do with Micheal Bay's way of directing. He likes to shoot things very close as well as have music video like edits which almost takes away from the action. Also, ther are a couple scenes that are put there simply to be there with absolutely no pint whatsoever (this might sound contradictory to what I said in the beginning but Let me explain). One scene in partricular is when they show Will Smith dressing up in a designer suit with Martin Lawrence impatiently waiting for him. Now, this scene is very brief and leads to a very lack luster joke which is shown in the trailer ( "dont hate the player hate the game" "I hate the tailor"). That is the scenes only purpose for being. All the other funny scenes at least had something to do with the mixed batch of a story and lead to great luaghs and then moved on to something related in some way. The "hate the tailor" scene is just spliced in with absolutley no purpose and leads to nothing of any signifigance of any kind.To sum up, this how action movies used to be, offensive and void of any logic but hilarious and intense. No deep thinking is invovled, just sit back and enjoy the images as they pass by (especially in the night club scene where Micheal Bay gets the most stylistic and degrading shots of women in short skirts)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw T3 on opening night, I saw the Matrix reload just after opening night and neither of these blockbuster movies can hold a candle to the non-stop action of this film. Simply put, this was the best summer movie I have seen in a long time. The feelings of surprise and delight that I had brings me back to the summer that the original Matrix was released. I will definely buy this when it comes out on video.When the movie ended I had a hurting side and tears of laughter rolling down my face. I could not believe the chemisty between Martin and Will. This movie worked for me. For those of you who chose to hate it or belittle it, what movie this summer would you rank better or more action packed?On a side note, where do my fellow reviewers get the nerve and desire to belittle this movie. There has been no movie with such little hype that has been any better save Antwone Fisher.If you had only 10 bucks and you could see only one movie this summer. Go see Bad Boys II, you won't be disappointed unless of course you don't like to laugh or enjoy your movie going experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definately one of the best summer movie, maybe the best summer movie (other than Nemo but thats animated) out. Bad boys 2 is getting really bad reviews, I have no idea what the reviewers watched. Anyways, the storyline is pretty basic and 2hr30min passes by really quick. It was very, very humorous especially the 15 yr old scene and the scene at the electronic store. Everyone gave it an ovation at the end and it well deserved it. It is definately 100 times better than the first and Martin Lawrence got much better at acting and Will Smith is just Will Smith. 9/10 (i rarely give any movies higher than that)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At times you go into a sequel thinking that you are looking for more out of a movie then the first one. BBII fits the bill. The team of Lawrence and Smith once again are the best cop comic team in the business today. The action in this movie was off the charts. The humor was continuous which has not been a high point in movies that have come out in recent years. The humor and one liners in BBII are classic. One thing I can say I HOPE they team up again for BBIII. Excellent Job!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw T3 on opening night, I saw the Matrix reload just after opening night and neither of these blockbuster movies can hold a candle to the non-stop action of this film. Simply put, this was the best summer movie I have seen in a long time. The feelings of surprise and delight that I had brings me back to the summer that the original Matrix was released. I will definely buy this when it comes out on video.When the movie ended I had a hurting side and tears of laughter rolling down my face. I could not believe the chemisty between Martin and Will. This movie worked for me. For those of you who chose to hate it or belittle it, what movie this summer would you rank better or more action packed?On a side note, where do my fellow reviewers get the nerve and desire to belittle this movie. There has been no movie with such little hype that has been any better save Antwone Fisher.If you had only 10 bucks and you could see only one movie this summer. Go see Bad Boys II, you won't be disappointed unless of course you don't like to laugh or enjoy your movie going experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool and exciting, definately a movie to see in Theatres *possible spoiler*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was amazing, and a lot of fun to watch in theatres. This movie is an entertaining film for people who love action(like me), for people who love humerous sh**t(like me), and for people who can handle the creepy things shown in this movie...like...human guts....and u should check out the movie if ur interested so far ;)The actors, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence work great with eachother. This movie can get people's attention quickly, because it's unique and it's a sequel that stands by itself. It doesn't need any support from the first "Bad Boys" movie. THat movie was great, but this movie is incredible. Some things might be irritating in the movie to a certain audience, like the dead bodies, and how Johnny Tapia(the a**whole) had the person's(he was doing a "deal" with)partner cut up to pieces(body parts were all in a huge tin can on top of the table with all the blood dripping), it's fake but sooo crazy. I love it!The soundtrack is da bomb! I'm a person who's open minded to all types of movies and people, you could check me out and see all the movies I've rated and then you will understand what I mean. I love movies and actors, and maybe by reading this I am persuading you to see the movie. It is a good film to see in theatres, it is a good film, period. Watching action movies in theatres is a lot of fun! I bet "The Italian Job" doesn't have this much action in it...plus this movie is hilarious. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence made everyone crack up in the theatre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Moose Hole - Review of Bad Boys II</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is nothing more reliable to the major studios of Hollywood more then sequels. That had been a known fact within the movie industry until recently. Sequels were once made only for films that had made more then a few million more then their production budget or had been critically accepted by the American public. That isn't so any more. The original Charlie's Angels and Tomb Raider films made more then their budget, not too much though, but had been hammered by the public. And yet sequels were made anyway and Full Throttle has proven the sequels are as reliable as they once were. Another truth about sequels was that you never made one to a film that was more then a few years from the original but films like Terminator 3 and Bad Boys II have gone against that truth. Though Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines has proven to be a success, it surely looks to not live up to the success of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, which debuted on the same weekend in 1991. Will Bad Boys II follow the same path? One can make argument that it could but it has many good things going for it. Jerry Bruckheimer, who had failure with Bad Company last summer, has been on a roll lately with the success of Pirates of the Caribbean just a week before the opening of Bad Boys II and whenever he teams up with good friend and director Michael Bay, there always seems to be success. Look at films like the original Bad Boys, Armageddon and Pearl Harbor for examples. But like it has been said before, nothing can be reliable now days. Will Bad Boys II falter under sequelitis or will it be able to end the summer with a bang?The story revolves around the original Bad Boys as they attempt to take down another drug lord in the city of Miami. Only this time they appear to be bigger, badder, and, hopefully, wiser then in the first installment. A couple of things have changed since the original film. The friendship and partnership between Mike Lowery and Marcus Burnett has suffered greatly, mostly to the drastic shoot-'em up tactics of Mike who, in an effort to save the life of his partner, accidentally shoots a bullets that slices through his partner's butt cheek. Marcus can't take this kind of pressure anymore and asks for a transfer with the acknowledgment of his partner. Marcus isn't the only one with secrets as Mike has quietly been dating Marcus' sister, Syd, for a couple of months. Eventually these secrets will have to come out but not until they have completed an important mission to save the city of Miami from rivaling drug dealers. A Cuban drug lord has grown tired of losing money and ground in the drug market, so he begins to set off a drug war within the city itself allowing him to reap in all the profits will rival gangs kill each other and innocent teens overdose on ecstasy. The Bad Boys much put aside their differences even when their secrets come out because Syd soon becomes involved and her life is at stake. The story for Bad Boys II is pretty confusing and unless you really pay attention or are narcotic detectives, you will be lost within the first hour of the film. But sticking to a straight forward story does not apply in Bruckheimer films as they seem to focus more on the action sequences then realism. The problem with the film is that it seems to rely too much on that fact but comes off as being too overtop for many to accept fully. Bay and Bruckheimer seem to ask too much from the audience this time around then they did in the original which hurts the film greatly.Outside of Lawrence and Smith, there really wasn't too much of a cast in the original film. That is slightly this time around as there are plenty of cast members that are focused on beside the amazing duo. Some do a better job then others as not every single character within the film works on the same level. Though the characters Lawrence and Smith play seem to have problems with each other in the film, that doesn't seem to be the case involving the two actors as they seem to play very well off each other. They even seem to work better together then in the original film. Smith is hilarious in the film though his repeating like `Hell no' and such three times seems to get tiresome. Lawrence is great as well and his character doesn't get to a point where he is too annoying. Gabrielle Union takes on the role of Syd, the love interest of Smith's character and the sister of Lawrence's. The problem with her character is that there aren't that many scenes where she is giving a chance to show her full range of acting ability. Another problem is that she seems to be missing for good portions of the film until she is needed again later in the story. Joe Pantoliano, who plays the captain of the narcotic detective division, is great but he is also missing for good portions of the film as two members of his team members run rampit in Miami crashing cars and destroying tons of public property.Overall, Bad Boys II is just another good action popcorn flick but one that seems to ask way too much from its audience. Many of the action sequences in the film seem too over the top for anybody to really believe even within a Bruckheimer film. There seems to be too much of everything in this film. Too much foul language was used with the words sh*t and f**k and n***er being said almost every five minutes of the feature. Sure, many of them were used in a comical way but even so, it seemed to be too much. There also seemed to be an excess amount of sex and violence within the film including a pornographic scene involving a black woman in a car and far too many scenes where characters have their brains blown out. Even the time length of the film is too much at a longer then usual two hours and forty minutes. But the comedy presented by Will Smith and Martin Lawrence was too funny to have the bad outweigh the good. They present a style to the film that make the tiresome experience worthwhile. Though the film can not be as highly recommended as Bruckheimer's other film, Pirates if the Caribbean, it is worth checking out during a lazy afternoon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Movie That Changed The Game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the Action movie. I thought T3 was it but this one is much better. Will has never been better. Martin is in rare form. And Michael Bay is in his prime. I would say that the movie might have been too long but since I loved every minute of it I won't. This has the potential to be my favorite action franchise, beating Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, Bevrely Hills Cop, and Rush Hour, if they do a third one. Anyone who didn't like this movie probably doesn't like the genre and should not have seen it. But if you're into a straight up action movie (not that much CGI) with a lot of laughs, this is your movie. As a matter of fact, action movies from now on are going to have a tough time being enjoyable after watching BB2. I can honestly say, this movie has changed the ac</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Basically Bad Boys II is an all out destruction, ask questions later, explosion fun fest. Director Michael Bay destroys nearly every set in the movie and it isnt done with the help of obvious CGI. If you really want to pick it apart, then you are going to the movies for the wrong reason. This movie is simply made to entertain, and it does. Sure it gets a little long, but the ending is worth your time. For fans of the 1995 original and those looking for a fun summer movie, Bad Boys II is it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a real fun movie if you can remember to forget to bring your brain to the theatre which i can do. Most movies have boring spots at some point, but Bad Boys is always action packed. I thought it was better than the first, maybe not as hip because the leads are now old fogies, but Lawrence is very funny. He should be funny since this is the 50th straight movie he's played a cop. Anyways. It's good, but (spoilers) I just want to see the deleted scenes on the dvd when the military questions why Miami PD is fighting the Cuban Army, why Mike Lowry never asks for backup,and why special op guys from wars past are willing to risk their lives to save one girl. Not very realistic, but a lot of fun, and very funny. Peace out yalls.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Boys 2 bad ass</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bad Boys 2 was a summer blockbuster in every sence of the word; car chases, gun fights, and plenty of explosions. Also, there was a healthy dose of comedy which I wasn't expecting. This is the type of movie critics hate, but the rest of us normal people love. To start the plot was fairley inane; But it was strong enough to pull the audience into the next action sequence. Warning spoilers ahead. The pair of narcotics cops end up working on the Tactical Narcotics Team(TNT). They try to stop a drug lord who is polluting the streets with ecstacy. working undercover for the drug lord is Marcus's sister:she gets kidnaped(big suprise),so it's up to Mike and Marcus to rescue her. That just enough plot for the action to commense. There is a freeway chase thet blows the Matrix away: almost littorally. Micheal Bay does a phenomenal job with the chase. Say what you will about Bay, but he does the best action sequences in the movie business. He manages to load the movie with explosions and gun fights. Also, there are comedy bits that make you hold you stomace you are laughing so much. Marcus accidentlly taking ecetacy is one of the funniest bits in the film. The story is completly unrealistic but fun to watch. A slightly more realistic story would have been better. But, no movie is perfect. But for a summer blockbuster this movie is a great ride.</fullReview>

The action was much better and not over the top like others are claiming. This one was much funnier than the first. Martin really stole the show with his comedy in this one. The story was what you would or should expect from a summer action blockbuster. I get tired of reading reviews on here about people knocking movies like this cause the story is not an Oscar worthy screenplay. I mean did you really expect that going in to it? Did you see the first one? I respect others opinions dont get me wrong it is just that you have to go into a movie in the right frame of mind in order to enjoy it. This is not a movie that causes the audience to think alot which is fine. If you spend the entire two and a half hours over analyzing the movie for all the unrealistic things then of course you are not going to enjoy it. It is a movie for goodness sake. They never say that the film is based on a true story or actual events. If you are unable to suspend reality for a few hours and just enjoy a movie then dont waste your time or money and then come on here and cry about it. This movie is one of the best movies I have seen this year. It has something for everyone. I would like to see a Bad Boys 3 if they treat it like they did this one. They dont need to rush and throw one together so it can be out in a year or two but Will and Martin have an undeniable chemistry together and this movie series are both of these actors best work. If you are looking for a great time at the movies and not Shakespeare then this is the movie for you.You are your own best critic.9/10</fullReview>

If you are looking for a great time at the movies and not Shakespeare then this is the movie for you.You are your own best critic.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heavy Going !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After many doomed movies like (Wild Wild West), (Ali) and (Men in Black II) Will Smith needed a hit. At the same time, Martin Lawrence after so many wrong choices needed also a hit (and he still does!). So why not they both return to the lucky title that brought them fame earlier. It was a comic action that proved itself as a hit in 1995. But the sequel they made was close to a hit to our faces more than anything else !Simply it has: the evil guys (a smart one with an idiot one, a war between them, undercover mission, a search for truths.. Just too many), the good guys and some comedy between them, the action between the 2 teams, and a difficult love story (between Smith and Lawrence's sister). These usual lines were done so unusual. You want to know how? I'll tell you? It's so damn nasty (a naked corpses being thrown in the street, being crashed by a car, a chopped off people, messing with dead bodies in a morgue, .. the list is long believe me), extremely violent (bursting blood and torn-off limbs all the time), less fun (aside from the matter of a bullet in Lawrence's butt in the start nothing was funny, even Joe Pantoliano's nervousness was dull and recycled from 100 other movies), all of that while being overblown in the same time too (the movie is 2 hours and a half long)!!!There is something really wrong with (Micheal Bay) this round. At times I felt that his desire was making a buddy-action epic, with a realistic feel especially while having so drastic violence, many ? not comic ? dialog, and a character of a drug dealer who has fat daughter, hates his racist mother, and refuses drawing the story of Christ???. There is a scene where the men of the swat team are talking proudly about the powers of their motherlands (this suits a Seven Samurai kind of tale!). It was a mistake to produce something serious out of what's supposed to be just funny action flick, otherwise this is the wrong way to do it!. At other times I felt that (Bay) wanted the biggest blockbuster ever done, with endless car chases, plenty of helicopters and non-stop explosions. But eventually it looked like a movie with a potbelly. (Bay) should have eliminated at least half an hour (I don't know why the storyline of the Russian guy mainly !). Let alone that his blockbuster ended up as bloody popcorn, bad "bad boys" movie, or simply anything but a funny action flick!In a word: when you go to a movie of that kind to watch people get exploded into halves so you must be shocked, sick, and most of all deceived. Not Gabrielle Union's great beauty can make up for it. Not Bay's crazy action can make up for it. And not (Amir M. Mokri)'s dazzling cinematography as well. I'm sorry to say it, but this is not as good as the first movie; which wasn't a very good movie in the first place. Next time, I'll maybe watch the action sequences only. Or maybe I won't!What ever happened to the buddy-movies lately ?!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad II</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to imagine that anyone out there could actually have been clamoring for a sequel to 1995's "Bad Boys." Yet, eight years later, along came "Bad Boys II" to remind us that even the least deserving film can get itself a follow-up, provided it has the right amount of high-powered corporate backing and big enough names in the cast to get the job done. As with most sequels, this one comes replete with a Roman numeral neatly tucked behind its title to give it that extra special touch of class. However, in this case, perhaps the II really stands for "twice as bad." This new film, which is indeed even longer, dopier and duller than the original, once again stars Will Smith and Martin Lawrence as two Miami P.D. undercover cops who spend most of their time kvetching at one another in between car chases and shootouts (and often during as well). As this is a Michael Bay film, rest assured that the gun battles and vehicular mayhem have been designed on so grand and epic a scale that we wonder that the entire city of Miami along with a good part of Cuba haven't been reduced to rubble by the time Smith and Lawrence are done doing their thing. The nominal plot involves the partners tracking down a Cuban drug kingpin (yawn) who is smuggling Xtasy to the states hidden inside gutted corpses. This allows for some truly vile humor at the expense of some innocent dead bodies ("Six Feet Under" this definitely is not). To complicate matters, Lawrence's beautiful kid sister is also working undercover for the NEA and the fretting Lawrence does everything he can to make her job all that much more difficult. The screenplay by Ron Shelton and Jerry Stahl encompasses every cop buddy cliché known to mankind. First, we have the hyper distraught captain who somehow fails to see the genius behind the boys' unconventional crime fighting methods. Then, in place of characterization, the boys engage in a running repartee of stale jokes and tiresome put downs that continues on even though all around them bullets are flying and bodies are piling up. Finally, there is the threatened sundering of the team over petty differences and the equally inevitable patching up of differences at the end. And the humor is so lowbrow that the film lacks even the saving grace of laughter to make it all bearable. Basically, this sequel is just another opportunity for Bay to beat his audience over the head with frenetic editing and mind numbing action. "Bad Boys II" might have been more aptly named if they had simply dropped the word "Boys" out of the title altogether. It would at least have given audiences a more truthful and accurate description of the contents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Boy Bay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bigger, badder, and worse than a tetanus shot in the eye. It is obvious that Michael Bay has no concept of subtlety, but this film goes too far, bordering on bad taste at every turn.And then Will Smith and Martin Lawrence show up spouting one liners straight from the tattered rulebook of bad 80s cop films. They're partners with issues of trust, we get it! Oh, and the over protective African American wife, now that's original.So the script is predictable, but that is to be expected. What about the action scenes? The Matrix Reloaded proved that a ridiculously long car chase does not a good movie make. And Bad Boys II has three of them! While Michael Bay does have a flair for cool set pieces, it seems that this epicly long film is too ambitious. Without a solid script to keep the stunt course afloat, no amount of explosive shenanigans can save this floundering mess of a movie.For fans of Bay only, and I'm not sure how many of them there are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad Boys 2 lives beyond its predecessor in all shapes and sizes. Mind-blowing action, non stop excitement and barrelled fuelled comedy are all present and correct in this blazing kick-ass action comedy served from Michael Bay (Transformers.) Bad Boys is from start to finish a rip-roaring, bone crunching, and ass-cracking thrill ride. Smith and Lawrence deliver their best performances yet in a film that will have you laughing right to the end. The story is simple. Its about two Narcotics cops who are made to bring down a Cuban drug Kingpin who is flowing large amounts of ecstasy into Miami. Things start to go weird as Lowrey (Smith and Burnett (Lawrence) realise that the kingpin starts to control not only the flow of ecstasy but also starts drug trafficking.This IS entertainment at its blistering best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad Boys 1 was a good movie but Bad Boys 2 was a substantial improvement. Below I have listed a number of reasons why I think this.1) There was a higher number of action sequences. 2) The action sequences were more exciting. 3) There was more humour. 4) The humour was funnier. 5) Gabrielle Union is in it and she is hot! 6) The phrase "Woosah" which really made me laugh every time.OK I will admit that the storyline is not exactly a great one but all the above really more than makes up for it. A brilliant action movie and a brilliant sequel. And I hear that a third movie could be on the way! Can't wait!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Belated sequel, flashy enough, but inferior to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bad Boys II" is pure popcorn fare, flashy but empty. The comedy is wildly uneven, ranging from the good (Lawrence swallowing two "ecstasy" capsules by accident) to the excruciating (Lawrence, along with Smith, bullying the young boy who's come to take his daughter out on a date), but there are some exhilarating action sequences, the best one of which is probably the almost supersonic car / truck chase on the Miami bridge. Michael Bay knows how to give his films visual punch, and has some cool ideas (like the endlessly circling camera in the shootout with the Haitians); on the other hand, the inside view of a corpse's brain is an image that does not belong in an action movie, even an R-rated one. Lawrence and Smith still have chemistry, but on the whole "Bad Boys II" lacks the freshness of the first film. More Gabrielle Union (who should be in the running for the "Most Beautiful Actress of the Decade" title) and a somewhat shorter running time would have been improvements. (**)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie achieved what it was meant to achieve: amazing action sequences and special effects. I think the effects and CGI in this movie may be the best to date. "King Kong" is one of the only competitors that comes to mind. This movie isn't supposed to be deep, make you think, or leave you feeling inspired. It's just supposed to be funny, fun to watch and action- packed. And it most certainly is all of those things. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence reprise their roles as police trying to take down a drug kingpin. But the plot really isn't important. If you like action and are sick of corny effects that simply don't look realistic, this one's for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can a movie be given TOO MUCH money? Apparently yes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm an unabashed Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay fan. The extent of that support is conditional and has been ever since I got to take a good look at Pearl Harbor and The Core, but at least I've never went to a JB/MB film and felt I was being completely suckered.Bad Boys 2 is really an insult to my intelligence. It's the last straw and next to line to totally unrealistic cop movies where paramilitary police offices duke it out with well-armed citizen terrorists, and the city gets blown up in the process. There are so many fallacies and inconsistencies that I couldn't care to list them, but let me say this: where the original had some roots in reality, Bad Boys 2 straps a rocket to the concept and sends itself to another planet, where physics, governments, gun control laws, and believability don't apply.For example, I didn't know all we had to liberate Cuba was to send the Miami Police Department. They send the Miami Police to CUBA, to do battle with Cuban forces, to perform a high-risk extraction on a house under full military guard. It's over-the-top, way past the point of no return. Michael Bay, apparently receiving all the money in the world to film explosions, gunfights, high-profile stars and one hell of a LONG-ass movie, manages at best to bore, at worst to insult one's intelligence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>loud, long, and overproduced</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bad Boys 2 was a little better than I expected, but still it's nothing great. It ran 30 minutes longer than it should have. There were way too many random scenes thrown in for comedy, which weren't very funny, and had nothing to do with the plot, ie... the boy coming to Marcus's house to take his daughter out. I will say the part where Mike and Marcus have there "homo" discussion in the video store was funny and what that black woman said before covering her child's ears. And it did have a cool car chase scene, where the bad guys are launching cars at the cops. But, that lasted too long, and so much of it as well as the other action scenes are too unbelievable. None of the good guys get killed, much less hurt, after dodging cars at high speeds, or driving the yellow hummer through houses and getting shot at. It was just too over the top and overproduced. It makes it mind-numbing to watch because the stunts are so silly.Not only were the action scenes ridiculous, they had to throw in another unbelievable plot device with Marcus's sister playing an undercover cop working on the same case he and Mike are. And of course, she has to be rescued at the end. And all the bad language thrown in was just as annoying as Martin Lawerence. I don't know why they think "f" this and "N" that makes a better movie.FINAL VERDICT: I don't recommend it unless you just want to watch an overly long, ridiculous, music video, action movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad Boys II is such a horrible movie. I absolutely dislike this movie. This movie makes no sense and the plot is very pathetic.*************Possible Spoilers****************This movie mostly mention about drugs, sex, violence, wanna-be funny, and just straight silliness that makes no sense. The beginning of the movie, I absolutely hate the beginning of the movie. About the KKK, that was just a dumb beginning. I'm pretty sure the Director could of made a better beginning than the KKK. When they ran over them metal houses was so messed up, people could of been hurt. This movie is so loud, when i was watching it my ears hurt so much. I was all like can it get any louder, and guess what it did. When Martin got shot in the butt it was so dumb, was it supposed to be funny because i didn't laugh at all. Gabrielle gave an okay performance playing Martin's brother and Will's secret boyfriend. The movie was so loud, dumb, no plot, silly, just a waste of time, I hate this movie. The end was uncalled when that guy exploded. How nasty was that. Too many explosions in that house in the movie was crazy and so violent and fake. I wish this movie was never made. It's just a mess to me.0.25 out 5 stars. I recommended if you love loud, silly, drug addictive, sex, makes no sense of a story movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this steaming turd of a movie. The plot is so unoriginal that it makes my brain hurt. This is the outline of the "plot": Two extremely stereotypical cops (with a sentimental and stupid "bad boys"-jingle going) that blow things up (and has a captain that screams about how the chief of police is mad at him for all the crazy things they do) go after a drug smuggler. The end.The acting is very poor, you can see how the main actors know how bad the script is and is just hampering on to get through. If they weren't bound by a contract, they wouldn't touch this movie. And when something is so bad that Martin Lawrence won't touch it, it's some serious crap.There is just so much about this movie that stinks. There is a few funny moments, and Peter Stormare is great as Russian mobster, but it's not enough to redeem the movie. It's just too bad.Don't watch this movie. It will lower your IQ with 20 points.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don´t mind dumb movies. Especially dumb action movies. The very consept of a modern action movie requires a lot of suspending your disbelief.The problem emerges when an action (or any other) movie doesn´t, for some reason, have guts to be what it is. This movie tried to be it all. At times it tried to be heartwarming, other times it tried to be dramatic, then it tried to be funny it even went very gory and violent. And because it couldn´t be all that, it failed miserably. The essence of this movie is to be an action-comedy, so what´s up with all the other bull**it? At times the movie went all serious and dramatic and I really couldn´t get in the mood because just earlier the movie was in a slapstick mode. When you make such cartoonish action and comedy sequences, you cannot expect people to take it seriously when something dramatic happens.The running time was simply too long. Ever heard of an action-comedy that lasts for 2? hours? Me neither, before BB2. This film could have been a lot better if it was an hour shorter.This movie was a total disaster, and I don´t mean the disaster Smith &amp; Lawrence cause on screen.I will not even rate this one, it´s below rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The one word that best sums up this movie is boring. Certainly other words describe it: tasteless, self-satisfied, egotistical, childish, idiotic. But in the end the quality that sinks the movie is the fact that it is just too long and too little happens.As many others have noted, the charm of "Bad Boys" was really that it was not planned to be a powerhouse hit. Sure there was some slow-motion and a few explosions, but the movie really worked because Lawrence and Smith had great on-screen chemistry. They played off of each other very well. The presence of Tea Leone - whose comic timing I did not appreciate until this awful sequel - only helped matters.Now we have the requisite sequel, and it appears the gloves are off. Everything that worked in the first movie just bombs here because everyone seems so sure that it will work again. The chemistry between Lawrence and Smith seems forced as they go through the tired "Lethal Weapon" conversations; you know them by heart, "You're a loose cannon!" "I have three days to retirement!" "I'm putting in for a transfer!"And perhaps the biggest killer of the movie is Smith's ego. There is not a single scene of Smith that doesn't involve slow-motion or some bimbo fawning over him. Smith slow-mo's into his bling-bling jacket and silk shirt. He slow-mo's into his car. He slow-mo bites into a sandwich. Everyone is so convinced that he's charismatic that they don't expect the guy to actually show any charisma.Lawrence doesn't fare much better. He presents us with some tired family comedy (how in the heck does he afford that mansion on a cop's salary anyway?) and recycles his "I'm so mortified and grossed-out" jokes from the first movie. Other than that he seems remarkably tame, as if someone told him not to be funny.Speaking of gross-out, there's an awful lot of that in this movie. Bay thinks it is high comedy to have heads fall of of decomposed bodies, and there is an intolerable scene in which the heroes chase a truck that hurls coffins and dead bodies at them - we then are treated to more detailed shots of said bodies exploding on the highway.The movie is just childish and boring. I can't even remember the name of the villain, or what he was doing (something about Ecstasy, which wouldn't even be dangerous if dumbass cops like the ones played Lawrence and Smith didn't force it to be made by criminals with their self-obsessed drug war posturing). The car chases are moderately exciting, if ridiculous (after seeing two cop cars flip 20 times and blow up we hear the captain say "Thank God no cops were killed" - what, did they have ejector seats?). But by the time the gang invade Cuba you will probably be long tired of this crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually quite fun despite it's many weaknesses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years after their last major adventure, Mike and Marcus are still both drug officers, Mike is still a player and Marcus is considering asking for a new partner after getting shot again on a bust gone sour. A shipment of E offers the chance for the duo to get to a new drug lord muscling in on the area, however they find themselves up against undercover DEA agent Sydney Burnett (also Marcus's sister and Mike's casual lover) as well as various gang members, in their quest to take him down and get the drugs off the streets.Of all the big summer blockbusters and sequels this year, Bad Boys 2 was the one that most surprised me by it's existence. It had been so long since the first film that I wondered why they bothered but I was actually interested in seeing it ? I like action, like Lawrence (although I know I shouldn't) and like Union. Seeing the film I must admit to mixed feelings ? I know that the film is silly and very weak in many areas but I still found it enjoyable. The energy it brings is almost enough to carry it off.The action scenes are pretty enjoyable, the highs being the 360 gun battle and the freeway chase. However the film seems to want to shock us with it's violence and the chase with the coroner's van is in really poor taste. Likewise some of the deaths are unnecessarily bloody and unpleasant and were real turnoffs to me.The plot is the film's main weakness. Thinking back I still find it difficult to see how it all flows together (it doesn't) and much of the plot stands out as either being a real stretch or being totally illogical. The action and noise pretty much covers this, but it is a real weakness. I could just about cope with this for the majority of the film but then it has a 20 minute climax in Cuba which is so ludicrous and overblown that I couldn't believe it. Trust me ? if you are enjoying the film, leave when it has it's first low key conclusion and don't let it get spoilt by this silly action man stuff.At over 2 hours the film is too generous and really could have done with a more vicious edit (some of the banter could have gone, along with that ending), and it does try to do too much at times, wandering away from the plot for some (albeit funny) side comedy scenes (the funniest being the duo confronting a boy who has come to take Marcus' daughter out on a date). The end result is that it all feels very overblown, but still manages to be surprisingly enjoyable.Why Smith returned for this I don't know ? maybe he didn't want to be seen to be going too serious with his roles and thus wanted to keep his hand in. He is average here and is just slumming it, reprising his lines from the first movie. Lawrence is better but also gives his usual performance ? he is not great but I always enjoy him when he is allowed to act out. Although he looks a little chubby and worse for wear he still gets enough laughs to hold the film together. Moll?'s bad guy is enjoyably over the top, a throwback to Scarface but also a mother's boy with a plump daughter! Union is underused and only seems to exist to set up the horrid climax. She looks sexy in every scene and I like her, but removing her character would not have hurt the film and would have allowed a needed but in running time of about 30 minutes. Pantoliano comes back to his old role and is amusing with his new age stuff (although it does get a bit old) and Randle also returns but has even less to do than in the first film ? plus side though is that she looks amazing in the swimsuit they stick her in! Rollins just looks happy to be getting his face in a blockbuster regardless of how much screen time he gets.Overall I felt that this was a very weak and absurd action film that still managed to be enjoyable despite it's many, many weaknesses. The long running time, disjointed plot and overblown nature all work against it but the cast, good action and some funny scenes all help make it worth seeing if not an altogether enriching experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loud, chaotic and ultimately empty sequel to the smash hit of 1995 returns the titled characters (Will Smith and Martin Lawrence) as they try to take down a powerful drug cartel in Miami. The cartel is led by a dangerous and sadistic Cuban (Jordi Molla') who has ties to the Russian mafia (led by Peter Stormare of "Fargo" fame) and even the Ku Klux Klan. Ecstasy is the drug of choice here as the lethal narcotic is to be transported in the bodies of corpses. Also along for the ride is the ultra hot Gabrielle Union as she plays Martin's baby sister/Smith's secret love interest/and an undercover New York DEA agent immersed with Molla'. The likable cast from the original also makes much too short appearances in "Bad Boys 2". Joe Pantoliano, Theresa Russell and former NBA standout John Salley all have minimal airtime here. The chemistry between Smith and Lawrence cannot be denied, but their comedic timing overshadows their timing in dramatic and action sequences. The first half of "Bad Boys 2" is pretty impressive admittedly as there is a multiple-automobile chase sequence that rivals anything of the type seen on the screen before. However, the production's running time is ludicrous (running at nearly 150 minutes). Too many attempts to gross out the audience, too many silly sequences and an ending that is really stupid to put it mildly ultimately destroy the fair momentum "Bad Boys 2" started out with. 2 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Bad Boys II" - Racism, necrophilia, Michael Bay and Will Smith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the misfortune of seeing this movie a few weeks ago due to a bout of sleeplessness...it was late-night, uncut and uncensored at that! Even though it came out years ago...This was a vile, disgusting, racist piece of filth masquerading as a movie. It has been a while since I have seen such a demeaning, nauseating slice of feces! Where do you start...the rat sex...the mutilated bodies...not that's not it...maybe seeing Will Smith and Martin Lawrence calling a young man n **ger and f **got and proceeding to humiliate him in every which way in the name of comedy? Or watching Martin Lawrence and Will Smith going back and forth, in a morgue no less, about the hotness of the breasts of a dead young woman?!!? Yep folks this "masterpiece" has it all...even undertones of necrophilia...These are just a few examples of what is a long list of stomach churning and insulting scenes, which are passed on as comedic relief and edgy humour, instead of the blatant stupidity and lack of creativity which characterizes "Bad Boys II". I used to find Michael Bay to be an utterly talentless hack bent on spewing his PG-13 masturbatory fantasies upon the world, but after being unfortunate enough to see this dreg, he can also add to his putrefying resume the label of racist.As for Will Smith, I gave up on him and his "Freshness" many years ago. After what was a great performance in "Ali", it went all downhill from there...this "gem" of a movie, was his first role after his turn in "Ali"...wow what a downgrade! Over the years his ego became as over-inflated as his hype and his pay-cheques, now he can add his annoying family to that! Martin Lawrence is not even worth discussing...a complete waste of space! If there is a hell, I hope that there is a special place for movies such as these, and that "Bad Boys II" is burning in it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>well, 8 yearz later, and it finally happened... we got a bad boys II... did i enjoy it? hell yeah...bad boys II is a funny-ass movie w/ top-notch action sequences &amp; comedic moments... will smith &amp; martin lawrence rule in their roles of mike lowrey &amp; marcus burnett... the chemistry between the two are really good this time around... their bickering is just funny to hear, and their interaction is hilarious to watch. But when they're p***ed off, you believe it... The defining moment of their relationship is made when mike sez, "we ride together, we die together... bad boys for life." there'z more to that scene than what commercials have shown... when i saw it in theatres, i wuz actually touched... the friendship-factor is played up more in Part II, than in Part I, which i like... it gives u the feel that they are more than just partners... they really are friends who'll do n/ething for each other...the action scenes are freakin' kool... unlike those so-called "action movie-lovers" out there who think the violence is unnecessary... THAT IS A BUNCH OF CRAP!!!! the violence isn't all dat bad... ppl get shot &amp; run over... wut have we not seen before? n/e way, the action is great... the car-chase scenes are awesome, and they serve as soothing visual eye-candy... the balance of action &amp; funny is really great...some other scenes that are funny include a 15 year old kid, corpses, and some x.... those people saying it'z immoral &amp; disturbing: cry me a river... don't come to this movie expecting big logical things... this movie is all about a good time, all-out action, and irreverent humour...Bad Boys II is tha s**t... it'z worth my money, &amp; i cant wait for this DVD to come out... 10/10 for me... it'z nuthin but fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So bad it's.. well, bad (SOME SPOILERS AHEAD)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have had the misfortune of sitting through this movie, you'll know what I mean: when most of the movie's 'jokes' come from the gratuitous exploitation of corpses, and it climaxes with an invasion of Cuba by a dozen men, you certainly get the feeling it's been a wasted few hours. (By the way, how did they manage to fill such a long time with such a paucity of material? The movie went on ffffffooooooooooorrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeevvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrr.)It's not fair to say that I can't appreciate - or even just tolerate - a good action movie - Terminator still rules, once you turn your brain off and go into neutral. (Tho' I suspect that some of this movie's popularity may stem from most of its admirers never coming out of neutral.) An attempt at a buddy-buddy movie ('We ride together. We die together') comes off as way too forced, when the leads seem barely to be able to stand one another. If I were Will Smith's partner, I wouldn't leave (as Lawrence wants to), I'd rather kill him and go to jail - he's remarkably awful in every aspect. Mawkish and forced their friendship comes across, and Smith is a boor.The plot challenges the extremities of your suspension of disbelief, and inspires such elevated scenes as 'guy murdered and shoved into barrel' and - may Bruckheimer and Bay be forgiven! - rats having sex. Could anything be funnier? The answer, clearly, is yes, anything could be funnier. Except, perhaps, for the rest of the movie. Drifting from one sordid and stupid situation to another with the only constant being gunfire (oh, and bad acting, horrendous writing, terrible direction and appalling production).I - for the first time ever - actually want to commit physical violence against all those involved in this movie, from the moronic scriptwriter to those who couldn't act their way out of a paper bag.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me be blunt: This movie sucked! It was as if Bruckenheimer and Bay were trying to see how fast they could make their astronomical budget vaporize. The first movie was a well-built machine; stylish, and smartly edited, with tons of charm. Like a puzzle, every piece of dialogue fit somewhere and had meaning. The plot was also good, incorporating well-constructed characters, with a clever blend of action and comedy. It seemed like an urban rip-off of Miami Vice. But, that's sort of why I liked it. It was funnier, applying less of a cheese-factor. In the sequel, it's like, "Let's just write a bunch of crap to fill this random ten minute scene en route having another pointless chase sequence or explosion." (Note:I don't mind chase scenes or explosions. However, it does kind of bug me, when, because of the Parkinsons-afflicted camera man, I can't tell what the hell is happening.) In the original, they made the bad guy really creepy and unlikable (in a good way). After five minutes, you hated the guy. So naturally, in the end, you were delighted to see Smith and Lawerance bust this dude. In BB2, the guy was such an idiot that I almost felt sorry for him. When they finally nailed him, I could have cared less. (It was also too long.) Mainly I was of peeved that they sissy-fied the character played by Joey Pants. Going into this vehicle, I wasn't expecting to witness high art, but did figure that I'd view a captivating "guilty pleasure". Instead, I was bored senseless, and aggravated by beyond belief(during the siezure-inducing chase scenes, mainly). Bad Boys is truly one of my favorite action films. Bad Boys II was just plain bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Move over Pearl Harbour because Michael Bay has now truly out mastered himself in sheer badness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think this side of In the Mix, Monster A Go Go, Red Zone Cuba and Gigli have I seen a movie quite as stunningly, magnificently awful as Bad Boys 2. Oh sure there's been stinkers like Alone in the dark and In The Mix but Jesus holy Harold Christ in a sidecar this was horrendous, even if it was just because it's plain stupid and grotesque.Bad Boys II is directed by the same complete and utter scumbag who directed Pearl Harbour and Armageddon, Michael Bay. Let me give you a sample of Bay's "work". Endless blowing s**t up, killing people for a laugh, no shot lasting for more than 5 seconds, plot that warbles out of control, and of course, the characters looking stupid.In order to get an example of why Bad Boys 2 is so appalling, we need to look at why Bad Boys 1 was for the most part good. Despite having a thin plot and lots of over the top action, Bad Boys 1 was still passable as at least a good rental. It didn't try to be anything that it wasn't and at least the two main characters (Smith and Larwence) stayed in their funny comedy character, as well as playing the serious parts.And that's what upsets me most about this hateful mess. The fact that that WS &amp; ML, two people that I have always respected and enjoyed on stage, have had their characters completely and utterly bastardised. Will Smith who is always capable of entertaining without foul language (Example: Bel Air), has been reduced to not only swearing more than a Glasgow Docker, but also endlessly saying the N word (which might I add he appears afraid to use). And Larwence who can not only entertain but play serious roles with finesse (Example: Blue Streak), is reduced to a boring drone.But of course the actual representation of each character is the least of the paid cinema customer's worry. You see when Michael Bay decides to commission a scene involving death, he explores it in any way possible, in such a grotesque fashion that you'd think he actually enjoys seeing people die. Here's a couple of things that Bay thinks are appropriate for such a film.1) An entire hillside village of Cubans are wiped out just so our heroes can poke fun at the carnage.2) Naked corpses being leered at for sexual gratification. Fun.3) More corpses tossed onto the highway during a car chase.OK, Now that Bay has beaten you to death, it's time for him to show you what he feels about sex.1) Two rats screwing in an attic as Bay's camera lingers on what he's sure is a brilliantly conceived sight gag! 2) A 15-year-old boy threatened with a handgun as he's offered anal sex from the movie's hero.And of course that camera angles. Slow motion shots of bullets, areal shots that make nothing out, and of course, Will Smith and Martin Larwence endlessly mugging the camera for the entire TWO AND A HALF FREAKIN HOURS. Yes folks, this painful experience was edited to last two and a half hours, explaining the dreadful editing jobs and slow motion crap.Ladies and Gentleman, Bay has not only matched his average of vile content such as in Pearl Harbour and Armageddon, he's trebled it! There truly isn't a film quite like Bad Boys II. The fact that any paid audience would opt to suffer through two and a half hours of this disaster defies belief.Michael Bay, Duffyboy salutes you, you are one evil bastard.Don't watch this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Bad Boys. The original movie was both fun and entertaining. The sequal is horrible. Whereas Bad Boys I was a movie about cops who were african americans, this movie is about a disgusting stereotype of african americans who happen to be officers. This movie was offensive and embarassing, to african americans, homosexuals, white males, cubans, latinos, actually, everyone. If there was one redeeming feature of this film, it's Joe Pantialono. He's it, though.The plot is barely passable, the incredibly dangerous flow of ecstacy needs to be stopped, money is being shipped in dead bodies, Cuba is being invaded, civilians must be killed, kidnapped and lots of explosions have to happen. I hate this movie. I do. I can't even imagine who would think it was good, but apparently other people with no taste enjoy it.There's a horrific scene where Will Smith and Martin Lawrence practically mind rape a 15 year old boy who has the audacity to take Lawrence's daughter out on a date. Complete with homosexual insults and homophobic ranting. These two "police officers" were the worst criminals in the film.</fullReview>

You will definitely "toss your cookies." Secondly, what a waste of the chemistry between Smith and Lawrence. I was looking forward to the exchange of wit like in the first movie. I was so disappointed that the tone of this movie was such a drastic change from the first movie which had lighthearted touches here and there. I admit the highway chase scene was awesome but that's about it. This is just a mean spirited movie that never lets up. *SPOILERS* As I have mentioned in other reviews for summer movies, the action sequences and plots are typically implausible but the Cuba aspect of this movie is just plain ridiculous. They did with little or no planning what Pres. Kennedy was unable to accomplish years ago in the Bay of Pigs incident. Who knew Michael Bay and his team of screenwriters had the answers all along.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love action movies. I love violence. I love gore. I love the first Bad Boys..........But this film was horrible. It had no plot structure at all. The dialogue seemed to have been written each day on the set (if they bothered to even write it down that is). The action is completely OVERDONE. I mean, I know Bruckheimer likes to go BIG...but this was like "Bruckheimer doing Bruckheimer." This film was out of control in every way! The level of gore and violence was relentless and mind-numbing. Some things were so bad I found myself asking, "should I be watching this?" There are horror movies with less gore. I've never seen so much remorseless killing in any movie. It's really sad to think that this is what we've come to since the days of Lethal Weapon. Sadly, for every wince I made, I heard multiple cheers from other movie-goers...which is a sure sign it's only going to get worse. Sickening. Truly sickening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an appalling film. The sequel to an entertaining action hit (Bad Boys) takes all the negative elements from the first one and capitalizes on none of the positive. This must be one of the most violent, insensitive and immoral films made by Hollywood in the past 10 years. Violent, insensitive and immoral can be very entertaining but when it's also crude, unoriginal and boring, the level of insult and disgust rises considerably. Both the story line and characters are undeveloped and seriously lacking in even the potential to be interesting. Will Smith, contrary to his usual clean image, comes across as a brutal, ignorant animal and that probably sums up the film. The glamour and righteousness with with the killing of both guilty and innocent people is undertaken is truly shocking. If you want blood, gore, and special effects, although they're there in abundance, 'Bad Boys 2' will leave you feeling empty and unsatisfied. If you want entertainment or excitement, there are none.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's a quick-fire summary of my views of this alleged film - homophobic, xenophobic, misogynistic and deeply, deeply disturbing.Deeply disturbing in the fact that there is no level to which Michael Bay and his writers will not stoop in order to gain either a cheap laugh or a funny murder. How does necrophilia sound to you? Or having your brain fried with Ecstacy? Or intimidating an innocent lad just because he's coming to take his daughter out on a date? Make you laugh. Ha, ha, ha.How about comedy Russians or Haitians? How bulldozing a Cuban shanty town to the ground with innocent people inside those houses - still what's a dead Cuban to director Bay. Still laughing.There are several things to dislike this movie. Is it only foreign types who import drugs into the US? Judging by this, the answer is yes. What's makes this film the most disturbing I've seen in a long while is that Cuba and anti-Castro terrorism is used as a plot device.SPOILER ALERT (not that this film need spoiling) - In one of several false endings, our gang go to Cuba with help from a group called Alpha 7. Here's a quick history lesson, the Alpha 7 is based on a real group called Omega 7, who are a bunch of nasty right-wing anti-Castro terrorists based in Miami. Far from the underground freedom fighters as portrayed in this film, the real Omega 7 have tried to destabilised Cuba and Castro through terrorism such as introducing Dengue fever into Cuba in the early 1980's which killed at least 113 Cuban civilians and a spate of bombings in Havana hotels in the late 1990's and alienated those Cuban exiles who want to seek a detente with the Cuban government.The introduction of this element into the plot, implys that Castro and Cuba are involved in Ecstacy drug-running into the US, something I suspect that is further from the truth. In turn this film turns quickly from a nasty, little action flick into a right-wing, militarist, anti-castro fan-boy fantasy, giving the people who see this film the impression that what America is doing to Cuba is right. Did the actors read the script they were given. But I forget this is a Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay film. When you are signed up to one of their films, check your critical faculties into the bank along with the fat pay-check you've been given. If you want to see what Cuba is really about go check out some Cuban solidarity web-sites and not have your opinions warped by a tenth-rate film-maker like BayFinally, this film should finally give credence to the fact that Martin Lawrence is untalented, which is evident to most people, except to film executives with their eyes on the box-office returns. Will Smith is undoubtedly a talent, which why he chose this film remains a mystery to me or to anyone who saw what he could do in a serious role such as 'ALI'. No-ones career will be hurt by this film, which is a shame because there are lots of careers of people of people involved with this project who deserve to go down the tubes.My rating 1 out of 10 (Zero out of 10 had I been given the option)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off let me say Im a huge fan of the original. Im not easily upset by gore, profanity, or even sometimes downright stupidity in a plot line. I dont hate Michael Bay or Bruckheimer. But this movie just sucked. The plot line was ok but all the things that made the first movie great is nonexistent in the second.Will Smith's character.. what the hell happened?? The smooth charming guy, has turned into a nasty foul mouthed jerk who treats his best friend like crap and shoots everything and everyone who crosses his path.Women are at the low rung of the ladder in this movie. While Union's character starts out with some strength, she ends up disappearing for a huge chunk of the movie only to show up at the end... needing to be rescued. Even Lawrence's wife is toned down from the women she used to be. Will Smith's character refers to a female corpse(a person who he never knew) as a bimbo. The women in this movie are all hookers, airheads or corpses. Oh wait, i forgot the strippers.The gore... all i can say is yuck. I have no problem with some gratuitous violence in an r rated movie, but hell, enough is enough. The movie is 150 minutes long because for some reason Bay thought we wanted to see every person who died being blown apart in slow motion. And seeing the body parts with blood dripping from them 4 or 5 times for the same scene is just lame.Some jokes were funny, most just died. My love for the rapport in the first one between the leads, in the sequel becomes annoying and long winded.The scary thing is the best thing about this movie is Martin Lawrence trying to come to terms and understand why his best friend has turned into a psychotic killer and a d**k. Which pretty much defines the biggest mistake the movie made.Its sad, if they had just edited some junk and left Smith's character the way he was in the original they may have had a decent movie.</fullReview>

The banter between them is flat and drab. Profanity isn't really a big deal, but even I got sick of hearing them swear at everything.This movie is guilty of something that is the death of an action comedy. It's boring. They should have decided which direction they wanted, dead bodies or lively comedy. The dreadful patter interrupts the action scenes and sucks any life out of them (although they're shockingly overblown and bad anyway), and because this is a tough guy movie the lines are awful. It's like the two genres are killing each other.Oh yeah, Michael Bay must have done some music videos in his time, because it looks like a glossy music commercial.One of the worst I've seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The biggest problem with Bad Boys 2 is not that the humor has been systematized, that there's no originality or intelligence in the storyline, or that the film is poorly paced and way too Kevin Costner-like long...The biggest problem of this film is Jerry Bruckheimer. If he really wants to agitate pro American values and con Cuban socialism, this is not the way to do it, even at this ultimate mainstream level. His production 'Black Hawk Down' succeeded where 'Pearl Harbor' failed. You understood why the US troops actually were the good guys when all was rounded up, where this constellation was an insult in PH. You could hope that Jerry had learned the lesson after that, but then he launches BBII. What the heck is wrong with him? To point out: A violent Columbian drug lord cannot in any way set up a drug traffic operation out of present day Cuba let alone build his own mansion in the wide open land. If he tried, Fidel Castro would immediately have him rounded up and shot, he'd most likely blow his brains out himself to prove a point. Fidel Castro may be an extreme dictator, but the political reality is that he hates drug dealers and organized criminals to the core of his body, because his extreme ideal is based on humanism. One of the main reasons that Castro, Guevara and others in the 50's rebelled violently against Cuba's former dictator Batista, and one of the main reasons why millions of Cubans actually supported them to victory, was that Batista for years had made Cuba a haven for drug lords from Columbia and Cosa Nostra gambling &amp; prostitution tycoons from USA and Italy, making Cuban life more miserable than anything they must encounter today. Claiming that the opposite is true, that Castro can be bought by the kind of people he hates more than anything, is not only a political contradiction in terms, it's a gigantic and dangerous lie. Dangerous because it tries to convince the mainstream audience that the Cuban problem lies somewhere it's not. If Master Jerry really wants to tell people about the drawbacks of Castro's policies, then he must first accept and ally with the truth. That won't prevent him from producing a blowout of an entertainment flick and make a [S-word] load of money, as BHD proved. This is not healthy political agitation at the people's level, this is disgusting nationalist propaganda. The deep travesty about it all is that this 130M$ insult actually made ends meat. I feel I can hear the devil snicker... Bad Boys 2 is short of a crime against humanity. A worse sequel than Highlander II.</fullReview>

What made the original good was lacking in this effort, in terms of originality, characters, plot, length, and in terms of good or bad taste.While the original was just another mismatched pair of cops it didn't have all that tacky street talk, while there was some it wasn't to the annoying extent that it was in say Shaft or Training Day. There was genuine humour and the action was in healthy doses. The length was good at 114 minutes (just under two hours). And there was somewhat a degree of originality with the setting (a change from New York or Los Angeles) and even the villains where not your cliched Hispanic or Homie gangs.This however loses everything. The characters are just plain unlikeable, with Martin Lawrence continually trying to dominate his sister, and then getting angry at Smith's character for dating her, and then taking his overprotection home and tormenting his daughter's date, I didn't really find that funny. I wanted to smash his characters face in for his attempted dominance (and for the record I am not a downtrodden sibling, I just found his antics so annoying). Will Smiths character has none of the attributes in the last one, he's quick to anger, and has a bad attitude as displayed when he referred to a corpse as a bimbo (which means promiscuous), when for all he knew she could have been an Honours student.The treatment of corpses in this is in bad taste. The scene in the morgue (which is where Smith insults the corpse) was disgusting, with organs and brains being shown. This made me feel bad in the toes. Sure there was blood and gore in movies such as Saving Private Ryan and From Hell but that's because, SVP and movies like it used gore to show how horrible wars are, and From Hell dealt with themes of the body and medical procedures.In the original, when Lowrey and Burnette (the main characters) had a spat (often faked) it was quick, and amusing. In this the spats are long, drawn out, deliberate, and just laced with spite mostly on the part of Lawrences character. I felt particularly uncomfortable watching the scene when they were walking through the fences. This is an action-comedy, spite between chararcters is edging into drama territory. Lets keep action comedy, action comedy. The originality is lacking too. In the original, rather than the usual Hispanics, Rastafarians or homies, the villains were locals led by a European. In this the main villian is a Hispanic, and has dealings with the Russian mafia, very cliched these days.The last half hour is the worst, it is where the movie bcomes too long, just plain ridiculous, and the cliches continue. When Delta Force and that anti-Castro militia came in I thought "You are joking" unfortunately they weren't. Bringing the other two groups in and the fact that Joe Pantoliano's character knew someone from one of them was ludicrous. When Burnetts sister is kidnapped by the token hispanic drug dealer, she's taken to Cuba; Castro is involved in the drug trade and gives protection to drug lords, the token Latin American dictator. This is veering into Swachzenegger, Van Damme, and Segal territory. In the original the characters did not come out of the final fight scene unscathed, the characters were pinned down and only freed thanks to Tea Leoni, Burnett took a bullet to the leg, Lowrey took a hefty punch in the face and was thrown from a moving car and couldn't get up without help, and Ruiz and Sanchez would have been killed if not for the intervention of Lowrey. In this the characters with their militray and para-military allies get through without any trouble, only one member gets a bullet in the shoulder and even some members of the Cuban army are popped off. If they do Bad Boys 3 will they go to the Middle East and fight Saddam Hussein loyalists? How Will Smith could oppose the war in Iraq (for which I will always like him for) and yet star in such cliched material, I will never know.Then there is the chase through the shanty town which is a complete rip off from the Jackie Chan movie Police Story. Joe Pantoliano played the cliched role of the stressed out superior officer in the original with such genuine humour I didn't mind. In this he tried far too hard in this to pul it off, it seemed too forced. There was nothing to save this movie. There was the freeway chase scene, but thats hardly a redeeming factor. Smith takes up acting in cliched material ending his record of descent movies (that I've seen at least), while Lawrence continues his record of lousy movies, except for the original Bad Boys which is great and Blue Streak which is quite amusing. But otherwise, is pretty bad.Big lack of originality, Bad taste, Bad characters, Bad movie. Avoid it if you can...like the plague</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad Boys 2 is one of the better movies i've ever seen. It has a little bit of everything you could want. Comedy and Action a plenty, along with some suspense and some partial nudity, granted it was dead nudity, but for some people that's all they get. The characters are portrayed to perfection, and Martin Lawrence and Will Smith have a superb on screen chemistry. There are some funny quotes throughout the movie, such as, "I can't believe you two, do you call each other in the morning, 'Good morning Marcus, Good morning Mike, how you doin, Aiight." Alright, in context it's a funny quote. Overall, this is pretty much the best movie i've ever seen, bare in mind that i'm a 19 year old who just likes to watch stuff blow up, and have a good laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad Boys II (2003) No Stars I've been trying lately only to review movies that I consider to be great movies, or random new releases that I get time to review. And so, this review is different. It's a movie that was made three years ago, and its the exact opposite of great. I hated this movie so much that months after finally watching the whole thing (I had to watch this "movie" in pieces because I felt as if I was going to have to stab my eyes out) I feel I can finally review this thing. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are Miami cops cracking down on a Cuban drug king, played by Jordi Molla. Martin Lawrences sister, Syd (Gabrielle Union) is also involved undercover in a federal investigation, and of course things get freaky with her and Will Smith's character. Blah blah blah, roll the clichés and super "cool" dialog, insert a chase scene that sees about a million cars get destroyed while Will Smith drives his Ferarri through the carnage at 200 mph unscathed, slap on some random catch phrases and a cheesy ending and BANG, you have Bad Boys II. Doesn't sound like much? It isn't. You could say that the movie is just mindless action, but to say that it is mindless would excuse its insulting of morality and intelligence to the viewer. If it would be mindless it wouldn't know better. Michael Bay does know better, but that doesn't stop Bad Boys II from being cruel and down right offensive to mindless movies everywhere. The movie thinks that it's being funny when it's just being cruel, and one scene in particular made me cringe and made me want to run out and burn posters of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. That scene involves the pair driving their fancy Hummer through a shanty town on a hillside. We're talking a slum, where the poorest people you could imagine live. The Hummer plows through the houses tearing them apart. This would have killed dozens of poor people. But do they care? No, they're driving their big yellow Hummer, having a ball. Sure they try to say that the village had been making drugs, but so what? I'm sure the kids and innocents who lived in those houses might have something to say about that. This movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth that shows up every time I hear someone say "Bad," or "Boys," or "2." That this piece of cinematic junk has 6.1 rating on IMDb is mind blowing. It's a testament to the stupidity of the modern movie audience. I never had to pay to see this movie, yet after seeing the whole thing, I still felt like someone owed me a whole lot of money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Chemistry Saves It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If any other actors played the leads in this movie, it would probably be just another style-over- substance, buddy cop action film to waste time on during the summer or on a night when you're bored. However, the chemistry between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence and their skills in playing off of each other elevate this film into a fun adventure. If you don't believe me, watch the scene when Reggie shows up to take Marcus's daughter out on a first date and he and Mike mess with him. I honestly can't tell if it was scripted or if it was just Martin and Will playing off of each other and ad-libbing, but these two make the Bad Boys films.Outside of this, it's your typical Michael Bay film: lots of action, stylized camera shots, sexy girls, some refreshingly non-PC racial humor, and some of the strangest editing you'll ever see when it comes to dialogue. It seems like the scenes cut right when there was supposed to be more said between two characters and the result is this odd, unfinished feeling during certain scenes. It's unnerving in some places!A fun film to watch, but not exactly "Citizen Kane" (nor is it meant to be).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate reviews that put this movie down. This movie is so much fun and quite enjoyable, plain and simple. Sure their is not much of a plot but it is quite entertaining. If plot is what you are looking for, why are you watching this movie. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are back and better than ever in this action packed sequel to Bad Boys. Their is more action, more humour and a bit more crude. Especially the scene where Lowrey and Burnette went into the morgue and the scene where they are planting the wire into Tapia's house. Joe Pantoliano was better in this movie than the first one. He brings life to every scene that he is in. His character is the guy you would just love to hate. Definitely better than the first movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad boys bad boys, what you going to do? Why-make a sequel of course.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One that was eight years later than the money spinning first film made in 1995. Directed again by Michael Bay, this sequel sees Will Smith and Martin Lawrence joined by Jordi Moll?, Gabrielle Union and Peter Stormare. Plot sees the wise cracking, bickering, buddy cops out to stem the flood of designer ecstasy into Miami. But the lads don't just have the pressures of the job to handle, but also some personal issues too; and the strain is starting to tell on both of them.Lets cut to the chase here, which ironically is what Bay does frequently in this movie, the film is too long, too shallow and devoid of a decent plot. But is it fun? Does it do exactly what one expects of a Michael Bay popcorner? Hell yes it does. Even if after you have peeled your eyes and ears off of the walls-and sifted thru the carnage-you find that more is more is not necessarily a good thing. But hey, on the good side of good is that Messrs Smith &amp; Lawrence still function well as a duo, quipping away and standing tall in the name of machismo. Bay's pyrotechnics are at times incredible, with a Miami freeway pursuit as good as it gets for such entertaining devastation. But the script (Ron Shelton &amp; Jerry Stahl) is often dull, and worryingly sometimes, offensive. Bigger budget means that everything on the film is also bigger, but it's not a better film than the one that went before it.Making back over double its $130 million production budget, the film clearly had enough interested viewers. It also meant that somewhat inevitably a second sequel will surface in the next couple of years after an 8 or 9 year gap. It's hoped that the writers can come up with a cracking plot that's with the times and that Bay can find the right level of action to go with the narrative. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad Boys II is the sequel to the 1995 film Bad Boys. Set once again in Miami, it tells the story of 2 enigmatic cops who are trying to solve the case of a lifetime. But the film doesn't just rely on its story, it supplements it with gore, hysterical dialogue and some of the best action scenes ever filmed. The action scenes are everywhere. there are 3 car chases and a multitude of shootouts, all with blazing stunts and excellent cinematography. Joe Pantaliano's character, while only supporting, was by far the funniest. Kudos to Will Smith and Martin Lawrence also. An incredibly enjoyable film to those with open minds. This is easily Michael Bays best movie since The Rock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad Boys 2 was an awesome movie and funny. The main characters are Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowery (Will Smith). The bad guy is Johnny Tapia (Jordi Molla). It was about the Miami Police Department was trying to catch Johnny Tapia, who was a drug dealer. Every time they try to catch him they couldn't because he would sue them because they couldn't find proof he was a drug dealer. Marcus and Mike were the only persons that could catch him. In the end Mike and Marcus catch Johnny in Cuba.The best thing about the movie is that it is HILARIOUS and nobody in the good guys side dies. The actors did a very good job on acting. It was an exciting movie. I hope they make Bad Boys 3. S.L.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whatever the director wanted to tell us about in the storyline, since it was far too boring to watch the second half of this movie. Anyway, shallow action movies, full of gratuitous violence, overdone explosions and tasteless one-liners is exactly my kind of entertainment. Usually. But in this case, it didn't work, it didn't entertain, it was just a series of graphical highlights with not much to connect them.Maybe it a less than brilliant idea to re-do a Black version of Miami Vice in the 2000s, applying a thick layer of stereotypes and string together an endless series of scenes targeted at the tastes of a similarly stereotypical Black demographic or whatever the director assumes about them.Expect the full range of action flick stereotypes: heroes with a lifestyle light years above the average income of any real policeman, policemen driving Ferraris on duty, policemen immune to bullets, policemen that can do everything, everywhere, in record time. Then lace it with stereotypical Black stereotypes and you're set: have them kill a few KKK members, let them wear Basketball shirts all the time, focus on every girl's booty and have some minutes of screen time for literal truckloads of money.In short: the classic ingredients of any run-of-the-mill rap video, just extended for what feels like 2 hours and then some.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2003: 'Year of the Car Chase'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it was Empire that called 2003 'Year of the car chase', a reference to the vehicular carnage on offer in four of the films released that year - 'Bad Boys II', 'The Matrix Reloaded', 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines', and '2Fast 2Furious'. For my money, the best one was the spectacular smash up of the 'The Matrix' sequel.'Bad Boys II' is incredibly entertaining. Once again, the visuals are stunning and highly stylized, and the action is breathtaking and nonstop. The movie offers up two killer car chases, the first of which takes place along the Macarthur Freeway in Miami, Florida where the film is set.In this second installment in the 'Bad Boys' franchise, Detectives Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) investigate the Ecstasy flow into Miami. In doing so, they tangle with evil drug baron Hector Juan Carlos 'Johnny' Tapia (Jordi Molla). And relations betwixt the two detectives become strained when it emerges that Mike has been seeing Marcus' sister Syd (Gabrielle Union).In addition to the two car chases, we also get a thrilling shootout at a drug dealer's decrepit house. The second car chase takes place in Cuba and includes a truly spectacular sequence in which a yellow Hummer occupied by the two detectives and Syd races downhill through a shantytown. A number of the closely bunched together shacks are drug factories employing highly flammable materials, so many of them explode as the Humvee smashes through them. The whole thing looks incredibly dangerous and, knowing director Michael Bay, WAS extremely dangerous! Bay has a cameo as a motorist ('Freak!') wearing a rather silly hat, as does retired American quarterback Dan Marino; he plays a man test driving a car which Marcus and Mike 'borrow' for use in a car chase.In the film's opening shootout, a bullet fired from the gun of Detective Lowrey passes through a rather intimate part of his partner's anatomy on its way to neutralise a bad guy. The subsequent injury to Detective Burnett's nether regions is a source of much of the film's ensuing comedy. Like the first film, 'Bad Boys II' is very funny, and there is real chemistry betwixt the two leads. Joe Pantoliano is great fun again as the long-suffering Captain Howard, who is convinced that Mike and Marcus deliberately go out of their way to make his life miserable.If you are looking for more bang for your buck, then this film delivers in spades. It is very long but never really drags as it is very well-paced. Bay regular Peter Stormare ('Armageddon') pops up as Alexei, and Theresa Randle reprises her role of Theresa, Marcus' wife.Whether we will see a 'Bad Boys III' remains to be seen. But, if it is anything like the first two films, then bring it on!</fullReview>

The special effects are incredible and hardcore. The car chases are especially fast paced and well directed. The only two problems I have with Bad Boys 2 is the opening. I couldn't understand who or what was going on. Also the slow motion sequence with the gun being fired is so lame. That ruined the movie for me.

		<shortDescription>Great Movie, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm gonna give this movie 5 stars for story, action and overall fun factor. It was a great movie to see in the theatre, and when a movie is 2 1/2 hours long in the theatre, most people don't wanna sit there that long. This isn't your typical Lord Of The Rings crap where it's 4 hours of boredom, it's wall to wall action, and great storytelling to make a great action/comedy. I actually prefer this movie over the original Bad Boys because it has better action sequences, less boring parts, and a better story/plot. One thing I am WAY disappointed about and it disappoints me more and more with the fact that DVD is taking over, is the fact that Widescreen is RUINING movies! and the movie industry forces this WS crap down our throats. I just recently bought this movie (BBII) and it didn't say on the box if it was full screen or wide. I don't care if it's both, or if it's the WS ratio (1.85:1), it's not that bad, but I prefer Full Screen, so I get it home and find out that it's the crappy version of Widescreen (2.35:1), and then I read the aspect ratio on this site and it says that it's WORSE! it's actually (2.40:1), so damn man, when are the movie companies gonna realize that not everyone in the world is a rich person and/or celebrity and not everyone can afford those 1000-5000 dollar Widescreen home theater TV's? I am really getting sick of the fact that they no longer make full screen movies, only the occasional movie gets released with FS, so people get cheated into buying a movie that doesn't say which aspect ratio, or doesn't even say widescreen or Full Screen so people can pick and choose the one they want. I bet way more people buy FS versions than these crappy WS versions. But oh well, I will end this by saying I am VERY disappointed with my copy of Bad Boys 2, and recommend that people DON'T buy it if they hate Widescreen like I do. Don't waste your money. When they play the movie on the movie networks, they are full screen so what the heck is the deal there? why can't they release it to the public? Well that's all from this disappointed Bad Boys fan.</fullReview>

It involves drugs, Cubans and all the other clichés but at the end of the day what actually makes this film is the wonderful and hilarious partnership between Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. Their chemistry makes the film worth watching. It's like they're only playing it for fun which makes it even more enjoyable because you can just relax and watch just for fun.I regret I haven't seen the first film but I know that this one is a great film to watch to relax, you don't have to think and you can just have fun.

		<fullReview>Michael Bay is back behind the camera and Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are back in front of it in this sequel to their successful 1995 buddy cop movie.This time the plot concerns an attempt to foil the influx of Ecstasy taking hold over young partygoers in the state of Florida. What that really means is that we get even more bullets, car chases, banter and fistfights, all in the name of justice.Smith and Lawrence slide right back into their characters and maintain the easy chemistry they had the first time around and the movie benefits from both the return of characters played by the likes of Theresa Randle and Joe Pantoliano and the new faces such as Gabrielle Union and Peter Stormare.But this isn't about character development. This is, in essence, the ultimate macho flick. Bay threatens to nauseate you as he throws every trick he's ever learned onto the screen while dragging us through the numerous gunfights and chase sequences but I'll be damned if they're not consistently exhilarating and impressive (with the exception of an ending that feels about 20 minutes too long). One particular sequence involving Smith and Lawrence shooting it out with some Haitian drug dealers is an absolute bravado moment and dizzyingly enjoyable in it's seemingly seamless camera-work.In between those big bangs we do get comedy that, once again, really works well. Whether it's some frisky rats, Martin Lawrence mixing up his tablets or a misconstrued conversation between the leads about an awkwardly placed bullet . . . . it's all good enough to raise at least a smile and often some belly laughs too.Not to everyone's taste, obviously, and it will certainly not win over any new fans for Bay himself but if you can tolerate the massive helpings of his style alongside the relatively lean substance then you could find yourself having a good time with one of the best bang-to-buck ratios you will find outside of a Rambo movie.See this if you like: Bad Boys, Running Scared, Lethal Weapon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although "Bad Boys 2" is no where near type of movie that I prefer, it came in a perfect time (on TV, for about third time!!), after hard day, when you don't need another drama or a movie where you need to think about. "BB 2" offers plain and simple fun action movie that won't stick with you after you watch it cause it's not special or innovative in any way. We all know that computer these days can do everything so car chase or loads of bullets all over the place aren't something (all Michael Bay movies are same) which makes directing very easy. That's why I cannot judge or rate this movie along with 'real' movies. But it's good to see Will Smith &amp; Martin Lawrence back, after 8 years, in roles of cops Lowrey &amp; Burnett and what's also good is that they still make a great team. Comical parts are very good, plot is maybe too much but no one expected any brains in this movie. There isn't much to act from main duo and supporting actors Pantoliano &amp; Stormare made their usual impact. Bay is one of directors I dislike after viewing crappy movies like "Pearl Harbor", "Armageddon" and "Transformers" (I'm not supporter of certain blockbusters) but I have no complaints about "Bad Boys". Bay just took all that money and made a movie that popcorn audience will enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First movie where bonus features were more interesting than the main story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bad Boys II was the first DVD I've seen where the bonus disk was more interesting than the main feature. Director Michael Bay came off the shooting of Pearl Harbor and was ready to do more with the CGI in the car chase scene and all the action sequences.The outrageous car chase scene of course was shot in composites of CGI and real cars, but I was surprised to know that the "real" cars were the ones that was getting thrown off the trailer, and the cars dodging them were the CG. Then there's the scene of Hummer driving through the mansion with explosions going off everywhere. This was a real house that was getting demolished which they took hold of for the filming of this movie.The movie itself is pretty good, but I'm little bit tired of movie plots where Will Smith is showboating from beginning to end as he does in all his movies. Him and Kevin Cosner must have a clause in their contract saying "I would have to be portrayed as a hero and look good in all my scenes." What detectives Burnett and Lowrey does and says arn't a good role model for youngsters who watches this movie, and I suspect that's why this movie doesn't get (much) air time on network television. Cinematography is great and casting is good. Like the first Bad Boys, this is a great movie to see if you like action.If you're out to buy or rent this movie, do yourself a favor and get the double disc edition where it comes with the bonus feature disk. I'm sure you'll be twice as entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bay's fifth film equals the first movie but is not better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the strong mixed reaction that Pearl Harbor received Bay returns to what many people say he does best. Making another Bad Boys. Bad Boys 2 is just as good as the first movie, but not better. The chemistry between Martin and Will is still there, and better than ever. This time they go all out with their comedy, and end up being funnier than the first. Michael Bay gives his fans all the good stuff which includes explosions, car chases, beautiful women, and music video shots to make this movie enjoyable. Bay has succeeded in all five movies, and the next film guarantees to be his best work yet. Keep up the god work Michael.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Sucks, But I like it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sequel to the 1995's surprise hit Bad Boys, commercial director Michael Bay hits back to the silver screen after his box office failure Pearl Harbor. This time for a hit he has to combat with Terminator and the Matrix sequels, what would he do! To make an IMPACT his idea was to, OVER RUN the extreme action elements, degrading black people by rude comedy and raw sex summing with homage to gay peoples. Was that successful? Yes for a bit. For a few seconds viewers can forget Honk Kong's wire stunts, larger than life fight sequence, Terminator sci-fi FXs, Marvel's stupid movie adaptations.Plus point of this movie - Will Smith! Minus point of the movie - Michael Bay. I hate Michael Bay's movies, like his every other movie he tried to give us some stupid dramatic shots by questioning our IQs. This sequel had a potential to be a better movie if Bay had taken interest in the script developments. I like this movie only because it has Will Smith.Even though I am a very angry male who likes action movies, I don't like it's certain aspects, especially homosexuality, insulting black communities and non Americans. But forgiving that it has some good great car stunts ever filmed in the history of movie business.Go and watch if you can take all the stupid story lines of Bay.Bad Boys 2 = Not Too Bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will Smith and Martin Lawrence play Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett, two cops who investigate the smuggling of Ecstacy into Florida. Both play their characters really well. The action scenes in the film are good and the action is of high quality but there are just a few too many. If the film had been been shortened by probably 30 minutes and not dragged out so long it would have made a bigger impression. Other than that the are no other major faults. The scene at the start with the night-clubbers giving each other Ecstasy could probably have been cut and the blood and gore were a bit over the top. The scenes where Marcus and Mike bag out the kid who comes to pick up his daughter and when they chase after the van with the bodies in the back were both funny. The car chase scene involving Marcus' sister was probably the best scene in the movie because of the great action, camera angles and the fact that it was funny. I think that Bad Boys II is better than the first and should be seen by anyone who likes great action movies.Overall - 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen a more convincing performance of a true nut case than Jordi Moll?'s performance of Jonnny Tapia in this movie. I mean, kudos as usual to Lawrence, Smith, and of course Joe Pantoliano, but Molla is truly the real deal when it comes to playing a character you love to hate. Martin and Lawrence have proved once again that they are one of the top teams in the business, playing off of each other and placing themselves in the honorable ranks of Gibson/Glover and Tucker/Chan. Buddy movies come and go, but these guys should make more. Of this franchise and then some. My honest opinion is this movie is 10 times better than the first one, and I'd like to mention if you haven't seen it yet, you don't HAVE to see the first one to enjoy it. Much like the Lethal Weapon movies, you simply have to understand that they have been friends/partners for a long time and that is why their exchanges play out like a fine piece of music.

		<shortDescription>40 Miles of Bad Road on the Wonderland Freeway (Minor Spoilers here and there)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a true given fact that most films of the day more and more forsake the boundaries of realism, in order to be able to show more, trash more, destroy more. Basically it is part of why some movies become triple-digit-expensive. Out of the time where the quality of movies was dictated by acting and directing performances, we ventured in a time where success of individual movies was sometimes even watered down by the over-exaggerated use of Lateral Cam and CGI or just the amount of objects that were destroyed on camera in the pursuit of even more imaginative and absurd action sequences.Bad Boys II. In many ways, the film was a decent sequel to a successful movie, aside from the massive amounts of recurrent profanity throughout the 140 minutes of film. Martin Lawrence displays his ability to mold his face in any possible expression, a requisite that had paid him well in his films and his personal series, 'Martin'. Aside from playing a small man with a big mouth, he delivers the 'visual' comedy to the movie, whereas Will Smith, like in the first film, had the edge when it came to his lines. The dualism of these two black male characters still did not elude me, and the combination appeared to work still. Sometimes added upon by Joe Pantoliano and his extreme ability to gain the crowd's attention with his vocal talent and body language, it is an OK film, but it would be a lot better if it was slightly shorter. There is however, still this film maker's urge to induce many visual factors to add to the atmosphere of the end-product, but in the process kills the realism. Blue XTC tablets with a female figure engrained on it? From Amsterdam? Another example is the Yellow Hummer crashing through an overly huge amount of cardboard homes, which makes me wonder how much the producers really knew about Cuba or if they were rather more interested in creating this situation in which more useless destruction could be displayed in full. Anyway, who in god's name would drive through Cuba in a Hummer, which is not even 'the' Hummer that some people know and like so well, but an ugly, badly performing surrogate?Here and there, there was some not so mild racist humor lodged in between. What would be meant by the Haitians communicating with one another by the use of horns and drums, living in pink houses and overly equipped with blond dreads and a dialect, things that were probably put in to make them look and sound more stupid rather than giving them individuality. Also the scene in the TV store, though certainly one of the better ones, showed us the extent of stereotypic relations between the looks and the opinions of bystanders. Though most characters were very superficial (the two lead chars Lowrey and Burnett weren't deepened out at all), the bad guy, played by Jordi Moll?, grants us a few scenes of enjoyable acting and a constructive emotional base for his actions as a drugs kingpin.Basically, Bad Boys II remains a worthy sequel and an all in all enjoyable movie. You do have to get past a few scenes of which the edges could easily be trimmed slightly. Cutting 10 minutes of its total length in arbitrary pieces of scenes would be a great improvement. In short, it has a little bit of everything; Humor in dialogue, though way inferior to The 51st State, nice visually improved car chases and some above average throughout performance.6.5 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has, arguably, the best car chase ever filmed, near the beginning. It's worth seeing just for that. I'm not going to mention why but I guarantee you won't be disappointed by it.Will Smith and Martin are too "black" when they shouldn't be, and not "black" enough when they should be. The cliché sayings are just a bit off, mistimed and lose most of their punch. Maybe it was rushed, maybe the editor chose the wrong cuts. This must have been one expensive movie.

		<shortDescription>A good movie with it's faults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this got bashed and legitametly "bombed", I enjoyed it when I saw it. And I watch movies like Barton Fink and To Kill A Mockingbird.The most enriching thing I found about the movie was the lighting and the cinematography. When the camera sailed down the doorway of the kingpin's house, when the man yells to all who hear "The Russian Grim Reaper is here", goosebumps went down my spine. That kind of directed vision can make or break a movie. The action sequences weren't the usual 30-round pistol magazine scenes, but action were thoroughly thought out and made to not be the usual clichés. Some standout performances were from Martin Lawrence and Joe Pantoliano. Will Smith gave his usual heroic performance with a little something extra added. Martin actually made me feel for his character with the depression that seemed to plague the character. And Joe Pantoliano, while playing a nearly pitch-perfect stressed police chief, was very believable. His performance almost made me forget the moron he played on the Sopranos.Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer make a good quality action movie without resorting to a half-winded effort. Most sequences were engaging and intense, but when the writer resorts to the silly stuff, you realize where the bad word-of-mouth might have come from.My score: 7/10</fullReview>

I absolutely loved this movie and haven't been as excited for afilm in a long time. The action is non stop and the chemistry of the lead characters are impressive and amusing. Will Smith does a great job of reprising his role along with Martin Lawrence. What else makes this film enjoyable are the villains. There's Johnny Tapia and the string of other bad guys that are hilarious. But what I loved the most was the action. The highway car chase involving the Haitians and the Hummer at the end along with everything in the middle make this film awesome and amusing. This movie is a perfect 10. You won't be disappointed when watching this. And if you are, I don't know what to say. Micheal Bay should be applauded along with Jerry Bruckheimer for blessing us with this thrill ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Bad Boys" = "Good Movie"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this action flick and had been looking forward to it for quite some time ever since I saw the original. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence prove that their chemistry hasn't faded in the eight years between the release of both "Bad Boy" films, and Jerry Bruckheimer proves once again how (usually) reliable he is in delivering explosive action. The first car chase in this movie is thrilling and arguably tops the one seen in "The Matrix Reloaded." The entire cast works well together, with Smith in particular oozing charisma from the opening gunfight to the very end. That being said, this is an incredibly long movie, a little too long, and by the final half hour to forty-five minutes, the action becomes a bit repetitive. It's not like the plot is all that complex, they could have cut plenty of scenes. Other than that, this film is a must-have for fans of Smith, Lawrence and Bruckheimer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Furious Action, Outrageous Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah yes, everyone hates Michael Bay don't they? He should be directing music video's, yes? Why would anyone want an action director to be into fast cuts, close up in your face shots, and endless car chases, followed by explosions, followed by mega-bucks live action sequences, with incredible stunts, over loads of CG work? Whats the matter with people!?As he did with the very small budget on the first film, Michael Bay has made a very good job of Bad Boys II. He uses his money well, and presents us with some real edge-of-your-seat set pieces, all cut together at a furious pace. BUT HE'S NO MCG! Bay never crosses the line of being simply stupid.The performances from Smith and Lawrence are just as expected - they obviously sway from the script many times, choosing to improvise scenes more often than not - there are few double acts in the business who can do this so effectively, Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson perhaps being an exception. Will Smith manages to hold the scenes down as Martin Lawrence hams it up as the nervy, slightly crazed family man thrown into hellish gun battles every day on the job. Smith remains the only actor who can star alongside Lawrence, and have him be funny rather than annoying...Some of the stunts in this movie are incredible, and the 1st big car chase is something that will have any action fan falling off their mosquito infested cinema seat - forget the Matrix Reloaded - this is the greatest car chase ever captured on film.The script is patchy, making way for more improvised gags rather that creating a deep story, but in a film like this, deep plot just isn't what fans want.

		<shortDescription>Bad Movie with a lot of Religious Iconography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off. The film is about a couple of ill-tempered civil rights violating police officers, who, lie, cheat steal and circumvent civil liberties, such as illegal search and seizure,kidnapping, physical and verbal abuse, and denying people the right to fair and speedy trials by killing them. Not to mention gross violation of international law by invading a sovereign nation, Cuba.That is beside the point. As I watched this film, I could not help but notice that in virtually every scene, there is a crucifix or cruciform. At first I thought this was my imagination, then I reviewed the film again and in slow motion. Most of the cruciforms are in the center of the frames (shots). They were made of window frames, trees, body arrangements, paintings, and other items. I found well over 100 instances of this phenomena. I also found it disturbing. They painted the main villain, Jonny, as Jesus. He referred to his daughter as an Angel and his mother's name was Donna Maria (or, Madonna) and when he died, his body was in the form of a cross laying in a field of crosses made out of barbed wire posts.I find it very interesting, and I will research the events more thoroughlyAll in all, I thought the movie was poor at best</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Action and Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great movie with plenty of car chases, explosions, and comedy. Bad Boys 2 starts out with Detective Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) and Detective Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) is investigating the flow of ecstasy into Miami. The car chase is massive: it all starts with a bunch of Jamaicans start to chase Syd (Gabrielle Union). She is an undercover cop and Marcus' sister, who is carrying money for the drop off. Marcus and Mike, who is driving a brand new Ferrari, catch up to these Jamaicans. Syd ends up wrecking into a car and starts a pile up, which starts a shootout. Finally, the Jamaicans hijack an 18-wheeler hauling cars, so the chase starts up again. The end up on the Miami Bridge and the Jamaicans end up letting the cars roll off of the trailer. It was a great action sequence that lasts for little more then ten minutes. The rest of the film has another car chase and two more shootouts, which are great. This movie also has plenty of great cars in it, such as the new Cadillac CTS, some great American Muscle cars, and a 2003 Buick Blackhawk Concept Car. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are great together; they are very funny and just are awesome together. The whole crew seemed to work together very well. For being a sequel, it did very well, and I think this one was better then the first one. What is even better is that there is talk of them making a third one. I haven't heard any of the main details, but Martin Lawrence and Will Smith will be in it. Even though this movie is two and a half hours long, everyone should see it. This movie has great action and comedy that everyone will like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having thoroughly enjoyed the original film so much, maybe it was just my expectations were too high for this eventual sequel. Or maybe it simply is that bad. All the things that made Bad Boys an enjoyable, if not exactly a classic, film simply got lost as Michael Bay proceeded to prove that he is what I suspected all along: completely talentless. Simple things like plot are simply forgotten as the film lurches from effects pastiche to effects pastiche, with increasing incredulity. Whilst the effects at least provide something nearly-worthwhile to watch, the whole film simply ends up being two hours of pure purgatory, like watching a bickering, married couple who don't know when it is time to quit and get a divorce.

I'd just like to point out that Will Smith is a hell of a lot better and accomplished actor than Martin Lawrence. What in the world is his name doing SECOND in the opening credits?! After films like Black Knight, What's the Worst That Could Happen?, National Security and Big Momma's House, Lawrence should be forced to drop to his knees and thank God for still having a career in the first place.

There are two or three big action scenes with cars that were remarkable and pushed my adrenalin higher. That´s all. The story was therefore too long and boring. I am disappointed because I expected more suspense time. I hope the producer and director will create more intelligent blockbusters in future. But it seems they make brain washing with the younger audience that don´t expect too much from a so called action movie. I hope you will understand what I mean and I hope that the persons concerned are reading my lines. I want to see finally movies such as ARMAGGEDON or PEARL HARBOR!

		<fullReview>I love action movies, so having seen the Bad Boys trailer, I was really looking forward to it. Plenty of stuff blows up in the film, and the car chase scene was perhaps the best I've ever seen. Wow! Lots of cars tumbling. And I was particularly impressed by Joe Pantaliano, who transforms the everyday angry police chief into something more interesting.Unfortunately, all the jokes fall flat. Martin Lawrence comes across as annoying, Will Smith steals all the scenes (don't both cops get to do something useful?), and there's some silly "joke" violence regarding death that didn't work for me. They even reuse the pool joke twice. Characters do things in the film that don't quite make sense. The subplot with the Russian character is wasted. Will Smith is too cool so he doesn't get "unsettled and bothered" the way a straight man is supposed to. And they don't use the party music during the action scenes like in the promo; they use it during the quiet scenes. Who made that decision?Who should see this film:-- Action junkies, but only on a rainy day-- Angry police chiefs who instead of yanking the badges from the renegade officers who have crossed the line, offer full support.-- Nobody else, even if you think you might want toSo... action varies greatly from OK to great, but plot and everything else either bad or nothing special. I'll give Bad Boys II a disappointing 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

I liked the banter between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence and just generally watched the whole film with a big smile. It is not going to win any oscars and it does not make my top 10 movies, but I did like it and admired the scale of it all. The whole end bit in Cuba... it is on a par with any action film I have seen. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>just as good as the first...**spoilers**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i saw this movie around the time it came out on-to video and dvd and i havn't been able to stop seeing it. Although it might not be the first, i certainly hope (if they keep it like this) that its not the last in the series. Will Smith and Martin Lawerence play two maimi police officers who have to stop a major drug dealer before he can complete his transaction. While on the job, Marcus (lawerence) discovers that not only are he and his partner Mike Lowery (Smith) chasing the baddies, but also marcus' sister. When she gets too deep into it Mike and Marcus come to the rescue and to put it short, a lotta gunfire, explosions, and not to mention flying cars...all ensue, youll even see a nice barrell in the movie that looks like it should be in dahmers house. All in all this movie kept me interested and made me laugh several times as did the first one. Although its not the same as the first, it sure holds it's ground and makes for a solid action movie just right for popping in the dvd player anytime. 8/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great and Funny Action Movie. Nothing more and nothing less.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love action films. I get delighted with huge explosions, bullet-time shootouts, stylish fights, colorful photography and overlong car chases. I liked Matrix Reloaded. I love John Woo movies. I liked Bad Boys II and I like Michael Bay sense of graphic filmography.I do understand that things I like do not like everybody but no way I understand people going to a movie WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HE'S GONNA SEE. Didn't you know, haters of "mindless action", that you were going to see Bad Boys II, a MICHAEL BAY MOVIE? C'mon!! If you don't like action movies, second parts, and whatever you are always complaining, STOP GOING TO SEE IT (and stop bothering us so you went to see it and want your money back). Try "The Cat in the Hat" or "The Passion of the Christ" instead and you won't need to regret later on the IMDb.Bad Boys II has two obvious purpouses: enjoy action lovers and make a few laughs. Nothing more and nothing less.Racist? Black cops, Hispanic cops, White Captain, Cuban druglord... Multiculturality at its best. Jokes are part of the fun.Gore? It's not R-rated for the music played. Wake up. Even that, there's not much gore. I'm sure that all of you that complain about the gore are big fans of CSI, ER...No plot? I prefer to say "light plot". And you know what? I didn't buy this movie on DVD for the plot. I bought it for the action. If you want plot, look on Kubrick filmography.Too long? I never get bored of seeing car chases and shootouts. The longest, the better. Thank you, Mr. Bay.Crude Humour? Yes, crude humour, and what? Remember the R-rated? We all make crude humour every day at home, at the office, at April Fools and no one seems to be worried about that. We shouldn't complain about the jokes made in a movie whose only purpose is to make us forget we are living in a world that is in war.Violent? Of course. Action without violence is like a day without light. If you don't like it, go to see Steve Martin movies.They blow up a village of poor people? Nope. That "village" was a make-up for a massive cocaine factory without inhabitants. If anyone was injured was a criminal, not the poor people. (Tito explains it before crushing the village).Michael Bay has offered us a very stylish movie, with non-stop hyper-kinetic action scenes, beautiful scenery (two helicopters flying at sunset, the blue water with the yellow sun, the fire reflected everywhere...), cool camerawork (haitians house: superb, russian rave club: spectacular), amazing car chases (Kudos to Cadillac for the advertisement strategy), humour (the conversation between Mike and Marcus in the audio/video store were hilarious "And You, Mo**erF*****s, need Jesus" :D ) and very good music (Russian club, rap theme).A movie made for enjoyment. 9/10 Have fun!&gt;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course, it's easy to bash a film based on assumptions take from other better reviews, but Bad Boys II never professed to be more than a mere action-packed movie with some funny scenes ? la Beverly Hill Cops. Nor has Bay ever professed to be Coppola, which is why his characters do not have much depth, and his movies are almost always severely lacking in the story department.Instead, let's take Bay for what he wants to create and does really well ? action movies. And as far as action is concerned, Bad Boys II, while still suffering from a few glaring flaws, is in the upper echelon of such films. And having watching Charlie's Angels just before this, I can definitely say Bad Boys II is a very enjoyable experience provided you don't come here expecting some de Niro acting and Godfather drama.What Bad Boys II does have is some very good action scenes, funny scenes, and more importantly, a good use of the infamous bullet time effect. After seeing so many movies ripping off the Matrix trademark and using it merely for flashy effects, it was refreshing to at least see a movie that knew when to use them and, more importantly, didn't abuse them. Kudos to Micheal Bay for that! The action scenes alone make the movie worth watching if you're an action fan. The freeway scene in particular is excellent, and definitely ranks as among the best of its kind. Watch as cars explode at a deafening rate, and the directing here is excellent. Another scene that springs to mind is when Smith and Lawrence are in a house, and the camera continually whirls around them and the bad guys. Micheal Bay really knows how to dazzle his audience.In addition, some hilarious scenes involving the 2 main protagonists are great, such as Lawrence's behavior after he accidentally gulps down some drugs. The morgue scene is even funnier, but many will probably find it gross and fast-forward through it.As far as music is concerned, Bad Boys 2 isn't over the top, but still manages to be above average, although the soundtrack is mainly geared towards R'n'B and rap fans. However, all is not bright here. My main gripe with Bad Boys 2 is that it is excessively long. Now, this would not pose a problem, but the fact remains that there are several scenes that don't tie in, and you do get the feeling that it would have been better to completely leave them out. A few other scenes, that pop in for plot development, also fail miserably to tell us anything more about the protagonists and what's going on.But in spite of these flaws, Bad Boys 2 is still a very good action flick. Just don't expect anything more from it, and it will not disappoint you.7/10</fullReview>

This presents a problem: there's not even ten things you could say about this movie. Even the plot wouldn't take up ten lines. Nor would the acting. Will Smith plays Will Smith and does lots of Will Smith-type jokes. The other guy is simply a McGuffin for the aforementioned jokes. Every single element of this film is borrowed from the "Lethal Weapon" and "Beverly Hills Cop" series'. You've seen it all before a dozen times. Anyways, that's my ten lines - I'm out of here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Senseless violence dressed up real well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, the problem with Michael Bay is this: he makes everything look so damn good. Like a Coca-Cola advert in the 80's. Everything is extremely glitzy and appealing. It's not hard to imagine that he cut his directing teeth making TV commercials and videos for MTV. But while that high-gloss sheen may have done wonders to sell consumer goods and the latest rap albums, all it does for 'Bad Boys II' is paint a very superficial layer onto what is really a soulless film.That's not to say that the movie is all bad. As a technical exercise it shows that Bay is not only at the top of his game when it comes to action-flick special effects, but also that he is able to make those visual treats an effective part of the on-screen narrative. A good example for me was the stunning sequence that took place inside the Haitian gang's hideout. The camera swings incessantly around in a wide arc, seemingly moving through the walls; showing first Will Smith on the one side of the wall, and then the gang on the other side. This allows for some economy by Bay in that he is able to depict manoeuvring on both sides of the wall without having to resort to the quick cutting that is a staple of such shoot-out scenes. And if you watch closely enough you'll realise that it wasn't simply accomplished by clever cinematography: there must have been some pretty nifty work in the editing room too, to get this shot right.I also like the super slow motion shot of Martin Lawrence getting shot in the butt. Ever since 'The Matrix', directors have been using those slo-mo bullets for nothing more than eye-candy, and it was nice to see it employed here with a real purpose. The 'butt-graze' adds great visual comedy, but at the same time the shot also explains visually for the audience a sequence of events that would have been impossible to depict in real time.However, beyond the slick camera work, the movie is seriously deficient. One of the great things about the original 'Bad Boys' was the chemistry between Lawrence and Smith. In this film however, much of that is lacking. There is only one scene in the movie where the two of them display any of the bond you'd expect between two friends who have grown up together, worked, and killed together. That was the scene where a 15-year old boy picks up Lawrence's daughter for a date. The two leads are at their most effective as comics here, but I couldn't help feeling how out-of-place the scene seemed in the context of the rest of the movie. Was this piece simply slapped on during production to provide Lawrence and Smith a bit of stand-up comedy time?Another woeful aspect of the film is in the basic plotting of the story. This is a long film and for a significant chunk of the middle of the movie it really tends to drag. When I thought about why I felt so bored during those tedious middle sequences I realised that the screenwriters had made a serious error. For long periods in this movie, absolutely nothing is at stake. What I mean by that, is that no character is in jeopardy and that there is really little motivation for any of the characters to get involved in the dangerous predicaments that they do. Sure, we know that the two good cops have to do their job and catch that bad drug lord, but until Lawrence's sister (Gabrielle Union) is kidnapped and her life put in danger once again, there is no reason for Smith and Lawrence to take on so much personal risk. We know that Mel Gibson was quite suicidal in 'Lethal Weapon' and you expected that sort of vigilantism from his character. But in 'Bad Boys II' it seems that the characters are lead from one scene of carnage to the next simply so that Bay could hold some more pyrotechnic displays and show off a few camera tricks. (but wasn't that the same feeling you got from Bay's seriously drawn out butt-number, 'Pearl Harbour'?)And speaking of carnage, that is the aspect of the film that I hated the most. This is possibly one of the most gratuitously violent movies I have ever scene. I'm glad that the Captain (Joe Pantoliano in another wise-cracking cop role) really chewed Smith and Lawrence out for that highway rampage of theirs. I couldn't help picturing the taxi-drivers on our highways every time Smith weaved his Ferrari in and out of traffic leaving a trail of broken cars strewn behind him. Those are ordinary citizens whose lives are put in jeopardy folks! Not to mention the countless shoot-outs in busy metropolitan areas that must have done serious collateral damage. Perhaps it's just because I had watched 'Bruce Almighty' two days earlier - a film with a genuine goodness in its heart, or perhaps it's just because I'm your average crime-fearing Johannesburger, but the graphic and unnecessary bloodshed and devastation in this movie really sickened me. The most appalling scene was where they drive the Hummer jeeps down the side of a hill ploughing through countless rows of shanties in an informal settlement in Cuba. My domestic worker lives in a shack like that: it's all she has in the world. Yet the film seemed to show the wanton destruction almost with a grin.To sum up, 'Bad Boys II' is more violent, louder and more expensive than the original. But it's also less funny, less engaging and less memorable than the original too. It will still make millions at the box office though, and Michael Bay will continue to make uninteresting movies. Just because he makes this crap look so damn good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah. That's right. I said it. It is better than the original. I enjoyed this film. Martin made me laugh my ass off, especially in the scene where he is high on ecstacy.The only thing I did not like about the film were the matrix-style special effects. They weren't really necessary. I know that Michael Bay is on an all time high after his success with Armageddon and Pearl Harbor, but come on man--know when the quit.Anyway, the rest of the film was good. Even the villain had his funny moments. I know a lot of critics have given this film bad reviews, but then again they liked the 1996 movie Emma-now that would drive any sane person to suicide. Oh, and I usually agree with Ebert and Roeper on their choices for best and worst films, but not this time. If they ever read any of these user comments, I'd like to tell them that I really liked Bad Boys 2, and that I own the DVD. I watch it frequently. I might even get a t-shirt made saying that I am the proud owner of the Bad Boys 2 DVD-j/k, but there you go.If you're a fan of Martin and Will, then this is the movie for you. If not, then go buy some Nsync video or something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surpringly good action flick with some flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never been a big fan of Michael Bay, personally I have a love/hate relationship with his works. Bad Boys was pretty good, The Rock I didn't like, Armageddon was watch-able and Pearl Harbour bored me to disinterest. It wasn't until I witnessed McG's disaster films that I began to pity Bay a bit, at least he puts forth the effort to make entertaining summer films.I haven't seen the original Bad Boys in years now, but I still recall what great chemistry Smith and Lawrence had on the screen. Smith has improved a lot in terms of acting ability since 1995 while Lawrence has had some modest success. Bad Boys 2 succeeds, stumbles and fails at some parts of the film. The first half of the film succeeds, the causeway chase is seriously on my Top 10 car chase list. I always found stunt drivers and pyrotechnics is so much better at creating tension than watching a CGI figure jump on cars. It stumbles around the end because the film just feels like it was stretched a half-hour too long, with too many breaks between action scenes with plot (which has never been a Bay strength). By the end, the film feels exhausted and like it ran out of ideas or scenes to create.This is a part that I'm going to write a separate paragraph for due to the attention it's getting. I'm sure you've heard about the "bad taste" humour this film has. There is a line that exists between dark humour and poor taste, this line is in different places for different people and with some there is no line. In my case, I felt a little disgusted when Smith was reaching into a dead body for drugs but felt really nothing when Smith &amp; Lawrence were "interrogating" the latter's date with a gun. Like I said, the line is usually there and your tastes will guide you in finding that line.Otherwise, the film is standard Bay stuff: big action, large explosions, non-existant plot and star power. In Bad Boys 2 an equilibrium is discovered that makes it all worthwhile.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awesome buddy-cop action movie. Compares favorably to the early "Lethal Weapon" movies, but with stunts and effects fifteen years more advanced. In a character switch, Will Smith plays the loose cannon and Martin Lawrence plays the stodgy, "I'm getting too old for this s***" cop. Their chemistry is spot on in most places, although I found the scenes where they were being all close and bonding harder to swallow than the scenes where they were butting heads. And don't even try to sell me that "bad boys forever" signature in the high school yearbook. There's no way these guys were friends in high school. I usually find Martin Lawrence so over-the-top whacky-black that I don't enjoy him, but he's toned down in this movie and I could actually tolerate his character. Will Smith is one of my favorite actors. He manages to make whatever role he's in funny and can deliver ridiculous lines ("John Elway should definitely buy this car. Well, not this car, 'cause I"m going to mess this one up, but John Elway should definitely buy a car like this one!") believably.Kudos to Cadillac for getting their new car into both The Matrix: Revolutions and this movie. That car is probably the least sports-car, stunt-chase appropriate car on earth. Double-kudos to the marketing department.The stunts in this movie are what some say the stunts in the Matrix should have been: completely over the top, awe-inspiring, death-defying, and without excessive or obvious CG. Michael Bay's insistence on shooting practicals means that the parts of the stunt that you're sure must be CG probably aren't, and his effects team's artistic talent means that the parts of the stunt that you never would think were CG probably are. All in all, exactly what CG ought to be. For example, in one stunt sequence, cars are being flipped off the back of a tractor trailer while our heroes, in their Ferrari, zip and zing between them. Ironically, the cars are real, and were really flipped off the back of the truck with a pneumatic ram. It's the $300,000 Ferrari that's CG. This reliance on practicals means that, throughout the movie, every over-the-top stunt sequence has a credibility that even the best CG hasn't figured out how to mimic. Cars bounce around, somersault, and crash into each other like real cars ought to--and like CG cars never could--because they are real cars! Even if you hate this movie's plot and characters, rent it and fast-forward to the stunt sequences. You will not be disappointed (unless you don't like stunt sequences either, in which case forget it).Although I've already mentioned the CG a little bit, I should also say that the CG camera work, and visual effects in general, in this movie is excellent. Frankly, you don't normally see CG camera work like this except in movies by David Fincher (see the "camera drops through the floor to the vans with explosives" scene at the beginning of "Fight Club" or the "camera pushes through the cracked door" shot in "Panic Room"). Again, high marks to the visual effects team.The DVD is excellent as well. A movie like this deserves a ton of behind-the-stunts featurettes, and this one doesn't disappoint, with an entire second DVD devoted to featurettes, storyboards, making-ofs, and so on. However, I was disappointed that there was no commentary track on the main DVD. Hearing Will Smith, Martin Lawrence, and the director riff off of each other would probably have been awesome. Hearing the stunt coordinator and visual effects supervisor talk about the scenes would have been equally awesome. Ah well... They can't all be Fight Club.Overall Rating: 5 Stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Bad Boys 2' is quite lengthy and about half of its two hours plus is spent in car chases and other variants of action. This is I am afraid the good part of the film. The rest is a compilation of standard action, very expected racial black self-humor, and many tentatives to be funny, out of which no more than a couple succeed to extract laughs from the viewers. Will Smith seems to have lost his opportunity to become the next big Afro-American comedian, his acts are more and more routine, and he joins Eddie Murphy on the descending slope. The action scenes are not good enough to sustain the whole film. 9 for the action, 1 for the rest, the average is a 5 / 10 on my personal scale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first movie was okay and there were funny moments, but this one just went way too far. First, there is little funny dialogue. Martin Lawrence is pretty much the butt of every joke and I guess Will Smith was suppose to be the sexy, cool one. They both failed on both parts.Second, the action was way over the top. For cops, Smith and Lawrence opened fire every chance they got, on public streets and in every direction. Smith drove his own expensive car on-duty, then got mad when it got shot up. Totally unrealistic. The chase scene with Gabrielle Union, completely idiotic. She should have died on impact, not walk away without a scratch and ready to keep going on. And why, why does Union have to be the lead female in every one of these types of films. Is there a shortage of talented Black actresses, so they just keep calling her? I can only imagine the dozens of jobs she keeps many yet-to-be discovered actresses from getting. I'm tired of seeing her.Third, is everything else. The bad-guy, stereotypical Cuban, the various slow-mo shots of Will Smith shooting (I guess that's suppose to be where we notice how sexy he is, NOT)the stupid scene where they interrogate a 15 year-old boy, or am I suppose to believe Will Smith is this suave, street-smart cop, after watching him samba to his wack raps videos like 'Welcome to Miami' or 'Wild, Wild, West'. I just can't see him, the wackest rapper ever, as a tough guy.Puh-lease!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Standard Sequel Package</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bay has always been criticized for the gaping logic in the scripts he chooses to shoot. Like the first Bad Boys (Bay's debut film), we have a ridiculous action film on our hands and by law of sequels this one is even more ridiculous. Logic aside, I come to Michael Bay films because they're a pleasure to watch; what the script lacks in substance, Bay makes up for in his slick style. He's in full swing with Bad Boys 2 . ..Unfortunately, though, like Matrix Reloaded, the action loses its intensity really quickly for me since `the rest of the film' serves as a bridge between one action scene and the next, and the fact that action sequences are getting longer and longer doesn't help. The fact that the action sequences seem to be there just to be there in more and more action films doesn't help either. `What? That wasn't the ending? We're going where for *another* action finale?' I haven't been this bored in a film's ending since Speed 2: Cruise Control. I like Bay's visual style, but not that much.And the writers knew they were making a sequel to a successful film, so they popped in references to the original. Some felt natural and sincere to the second film's premise and plot and those made me smile, quite a few felt forced like a direct rip-off of its predecessor and those made me groan. `Now that's how you shoot! From now on, that's how you shoot!' It's just not the same as the first one, and I wouldn't even want to compare the two films to each other much except constant references virtually force you to. It is nice seeing elements carry over from film to film, but I seriously disagree with everything that made it to Bad Boys 2. I think it could have stood on its own in more places than it did if only given the chance. I liked the chemistry between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence - they played off each other well, and gave an interesting twist to the buddy cop genre - and so seeing them return is also welcoming (not to mention Joe Pantalion as their captain is a nice touch too). However, this film needs (at least) one less action scene to make it work . . . preferably, cut the last one. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good sleaze undercut by pathetic wit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Bay wants to do sleaze (and he clearly does), then why not quit it with the hopeless attempts at humour by Smith and Lawrence.This flick is notable for its cavalcade of perversion, but it sounds better than it really is because every sequence is undercut by too much editing and too much sound. The result is a wall of visual and aural noise.I appreciate shots looking straight up a gorgeous babe's legs at her panties and I appreciate lovingly executed bullet entries, but I don't appreciate the bubblewrap Bay packs around his visual ornaments.Considering the fact that Bay produced the new TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, it's clear he has a liking for the offensive (to some) and the downright disgusting. But I wish he'd make a lower budget film where he would not be required to ease the sleaze with comedy relief.BAD BOYS 2 has a really good car chase sequence that combines stuntwork with CGI. The movie is worth seeing for that.I'm not asking Bay to lighten up; hell, he can do whatever the f*** he wants to do, but I would sure love to see something that's exactly what he wants to do because no way would he CHOOSE to include the tiresome comedy crap he gives us in this movie.Still, I admire the guy's sensibilities, even if he can't direct drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite what the critics of this movie say, I think it was extremely funny. You just have to remember that it's nothing but an absurd, outrageous parody. Everyone knows that cops can't level half of Miami and leave a trail of bodies without consequences. As for being homophobic, so what?

		<shortDescription>Was There Even A Script Written For This Film?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS MAY BE AHEAD.I just finished watching "BAD BOYS II". This is the sequel to the first film, "BAD BOYS".What the hell was this sequel suppose to be even about? Did they even write a script for this film or did they just make it up as they shot it? I think producer, Jerry Bruckhiemer, should've concentrated more on making sure that the script was finished before production began. Instead, he concentrated more on whether or not he could get WILL SMITH (Mike) and MARTIN LAWRENCE (Marcus) back for this sequel, playing the lovable wise-cracking Miami cops. The storyline didn't seem to be focused enough. It was all over the place. "BAD BOYS II" was missing that certain magic the first film had.I'm a big fan of shoot'em up action movies (like the first "BAD BOYS"), but "BAD BOYS II".... DAMN!! Too much of an overkill. Don't get me wrong, "BAD BOYS II" isn't that bad. It has alot of action sequences that are more breathtaking than the ones in the first movie. There's a freeway chase sequence that has to be seen to believe. It even has the beautiful GABRIELLE UNION playing Marcus' sister, Sydney (an undercover DEA agent). I think Gabrielle is the best reason to see this movie. She is oh so hot in a bikini and has the nicest, juiciest lips on a woman.The bad stuff that should've been left on the cutting room floor are:1) The overuse of close-ups of bullets exploding into human heads.2) Dead naked corpses in the mortuary scene (later being ran over in a car chase).3) Cars crashing into everything and being demolished.4) All the unnecessary explosions.5) The bickering between Marcus and Mike. They sounded like an old married couple. It was annoying.By the way, since when did Marcus have a daughter? I don't remember her in the first film. What happened to his two (2) boys from the first film?This sequel is funnier than the first one, but the jokes are kind of over-the-top.The last 15-20 minutes of non-stop action in Cuba is just too much of an overkill and unbelievable. Only see this film if you don't mind watching mindless action on a rainy or boring day. Did I mention the length of this film? It's 142 minutes. This film is just way too long.To Michael Bay (director), "LESS IS MORE".</fullReview>

It has some exciting chase scenes and some nice humor, but its length takes it toll. Scenes labor on and on, such as the scene in the morgue and an unnecessary scene involving a teenage girl's first date. This is worth a rental and that's it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worse action flick that I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever had one of those moments while you're watching a movie, totally immersed in the plot, oblivious to your surroundings, and suddenly, you are yanked out of that experience; simply because you realized the movie was ridiculously long and bad. Well, this is one of those movies. Actually it would have been rewarding if at least in the beginning, you have a false sense that the movie was actually good. Unfortunately, it unbearable from the start to the end.The plot was incoherent that you just wonder how this movie was ever written or produced in the first place. It was unbearably long and winded. It could have used a lot more omissions in the editing room for those scenes that are simply illogical. Michael Bay made up for the movie's lack of structure by "unnecessarily" blowing up stuff and overly used of "CSI-like" effects (no wonder, it was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer). The flashy camera angles, instead of enhancing the effect of the actions were disconcerting and excessive that it lost it's entertainment effect. I could understand employing the same technique on movies like "Saving Private Ryan", "Band of Brothers" and "Black Hawk Down" but not a movie like BB2, that is trying to be both serious and comedic that just failed miserably in both sense.The dialog, just like the plot was just as bad. Funny at times but mostly the banter is long and not so funny. Most of the times, it seemed as if the dialog were ad-libbed, that there was actually a script written.I have seen better low budget comedy action flicks that though they were not what you would consider the best, they were at least entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They're back! Hooray! Or with some people who didn't like the first movie it would be a "boo". As you would've correctly guessed Will Smith, Martin Lawrence, Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay are back for more in this action comedy sequel of 2003. The question that comes to mind is: why did we have to wait eight years for a sequel? But then again a similar question would be asked for Terminator 3 I would say. This film is better but unfortunately there is much of the funny side that the first film once had. But the action is again in this film are well done. But at least there are some things that either still there or just got better like the action sequences and the storyline is a little bit better and a little bit weak but hugely entertaining stuff. As a fan of the first film I pleased with the film, I would say that this film is worth watching but (in my opinion) that this is more for people who liked the first movie but anyone who didn't see the first one watch this one as well as the first one.</fullReview>

For me a movie has to have a bit of realism and the fact that they're standing outside a US naval base shooting people and no-one takes them out is a bit unbelievable and spoilt the film slightly.Overall: it's a film that you can sit down to after a hard day of work and just let gloss over you.</fullReview>

More action and comedy mixed well thanks to Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. Basically Smith and Lawrence are pitted against a Cuban drug smuggler importing ecstacy into the US, Burnett's (Lawrence) sister is also trying to bring him down and eventually is kidnapped by "Johnny Tapia" (Jordi Molla) and it is up to Lowrey (Smith) and Burnett to rescue her. Simple plot, basic screenplay but the wit and action from Smith and Lawrence makes it enjoyable. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some movies are great. Some movies aspire for greatness, and fall short of the mark. And some movies are fluff, and nothing more.Bad Boys II falls safely in the third category, but it's fluff of the good kind. There's no way that seeing this movie will, in any way, shape, or form, change your life. You will not leave the cinema having been presented with an alternative world-view. This final point is worth repeating, because it is particularly important in this current climate of theological epics that before viewing the film the audience knows exactly what sort of a journey they are getting themselves in for:-You will not leave this film questioning your existing beliefs in our current, past, or future social and cultural structures.Bad Boys II is little more than a mish-mash of car chases (and pretty darn exciting ones at that: Wachowski brothers should take note!) gun fights aplenty (at one point Lawrence quips: "I think we just broke the record for the number of gun fights in one week") and a climax which will do little but leave the acronym WTF? running around your head for the next three weeks.It's tripe, it's fluff, it's silly, it's violent and it's downright offensive - but paint me purple and shout "Whoosah!" if it isn't enjoyable.*** out of ***** - It's just a movie!</fullReview>

Stick to other Jerry films like "The Rock" and "Armageddon" as they are 10 times better than this one. SPOLIER - Only reason for me giving this crap 2/10 is the Ferarri car chase and the excellent camera angles with cars being thrown off a trailer transporter. That was very good. Other than that?

		<fullReview>Like the first Bad Boys film, the sequel feels like something straight out of the 80's - thin plot, cheesy bad guys and hundreds of henchmen who get riddled by bullets by the heroes.Surely films like Speed and The Matrix put these bang-bang action movies where they belonged and we've moved on. Not so with Bad Boys 2, which could easily have been made in 1985.On the other hand there are some great action scenes and the freeway chase is ALMOST as much fun as the one in The Matrix Reloaded. It's incredibly sick instead of being blackly funny like Grosse Pointe Blank. Corpses burst and people get there heads blown off every ten minutes.If it wasn't so damn long I would say go and watch it for a guilty pleasure. It's fun, but stupid and crass, and is actually a step backwards for Bay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eight Years! The producers waited eight years to bring back one of the biggest thrill rides of 1995? Yes,they indeed did. "Bad Boys 2" comes on like all sorts of vengeance. For one,director Micheal Bay is again at the helm,and his first feature film in two years after the somewhat disasterous/mixed reviews of his epic saga "Pearl Harbor" released in 2001. Again,actors Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are back at the controls as the two they-so-gun-crazy Miami cops. At over two hours long,there is more carnage,more destruction,more violence,and more irresponsible imagery on screen than ever before. Need I say more?Let me talk about the explicit scenes of violence in this film as well. The body count is way higher than the first one,our two cops get riddled with bullets,run over on city streets and get blown up by land mines. And some people,including the innocent ones,die. For one,Micheal Bay is no Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone for that manner since he was trying to go either "Commando" or "Rambo" on this one. I saw this at a local drive-in theatre,under the stars where the abundance of children were present since this was an "R" rated feature. It was okay and in my book passable,but "Bad Boys 2" is too fast,too furious,too long--way too long,way too violent,and extremely silly. See it for Will Smith and Martin Lawrence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad Boys II squeezes every ounce of action out of the action genre in this glitzy sequel to 1995's Bad Boys. With a running time over two and half hours, Michael Bay lets it all hangs out in the second installment in which looks to be a trilogy in the making (Bad Boys III is slated for a 2005 date). With a bigger budget and 8 years to think about it, Bay throws all the cards on the table with flashy car chases, impressive explosions, and witty banter. What I loved about the first Bad Boys was the gigantic amount of chemistry that Will Smith and Martin Lawrence have together. They continue that chemistry in the Bad Boys II, with more hilarious dialogue then before. I loved everything about the movie, from the preview trailers to the soundtrack. Bad Boys II is that movie where you just need to sit back and enjoy. Many would argue the lead characters complete lack of disregard for property and such, but it works in a movie such as this. It's not made to be humane, it's made to clip along at a fast pace...to entertain totally. I found the plot, smuggling drugs through a morgue, quite original. This leads to a hilarious scene in which the two investigate the morgue, "Mike! The motherf*cking head fell off!" The car chases are flashy and quick, but I feel most camera angles work. Bay loves action, and he shows it here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read Ebert and I usually like Ebert, but something tells me he and a bunch of over-rated movie reviewers screened Bad Boys II at home alone in their giant home theatre rooms with a troth full of snacks while fighting hypoglycemic attacks. Because if they had heard the audience reactions like I did they'd give this movie at least a 'B' for entertainment value alone. Okay Academy Award stuff? No! But is Bad Boys II a great action, drama, funny as heck flick? Hell yeah! Is the movie shameless non-stop-action? Hell yeah again, Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) still protect the streets of Miami, but now they've stumbled onto a ring of Cuban drug dealers smuggling high-potency Ecstasy into the local clubs. Drug lord Johnny Tapia played by Jordi Molla a wickedly wonderful villain. Now we got a real good thriller with brilliant comic relief. I heard people cracking up all throughout the movie. Nothing is cooler than spontaneous eruption of laughter in a theatre with a well-mixed audience. It happens a lot in Bad Boys II. The well-mixed crowd was rolling in the isles. Every bad boy one-liner works in this action flick. I'm a Black guy living in a predominately white suburb my Asian and White friends are laughing as loud as me.Martin Lawrence &amp; Will Smith have way better chemistry than Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. You know why? Because Martin and Will are funny! Roaring funny! And after 90 minutes you think this movie is ready to stop? Hell naw! `See that's that bullsh*t!' As Mike Lowrey played tough by Will Smith would say. But naw it ain't over, its time to invade Cuban airspace to rescue one the finest women on the big screen today, hot star Gabriel Union (`Deliver Us From Eva,' `Bring It On'). Add that with an adrenaline rush of explosions, excessive gore and chase scenes right up there with The Matrix Reloaded, then you got yourself a damn good gotta see summer blockbuster. Led by perennial hot-dog director Michael Bay he did: "The Rock," "Armageddon," and "Pearl Harbor". Michael Bays got a real show off cinematography style of directing just right for this high testosterone action flick. The camera kinetically does it's best to keep up with the Bad Boys action. And when it does it's only for slo mo tracking of a bullet from gun to forehead that makes CSI look like a six-grade frog dissection class. Bad Boys II is mo'faster, mo' furious, and 2 exhilarating to see just once. Holla!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Boy II 2 Mean and 2 Long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:Bad Boys 2 follows the sequel formula of being bigger and louder than the original. It runs for 2 hours and 26 minutes in length and contains more action and stunts compared to the 1995 original. I for the most part enjoyed BB2 more than BB, but that's not really saying much. Bad Boys was a good movie after one viewing, but as you watch it more and more with age, you realize that it's not a very good movie.A lot of what transpired from the 1995 hit, is seen on the big screen with the sequel, however the sequel pretty much just takes that old and worn photo and blows it up 10 times bigger for all to see once again.Bad Boys 2 was much too long and way too mean. Sure, the action and the stunts were good and the movie was funny. But it was over the top and I felt guilty after for laughing at such mean acts of comedy. These are suppose to be two cops who try to up hold the law and put a stop to drug trafficking, but instead they kill dozens upon dozens of innocent people while doing so.Exactly what kind of cop would pretend to be drunk and pull out a gun and threaten and then sexually come onto a 15 year boy? (mind you, it was funny...but I sensed something terribly wrong as I was laughing along with the rest of the crowd.)What kind of cops would race down a hill with homes planted on top of it with a HumVee, destroying everything in it's path? Possibly including more innocent people. Bad Boys 2 is long and It gets tiring after the one hour and forty minute mark, because you realize that it's not going to end anytime soon. The movie does deserve an R rating (living in Toronto, it's a rare thing to occur) and it holds too many unnecessary side plots which evidently extends it's length (The Haitian car chase anyone?).It even goes as far as ripping The Matrix off. However, I think the most annoying aspect of the entire movie itself is the two main characters of Mike and Marcus who never shut up. All they do is yell and swear at one another and they are suppose to be partners in crime. The constant arguments also extends the length of this movie as well. Sitting there in the theater, I saw a Micheal Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer movie. I got exactly what I expected (I suppose), but what really killed the movie off for me was it's length. I could forgive the meaness and I could forgive the constant arguing, but when the final act turns into something like The Rock, my eyes were rolling and burning with frustration. Micheal Bay needs to get some new techniques in film-making and I think Bruckheimer needs to be the one who tells him so (Can Bay doing anything by himself???!!!). But like the saying goes, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." and why would they? Their repetitive and tired formula makes money. Who gives a damn what people think.With the success of the sequel, I smell another one coming out in the midst. This time, I predict the set-up will take place in prison where Marcus and Mike are finally imprisoned for life for all the reckless behaviour they have unleashed upon the people of Miami. Hopefully they are incarcerated without a chance for parole, thus providing accuracy for their beloved catch phrase "Bad Boys for life!". 4/10.</fullReview>

It turns out it is possible to be bored by expert special effects and car chases.At first I thought it was funny to see Henry Rollins, the former anarchist punk rock god, play a DEA agent. By the end of the film I simply thought it was sad. Another reviewer thought it was funny to watch the two lead actors try to terrify a kid who came to take Lawrence's character's daughter out. I thought it was pathetic. It's too bad, as I enjoyed the first movie a fair bit, and there were times even in this one where the actor's comic abilities were undeniable.SPOILER:The idea that Castro is supported financially by Ecstacy manufacturers was the absurdity which removed the last possibility of enjoyment of this film for me. To then see a bunch of American cops take pleasure in driving through the homes of poor Cuban people was simply too much. Everyone concerned with making this film should be ashamed for their part in it, as perhaps I should, for seeing it through to the end.If you want to see an entertaining, even thrilling movie that will stay with you for a while, check out 28 Days Later, and give this thing a pass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>they're bad, alright</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't been really excited about this one since the past Jerry Bruckheimer-Michael Bay tandems on films haven't turned out as well as they were advertised ("Armageddon", "Pearl Harbor", and even the first "Bad Boys"). So I wasn't really expecting anything much. I guess I shouldn't have expected anything at all."Bad Boys II" tries very hard to be a good action movie. It uses only enough story to tie together its action sequences and the whole 2 1/2 hours are too much and this only drags the inane story. The script and acting do nothing to help the story and its action sequences, supposed to be one of the movie's main attractions, are weak and bloated. Not even the chemistry of Lawrence and Smith can save the fatuous one of Bruckheimer and Bay.In the final analysis, it's just another summer movie that tastes like salted popcorn. It tastes good while it lasts, but eventually you end up rather dry and thirsty.</fullReview>

I kept wondering how much $ these guys were pulling down, did you get a looksee at Lawrence and Guido Pataliano's homes? Uhhh okay there guys. Not skimming off da top or something.....not yer typical Miami cop saleries shall we say....This was almost like Miami Vice meets the Rock, more or less. So over the top, and sooooo over-long, and if I remember right, that there Hummvee chase went from Havana(?) all the down to Gitmo Base(!?) clear across the entire length of Cuba.....sure guys, in a matter of a couple hours max. Uhh guys.......Just too much going on here, some editing woulda been better. **1/2 for the good parts, but leave out the bad next time, alrighty?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ok, BB2 is a perfectly explosive, funny cop buddy movie. it's got pretty much what the first one had, although Gabrielle Union definitely deserves more screen time. The main problem is 2 1/2 hours of the same virtually non-stop action is just way over the top. a brainless action movie should not be putting you to sleep, and this one can, just becuase of the endless repetition. huge car chases are one thing, but how long can you watch the same thing again and again and again? they could have easily chopped 30-40 min off of this movie. it reminded me of FaceOff, where you think the movie is finally over, but then... a whole other action scenario. geez, was that really necessary? i wanna go home already!!! BB1 was 32 min shorter and 32 min better. the end.</fullReview>

There are a few scenes (like the one where Martin Lawrence's daughter's boyfriend comes calling) where you may fall of your seat laughing.But it is a neat action movie. I never knew that you could generate so many laughs in a morgue in the middle of night with a bunch of corpses (you will see what i mean). Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are very good in their roles and the supporting cast is not bad either + check out that hot body of Lawrence's sister.All in all not a bad action/comedy. i give it 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a summer movie pure and simple. This does not mean that it is good. First the plus sides. There are quite a bit of funny scenes in the movie. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith have a great chemistry and make the movie work. Quirky characters keep you interested and add to the comedy of the film. Now the bad, the story is weak, and mostly just and excuse for explosions, gun battles, and slick scenery. Some funny lines are beat to death, and become annoying. The quirky characters become annoying or dissapear from the film completly. I could go on and on. What this movie boils down to is that it is all glam and no substance. Although, if you are seeing this film, than this is what you are expecting.</fullReview>

This movie is mindless action and jokes that are often good... most of them were from commercials already but some are new.Here are the movies major flaws that probably made many hate it. 1. Cops don't drive Ferraris and live in large homes on the beach. 2. 2 ecstacy (sp?) pills will kill you. 3. There are so many action sequences that go nowhere.Obviously there are many more but this movie is still enjoyable. Don't go to this movie for a great plot on catching the bad guy or whatever. Go to have some fun with the action and enjoy all the jokes. There are at least 2 scenes not from commercials that were great humorwise.Bottom line: If you wanna have fun watch this. If you want a real movie find something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is really a tough movie to review... Technically (as in technologically), the movie is outstanding. The special effects are top-notch - a good step or two beyond what you usually see in movies these days. If much CGI was used, I couldn't tell. The plot was entertaining enough, and the movie was a bit long, but I never felt like it was dragging. There are some VERY funny parts...However, the problem with this movie lies in its darker sides...and there are a number. This is definitely not a movie for kids, or really anyone under 18. In fact, the movie should be rated NC-17, or at least something to make it obvious that it pushes the "rated R" envelope for violence. Some might argue that I just have a weak stomach. First year anatomy required us to open a person's chest, and then dissect everything in it - no queasiness here. This movie has a number of problems. (possible spoilers below)1) The way corpses are treated in the film is very degrading. Driving a truck over a corpse is defiling it - and certainly not something laughable. Each one of those corpses was a person - someone's recently deceased brother or sister, and having them strewn across the highway is just not funny.2) The depiction of the violence, while amazingly realistic, is a bit "over the top". I really don't need to see the splatter and chunks fly off the back of a guys head (gunshot to face) into someone else's face.3) The worst part of this movie is that the characters (police, no less!) don't seem to care about the consequences of their actions. The repeated gun battles and car chases are more than enough proof... At one point, a speedboat flies off a trailer, and the back of it plows through the windshield of an oncoming car. Having worked in an emergency room, I can not begin to describe what this would do to the occupants of the car. Instead of showing some hint of regret or remorse, our protagonists give us a simple "WHOA", and are seen enjoying a Bar-B-Que joking around just a short while later. This is not an isolated incident, and literally hundreds of innocents would have been killed if these scenes actually took place.</fullReview>

Also I know many like the new camera angles and special effects Michael Bay used but it actually made the film worse. Many of these directors today rely too much on special effects that look fake. Stick to the main agenda.I will say this, I was very happy with the ending. I thought it was a nice little spin. If they had edited a good chunk of the middle, they would have been fine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad Boys II is undoubtebly an anticipated sequel, and as most sequels the previews try to grasp your attention and the movie is contraversially hyped up. Walking into the theatre for this movie, my expectation were extremely low, and to those this movie delivers. While it is entertaining and funny at certain times, this movie is filled with action sequence clichés which could be viewed in movies such as Lethal Weapon, Beverly Hills Cop etc. These movies, being relatively old, offered some originality on their release, Bad Boys II, however, is a complete remake of the oldest action sequences we have seen hundreds of times over. While the plot, being fuzzy, unsynchronized but decent, is astonishingly way too long. two and a half hours is enough to make people cry at the thought they have to sit through this entire movie and not being fully gratified by viewing it. Mrtin Lawrence and Will Smith do make a good team, but this movie was just not good enough to merit any good reviews or positive-criticism. (5/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching a Jerry Bruckheimer produced film is the cinematic equivalent of consuming empty calories. It will fill you up, but it ends up taking up space that could be occupied by things that are better for you."Bad Boys II" is no exception to this rule. Director Michael Bay is a filmmaker fully grounded in Bruckheimer's rule of box office hit: bigger, louder and faster are better. Bay makes the movie snap along at a quick beat and there are plenty of action-packed sequences, all filmed with a post-John Woo flair for slow motion, kinetic action, random explosions and macho posturing during the middle of chaos. Oh, and there's a story hidden in here somewhere as well.Martin Lawrence and Will Smith return as detectives Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowrery, respectively, two Miami narcotics officers who are magnets for acts of violence and leave war zones in their wake. As the film begins, they are cracking down on a drug cartel trafficking ecstasy in Southern Florida. Years of tension between the two police officers is starting to take its toll on Burnett, who is secretly plotting to transfer out of the squad because of all the stress he must endure being partnered with Lowrery.This anxiety is further compounded by the fact that Lowrery has the hots for Burnett's sister Sydney (Gabrielle Union), a DEA agent who, as fate would have it, is working a different angle on the same case. Apparently a major Cuban drug dealer named Johnny Tapia (Jordi Moll?) is trying to muscle his competition in Miami through various degrees of violence, and is working with Ms. Burnett, whose cover is a crooked banker laundering his money.Really, after that bit of exposition, the rest of the film writes itself. What follows are some of the most incredible action scenes ever filmed, including a twenty-minute sequence that starts as a heist gone wrong, turns into a car chase, changes into a violent shootout, and then turns back into a car chase involving an 18-wheeler dumping the cars it's transporting along the MacArthur Causeway.The action scenes are, in essence, the only reason to watch the film. The rest of the movie is a downright mess. The characters are poorly written and unmemorable, the dialogue unbelievable under certain situations, and the narrative full of needless `comic' excursions and cornball scenery chewing. And all I can say is thank goodness for the Internet Movie Database, otherwise I wouldn't have remembered the names of half the characters in the film.The problem with "Bad Boys II" is that like most summer releases for the last decade, it completely throws common sense out the window. The main characters leave chaos and mayhem behind them and never once are given a reprimand for their actions. The movie apparently wants to have all the fun of large scale pandemonium without all the consequences (deaths of innocent by-standers, lawsuits, suspensions, etc.). And villains are not human beings; they're just pop up arcade targets that exist only to be bullet fodder.34 years ago when Sam Peckinpah gave us "The Wild Bunch," the first modern day action film, large scale violence was both exhilarating and scary. It showed us the horrors of aimless gunfire and the cost of recklessness; bloody and mutilated human beings, loss of respect for human life and families destroyed. It's sad to see that in 2003, following a similar scene that seemingly would leave numerous innocent people orphaned or widowed, Will Smith's character chooses to chew out his partner for accidentally putting a few bullet holes in his Ferrari.Just be thankful he didn't bad-talk your mama, too.5 out of 10 stars: the action scenes were good but everything else reeked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Explosive, action-packed, in-your-face sequel reunites narcs Lawrence and Smith as they try and apprehend the vile leader of an underground ecstasy ring. To complicate matters further, Lawrence is suffering from a major case of anxiety and considering finding a new partner, while Smith secretly begins to court his longtime partner's younger sister (Union). Violent, edgy, high-energy action scenes and charismatic performances from two great leads help to elevate the formulaic material, though the comedy tends to be wildly uneven at times. Goes on too long, and is much more violent than it needs to be, but as an adrenaline rush of action and excitement it works just fine. **?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PLEASE, do not go see Bad Boys II if you have any self-respect! I loath the fact that Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay will see one red cent of mine because of this insulting piece of film trash. It is the WORST, most OFFENSIVE movie I have ever seen. Unlike our president, I do not use the word "evil" lightly, but it is an adjective that I will not hesitate to use in describing BBII. Were Will Smith and Martin Lawrence supposed to be heroes? Really, with all the damage to public property, destruction of homes, RAMPANT violation of civil rights, terrorizing of innocent 15 yr old boys, necrophilia, and obsession with humping rats that they displayed, I began to think that humanity would be better served if both were shot. Personally, I was rooting for the Russian guy to win at the end, even as a drug dealing club owner he was the least offensive character in the film.And how cruel is it for a film to mock a young girl who's only overweight? After seeing three friends suffer from anorexia, I can assure you I thought that was hilarious. Har har.Anyone who laughs at the sadistically cruel, hateful, homophobic, and racist jokes told in this film needs to go check themselves into the nearest mental hospital. Now. This is not black humor. Hey, I LOVE black humor! "Fight Club" was the best movie of the 90s. I even like lots of blood and gore, "28 Days Later" rocked my world. I'm not a pansy, uber-moralistic movie-goer who faints at anything more bloody than a paper cut. But this .. . this is just sick. There is nothing in this film to justify the levels of violence it displays. And Will Smith, I always thought you were a decent guy. After seeing you in a film as dehumanizing as this one, I don't think I can ever truly enjoy Independence Day and MIB again. Shame on you. Would you want your son to watch this crap? I think not.BTW - some parents brought their 12 yr old to the showing I was at. DO NOT DO THIS! BAD IDEA! No one under the age of 18 should see this movie.Also, why are all the positive comments bemoaning the proliferance of negative reviews on this site? There are many more positive reviews than negative ones, a fact which makes me want to never watch another movie again. That someone can get so much pleasure out of watching people die that they call this "the best movie of the summer" makes me lose all faith in humankind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm gonna say it outright: this movie was bad. It's this kind of movie that makes people hate Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer. I saw it last night and while it's not the worst thing I've ever had the displeasure of seeing for myself, it can't be let off the hook. This movie was two and a half hours, give or take. Now, that's already too much time dedicated to hear Martin Lawrence and Will Smith bicker. It was kind of funny the first time around and now it's simply grating. Not only that, I didn't find their playful banter funny at all this time, save for maybe two or three different occasions. The movie has several (many, actually) action set pieces that, while well shot and technically impressive (nice uses of slow-mo and imaginative camera work), fail to deliver any real suspense. The story revolves around our two heroes trying to bring down an ecstasy ring headed by a Scarface wanna-be, who truth be told looks like Fisher Stevens after a Mojito and LSD bender. I honestly felt like this movie was purposely trying to insult my intelligence. The story is utterly ridiculous and the last section of the movie veers into something out of left, center and right field combined. If you've ever seen Schwarzenegger's Commando, think about how that movie ended and you'll see what I mean. Movies are supposed to be watched with some suspension of disbelief, the degree of it depending on the movie itself. I mean, you're not going to go see the Hulk and complain about the fact that there's a big, green dude running around, smacking mutated poodles up against a tree. It's a comic book movie for Pete's sake! Going into this movie, I made sure to keep my expectations low because judging from the previews I'd seen, I knew this movie was going to be an exercise in style over substance. Even watching it in that frame of mind, I was in awe of how empty the whole thing was. Watching it, I felt plain depressed. It's one of those things that you watch and shake your head over. Movies like this are the reason that Hollywood movies are so frowned upon. It's crude, it's pretty violent and the jokes reek of being tinkered with one time too many, proof that maybe there were way too many writers aboard this mess. One thing that I really didn't like about this movie was the way certain racial stereotypes were played up. Everybody who's Cuban in this movie talks like Tony Montana. The Russians sound like they just graduated from an ESL course and of course, they've gotta have vodka in hand. The Haitians are made to look like uncivilized criminals, one stereotype that I could swear gets used in any movie to describe Haitians and Jamaicans with. I'm not trying to get up on a soapbox here but I'm pretty sure someone is gonna be offended by some of the racial material here. I mentioned before that the movie is pretty violent and while it is kind of over-the-top, it doesn't veer into being uncomfortable. I guess if they make a Bad Boys III, they'll probably top the violence level in this one by having Will shoot someone in the face with a sawed-off and then have him and Martin cracking jokes about how funny the guy looks with no face and if he needs help picking up his teeth.The movie isn't a complete disaster; it just wouldn't be fair to say so. There were some positives but just a few. Gabrielle Union is actually believable in her role and I'm glad she was able to hold her own in her scenes. Martin and Will share a scene where they terrorize Martin's daughter's date that was absolutely hysterical. The chase scene where the Haitians are rolling cars off of the back of that car transport was nice (I'll still give kudos to T3 for the crane chase over this one). There were several deaths in the movie where people got it real bad. Joe Pantoliano is always a joy to see angry.I've spent too much time on this already. I think this movie is definitely gonna appeal to those people who like their movies like their music videos: real pretty, real glitzy and ultimately, real empty. I hope to see Will and Martin do some independent quality work one day in the future. And I hope that Michael Bay didn't sell his soul to the Devil to waste our time with this. Give me something substantial!RATING: ** out of *****.</fullReview>

I was so excited to see this movie too. I loved the first one the problem is there was no second one...If you can call bad boys 2 "BAD BOYS II". There were so many problems with this movie. First of all the action was way,way,WAY!! overkill but they did that just to cover-up the lack of story &amp; plot. Another problem with this movie was the scoring (the bad boys theme from the first film)where the hell did that go??? It felt like I wasn't watching A sequel just another action movie with martin lawrence &amp; will smith. In the first film the bad guys were alot more high-tec I mean sure the first movie was about drugs too! thats why this movie sufered it was about the same thing, could we come up with anything diffrent? dose everything have to revolve around drugs? I mean sure they live in miami but damn they can do better then that. There was alot more dialog &amp; screen presents with the bad guys in the first film, in this one they are more less thugs, just tag-alongs. The only good feeling that this movie gave me was the comedy. That's why I give this film 1 &amp; half stars .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original BB was a hit and it deserved it when it distinguished itself from every other action film. It had action and it had sex appeal and plenty of spent bullets but the plot between Smith and Lawrence was actually interesting andfun to watch. Now, at two and some hours long, and their hate-hate relationship drilling you the entire time, you aren't so much worried about whether they live or die, but whether they will do either anytime soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Massive Action Cheesecake or Sneaky Satire on America? (small spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love GOOD action movies and really enjoyed the original Bad Boys when it came out in '95. I was looking forward same great banter, major action and slick directing, with a much bigger budget.The movie cost $75,000,000 and Bay tries to give you your money's worth. Shoot-outs, car chases, cadavers, Haitian Gangs, Russian gangs, Cuban Gangs, and the KKK all add to the heaping body count and adrenaline rush. It gets your rocks off seeing everyone and everything blow up. Some have called it just a little pornographic. I think that's the point.What I found really interesting is that hidden beneath all the FX and explosions, Bad Boys 2 is a sneaky little biting satire of the american public and the oval office. Consider it Jerry B's little subliminal side trip....Martin Lawrence is your middle-class Joe Average Family Guy, Det. Marcus Burnett. He along with almost everyone in the police department is starting to rethink this whole "Shoot First, Ask Questions later" strategy. So far it's not working out: The bad guys are getting away, innocent people are dying, it's costing millions, and it's a political nightmare. [Sounds like a typical "liberal" American view of the world these days, right? ]Will Smith is Marcus' partner, Det. Mike Lowrey, a testosterone cowboy with a big trust fund. He just wants to keep on kicking some ass. Who cares if the shootouts shut a city down, kill dozens of officers and innocent civilians. It's all about the the short-term adrenaline rush and perpetuating the Good Ole American NRA Way. No Negotiation. [Sound like anyone you know?]In between action sequences, Mike attacks and ridicules Marcus' liberal ways, embarrassing him and inciting dissent even in his own home. Marcus tries to reason but Mike is too knee deep in denial to see the truth, even when it stares back at him in his high school yearbook photo. Early on, Marcus announced he was separating from Mike but naturally this temporary glimpse of reason doesn't last long. [Any bells going off yet?]Lack of communication between agencies messes up an otherwise coordinated sting operation and the bad guy flees the country. At this point Marcus is with Mike and against everyone in their way. Rather than obey established rules of conduct for their agency, government and international law, the newly regrouped Bad Boys lead a heavily armed team to illegally attack on foreign soil. They liberate one American hostage and in the process, kill several innocent civilian foreigners and decimate their land. [I'm getting that Deja Vu feeling again]In the end, Liberal Marcus is no more and Conservative Mike is bigger and badder then ever. The moral of Jerry's Fable:--When the natives get restless and start to catch on; blow stuff up, imperil their family, and invade another foreign enemy. Your popularity is assured. [Just remember to buy a new pool.]+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Final Thoughts: At 2+ hours long, BB2 is like gorging on super-rich action cheesecake. If you like that kind of thing and can ignore the brainy stuff you'll love it. Even with the clever satire though, I walked away feeling like a bulimic after supper.(2** stars out of 5*****)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I admit the action scenes were extraordinary, I was shocked at the amount of gore, and more shocked that the gore gets a "laugh" reaction out of the moviegoers. What are we becoming, honestly? Do we really need to see a guy's dismembered corpse in a bucket, or a guy blown up by a land mine, or corpses flying out the back of a van during a car chase? Should humor be juxtaposed with the beheading of a cadaver? Roger Ebert was right, this film is a sad commentary on American moviemaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shakey Cam and Extreme Close-ups are a poor excuse for a storyline.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching Bad Boys II over the weekend was supposed to be an exciting event. Bay's second direction of the film "Bad Boys" was terrible. He uses shakey cam and close-up effects through out the entire film. I feel that this technique is widely being used to replace a good storyline. It doesn't portray action to me, it just makes me sick, literally. During peak scenes he also uses constant rotation of the camera around the actors. It's unpleasent and annoying. Normal movie goers will probably like this flick and it's effects, but from a director's stand point, it's over used and annoying.The story had it's funny moments, however. I truely like Will's and Martin's acting. It's a great buddy-cop flick filled with extreme excitement and action. It's just not my kind of movie anymore.</fullReview>

And why wasn't Joe Pants in any more scenes??? WHat a wasted effort. Lets hope part 3 will be an apology, if it ever gets greenlighted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TALK ABOUT OVERKILL!!!!! **Spoilers inside**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I know that summer blockbusters tend to be the typical popcorn movie, meaning that it employs the 'blow-alotta-stuff-up' formula. But Bad Boys 2 takes this to a whole new level, essentially to mask the numerous plot holes and other errors in the film itself. The original Bad Boys was tolerable.....I liked it back when I first watched it in '95. But that film, when you watch it later on you quickly get annoyed at all of the petty arguments between the main stars (Will Smith &amp; Martin Lawrence). Still, it was a decent action film with a much better executed story. The sequel tries to take what the original was and multiply that by about.... oh, about 20!!! The storyline/plot QUICKLY gets lost in all of the explosions and graphic violence throughout this 2 ? hour action film. Again, seeing the audience that BB2 is trying to attract, I guess this is SOP, and therefore acceptable. I'm sure the budget for this film is astronomical, as there is enough carnage to fill ANYONE'S appetite. After about an hour into the film I couldn't help but get the feeling the Michael Bay was trying so hard to maybe fulfill a fetish he has with blowing stuff up. The gore in this film is almost sickening, note the scene with the corpses falling onto the street during a chase scene and then subject to being run over by cars, some even getting decapitated. The sickness is throughout this wanna-be action epic, from beginning to end....with the main bad guy in the film getting a bullet in the head only for his lifeless body to fall on a mine and half his body blows up. Is that all REALLY necessary?For what it is, the two stars come through as far as comedy goes. I was expecting the worse as far as dialogue between the two, which in the original was simply belittling each other amidst gunfire and chaos. That atrocious aspect of 'dialogue' is, not surprisingly, in BB2 as well&amp;#8230;.but somehow it seems a little more balanced with straight-out hilarious sequences. The 'daughter's boyfriend' scene is a classic. The explosions, gun fights and car chase scenes help you get through the fact that this film is 2 ? hours... which is a major flaw in this film. BB2 could have EASILY been 2 hours or less, and it might have been a better film. There was numerous dialogue and scenes that just have no purpose in the film. Things just seem too drawn out. By the way, the 'Police Story'-esqe Hummer scene was a blatant rip-off and disgrace to that classic action sequence from the Jackie Chan film. I guess Michael Bay remembered that scene and said, 'yea that has a lot of destruction and carnage too, lets put it in!!' YAWN! By the last half hour of the film everything gets pretty cheesy, all with Bay's vain attempt at drama with Lawrence's sister getting captured. I mean, since when does any police department engage in tactical warfare, much less without any prior training? Seeing two Miami narcotics cops throwing grenades and wielding machine guns as if they were born to do it just didn't do it for me. In other words, 'yeah, right!!' Again, over-the-top.Overall this film essentially serves its purpose, if you want to spend 2 ? hours watching a mindless, overly violent action film this summer, this is the one to watch. I just feel that it was in bad taste, with the director getting too caught up in himself and his budget. The action scenes, although sometimes entertaining, just felt overdone...and that defeats the purpose altogether. Out of 4 stars, I'd give Bad Boys II 1.5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The kind of movie that looks great in the previews but sucks in the theatre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once upon a time, action movies made sense; they didn't try to be funny to the point that they would make the comedy genre, and they had enough action to make a scene realistic. Bad Boys II by comparison is an over the top gaudy movie that is backed by its own awesome 160 million dollar budget. It tries to out-do every consecutive scene from the previous one with bigger explosions, more ludicrous scenarios, and unfunny crude jokes.Director Michael Bay this time seems to have outdone himself. This movie is similar to Matrix Reloaded in which the Wachowski Brothers also wanted to show off their technical and cinematic action scene abilities. But it's different because it doesn't regard international law, domestic law, and seemlessly turns Miami into a battle torn playground. If this was even modeled by real life, these heroes would have been fired within the first 10 minutes of the movie.The movie revolves around the two police officers from Bad Boys II: problematic husband Marcus Burnett(Martin Lawrence) and rich bachelor Mike Lowrey(Will Smith). They are part of the Tactical Narcotics Team(TNT) of the police that deals with matters that overlap the Drug Enforcement Agency. It seems that the TNT can cause mass havoc without a reprimand, enter homes without warrants, and shoot up armies of other countries with absolutely no problem at all. Fast forward every 10 minutes and you get a new scene that wants to outdo the previous one, not only in effects but in presentation. The movie wants to engross the audience so much in these explosions that it fails to capture the essense of any of the characters. You don't care if anything happens. In fact, the 146 minute movie seems to drag along with neverending action scenes, scenes which are mastered to perfection in technique, but lack the emotion and whole heartedness of a true action flick.This time, the TNT has to track down one of the biggest ecstasy dealers in North America. This dealer has capture Burnett's sister and off to the rescue is this duo with their team that break every law the police stands for.Just about everything is morbid and crude about this movie: a drug dealers who ships drugs in carcasses, jokes about rats getting laid the "human" way, and people getting their heads blown off. Maybe I'm missing the point, but aren't police supposed to save lives?Is this movie visually appealing? Yes. Does the action satisfy the moviegoers? Yes. Is it worth your $8.00? No. The endless one-liners and anti-hero pattern inherrant in these two "heroes" make one want to just toss this movie strip into the trash and burn it to ashes, which is where it should belong.5/10</fullReview>

The whole scene with dead bodies flying out of the vehicle is really uncalled for in my opinion. What was up with all the gay jokes in this movie. This movie is the typical 'cop' movie but it does not compete with 'Lethal weapon.' So, bad jokes and bad script. The action on the other hand was good. The whole scene on the highway was intense..u know the edge of ur seat kinda thing. So, if u like corny action go c it. If not well there's much better movies out.</fullReview>

At times, you were thinking that the movie was about to end, and suddenly, another situation occurs and another hour and a half goes by. Then, you were thinking that it had to be over, and, what do you know, another think occurs and the movie continues. Even when the credits appeared, there was still a little 3 minute continuation of the movie. To sum it up, the movie was average, but had terrible acting (what do you expect?), and was way to long.

		<fullReview>Hello movie fans out there! Bad Boys II IS the film to watch! Granted the story is a bit long and slow in some spots, the humor is fantastic and the action is top notch. Michael Bay, the director, brings you as close to the action as possible; rarely does he over-do the series of shots, but the non-action scenes tend to be visually bland. Overall he does an excellent job and most of you won't notice what I'm talking about.Well, there's not much I can say without spoiling the movie, so I'll say this: if you enjoyed the first Bad Boys movie, or you enjoy watching these actors, then go watch the movie. If you're looking for some action mixed with humor - yep, this is the movie.If you've watched any of Jerry Bruckheimer's films before, you won't mistake this one for anything else; the cast and crew worked real hard to make the film as fun and enjoyable as possible. A word of advice to parents, make sure your children viewing this film are 17 or older: strong drug content, somewhat graphic violence as well as brief nudity populate the film.For those of you who do decide to go watch it, make sure you order a jumbo popcorn to go along with that jumbo drink. Films like this justify the popcorn size and drink.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad Boys II is an action film like they used to make them. Today, it's mostly PG-13 consumer ready products with no balls. Bad Boys II is full of big explosions, vulgarity, and oddles of blood. But, that does not essentially make this a great movie.First off, I found Bad Boys II to a better comedy than action film. This is due mainly to the chemistry of the two main stars, who seem to have genuine chemistry together, unlike most recent buddy teams (I'm looking at you Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker). Most of their lines were improvised, so a lot of their own humor is evident in the movie. If you are someone who is critical of Will Smith or Martin Lawrence, you won't find the movie funny. I think they both can be funny, but they are not uproarious.It seems already that a lot of people are complaining about the violence in this movie. Seriously, THEY'VE DONE WORSE IN HOLLYWOOD BEFORE. Critics are scapegoating the film like it's "Caligula" or something. It's not that violent, it's not that disgusting. Get over it and we'll all be happier people. That said, I didn't find the action all that great, especially in this summer. Another car chase, yeah. Oh wait, you have shootouts as well? Genius! The action is recycled. Traditional action movies have worn thin on me. Bay tries to sparkle it up with his directing, and sometimes it actually works, but it's far from a saving grace. Action fans will get a kick out of it, but most others will just be tired.Based on the reference above, you may have guessed I'm not too critical on Michael Bay, whose generally held in comtempt by most (a pretty popular bandwagon most "film buffs" have jumped on to). Bay at least tries to do somethings a tad different. It's not much, and his style can be annoying at times, but this man is NOT the worst director in Hollywood.I felt the movie was enjoyable because Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are a good team. It they carry the movie through the rough spots (and at 2 1/2 hours, there's a lot of them). The action was alright, but it really started to feel like deja vu by the end of the film. Bay directing is far from great, but it's not terrible. A mediocre summer popcorn flick5.5/10**/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>mixed emotions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As one of the biggest fans of the original "Bad Boys", I have been eagerly awaiting this movie for a very long time.My expectations dropped somewhat in the days leading up to it's release, when I read early reviews of the movie, most of which described it as an overblown peice of movie making excess, concerned only with blowing things up and crammed with gore. So when I went into the theater on opening night, I did so with lowered expectations, and that might be a good thing. Because when I came out of it, I was left not feeling let down. And that rarely ever happens with me in the case of sequels to old favorites.There's lots of great things here, but it's the presence of those great moments that make you realize that it could be so much more.I have mixed emotions on this movie, mostly which result in comparisons relative to the classic original. But before I dive into cranking those thoughts out, I would like to officially state that this is, simply put, a good movie.When they are allowed to get going, Lawrence and Smith are absolutely hysterical, recapturing the magical chemistry they had 8 years ago. Lawrence is particuarly hilarious, playing the beleaugered sidekick to Smith's non-stop carnage parade. The duo's egually beleaugered Captain, played by Joe Pantoliano, is also hysterical this time around, drawing more laughs in less camera time.The movie is jam-packed with massive action sequences, as the producers cram as much as they can into the near 150 minute marathon. The action that is there is very impressive, but it is too much. Half of that time could be spent just eaves-dropping on conversations between Smith and Lawrence, and be far more entertaining. After all, it was the special dynamic of those two actors that made the original stand out above all other buddy-cop action-comedies. Big budget action is a dime a dozen at the multiplex these days, but the chemistry Smith and Lawrence have is truly special. Something that only comes along, oh, say once every 8 years.But you almost get the feeling that the filmmakers felt pressure to deliver a box office smash (an $150 million price tag will do that to you), and took the easy way out. They filled the movie with the action sequences, the gun fights, the special effects, the explosions, and all that good stuff that lands you at #1 when the weekend's grosses are counted.In reference to what many critics have been saying, this move is decidely more violent than the original, and almost seems to revel in it. Smith's carachter seems to take on a dark sinister tone in several combative sequences, as he effortlessly kills off bad guy after bad guy, in increasingly violent fashion without a trace of remorse. It's not pretty. And by the time the movie climaxes, with a near-war on forgein soil, the duo (Smith, especially) seem more like super-soldiers and unstoppable killing machines, than the average cops (well, maybe "super cops") we grew to love the first time around.But on the whole, this flick is a great ride. And though some moments in the film truly deserve an explanation from director Micheal Bay (such as a scene in which two rats are seen fornicating -- is this Austin Powers or Bad Boys?), I had a fun time and left the theater smiling.I hope there is a part 3, and if so, I hope it returns more to the tone of the first movie than this one. Sadly, that probably won't be the case. But that's why the first movie is a classic. It's so special because it rose to a level that most movies can't. Bad Boys 2 doesn't attain that level, but it's still a good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bad Boys are back. Bigger and badder than before!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three words to open my own missive on this sequal! OH! MY! GAWD!Back some 20 years ago Director John Landis set the tone for every cinematic car chase that followed, in his hugely popular Blue Brothers (1980). Folks, Take my word for it, Director Michael Bay has raised the bar for every Director that now follows him. This visually stimulating film is a virtual assault on the senses! I actually found my self rocking back in my seat, during the first Car Chase sequence over the Bridge.The Director's use of Matrix like film shots, his use of slow motion and his daring camera angles make this film worth the price of admission for the Action sequences alone! Note: Spoilers and a film mistake follow.Will Smith has hit a home run in this sequal. His sense of comedic timing mixed with a genuine ability to carry out the romantic lead, demonstrate the quality of acting honed over years, first in Music Videos then Sitcoms and finally, the Big Screen.Martin Lawrence is more than up to keeping pace with Smith. Portraying a Cop with a family and feeling the pangs of doubt, Lawrence has reestablished his self as a bankable actor. Any doubts should be removed when Lawrence's Character has to shoot the bad guy in the end, then transition to his more familiar comedic self.Look for actress Theresa Randle as the Uber supportive wife of Marcus Burnett (Lawrence's character)How can you not like Joe Pantoliano? His character portrayels are as rich as any working actor today! Who can forget his memorable role on the Sopranos? Taking on the role of Captain Howard, the viewer falls into a sense of comfort as Pantoliano portrays the head of Miami TNT (Tactical Narcotics Team). Not quite a street cop and not quite a politician, Pantoliano gives a more than convincing performance of a harried, beleagured cop trying to do what is right, back his street cops and at the same time answer to the politicians and desk jockeys that make departmental policy.Most surprising and even a little disappointing was the character, Sydney Burnett, Marcus's little sister and DEA Agent, brought to the screen by actress Gabrielle Union. Personally, I did not find this actress, in this roll, very believable. She did an OK job but there are actress's better suited for this role (Jada Pinket Smith comes to mind).The movie will grab you from the time Smith and Lawrence hit the screen, going under cover to a local Klan rally. I nearly fell out of my seat when Martin Lawrence, while holding a gun on several surprised Klansmen, says "...Oh Oh, it's the negros..." I admit, you will have to see the line delivered to appreciate how funny it really was. The story takes an almost predictable course. Notorious Cuban Ganster smuggles drugs, kills rival Russian gangsters, kidnaps sister of the hero et. al. It's been done, time and time again. The only stereo typical bad guy left out of this script was the middle eastern terrorist.I actually liked the car chase sequence with the rental car commandeered by the heros, better than the bridge chase sequence. It must have been a stunt drivers dream and at the same time a nightmare to get all the elements into place. This movies Just Destroys vehicles.The finale defies all logic but hey, it's just a movie. So in conclusion, if you enjoyed BB1 then go see this movie! It will be the topic of water cooler discussions come monday when the weekend box office is posted.An unexpectedly charming scene was when true Miami Icon, Future NFL Hall of Famer and now retired Miami Dolphin, Dan Marino makes a Cameo. Hey dont laugh! This is how Terry Bradshaw got his start in show business, doing cameos and bit parts. This is definatly not a movie for teens (15 and younger) or small children! If you have small kids, leave them at home! Strong language, Extreme violence and sexual situations make this a movie worthy of an NC-17 instead of the R it earned.Film mistake....During the Search of the Morgue, middle of the movie, Will Smith discovers a large supply of cash in a casket. Watch closely when the camera give's Smiths Point of View. On the upper right corner of the currency you can clearly see the phrase "FOR MOTION PICTURE USE ONLY!" A huge Shooting mistake and error on the part of the director and editor. Normally A suitable prop curency note will be used with these words covered over or an actual currency note placed upon a stack of prop money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BAD BOYS II is not good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first BAD BOYS was great. Simple, funny, and (most of all) fast-paced. BAD BOYS II, on the other hand, was confusing, had a few funny moments, and (most of all) l o n g. I got very bored from the story.Speaking of story, there was just too much. The whole therapy angle was silly. "Woo-sa" this! I bet no one's going to pay $8.50 to see Martin Lawrence and Will Smith deal with their emotional problems like a couple of babies.Dr. Dre did some music for the movie. This man, while a good rapper, shouldn't be allowed to work on movies. Especially if he's going to put the same redundant baseline in every chance he gets.Back in 1995, they didn't try to be cool with it. They just did it their own way and it came out great. Here, you get your standard deal of slow-motion shots, unnecessary explosions, and lotsa people shooting. But at what? Most bullets go through walls just for the sake of firing a gun.I feel the same way about this movie as I did on HULK and TOMB RAIDER. The filmmakers know how to film action but that doesn't mean anything if you throw in a whole bunch of nonsense as your story.After BAD BOYS II is over, you're going to say, "If it were shorter, it would've been better." You'd be right in saying that. Instead of seeing this pretty typical summer movie, go rent BAD BOYS. Better yet, buy the special edition DVD.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BEST SUMMER MOVIE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last night I was fortunate enough to get passes to see an advance screening of BB2. I was looking forward to seeing this for a long time. I was heavily hyped (not a good thing). Well was it worth it? You damn right it was! I couldn't believe the scope of the picture, it makes BB1 like a Fresh Prince/Martin episode. Minus salaries, it looked like dollar for dollar the budget was onscreen. It was a great adrenaline rush, I was tense, my arm was been twitching the fist half of the movie alone. I must have swallowed my tongue several times. About the running time, I didn't even think twice to check my watch. Not counting the quick plot set-up at the beginning, the movie catapults forward and never stops. The freeway chase smokes the Matrix Reloaded, gunfights galore, bullets in the head, blood flying, bodies being blown up and dismembered, dead bodies being smashed up, hot women in water-drenched clubs, endless cussing to make you blush, a Ferrari in gunfights at high-speeds, Jesus what else?!. Oh, a Hummer on a warpath through Cuba. From the title sequence alone I knew this was the one. What was a good break between the action was the comedic relief, I swear I almost fell out of my chair, it was hurting to laugh after a while. The cast was great. Will Smith was bad-ass along with Martin. I can't even remember all the action sequences. I really don't want to give away anything to the fans, picture this, its roller coaster ride that flies off the track and nosedives into the ground at mach 3. The finale outdates the Rock easily. This is the perfect summer movie, with a R-rating proving these movies still can be made if done properly. I'd give it a 9.5/10. Why knock down a notch? Well, I was disappointed that the Mark Mancina Bad Boys theme wasn't even present. Don't get me wrong Dre and Trevor Rabin (which I love) was good, reminiscent of Black Hawk Down, but no real theme music. Oh well. Can't have everything I guess. For the action fans, Bad Boy fans, Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay fans and people who want a good summer popcorn movie, here it is. People who want to see this fail or have nothing better to than bitch and complain about this type of film making, stay home and catch rerun of Frasier because if you see this you'll never admit the truth about this movie. Guaranteed I'll be back in line to see this on 07.18.03</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have you seen the first one?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently not many people have. 'Bad Boys II' is one of those rare films which seems to have totally eclipsed the original. Most people seem to have seen the second part without seeing what came before. Therefore, if you're wondering what Part II is like, you really should start by watching the first one. It's basically the same, or at least the same tone. If you like Part I then you'll definitely like Part II.Martin Lawrence and Will Smith play two Miami cops who 'do things their own way.' Yeah, nothing new there. In fact, there's nothing much new about the whole 'Bad Boys' package... and yet it's still soooo much fun. Okay, so you may have to suspend your disbelief slightly ? a lot of what happens is probably a little more exaggerated than it would be in real life. However, it's not supposed to realistic ? it's just a great film to watch and enjoy.It's about a drugs kingpin who...well, does what evil drugs kingpins do. And Will and Lawrence have to bring him to account. You really don't need to know much about the plot. It has fantastic car chases, wicked shoot-outs and Martin and Will play off each other perfectly. Again, the fact they tend to argue their way through gunfire is just one of many telltale signs that this film isn't supposed to be 'hyper-realistic,' but, what the hell, it makes a good film.Don't let the fact that it was directed by Michael Bay put you off. It was done waaaay before the travesty that is the Transformers franchise. Just put your brain to one side and enjoy the craziness and general banter between Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. If you want 'realism' in police drama, watch a reality TV cops show. If you want overblown shoot-outs, car chases and beautiful scenery ? you know where to come!</fullReview>

The action was amazing, the cinematography and different locations were amazing, the chase sequences was one of the best chase sequences ever made in television. If you said something dumb like, "they don't value human life," they have shootings and violence in other movies as well, this is just pure entertainment. Nothing personal, it is there to entertain the audience. I had a blast watching this film. I watched it literally 11 times maybe more.If you don't like it, don't watch it. There are so many dumb people in this world including critics, this isn't an intelligent thriller or anything, just one of those pure high octane Michael Bay flicks which you just watch to get a laugh out of and enjoy.

It clear Mr. Bay is in it for the money. I mean he must think that two punk cops calling a young boy the N word before he goes out on his first date then Intimidate him without mercy is funny. Its not funny.Nothing but action coming from all sides....crashing cars and naked dead bodies are suppose to be funny? I don't think so. Hey Mr. Bay have you ever seen the French Connection?

		<shortDescription>And this time... it's *personal*!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films where you simply need to know what to expect. I would guess that a large portion of the people who didn't care for it simply expected more(one would wonder why, what with the first film being... well, what it was, which was hardly Shakespeare) from it, or something different than what they got. This is "dumb" entertainment, nothing more. There's little of actual substance... there are clichés and there's filler. Added to what the original had of, well, unoriginality, we have the "personal" motive(as I allude to in my summary), the utterly despicable villains(the main one being Mexican, looking like he's never heard of showering or the magic of shaving, and probably smelling bad, too) and more. The characters are decently written. The acting is fair. It was nice to see Pantoliano back in the role as the captain. Smith and Lawrence do their thing, much like in the first, and seem to have fun. The cinematography varies, with some shaky-cam in the action scenes, to reasonable effect. The action is quite good... the shootouts are plentiful and cool. The car-chase scene does, in my opinion, not measure up to the one of The Matrix Reloaded, but they had to try, and I'd say they did rather a lot better than Terminator 3. This is a pretty good way to spend two hours... too bad that it's half an hour longer than that. Yes, by that I do mean that it's slightly overlong. In closing... this is pretty run-of-the-mill stuff, but it's good action and fine entertainment. There are a bunch of scenes that are somewhat offensive and unpleasant, and the language is by no means something they held back on. Anyone who are offended by such things should consider skipping this. I recommend this to any fan of the original, Michael Bay, the actors or the genre. Fine for what it is. 7/10</fullReview>

To much of my surprise, Bad Boys II follows the same action cliques. The only difference is that the makers of this film made is that they changed some of the cliques around and added some twists to it, however they are all not that interesting. Another negative point of Bad Boys II is that it's 2 hours and 27 minutes long. This is one of the many, many, many incidents where the movie studio should have stepped in and cut the film. One second thought, the movie studio should have read the script one more time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be perfectly honest i can't quite remember what possessed me to watch this film in the first place especially since Bad boys 1 had been undeniably poor entertainment, yet i assume the answer had something to do with Will Smith whom has rarely disappointed in the past. However after about 20 minutes of this abysmal sequel it became quite obvious that it would need a standout performance from him and every other cast member to draw attention away from the painful weak script and at times completely incoherent dialogue. The visuals also failed to impress as the pointless action scenes and car chases droned on for hours after the plot had long been lost. Ultimately this is proof that stuffing long, loud and unoriginal action sequences into about 3 hours will only impress some weak minded small children, boring the ass off anybody who actually wants to see a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Pointless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Bad Boys film, was a breath of fresh air into two genres. Firstly the overly populated genre of the 80's and 90's action film fests, with gratuitous violence and layers of ladened expletives (i'm not condemning that, I quite like it e.g Predator et al), and secondly into the cop-buddy film genre, sparked off by the brilliant Lethal Weapon. The first Bad Boys talk the great elements from both and created a film that was intriguing, well designed, funny and above all a good romp.Bay Boys II fails on ALL accounts, bar, possibly, the "funny" aspect. The second installment has lost the rugged "streetness", if you will, the first one possessed and in turn gone for big budget special effects and car chases, which make me feel that when this script was being written the words, Kick Arse Car Chase, or something of that ilk was grafted above specific scenes. The acting is pretty poor. Martin Lawrence has his little moment in the spotlight where he tries to convey the severity of the situation, towards the end of the film, "The S**t just got real"-speech, and really it is truly awful. Thankfully this is redeemed not but two minutes later by Will Smiths more subtle and tastefully done "we ride together, we die together".The premise of the script is quite basic. It is your standard "going out with his sister, not letting him know" type, and predictable throughout. While predictability is not necessarily an issue, it does detract from further events.Believe me, I know there are a lot of pre pubescents, and people with decidedly low IQs who have posted positive reviews about the marvels this film gives us, but frankly there isn't. I watch this film and think, hmm well it is "pretty cool" in terms of violence and car chasing (as I indeed love that), but with some many films doing the same old thing this really wasn't the breath of fresh air everyone expected it to be. It was no Bad Boys. Too much action is great, but when it's mere action for the sake of action, it becomes very old, very fast. The rotational gun fight, whilst interesting and well done, screamed of a Matrix ripoff.This film can be summed up by the HIDEOUS!!!! acting by Lawrence and Smiths female costar, at the end of this film, where she has her little moment to save the day. I shan't spoil it by saying what she says, but whenever she says it I expect it to be followed by an evil maniacal laugh. You'll see what i mean!</fullReview>

The title is well-fit for the action/comedy. i enjoyed it. I thought the film would not be good at all, but it was. there are some things I have against that film. one is that there is tooooooo much swearing. i counted almost 400 curses in that film! 250 of those curses are from the two stars Will and Martin. Another thing is some of the graphic violence, I mean, one guy gets shot through the head and his body lands on land mines, shredding his body to pieces, and another part, a man getting cut into pieces from saws. A bit nasty. However, I enjoyed the one-liner lines, the racial/crude humor, (I don't like racial, but it was a joke with Will and Martin), the intense action sequences including the car chase on the interstate, and the finale at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was disappointed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard both good and bad things about this movie, when I finally rented it, hoping that Will Smith and Martin Lawrence could at least crack a few jokes for me to laugh at. Boy was I disappointed.This movie is, of course, an action comedy. Well, here's the problem... Mostly the action is totally uninteresting or confusing, and the humour is pretty much non-stop. Too bad about every joke fall flat. This movies dialouge consists of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence running around and cracking one-liners at each other at a startling rate. Amusing? Not the least. The most used word in this movie has got to be "shoot". "Shoot her, shoot him, shoot them, he shot himself, they are shooting at us!" etc. etc. They say shoot all the time, and that pretty much also sums up the movie.When Will Smith and Martin Lawrence aren't walking about cracking one-liners they are shooting. Shooting at jamaicans, shooting at russians, shooting at cubans, shooting at pretty much everyone. And they aren't really rolemodel policemen either. "Hey, he's got a gun. Let's shoot him.". Wow. How amusing.As I stated before, the action is mostly uninteresting and confusing. But sometimes, it lightens up. During one of the many car chases there comes a moment where a terrorist is hanging on a car door, and it opens up and smashes against a pillar. This was a nice moment, even if it was just effect. Some other nice moments happen during the jamaican shootout.So pretty much, to sum this movie up its: Pointless and boring dialogue with one or two jokes that are funny plus heaps of mindless, uninteresting and confusing action, along with a few nice action moments.I'd rate it a 4/10. There's definetly alot better of stuff to rent out there, and I wouldn't really want to recommend this to anyone, unless they are a DIE hard fan of both Will Smith and Martin Lawrence.Oh, and if you thought that there wouldn't be any bullet-time effects in this movie, you're wrong...</fullReview>

The dialogue was mindless and absolutely atrocious. It's one thing to toss in some swearing for emotional effect, but the amount of cursing in this movie was ridiculous (if this gets aired on network TV, they'll have to make it a silent movie). Each scene just seemed to be nothing more than a competition between Lawrence and Smith to see who could yell and cuss the loudest. The villain was a joke and his accent was so bad that his dialogue was nearly unintelligible. He sounded like he just had an injection of novocaine in his tongue.

		<fullReview>I was quite looking forward to this as I quite enjoyed Bad Boys.It started with some wild action and wise-cracking from the cheeky duo, but as the film moved on I started to feel more and more uncomfortable.First of all, repetition set in early. How many shootouts, car chases, and arguments between Smith and Lawrence do you need in a film? How many different ways are there to eviscerate someone? And the plot? The plot is this: Smith and Lawrence bust a drugs gang........again.There is much jollity from Smith and Lawrence amidst total carnage. And this is my biggest problem with it. If it was just a bad movie, my comments would have ended in the last paragraph. This is a very very nasty film. Bodies explode, people are shredded by gunfire, limbs sawn off, and heads are sliced off and our two heroes wise-crack their way through all the devastation. Not just wise-crack, but laugh about it. Oh, but it's good fun to wave a gun in a humorous way in the face of a teenage boy whose only crime is to fancy your daughter. And let's have a bit of fun with some dead bodies shall we? The scene that really did it for me though, is when Lawrence is hiding in the mortuary under a sheet with a naked dead girl. I sat in the cinema feeling very uncomfortable. True, this is a "comedy thriller", but why such cheapness with human life and sickening use of women? Strangely enough, the film gets serious when Lawrence's sister or daughter(I can't remember which) is kidnapped. The wise-cracking stops and the audience is invited to share Lawrence's pain. I didn't. I wanted her to die so that Lawrence's character learned the value of human life. But, she is rescued and the moment she is safe, it's back to comedic carnage. This was rated 15 for the audience in the UK and I just worry about those young minds watching this. It should have been an 18 certificate (or R-rated in the USA). Better still, it shouldn't have been made at all.I could forgive it for just being a bad movie, but this is sadism and cruelty dressed up as coolness for the 21st century.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to explain just how awful this movie is: Silly, slow-moving, boring plot; leaden dialogue; lack of personal chemistry among the characters; feeble and failed attempts at humor; and longer than eternity. The light repartee between Smith and Lawrence that made the original such fun has been replaced with something resembling the carping of an old married couple. Smith does his best with the material handed him and still has occasional flashes of charm, but Lawrence has sunk entirely into the persona of a spinster aunt. This is not just a movie where you have to suspend disbelief; you have to disconnect your mind entirely. The people behind me were engaged in a long conversation for entire the second half of the movie--something that always annoys me terribly, but in this case I didn't complain because I really couldn't blame them--and their conversation was more interesting than the movie anyway. All the mayhem and blood and crashing vehicles and spectacular special effects--which I generally enjoy--could not save this movie from sliding into a sinkhole of triviality and ennui.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Final Score: 3.2 (out of 10)I've been holding out hope and standing up for director Michael Bay since 'The Rock', but with 'Bad Boys II', Bay, superproducer Jerry Bruckheimer and, what the hell let's throw Smith and Lawrence in there too, finally go over the edge. The movie is essentially one big, long - very long at 2 1/2 bloated hours - barrage of episodic set pieces strung loosely together by the thinnest of common plotlines. The refreshing idea here, at least in its concept, is the casting of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. Not only are they both black, which goes against the color-coded template of mis-matched cop movies, but they are typically comedic actors. Seeing these two trading wisecracks and getting down to business to bust street scum was what was so intriguing and fun about the first Bad Boys.In Bad Boys II, Smith and Lawrence's characters seem to have been stripped down at the same time the plot was blown up to a ridiculously bloated proportion. As Miami cops, they relationship mostly consists of constant feuding, their dialogue little more then yelling about how crazy the other one is. They are constantly reveling in their own antics over how much destruction they will/did cause. Bay chops up the action scenes with that music video style of his (Michael Bay is the director that McG wants to be) making them into frenzied, unexciting, undecipherable close-ups of faces and tires, probably to compensate for the fact that he drags the scenes beyond the attention span of his target audience (and people complained about the chase in The Matrix Reloaded). No chase scene in this movie is a fraction as fun and exciting as the one in 'Terminator 3' or a few weeks ago. All of this would be well and good if the movie were any fun. But it just isn't. Bay pounds any potential fun or excitement out of it - and keeps just keeps pounding. And this is normally the type of movie that is right up my ally.But as overkilled as the endless chases and shootouts are they aren't nearly as lame as the comedy. Tacky and long, bits feature our heroes being caught on tape in a conversation filled with homosexual double entendres and Lawrence accidentally ingesting some of the drugs where typical goofball hilarity supposedly ensues. We've seen this stuff all before. But the genera hits an all time low when our heroes head to a funeral home to rummage around in cadavers for smuggled drugs. Again they revel in their creepy antics while we get lingering shots of livers and open brains. Before that, Bay drops the bodies out the back of a truck during a chase and one of their heads' pop off like a Ken doll - and he does if as if he's staging a joke. I like dark comedy, as this tries to be, but good dark comedy is applied with a fine touch - not Bay and Bruckheimer beating us over the head with their sledgehammer style. They also squeezes in the now tired Bruckheimer target of New Age therapy by having Lawrence chanting and psycho-babbling on to relieve stress. The target is lame and stationary and it is done all the time in movies like this.I liked the movie when it started. I liked the opening scene of Smith and Lawrence caught in a standoff at a Klan rally. That's a post-modern view Bay and his writers have that they can utilize the KKK as villains, almost generic villains, in a goofball action/comedy (even one as dark as this). I like the fact that the villains in this movie, again only in the basic concept level, are real world evils like Klansmen and Columbian drug dealers - as opposed to phony movie villains. I personally like the idea of Klansmen being used as goofball stock movie villains, instead of being depicted as a powerful, foreboding force to be feared as in other movies. Another nice little post-modern idea of the movie is it's targets of ridicule. Instead of cracking jokes on the `single and lonely' people it shows the player, Will Smith, as more of the hero and the married with children family man, Lawrence, as the butt of the jokes. It brutally makes fun of a kid going on his first date - another typical sacred cow for movies. In this one example it's Roger Ebert, who spent much of his review calling the scene cruel, who is the one a step behind Bay. It exemplifies the generation gap of this type of comedy.While I'm on the plus side, I will say that in all the sound and fury Bay does get off a few good individual shots. The spin-move around the fireplace (see in the commercial) is the coolest visual scene in the movie - and even that is just Bay emulating David Fincher. The 3rd act - which seems like an entirely separate movie - is the best of the long action vignettes and I like the way the master villain (the only connecting element in the plot) finally checks out. Now that is good gore. The music from Dr. Dre and composer Trevor Rabin (Deep Blue Sea) is very effective. Easily the best part of the movie. It's in these all-to-brief moments when I thought the film might turn into something. However, during it's pummeling 3 hours I found all the tolerance and benefit-of-the-doubt I had for this thing evaporated with each passing scene. There is definitely a place for mindless action movies like this, but 'Bad Boys II' is an example of an utter failure. If Bay really wanted to have fun he would have given us a little more of gorgeous Gabrielle Union and a little less gore.</fullReview>

I was actually embarrassed to be sitting in the theater watching it, and was extremely conscious of the numerous children in the audience of this gore- packed, sexist, rated R movie - parents had brought offspring aged from about 2 months to 14 years, with almost every age group in between well-represented.

		<fullReview>never have i seen a movie this year as long and drawn out as bad boys 2. The jokes took 10 minutes to tell. The action was loud and messy, you could not tell what was going on. There were so many scenes that were just pointless. Rats having sex on screen? what? is this needed, how does this advance the story? The scene at the door with the girls date was just mean and unfunny and had nothing to do with the plot. This movie is just bad, sure i laughed at a few jokes and enjoyed the end and the firefight in the bad guys house. But overall i feel sorry for people that think rats having sex on screen or threating a minor with a gun is funny.</fullReview>

Oh yeah, and let's not forget to let the two tough guys throw in a little racial "humor" at every turn. This is Martin Lawrence and let's face it, does he really have any other material?

		<fullReview>My wife and I are big fans of the original and have anxiously awaited BBII. What a waste of time!! Sure there were a few laughs and sure there were lots of stunts, but seeing this movie made me realize that the producer/director/writer don't have a clue why the first movie was a success. Apparently, it was sheer dumb luck on their part.What little plot there is in BBII is absurd...invading Cuba???? Will Smith's character is the over the edge bad cop, so Martin Lawrence has to work for the laughs. There is a great deal of action, but it is very mean spirited and graphic to the point of nausea.The original was a success due to the humor, the bonding of the characters and some well timed action. This movis is a miserable follow-up with little true humor, characters that constantly harp at each other, and continual action with no real point.</fullReview>

I don't understand why the director underestimates me. I refuse to believe this movie. I have often said to my daughter that the most important thing is to believe. Terry Pratchet's Discworld is fictional, but I believe to every word of his books. This movie makes me a fool, a fool that loses his time watching nonsenses pretending to appear as a "police comedy". When you kill about a hundred man you have to make your choice - is this a farce or this is a hard police story. Keystone policemen are making the same, but nobody is dieing. Here we are watching the dead and acting like imbeciles. P.S. Sorry about my poor English.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first BAD BOYS was an okay comedy/action thriller, but there was nothing about it, including its profits, that demanded a sequel. Nonetheless.... This leaden mess is embarrassing; every gag is oversold, the two leads clearly regard themselves as brilliant performers; the story is slapdash and aimless; the action scenes wildly out of proportion. And yet it's so LONG. More than anything else, it resembles one of those "movies" made out of condensed serials. Just enough plot to get by on, with the real deal being all the gigantic action scenes. It's good that Smith and Lawrence really enjoyed themselves; somebody had to have something like a good time out of this waste of film and talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its a film with II in the title, this could be bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Think of films with "II" in the title and some horrors spring to mind. Bad Boys II is nothing like the original cop movie which the characters Marcus and Mike, played by Martin Lawrence and Will Smith, have a bad ass partnership in. This movie is as far from the original make up as it could be. It would have been better to of not called this film Bad Boys II as the viewer arrives with pre-conceived expectations from the original movie. I got the impression that perhaps Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson had lifted dare I say the car chase scenes from other movies. The highway smash up chase, seemed all too Luc Besson "Ronin" / "Taxi", and the attempted sealing of a small economy car "Die Hard".Personally I love good car chase scenes, and seeing as within 35 mins of the film run this happens for quite a chunk of the action - I would expect it to be the best. It was a disappointment - ask the question, why cant Mike's Ferrari out run a truck fully laden with a car transporter? (Mike's character doesn't come across from the original movie as somebody who would ditch a Porsche for one!) Why can the 4x4 just push its way out of the pile of cars? what happened to low ratio gear box and foot to the floor? OK its make believe but if you want your viewer to believe - make it real! As as for the dubbed "revving" sounds - please.....This movie, would be better is the timing was cut short by 30 minutes it too long and I found myself thinking, get to the end. In the UK this film is rated ages 15 and above, the movie does have its fair share of blood and cuts with scenes of chopped up bodys, headless torsos, and people being dismembered. A little strong for some younger viewers. Overall if you rented the movie, you just take it back. If you bought it, oh well, there's always ebay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad II</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to imagine that anyone out there could actually have been clamoring for a sequel to 1995's "Bad Boys." Yet, eight years later, along came "Bad Boys II" to remind us that even the least deserving film can get itself a follow-up, provided it has the right amount of high-powered corporate backing and big enough names in the cast to get the job done. As with most sequels, this one comes replete with a Roman numeral neatly tucked behind its title to give it that extra special touch of class. However, in this case, perhaps the II really stands for "twice as bad." This new film, which is indeed even longer, dopier and duller than the original, once again stars Will Smith and Martin Lawrence as two Miami P.D. undercover cops who spend most of their time kvetching at one another in between car chases and shootouts (and often during as well). As this is a Michael Bay film, rest assured that the gun battles and vehicular mayhem have been designed on so grand and epic a scale that we wonder that the entire city of Miami along with a good part of Cuba haven't been reduced to rubble by the time Smith and Lawrence are done doing their thing.The nominal plot involves the partners tracking down a Cuban drug kingpin (yawn) who is smuggling Xtasy to the states hidden inside gutted corpses. This allows for some truly vile humor at the expense of some innocent dead bodies ("Six Feet Under" this definitely is not). To complicate matters, Lawrence's beautiful kid sister is also working undercover for the NEA and the fretting Lawrence does everything he can to make her job all that much more difficult.The screenplay by Ron Shelton and Jerry Stahl encompasses every cop buddy cliché known to mankind. First, we have the hyper distraught captain who somehow fails to see the genius behind the boys' unconventional crime fighting methods. Then, in place of characterization, the boys engage in a running repartee of stale jokes and tiresome put downs that continues on even though all around them bullets are flying and bodies are piling up. Finally, there is the threatened sundering of the team over petty differences and the equally inevitable patching up of differences at the end. And the humor is so lowbrow that the film lacks even the saving grace of laughter to make it all bearable. Basically, this sequel is just another opportunity for Bay to beat his audience over the head with frenetic editing and mind numbing action."Bad Boys II" might have been more aptly named if they had simply dropped the word "Boys" out of the title altogether. It would at least have given audiences a more truthful and accurate description of the contents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inferior but enjoyable BB sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I agree with the "professional" critics on this one. It is not the same caliber as the first installment of this would-be franchise. The first was more along the lines of Lethal Weapon &amp; Tango and Cash. This one was a more serious action, rather than the comedy most of us expected. Not meeting the expectations of the fan base is solely why this movie was rated so badly. This is NOT a bad attempt, by any measure.The car chases were not obligatory car chases, they were well written and believably executed, rather than mindless crashes and explosions. The gun fights were not just the typical Saturday afternoon at the matinée fare, there was a reason behind it. The one liners were used less, and the meaningful dialog was used more.This film has been dogged for being racially prejudiced, homophobic, and just plain bad. I disagree. I found Betty White's lines in Bringing Down the House to be far more offensive than this. The porcine woman with the tremendous breasts telling Smith and Lawrence, "Y'all mofo's need to find Jesus!" is the typical kind of closed-minded bigoted harassment most gay men are subjected to by the Christian masses. Many times by their own families! That was nothing new. That does not in any way excuse that horrible behavior, but for the most part, the homosexual community at large does possess the ability to laugh at themselves, and those who are ignorant enough to say such things. So get over yourselves.The "bad guys" were all of other national origins than American. Is that racist? Not when most of the police officers were of origins other than American, as well. I suppose that was racist, too? You can't have it both ways.This attempt was fun, with quality action, a creative dialog, and a very entertaining fast-paced story which moved right along to a satisfying ending.It rates an 7.9/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfortunately, the Bad Boys theme loses a lot of its appeal when it is directed at a lot of poor people living in a shanty town on the side of a hill.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's an interesting scene in Bad Boys II near the end. Interesting, of course, in that the movie does something so unique and memorable in arguably its worst scene. As you sit through this overly long sequel to the smash 1995 hit, watch for a scene near the end where the movie itself and it's progressive quality can be seen personified in the manifestation of a bright yellow H2. Now, as you know, the original Hummer is probably the most badass off-road vehicle ever created by mankind, while the H2 is remodeled to appeal to soccer moms, emerging as the most inefficient minivan on earth. So your first reaction at this scene may be shock at seeing an H2 actually being taken off the pavement, but try to look past that. What this scene represents is the movie itself (as the H2) not necessarily falling off a cliff, but certainly zooming rapidly down a precipitous drop-off.The thing that I really appreciate about Bad Boys II is that it provides so many opportunities to use its scenes to illustrate its intentions and the mental state of its target audience. I recently saw Scary Movie 3 in theaters, which served to remind me what a glorious and successful decision it was not to see Bad Boys II in theaters. I learned in Scary Movie 3 the importance of considering a film's target audience before paying real money to surround yourself with a whole theater full of these people. The film starts off with a scene involving an extremely advanced siege of a drug smuggling ring who are importing massive quantities of Ecstasy into the US through Miami. As the elite team surrounds the perpetrators, afraid to move in too soon and spoil their bust, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence pop out of their KKK costumes to point a gun in each hand at the villains and break into song. As they sing the Bad Boys theme for the first of half a dozen groan-inducing times throughout the film, you realize the importance of this bust happening at a Klu Klux Klan meeting.Now, I realize that much of this film's target audience is black, which is perfectly fine, but this illustrates something of the opinion of director Michael Bay and producer Jerry Bruckheimer about these people. Obviously, the two don't think very highly of their clientele as they construct this scene to appeal to the hatred of whites generated so successfully and so completely by rap music. This is not a blanket statement about all rap, but as long as there is rap music in the world, there will also be hate. Clearly, the presence of massive quantities of drugs and drug money among these backwards rednecks is not enough, they have to be KKK members for their punishment (as their `capture' can really be described in no other way) to be fully satisfying to the audience. I'm only half white myself (hence my last name), but the KKK is one of the most embarrassing blemishes on the history of the white man (along with slavery, a seemingly relentless sense of self-entitlement, and Vanilla Ice), and I really see no reason to have them updated in a huge Hollywood blockbuster. Keep in mind that there really are still people backwards enough to believe in and be members of remnants of the KKK, just like there are people living today who are so detached from reality that they don't believe the Nazi Holocaust ever happened. They don't care how they're portrayed, this is all publicity for them.So the movie thankfully moves on from the KKK and, shockingly enough, MOSTLY from race jokes. In fact, there is something to be said of their ability to make a movie that featured Martin Lawrence without peppering it with endless race jokes. The makers of National Security were not so lucky. Not lucky at all. But if you boil down the plot and compare it to the lengthy, explosive action sequences and, more importantly, the length of the movie, it becomes clear that the movie was made for little other reason than to allow Michael Bay two and a half hours of opportunities to construct action scenes. However bad the movie was, Bay certainly knows how to make an action sequence.The movie is about a drug lord smuggling lethal Ecstasy into the country and two renegade cops trying to stop him. They have to break rules to do this, by the way, which is why they have to do it on their own. Luckily, many of the Hell's-Angels-turned-Miami-PD enlist themselves to help. There are some complications, like Marcus's (Lawrence) sister being involved in another plot to bring down the drug ring, the fact that machine guns are worthless for bad guys AND good guys, and the drug ring's interesting tactic of importing the drugs inside cadavers. Lots of gross-out possibilities there!There is, actually, one genuinely amusing scene in the morgue where Mike (Smith) is reaching around inside the cadavers searching for drugs and money while Marcus struggles to maintain his composure and keep his lunch down, but unfortunately most of the rest of the comic relief falls beneath the acceptable bad taste level. You have lots of dumb one-liners (many of which are talentlessly used during car chase scenes in true 2 Fast 2 Furious fashion) and other unique but equally just flat-out dumb scenes, like a scene where the movie halts in its tracks long enough for Marcus and Mike to forget that they are cops and act like wannabe gangsters when some poor teenager comes over nicely dressed to take Marcus's daughter on a date. They threaten him, search him, interrogate him, Mike even pulls a gun and waves it around like a complete idiot and asks him if he has ever or would like to have sex with a man. WOW.Roger Ebert claims that the movie employed no less than four writers. Another professional film critic claimed that there were no less than seven, the IMDb names five. Either way, none of them did anything. Consider this scene, consider the one-liners shouted during car chases, consider the fact that none of the massive amounts of damage inflicted on people and property matter, that it only becomes `real' when Marcus's sister is taken hostage. If this is what you have to be able to come up with to be a screenwriter in Hollywood, I've been wasting my time. I graduated from college three days ago, and watching this movie taught me that I only need maybe a seventh grade education to make it in screenwriting. This has resulted in a severe alteration of my career goals (not that screenwriting was ever very high on my priority list).Bad Boys II is big, loud, dumb, ugly, frenetic, arrogant, egotistical, misogynistic, racist, and preposterous. Joe Pantoliano has an interesting role as the police chief of Miami PD, massively stressed out by the constant and extensive damage regularly created by two of his officers, as well as the fact that he can't fire them, as any thinking police chief would, because then there would be no movie. There is a weak attempt to make Marcus three dimensional by having him participating in therapy to cope with the stress he deals with on the job (Mike is clearly less affected, as he simply has sex with his therapist), which results in nothing more than some allegedly funny scenes in which he starts pulling his earlobes and chanting. Yawn.There is absolutely nothing new or original in Bad Boys II. A lot of conventional scenes changed slightly to add the illusion of originality to a script that is a tired rehash of every action film to come out in the last 15 years, and unfortunately the only thing that's added is bad taste. The villain, for example, is a thinly disguised embodiment of some mixture of Al Pacino's Scarface and every single James Bond villain, and car chases add little more than a gross-out effect, arguably the weakest technique that exists in any kind of filmmaking. Things have been thrown at police during car chases for decades. Bad Boys II come up with the clever idea of throwing dead bodies during heavy traffic in downtown Miami, which are then run over and dismembered by the speeding cars in pursuit. Real clever there, guys. Dropping cars off of the speeding semi was pretty good, but this small gleaming morsel of cleverness is buried deep within a two and a half hour muddled mess of dismal distasteful trash.Sadly, the original Bad Boys has been followed up by a grinding sequel that has sunk so low that it seems to be trying to recreate the `success' of the piece of cinematic feces that is 2 Fast 2 Furious. The only thing that has been recreated, however, is that if all of the idiot dialogue like `Oh it's on now,' or `You want play like that?' or `I got something for you brawww,' or `Oh no you did NOT!,' and all of the unnecessary and pointless scenes were taken out, each film would be less than 15 minutes long. Bad Boys II, just like its mentor, is a massive failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Travesty in filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching Bad Boys 2, I had a discussion with a friend over whether or not that was indeed the worst action flick we had ever seen, putting it up against another baddie, Collateral Damage. We decided that at least Damage was short, because Bad Boys 2 ran on for a dreadful 2 hours and 45 minutes with the onslaught of commercials and previews we saw. How bad was Bad Boys 2? It inflicted physical pain upon me, making me hurt in no ways a movie has honestly made me hurt. It was just a huge cliche wrapped in innuendo sealed in really shiny film with terrible signature Bruckheimer slow mo and various other editing techniques. At certain points, we began to question whether or not after Pirates of the Carribean, Bruckheimer decided to throw caution to the wind and try to make a film as truly horrible as he could. How shoddy was this filmmaking? You can easily see that the money in the mortuary in which Martin Lawrence and Will Smith "sneak" into says "For Motion Picture use only." I went in with low, low expectations and I came out with a new feeling from a movie. Instead of feeling robbed of money, I felt robbed of time and I wanted my precious nearly 3 hours back. I gave this movie a 1 out of 10 in the voting only because I could not give it a 0.0 out of 10 for being the worst thing to ever happen to me</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought we were done with this type of junk after the Lethal Weapon movies but i see that Hollywood still thinks there's brain dead saps out there that will see this trash. Mindless fun is one thing. Mindless people are another. Lethal Weapon 2,3, and 4 were worthless so this isn't a black thing its a stupid movie thats aimed at young white kids that think they're black. At least in Lethal Weapon movies it was just plain dumb but now we have gay/white jokes, and N bombs at other blacks as being funny. Sad. You would think humans would have evolved by now but it looks like that will never happen. Its simpler to be dumb than creative. Its simpler to destroy than make something. Welcome to American. Welcome to the never ending MTV/BET mentality that will never grow up because they're too scared to be themselves. They're too scared to go to school in the wrong shoes/pants,etc... Pathetic! Movies like these filled that emptiness that instead confirms their stupidity and nurtures it. It becomes the norm and then the rest of us that are ourselves are the ones that are laughed at. Why for instance, do they edit cartoons now when i thought it was suppose to be the PARENTS responsibility? But its ok to watch and listen to explicit music/movies. LOL What a world.</fullReview>

He was much better in Big Momma's House and that was a disaster. Will Smith as his shoot first and ask questions later partner is equally redundant and...come to think of it, he hasn't had a decent performance since Men in Black...the original one.Joe Pantolino as Captain Howard the foil and brunt of too much Joe Pesche want to be slop and dribble is well cast as a moron that oversees a group of not funny psycotics, and there were a couple of slightly funny scenes during the at least nine hour mega torture...it least it seemed that long and was well over two and one half hours, that this...."thing" seemed to be.I think the Houston police should have put yellow tape around the theater to indicate this as a major crime scene. I mean to call this ...gargantuan glob of goo a film is a crime within itself!Every known racial slur and sterotype combined with dead bodies being strewn around with crude and out right vulgar abandon should have made this move ...ooop sorry about the slip...this "thing" rated "X" at least.I asked for my money back and was given two free passes to see...some "non-road show" at this AMC theater in the future. I gave them to two kids standing out side and told them to go see anything else.I wish I could give this thing a minus fifty but zero is as bad as I can go. It has now moved into my terrible movie list as the new king. it replaces such beauties as "The Family under the Stairs, Troop Beverly Hills, and the current leader in the club hose Caddie Shack Two, as the new worst ever movie.The king is dead...long live the king!</fullReview>

I mean that made the movie even more drawn out then it had to be. And Martin Lawrence is not funny, I mean how many times can the guy say f*** and still have it be funny.

		<fullReview>I haven't felt this much hostility while watching a movie in a long time. I think I actually wanted to HURT the filmmakers for subjecting me to this.First of all, I should say that I liked the original 1995 "Bad Boys". It was a big, dumb action movie, but it was funny, exciting, and had fun characters played by Will Smith, Martin Lawrence, and Tea Leoni (who is wisely MIA from this turd of a sequel). Now, 8 years later, for no other reason than to make a lot of money, the stars and director Michael Bay (who hasn't directed a single good movie since the original "Bad Boys") have conspired to unleash this atrocity on the public. I don't even know where to start. I went in with an open mind, but that ended with the first scene, with the awful KKK jokes and an extended "I shot my partner in the butt!" scene that was so funny I forgot to laugh.I can't say enough that this movie is excruciating. Not funny, not interesting, not exciting, and even offensive. I have no problem with gore, but a movie needs to find the right tone before expecting to get laughs from corpses tumbling from a morgue van and getting run over by cars, and in this movie it's just sickening. As if that wasn't enough, the movie is unnervingly homophobic at times, which is just depressing. One scene that actually comes close to being funny is ruined when it moves from being playfully homophobic to being outright offensive. It's also 2 1/2 hours long, which is just stupid. That makes even the action scenes boring (though I admit to a twinge of interest for a second or two during the big freeway chase). This a terrible, cruel, mean-spirited, stupid, revolting movie. If it were a person, it would be a big jerk who thinks it's sexy to pick fights in bars.Oh yeah, and there's also a scene with a sight gag of two rats having sex. Missionary style. Suddenly, I want to hurt the filmmakers again.</fullReview>

It's a film with no plot and about a million stunts that try and fail miserably to hold it together. Will Smith is bearable just, Martin Lawrence is extremely annoying. If he wants to quit so badly, why doesn't he just do it and spare us the misery of having to sit through so much truly awful film with overdone action trying to hold no plot at all together.All the money has clearly gone to stunts and effects in this film, nothing was spent on scripting.Avoid it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to start?I knew this film was going to be silly. That's what I liked about the first one. A Buddy-Buddy film like Lethal Weapon but younger and cooler.Bad Boys 2 though... is a stinking pile of s***e. Not just bad but awful. I didn't expect a plot but between the explosions, enough ammo to take care of the whole of Miami and the motherf***in' whining of the leads there wasn't a shred of plot. Not a bit. If the plot was a coat moths would [i]starve[/i] on it.This is not to say that it is just the plot that stinks, oh no I could cope with that, the effects were just pointless. They are no longer about the film but about effects crews trying to compete in some gore\explosion pissing competition. The Matrix Reloaded had car chase. People were impressed. So BB2 had to have a car chase. On this one has to be bigger. Will Smith is going to drive his Ferrari between cars that a being throw from the back of a transport. Why? Because they can. Because I'm supposed to be awed by this. Has anybody who works on these films ever seen a REAL car chase? I guess not.Hang on though, in this film ONE car chase is not enough. But this time what can we do to freshen it a little make it more exciting? I KNOW let's have them chase a van with corpses in it which then slide out of the back of said van and Will just runs over them! One comically has her head roll away! Oh my aching sides how good is that? Answer? It's not. It's tragic. Why bother having an exciting chase a la Ronin when you can just have wide open roads and throw obstacles in the way instead?What else? Ah yes, the gun fights! Ammo, loud bangs, Will and Martin roll around a bit and the only time when one of them gets hit is when it's 'funny' to do so. I realise that they are the stars but when things get ramped up this far then it goes beyond the point where you can suspend your belief and just becomes plain stupid.Three names that are in this film should have warned me. I didn't think I should have know. Don Simpson\Jerry Bruckheimer Productions and Michael Bay. *Shakes head* I just should have learnt by now. Don Simpson is dead and he's still getting credit for execrable s***e. Poor sod.Don't go to this film. If a Black Hole opened up in my garden tomorrow it wouldn't suck as much as this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like to see decent actors looking embarrassed and having your brain alternately numbed and grated for almost two and a half hours, then Bad Boys II could be for you. Otherwise, steer clear of this worthless and tediously overblown car crash of a sequel.Someone gave Michael Bay - who tragically suffers from some kind of movie-making ADD - enough money to destroy most of Miami, but didn't pay him enough to come up with any original ways to do it. And while the action is epileptic, the script ? which doesn't contain a single amusing or remotely clever line ? is catatonic. Absolutely nobody on-screen appears to have any enthusiasm for either the witless gibberish they've been given to spout or the been-done-a-thousand-times-before situations they find themselves in.Big budget, slick and obvious set-ups, terrible performances - this is just like a WWE production? but without the fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never liked the original "Bad Boys" from 1995 despite its reputation as one of the "better" cop-buddy movies out there. In my opinion it's all style over substance and director Michael Bay's annoying use of the sun-drenched, hard-hitting, always-moving camera distracts from the reality of the friendship between Smith and Lawrence's characters. The over-the-top action violence and stupid sex gags make the story seem unrealistic and the characters fake.The sequel isn't much better. It's eight years after the first film (can't believe it took so long for them to cash in on the original) and essentially exactly the same. Smith is still a fashionable playboy who's got it all together. Lawrence is still a neurotic wimp. Their boss (Joe Pantoliano) is still at their throats. The bad guys are still stereotypes, the women are still all beautiful and wearing as little as possible.Even the plot is very similar. They're on the trail of a drug smuggler yet AGAIN. This time the guy hides his drugs in dead bodies and their mission is to take him down and provide enough evidence to incriminate him - so they use a romantic interest to be a mole in the drug lord's operation.Bay's direction is just as bad as before - but now thanks to a much bigger budget, a larger cast and crew and the advent of advanced digital technology, the explosions are bigger, the car chases are longer and more boring, the camera moves even more and never stops zooming and cutting away to other scenes, and so on and so forth.The movie isn't really that funny either. It's just brutally violent for the sake of being so - it tries to add risqué humor and some "misunderstood events" to make the film funnier (such as Lawrence and Smith's conversation being displayed on all the TVs in the electronic store), but we've been there, done that already. It's not worth the time or money that was invested into it on both ends. Hopefully there won't be a "Bad Boys III."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad Boys II is one of those films you can watch with a bunch of friends and be thoroughly entertained, because you really don't have to pay much attention to the story because there really is none. This film works because Micahel Bay &amp; Jerry Bruikheimer know how to make fun movies. What makes this film great, is mainly the on screen chemistry of Will Smith &amp; Martin Lawrence, who are great together. Superb action sequences, especially the freeway scene (makes the Matrix Reloaded look like a puppy). With Smith &amp; Lawrence you can expect big laughs (especially the scene where they scare the crap out of a young teenager). Overall I highly recommend this film, not for kids or young teenagers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Along with SPECIES 2, this may be the closest Hollywood has ever come to the unbelievably perverse and over-the-top nature that Hong Kong cinema is sometimes known for. We have corpses being run over and their body parts scattering across the street, people being shot in the head and their blood and brain matter just *flying* behind them, people are smacked into concrete posts at 60 miles an hour *then* fall several stories to their death, dozens of cars get smashed up in high-speed freeway chases, buildings get blown up, cops have to dig into the guts of corpses for clues, and a drug shantytown on the side of a mountain gets torn up by several vehicles racing through in what is a blatant rip-off of a famous scene from Jackie's Chan's POLICE STORY - for starters.Now if you have a taste for sleaze and over-the-top action like I do, no doubt you will find all this stuff inevitably entertaining to a degree, and it will have you slack-jawed at times. However, though the movie has the "stuff" of these Hong Kong movies, it's not done with the same *finesse* - the movie is *way* overdirected and edited, making it harder to get a firm fix on whatever happens. It's also *way* too long, especially it's a really simple story that somehow took several screenwriters to crank out. Also, these two fellows got old fast - they are *so* loud, *so* foul-mouthed, and *so* angry-minded (and even downright cruel at times) that the movie is sometimes a chore to sit through, even though it's about them. Still, I'm giving this a cautionary recommendation - see it when it's cheap to rent and you are in the mind for something brainless - if only to see how berserk big-budget Hollywood filmmaking has become!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loud, graphic, action overload</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although director Michael Bay is dangerously close to becoming a caricature of himself, his showy, flashy direction somehow helps BAD BOYS II to be a good, if overlong, film. It's pretty much a clichéd action movie, with an age-old plot, yet revamped with outrageous flashy camera-work, non-stop cutting and editing, and a style of filming which is completely OTT in every respect. The bare-bones story sees cops Smith and Lawrence returning to battle a Cuban drug lord, and getting involved in plenty of shoot-outs and battles throughout. Smith and Lawrence fast-talk their way through a vulgar script peppered with hit-and-miss gags and acquaint themselves well with the action scenario. Said action is often spectacular, ranging from super-fire shoot-outs to an amazing car chase involving a car transporter ? excellent special effects make this one to watch.Some may be put off by the ghoulish streak of black comedy running throughout the movie, which peaks as the boys chase a morgue wagon across town, with bodies flying out of the back and disintegrating. For a 15 certificate, this movie has more than its fair share of blood, guts and mayhem, so most action lovers will find themselves at home here. On the downside, it is headache-inducing, what with all the incessant music, and it does outstay its welcome long before the end credits roll. But generally this is solid B-movie fare which just happens to have an AAA budget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film that is at once quite exhilarating and exasperating. As a fast-talking, wise-cracking buddy-cum-action thriller it's difficult to beat. A car chase/shootout that can be compared to The Matrix Reloaded + Heat (and is arguably shot and cut together better than either) is an asset, however it's shoehorned into the plot.Alas, we then have to suffer a witless sequence such as Marcus (Martin Lawrence) trying to put some poor teenager off dating his daughter (there's a whole Lethal Weapon-type family man subplot going on). Quite apart from a violent casting error in "Dennis Greene" as the effortlessly gormless teenager ambushed on the doorstep by Lawrence we also see Mike (Will Smith) waving a gun in the kid's face whilst retching up the sort of spiel he should be saving for the small proportion of bad guys he's not killing outright elsewhere in the film. It's not only a comedy - it's an adult comedy and often rather black-humoured - but it needn't be a lazy one as well.Still, the film's moments of music-video-style strobic-edited action makes a great vehicle for the two men at its centre. Gabrielle Union is 2-d but satisfactory, Bay simply shooting her as skirt - and in the panto parts baddie Jordi Moll? and cop boss Joe Pantoliano leave no undamaged corner of the set unchewed. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lesson Hollywood needs to learn.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lesson Hollywood needs to learn.Bad Boys 2 is just another gangsta cop movie that ultimately pales in comparison to buddy cop movies in general.Why this sequel was made in the first place is beyond me. It seems that the producers and writers of this piece of s*** ran out of ideas in terms of storyline and dialog which is full of many flaws.First is the language. Why do black cops need to swear in this type of film? Was it really necessary for Will Smith and Martin Lawrence to blurt out nonsensical profanity when high quality films like Rush Hour and Hollywood Homicide rarely require it? To all you moviegoers of various races, shapes and sizes, the answer is NOOOOOOOO!!!! If the producers decide on making a third sequel to this drivel, they should instead make it into the form of an animated movie rather than a live-action film. As it turns out, many movie critics have already called this film a cartoon because, unfortunately, for this particular film, it's exactly what it is. It truly pays homage for all those cartoons featuring big-lipped, loud-mouthed po po's who talk jive and act completely stupid, while black children who wake up every Saturday morning to watch them on television. Truly, they are sending a bad message to black American children.To all things considered, BB2 boasts a number of exciting action scenes. As I recall from the first film, the action scenes were exceptional. In this second installment, they are far more bloody and gory, especially the bullet time sequences early in the film when a Klan member gets popped in the jugular with impressive results. But as we all know, special effects only go so far. The action scenes, while exciting and entertaining, are exaggerated, unrealistic and just downright plain ludicrous. Since when did police officers get into situations like these? Bad Boys 2 fails on many aspects. The dialog is unremarkable, the jokes are lame yet some of them are quite funny and may leave a chuckle or two, but in the end they quickly dry out. The jokes feature so many stringed together four-letter words within dialog that it's hard and confusing to understand the plot. The characters are all racial stereotypes of past buddy cop movies whether good or bad, especially Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. Joe Pantoliano is poorly cast as the no-nonsense police chief who spews forth cheesy expletives from his cocked mouth. In short, they're not even funny, but rather annoyance. It seems that the screenwriters thought that by making the actors spew foul language that this would make the film more entertaining to watch. It doesn't. The amount of adult language in this film has been greatly used to no certain extent to sugar coat the mediocre plot. Unfortunately, this ruins what might have been a worthy successor to the past hit of the mid-1990's. A fine example on how to make a blaxpoitation film for the new millennium.Simply put, the average moviegoer has no idea that this abomination of a movie was put together by a sinister organization of white filmmakers and producers dedicated to creating stereotypical movies featuring swearing Afro American po po's to be viewed by the world. Oh the horror, the horror, the horror, AAAAAAGH!!!! The only reason I'm giving BB2 a three is for the car chases and some action scenes. Other than that the film is a toss-up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Action Movies Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Bad Boys 2 is one of the best action movies ever. I really like Michael Bay movies, he does really cool action movies, and i like his style. And of course Martin Laurence and Will Smith are good and have chemistry, just like in the original one, and they kind of act just like they did in the original one a little bit, which is good. Let me set it straight. The first Bad Boys movie is pretty much better at the comedy and humor and i guess the story too. And Bad Boys 2 is better at the action. Yes, Bad Boys 2 does have its funny moments, but it had so much action, there was not too much comedy, but as i said it did have some pretty funny moments. Bad Boys 2 did have quite a bit of seriousness to it, which i kind of liked, and it was a little serious during the action scenes, which kind of made the action scenes better. I like how Laurence and Smith blabber at each other during the action. The story in Bad Boys 2 isn't all that great, but its okay. It has a very simple storyline, they are trying to stop a drug kingpin, and all that stuff between Martin Laurences sister in the movie. I loved the action in the movie. I think it is one of the best action movies ever. Lots of stuff gets blown up real good, Michael Bay sure knows how the blow stuff up. I like all the shooting and explosions and shootouts. The first car chase in the movie is great, when they are chasing the Haitians and throwing cars off the car carrier, that was a long car chase, and there is a cool shootout in the middle of the car chase. Tree's, the ground, dirt, cars, Stepals, bushes, mansions, high rises, etc. all get shot up and blown up The movie is a big battleground. The action scenes are very epic and long, so its very detailed on things getting blown up and shot up. The movie is very violent, bloody, and gory. Like that scene at the end in the Mindfield. And there's a scene were dead bodies are being run over. The good old days, when action movies were rated R, and lots of explosions and stuff. And lots of bad words. And no cops get in the way with Martin Laurence and Will Smith which is cool, no getting in trouble, not letting cops get in the way of the cool destructive action. Just action, action, action I love the style of the action. Also, i really liked the music in the movie, especially during the action scenes. It made the actions scenes more intense and gets your blood pumping. And the ending action scene in Cuba at the end of the movie is very pleasing. Yes, the movie may be pretty mean spirited, and pointless and relentless, but it is awesome. Michael Bay is almost like John Woo. This movie is a fun, wild, crazy, loud, action packed ride. Its one of the most action packed movies ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Director Michael Bay who brought us Pearl Harbor and Armageddon, brings us another great action-adventure film filled with laughs and realistic action. Bad Boys 2 stars Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, and together they make this movie the best as it is giving us major laugh out loud laughs and fight scenes. To me, they are the best on team duo's in the history of cinema. The film starts off in a way that keeps you watching and watching until it's over making you want more. This film has 6 action scenes that are long and enjoyable which you can watch many times and still love it. If you liked the first one, but you wanted to see more about them and see them in more dangerous situations then this film is for you.But if you are not a Michael Bay fan, then just grab a few guy friends and maybe chick friends, get together on a Friday or Saturday night, grab snacks, kick off your shoes, grab a blanket, disconnect your phones, and be prepared for a movie that will keep you laughing and entertained the whole entire night.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this a sequel or a remake? 58%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For reasons I have never been able to fathom, I watched this at the cinema. I actually paid money to see this film and yet, despite thinking about how I reached the decision to watch it, I still cannot remember why. It's as if someone had clubbed me over the head, taken some money from my wallet and sent me on my way. Recapping today with the DVD, it's not any easier to think of the reasons because, bar the 9-11 references, this is essentially the same as the first film. Only, the magic isn't as strong this time around - despite the extended duration and top-shelf action sequences.Will Smith and Martin "Dear God, Save Us From..." Lawrence return as maverick Miami cops Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett, polar opposites who somehow blast, cuss and wise-crack their way through each and every case but not without causing mayhem on the streets of Miami and getting on each other's nerves. Regrettably, the pair are on the trail of exported Ectasy from Amsterdam but after the initial raid goes wrong, the heat gets really turned up as they struggle to locate the drugs. Thank God that Miami's resident Cuban baddie Johnny Tapia (Jordi Moll?) leaves a bloody trail for them to follow as they risk their own lives and a DEA investigation involving Marcus's sister Syd (Gabrielle Union).As I've already said, if you've seen "Bad Boys" then you have absolutely no reason to watch this unless you like your action films devoid of realism, heavily stylised and reliant on over-the-top stunt sequences and frankly hilarious gun-fu. Harsh perhaps but "Bad Boys 2" is not a complete bust. Lawrence and Smith are, against the odds perhaps, a great comic pairing and there are some crude laughs to be had, though not through great dialogue which is typically macho and swear-heavy. The action is this film's real trump card and it does deliver, with street battles more reminiscent of "Saving Private Ryan" and car chases which bear all the hallmarks of director Michael Bay and producer Jerry Bruckheimer (and boy, does he like watching expensive cars race). It's a young boys dream, which is basically how Bruckheimer works. But for those of us who want more from our action films than bullets flying through a Ferrari's window, there isn't much more to there to enjoy.Besides the two leads, acting is pretty patchy to be honest and the plot is stretched beyond breaking point, meaning that unless you have the patience of a priest you are unlikely to last the distance. If you are looking for some mindless, switch-your-brain-off action then this isn't so bad but whatever you do, don't confuse this with the first film which is no classic but still much better than this. It's far too long, much too silly and waaay too dull to be of any real interest and that's a shame because the action really hits the spot. It's like a more comic version of "The Transporter" and if that hit your spot then you'll enjoy it. But as with that film, don't watch this if you've seen the first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just watched this disk... it's been sitting on my TV a week, Netflix sent it. Wow.... it's bad. There is a lot of gratuitous violence- heads exploding from gunshots, etc. Lots of gore, dead bodies. Only one or two genuinely funny moments, like when they greet the daughter's boyfriend for the first time. I'm all for action movies and blowing c**p up, beating the c**p out of someone, etc, but this was too much. This movie's convoluted and utterly unbelievable plot had some drug kingpin's cover operation in a funeral home. Yaddayaddayadda- this leads to our bad boys chasing a van while the bad guys throw dead bodies out the back for all to run over. Horrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm usually quite forgiving when it comes to poor movies, but after this latest dross from the world's worst director, Michael "Throw a filter in there, it'll look so cool" Bay, I have had to plump for 2 stars. Never mind the objectionable humour and non-existent plot - is it healthy for a nation that suffers from one of the highest gun-murder rates in the world to be subbjected to a film that worships at the altar of Glock? The first Bad Boys was a vaguely enjoyable buddy movie that broke convention by starring two black cops instead of the traditional one black and one white. The sequel is just a mindless sequence of destruction, violence, and profanity that eventually just succeeds in offending the viewer. Bay is without a doubt the most inept director in Hollywood. After the pain of Armageddon and Pearl Harbour, how is it that he is allowed to continue to victimise us? Please stop. If I have to see one more over blown filter shot that belongs in a Ford Galaxy commercial, I'm going to hurl. Please. Amend the constitution. Stop Michael Bay before someone really dies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the original Bad Boys was a fairly good movie as far as Hollywood action comedies go. However in the past 8 years my expectation for movies has hightend a bit, obviously more then Michael Bay's ability to direct movies has. Bad Boys II is basically one long gun fight interrupted by some long car chases and a few weak scenes of dialog.As for the cast, well if you've seen Bad Boys I then you know the main characters. Will Smith isn't what you would call a great actor. However one has to respect the fact that he has been involved in a few good movies such as MIB. However in my opinion Bad Boys II is probably the worst of "all" the bad movies that he has appeared in. Martin Lawrence was as usual terrible to watch, by far one of Hollywood's weakest actors. The addition of Gabrielle Union was the only real good part of the cast. She's a nice little hottie, who is one of the few actors that deliver a decent performance in the movie.Usually I make mention of the sound track. To be honest I can't remember the sound track for this movie, so I doubt it was anything special. Which means it can't have been to bad or I think I might have remembered it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsThis year's most awaited,belated sequel finally hits our screens.I caught a preview of it today,and was desperately hoping it would match the quality of the unmissable original.I didn't hold the fact that it's come eight years after the original against it,as a belated sequel is not a sure sign of poor quality,and was happy to see the original's director Michael Bay was back at the helm.I was also happy to see the two original co stars back in the leads,though in the intervening eight years since the original came out,Will Smith's star has risen considerably,whilst Martin Lawrence has headbilled a plethora of mediocre,forgettable comedies,so why he remains first billed must only be for nostalgic value.This is a minor quibble,though (not even a quibble,really),so lets get onto the film instead.On the plus side,Lawrence and Smith have lost none of their thoroughly engaging rapport,which remains just as effective as last time.There are some brilliant,wildly over the top action sequences,as well as some riotously funny moments,meaning it works on both levels.Another bonus is the film's absorbing,mesmerizing visual feel,especially the overhead views of Miami beach and the skyline of the buildings,sweeping you even further into all the action and excitement going on.Now for the not so good stuff.We have a bland,lifeless villain,spared any engaging charisma or dialogue,who you will care nothing for.There is a meandering,slumberous storyline to contend with,which causes the action scenes,good as they are,to be too few and far between to have the full lasting impact that they could have had.And I seemed to be sitting in the cinema for ages as the plot dragged on and on.And it was only when I just checked on the IMDB that I found out that this thing goes on for no less than 147 minutes!Wha',excuse me?!?I somehow think the word overlong is also a criticism of the film.And then,there's the big anti climatic ending.The film builds you up and builds you up for it's arrival,and then,when it eventually comes,it just comes and leaves you out cold and ,to be honest,a little short changed.All in all,the movie emerges as a big something for nothing,an enjoyable enough ride while it lasts,but in the end,just not very much.I tried to enjoy it,WANTED to enjoy it as much as the original,but in the end,I just couldn't ignore how underwhelming it all was.An okay,if wavey and totally overlong,action movie,but certainly not a classic one.***</fullReview>

If this movie even gets a nomination for Best Sound Effects Editing, I am seriously going to start boycotting the Oscars. Why is it they are spending so much money on so much crap?!Jerry Bruckheimer tries up for the failure of Kangaroo Jack, and gloriously fails. All the action moments are obviously John Woo-inspired. None of them have the same mood that makes Woo's work superior, vastly superior. The editing is the usual flashy jackknife job that doesn't make anything worthwhile in the long run.The biggest problem is the script. There is neither message nor purpose in it, just an attempt to overdose on gunfights, outrageously dumb conversations (and you thought The Breakfast Club was bad), and more from our usual source of summer garbage...Jerry Bruckheimer.Overall, skip this movie. There are so many better action movies (such as The Killer and Die Hard) that you shouldn't have to rely on this junk. Is it still possible for Hollywood to make something with depth?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning - May contain spoilers.Watching this movie, I could have sworn I was watching a Lethal Weapon movie. You've got two cops who have been partners for a long time and act like a bickering married couple. One threatens to break the partnership while the two are chasing a bad guy. Bad guy makes it personal by kidnapping a loved one of one of the partners. The two partners chase after the bad guy and kill him to free the loved one. All the while, there is bad comedy but amazing stunts sprinkled throughout. Throw in an Italian-American actor named Joe (Pantoliano vs. Pesci) who has a whiny, annoying voice and the formula is complete.I was really looking forward to Bad Boys II, since I had always wondered why it had taken so long to make a sequel to the first one, which I really enjoyed. The banter between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence wasn't as good this time and the comedy was way too contrived - "woosa" and humping rats. Very disappointing. Is it too late to make a sequel of Running Scared with Billy Crystal?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right off the bat, I LOVED the first Bad Boys movie from 1995. It is still to this day one of my favorite buddy cop movies. It was so spontaneously quick-witted, fresh, funny, stylish, and cool! It is and will most probably the only Michael Bay movie that I will ever say that I actually liked! Now, in comes BAD BOYS II (2003), a full EIGHT years later, and, surprise, it, like most sequels...SUCKS! The main problem I had has already been stated. This sequel came out 8 years after the first one, which is way too long. If anything, a sequel should have been 2 to 3 years after the first one. One of the big reasons I realize now why the first Bad Boys worked so well was because, in terms of film experience, back in 95, both stars Martin Lawrence and Will Smith were movie novices and their comedy was fresh to the general movie-going world, Smith had still not attained superstar status (not even star status!), and Bay himself was new to the game, so they were all probably more willing to take advice and direction from more experienced hands as to what makes a movie work! But by 2003, Smith was a huge star and focusing on more dramatic roles, Bay had pretty much sold out that he was going to make nothing but loud, empty, emotionless action flicks (having done Armageddon and Pearl Harbor by this point), and Lawrence was doing whatever he was doing! Basically, this sequel was just a way for them to increase their financial profile, nothing else! Except for the fact that these 3 are involved, this sequel reminds me nothing of the first movie. Gone is the fresh and convincing, and charming buddy chemistry and natural dialogue between Smith and Lawrence from the first film; it's been replaced with stupid one-liners and disgusting jokes meant to elicit cheap laughs from the audience.Another noticeable negative of this movie is why is Gabrielle Union even in it? First off, it strains credibility that she and Lawrence are supposed to be siblings. Also, I thought is was so contrived that Marcus' sister just HAPPENS to be a DEA agent working on the same case as Marcus and Mike. It's like soap opera plot points for cripe's sake! Plus, I saw no chemistry between Union and Smith. I much preferred the simmering, building sexual tension between Smith and Tea Leoni (who was surprisingly engaging and a perfect fit as the female protagonist) from the first movie. I would have rather seen Leoni back as Mike's girlfriend, or dare I say it, wife! But, I guess even in the TWENTY-FIRST century, it's still unacceptable to have an interracial couple at the forefront of a film, unless it's some indie, Oscar-begging crap! Then they inexplicably replaced the the 2 supporting cop foils from the first movie (Sanchez and Ruiz, who were well-performed by those actors) with 2 noticeably younger, more obnoxious, and less funny pranksters in this one, which I guess was supposed to be meant as some kind of parody of the first 2 guys...it didn't work! The big drug dealer in this movie is literally a comical cliché of Bad Action Movie 101: overly abusive and always cursing at his lackeys, then turns into a sweetie with his kids and has some kind of phobia (he's afraid of rodents!). Not to mention that Bay plays up his nationality (Cuban) making him into a Castro-wannabe. The main bad guy from the first movie was legitimately scary and worldly and worthy of being an action-movie villain; I mean, the bad guy from the first movie really involved the viewer in the story as much as the heroes, but not this one.And, finally, the action...there's too much of it! I know it's an ACTION movie, but c'mon! Even in an action movie, it has to have other things going for it to work. Yeah, of course with Smith and Lawrence, there is comedy, but the comedy was used here almost separate from the action and plot, just to elicit laughs in between the action. All the comedy in the first movie literally flowed along with it and was A PART OF the action.Michael Bay is well on his way to being one of the worst "film" makers of all time, but at least Bay can hang his hat on the first Bad Boys movie, which is good. But definitely NOT this sequel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Bad Boys II" is a late sequel to Michael Bay's successful enjoyable debut movie "Bad Boys" from 1995. Hey, but better late than never! Although "Bad Boys II" is not as good as the first, it still is a very enjoyable, entertaining popcorn flick with some spectacular action and two great main characters who have some fine chemistry together.This movie is typical Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer stuff, meaning that it's big, loud and just totally over-the-top in its action. Despite what many other people seem to think, I think that Michael Bay is a wonderful director. He knows how to create a big-budget action movie and he does it always with style and lots of sense for entertainment. Plus, his movies have what many other present action movies these days don't have; some good and respected actors in it. So to me it seems, that those who show hate toward Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer movies, don't even like action movies in the first place. "Bad Boys II" is no different from any other Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer production and is entertaining and over-the-top, made with an obvious big budget and some wonderful actors in it.However the plot and story for this movie are just totally ridicules. However in this case the movie really is secondary. Primary element of the movie are the two main characters Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowrey, played by Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. They both are highly entertaining character, who show some great duo-chemistry on screen. The characters really carry the movie and are the main reason why this movie is so entertaining to watch. It was also great to see Joe Pantoliano reprising his role as police Captain and Peter Stormare is always enjoyable to watch.There are some truly hilarious scene's in the movie but overall it has a bit too serious undertone at times. "Bad Boys" was certainly a movie that was more consistent in its entertainment and humor than this sequel. This is basically the only reason why I don't rate "Bad Boys II" as highly as I do "Bad Boys".The big budget for this movie is well spend and there are truly some spectacular action sequences that are just completely over-the-top but are wonderful to watch for that very same reason. The action is well filmed and original from mainly a movie-technical point of view.Appreciate the movie for what it is; pure entertainment...and this movie is a very entertaining action-flick alright!7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The oppressive cynicism definitely makes it one bad boy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You could perhaps make collectible trading cards out of the unnecessary, overly-long sequences that exist in Bad Boys II. Is it possible that a mildly pretentious, ridiculous, dim-witted film could get a sequel that is even more pretentious, ridiculous, and dim-witted? When you have a film with Michael Bay's name firmly stamped on the cover, one thing is for certain; there will be booms and a lot of them.This is a tiresome sequel, that becomes long and winded after the first half hour because of its oppressive consumption of self-importance from very early on. This is a film that looks cocky and has nothing to hide. There is a scene in the very beginning of the film where Martin Lawrence gets shot on the cheek of his buttocks and we have to listen to a riveting commentary on how the bullet didn't enter the hole but the cheek and how uncomfortable it will be to sit and how stressful it will be for him to go on. Have mercy.It's scenes like that that make the movie plod along at snail's pace. About halfway through this excursion I came to the consensus that the film was utterly listless, and had absolutely no ambition to be good, entertaining, or anything outside of the cloying genre of a "popcorn flick." I sometimes like a good camp movie, but I despise when films use the excuse "it's an action movie, take it for what it is" or the long over-stayed "just turn your brain off." When you truly think about it, why would a movie want to proclaim itself as a "turn your brain off" type piece? Were the writers lazy or was the whole project lacking any form of motivation and ambition. Or was the easy route taken? I'm not sure, but for whatever reason, the film seems to be inherently inept.Again, the story is made complicated by a long run time, numerous dead-on-arrival conversations between criminals, tedious shootouts, astoundingly incoherent car chases, and the constant bickering between two men we are led to believe have been close friends for many years. Detectives Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Smith) return to track down and abolish the smuggling of ecstasy through many underground routes in Florida. You may ask yourself, why does that task take 147 minutes? Because every five, the film is punctuated with either a redundant scream-fest between the detectives or an unacceptable shootout that always results in the same turnout, making it robbed of credible suspense.Bad Boys II wouldn't be so intolerable and unwatchable if it had just improved on three things; one, lee pretentiousness in the direction and the production. Everything looks too production-heavy, incredibly overbearing, and ridiculously glossy as if it was given a paint job by Hollywood. Two, the film's cynical mean-spirit that is carried throughout the entire picture. Multiple scenes have this built up aggression that goes nowhere except right down the drain of despair. And finally, the removal of needless sequences like the one at an electronic store, the one about being shot in places unknown, and the countless number of relentless car chases. This is one of the worst action movies I've seen in a while that didn't involve metal, soulless robot monstrosities.Starring: Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. Directed by: Michael Bay.</fullReview>

Meanwhile, things get a little heated between Mike and Syd, Marcus's sister, which causes a little hostility between the two, and lots of explosions......When this film first came out eleven years ago I thought it was wonderful, loud, and very exciting. But back then, I was 26, and in the demographic for Bay's type of movie.Seeing it again now, it still has some great elements to it, the car chase with the boat explosion is still a thrilling piece of cinema, and the scenes with Marcus under the influence of Ecstasy, and the scene with Mikes daughter's date are still laugh out loud, but there are so many flaws to the movie.Firstly, its way, way too long, by a good forty five minutes, and no matter how many flashy edits, or speeding cars you have, there is a lot of pointless drivel in this movie, and most of it is sexist, and xenophobic humour, that you get in his films now.Still, Smith and Lawrence are great together, and they are clearly enjoying themselves.But just way too long and sexist.</fullReview>

So, one of the movies has been Bad Boys II.For the reasons i don't want to go into here, i was stuck in a room with a TV set and saw both of those movie. Actually, i've treated the TV set as a moving picture hanging on the wall and devoted my time to more useful things.Bad Boys II starts with police busting a KKK gathering where Will Smith has the honor of personally knocking out a couple of participants. This might have been supposed to be a political message, i assume. And it all goes downhill after that. If you're into action movies, this is the one for you.Apart from the special effects, there is a small detail about Bad Boys II that was good.

They're assigned to investigate the flow of drugs, and run smack into Syd who's gone undercover.Director Michael Bay is unapologetic in creating a big bombastic popcorn movie. It opens with the heroes taking down the KKK. And if you think he can't get any louder, he throws you into a car chase to end all chases. I must admit it is crazy fun. The one thing Michael Bay knows how to do is blow things up. But it does get tiring. It's loud, annoying, and doesn't let up. It's a brutal way to spend 2 and 1/2 hours. But I do recommend the car chase to everybody. It's definitely worth repeat viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expensively, excessively tasteless sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got to see it for free. Hmmmm. Two genuinely funny moments in this sequel that we really didn't need. Its interesting that movies like this lift plot points from much better films and blow up the action to larger than human scale. I noticed rip offs of Hitchcock, Peckinpah, Di Palma and Mack Sennett. Martin Lawrence is not improving as an actor. Will Smith sort of coasts thru the whole thing knowing he probably doesn't have to do this anymore. When you see up and coming actors struggling against odds to make some logical sense of this you see some heroism in cinema. Gabrielle Union is very impressive and every time she appears you know she is working very hard to make this a better(or at least more credible) movie and her scenes with Jordi Molla have some grace and intelligence which probably goes over the head of the target audience for this film. When John Salley can act you off the screen its time to get back to acting class. Theresa Randle and Joe Pantoliano...just wasted. What the heck was Peter Stormare thinking!!?!? Marg Helgenberger made the right move and said no to this project(paycheck aside). Great stunt choreography(naturally), editing that makes sure we get all the viscera just before the punchline. The thing that really bothers me about the series is the redneck sensibility underneath all the pseudo-up-to-the minute black tough guy street vernacular. Insulting to one's intelligence doesn't quite get at what the "film" does to me. Again, there were two very funny bits but that isn't enough for a 147 minute experience like this. I fully expect a BAD BOYS III. I'd like them to do something radical and have a black villain this time. Dennis Haysbert could peel both of these clowns off the screen.I had to come back to this to see some of the other submissions and the fans of this movie are a mystifying group to say the least(over 40 pages of reviews) but I don't expect any of them to run out and buy the IRREVERSIBLE DVD anytime soon like I recently did. They probably wouldn't like the idea that you don't have to couple extreme violence with wise ass humor to have a very good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mindless action, if you like that sort of thing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally got around to seeing this movie a few months ago, and now I've finally gotten around to writing a review of it. The trouble is, just like the original Bad Boys, I have no real memories of it to write about and the thought of watching it again fills me with a kind of dread.There are two things I do recall about the movie. Firstly, a pretty decent car chase and something about a boat on the road. That seems to me to be a good memory.Secondly, and less pleasant a memory (in fact downright unpleasant) is Martin Lawrence. I can't be the only person to think that the current trend amongst black actors to squeal, show the whites of their eyes and panic a lot in films is an intensely irritating one. For lack of a better scapegoat, I'm going to blame the Wayans brothers for starting this, though Chris Rock (or squealer, as he is known round my way) is perhaps the greatest practitioner of it. Now and again, this behaviour is very funny, but when the actor in question does it constantly throughout a film it is aggravating in the extreme. Not only that, but I have to say I find it somewhat demeaning towards black people in general.Anyway, back to BB2. Well, the fact that I remember so little of it, so short a time after seeing it, tells me that, no matter how good the car chases might have been, the film as a whole was instantly forgettable. In fact, the only real memory of it is a negative one (Lawrence's panic act).One last point regarding Lawrence.... what the Hell happened to him? He seems to have quadrupled in size between the films. What's that all about?Anyway, mindless action and violence if that's your cup of tea, then this is a good movie, if you can stand the squealing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atrocious. The worst movie I've seen - ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was absolutely terrible.Why? Well, first, let me say it was poorly written. It felt like it went for five hours, and when I thought it was over, somehow, the incompetent police let the bad guys escape with the girl. These are the same group of police who trashed Miami and gunned down many, many people on several occasions and still had their jobs at the end of the day. This is not fun. This is stupid.The use of the "f" word is usually to ADD to a script, it's not half of the entire script. There are too many skits which aren't FUNNY. Laughing at a female cadaver isn't funny. It merely highlights the sloppy script.Implausibility is the name of the day here - nothing makes any sense. There is no logic. The film has a strong smell of "anti-drug" propaganda which pervades it like a hooker's funk. This foul stench goes through every aspect of the film. They even repeat jokes which weren't funny the first time. So you can't remember the words to "Bad Boys" (the song), so what? Go and make real movies, you punks.Michael Bay likes to use really fast camera shots to make the action more interesting than it is. It doesn't work. Will Smith's character is extremely arrogant, and he seriously needs some acting lessons by the way he plays his part, it looks like he ad-libs the script and knocks over props, whereas Lawrence's character has had enough (probably of the franchise) and wants out. I don't blame him. I don't blame anyone for not wanting to be a part of this disaster.Action movies do not come any more costly than this movie - it went into incredible special effects which were just for eye candy and were mind-numbingly dull. Over the top, BORING car-chase scenes which feel like they take up hours of your time will ruin your day. The gun-fights are ludicrous - the heroes (not one of the main characters, mind you) will get shot once in the leg or something while all the bad-guys get nailed.Haven't we seen this before? Oh, yes, in every single other action film. The movie is a complete rip-off of every other better action movie ever made (name one). Bay has even re-used some of the terrible story in The Island, which, for my money, was MILES ahead of this garbage. Bad Boys 2 is utterly derivative and all traces of it should be wiped from our history. Just think - in millions of years, if somebody finds this planet and find traces of this movie, they'll think that we humans never amounted to anything but mindless violence and poor dialogue and a movie that should've ended half an hour before it did.This bloody movie has reignited my anger disorder. I hate it more than words can describe.To sum up - do NOT watch this film if you have ANY self-respect. It is a blemish, not only on films, but on society as a whole. HORRIBLE. -10/10 stars - worse than ANYTHING ELSE - EVER. Having one's fingernails removed with pliers is like a party game compared to this rubbish. Unfortunately, I have to rate it 1 on this site, as it doesn't have negative numbers in its rating scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shut Down your Brain and See a Funny Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Florida, Detective Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Detective Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) are investigating the traffic and dealing of ecstasy. The clues lead the cops to a funeral home owned by the Cuban drug baron Hector Juan Carlos 'Johnny' Tapia (Jordi Moll?), but Mike and Marcus have difficulties to find evidences to send the powerful gangster to the jail. Meanwhile, Mike dates Detective Syd (Gabrielle Union), the younger sister of Marcus, who is working under covered in the same case without their knowledge. "Bad Boys II" is a very irregular film, having funny and great moments, but also parts very ridiculous. The parts with the corpses are very comical scenes, the destruction of cars is also great and the discussions between the two partners are usually hilarious. Marcus under the effect of ecstasy in the home of Captain Howard (Joe Pantoliano) is also great. When the story shifts to Cuba, it becomes an ideological crap, labeling Cuba as a country of drug dealers and whores, where American soldiers do not respect the sovereignty of that nation and invade as if it was their back yard. Fortunately this part is very short, and if the viewer shuts down the brain, he or she will have a good time with the rest of the movie. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Bad Boys II"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>$130 Million Dollar sequel that proves more is messier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's anything at all you'll find memorable about BAD BOYS II, it will be the noise level. I'm not just talking about the explosions and the car chases and the gunfire and still more explosions and still more car chases and still more gunfire. You'll remember all of that, but to fill in the noise gaps in between the action sequences, Director Michael Bay has his whole cast yelling during the rest of the film as if one quiet moment would destroy his loud and noisy caper. Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) yells at his partner and friend Mike Lowery (Wil Smith), Lowery yells back at him, Captain Howard (Joe Pantoliano) yells at Burnett and Lowery, Johnny Tapia (Jordi Mollá) yells at everybody, Burnett's sister Syd (Gabrielle Union) yells at Barnett, then yells at Lowery, and in the most excruciatingly idiotic scene in the film, Barnett and Lowery yell at a young fellow who is taking Burnett's daughter out on her first date. Yep, It's one yell of a movie. And that about sums up Bad Boys II, the big budgeted overblown extravaganza that spends $130 million dollars and takes up two and a half hours of your time letting you know that making a sequel to a film as lousy as the original BAD BOYS just doesn't work, no matter how much money you spend on mayhem and chaos.As you know from the first film, Burnett and Lowery are friends and partners that work in the Miami Police Department. In this outing they are out to clean up the drug trading and money laundering operations of Cuban kingpin Johnny Tapia. At the same time Burnett's sister Syd is working undercover for the DEA to achieve the same goal. The plot is simple enough, as it would have to be because anything more intricate might interfere with the excessive on screen havoc manufactured by Bay.One of the biggest questions I have after having viewed both of the BAD BOYS films is how did these two characters ever became friends let alone partners? After listening to Burnett and Lowery spend the better portion of two films letting each other know how many things they hate about each other, how can we be expected to care one iota for either character? The only hint we are ever given is to why these guys are so buddy buddy are given in this film, and only because of an inscription in an old high school yearbook that is laid out as a minor plot device. Burnett and Lowery have so little respect for each other, you would think they'd have gotten a divorce before the sequel ever made it to celluloid.Then there's Burnett's family life. As in the original Bad Boys, it is used here also as either a plot device or a set up for what is supposed to be a comedic interlude. One joke about a swimming pool is straight out of the Jerry Lewis handbook of pratfalls and misadventures and is as lacking in humor as most of Lewis's later films were. Yet we not only are subjected to this joke once, but twice. Well, maybe the French will like it. The other joke has to do with the aforementioned date of Burnett's daughter. What Bay should have done is taken a look at the Lethal Weapons films. In those films Danny Glover's home life was at times a plot device, but we were also given some true insight into his relationship with his wife and kids which gave Glover's character a human element that Burnett sorely lacks.Lest we forget, there's also Burnett's sister Syd, the DEA officer from New York. The reason she is Burnett's sister is so that we can have a running joke about what Lowery may or may not have done with her when he made a trip to the Big Apple. Also, when and if Burnett finds out, it gives him another reason to dislike Lowery. As if he really needed one. Late in the film Syd is also used as another plot device to help move our story to Cuba, something that could have been done without making her Syd's sister, and had her just be the girlfriend of Lowery. Thinking about it now, the whole film might have been much more interesting if she had just been introduced as Lowery's girlfriend and Bay had left the sister plot in the trash compactor where it belonged.Since most of the audience of this film is here for the action, the film doesn't falter in that regard. If that's what you want to see you'll certainly get your money's worth and then some. The problem is that there are too many car chases, too many shoot outs, and they all go on for what seems like more than an eternity. Watching this film in the theater, Bay does as always and cuts his action sequences in such a way that watching them in a theater, makes everything almost impossible to follow. I think Bay considers filming action sequences this way as showing true chaos. All I see is a big mess. Having viewed the film a second time on DVD before writing this review, I can honestly say this is one time where big action sequences actually play better on a smaller screen. At least you won't become nauseated as you more than likely did during one sequence when Burnett is standing flush against the wall holding his arms outstretched, guns in both hands, and the camera circling around him like it was filming a ballet sequence. The shot is pointless, and adds nothing to the sequence, although it would have been a good place to use a product placement ad for Pepto Bismol.In another scene that should have been used to build suspense, Bay plays it for one big cheap laugh instead. It has to do with Lowery and Burnett posing as exterminators in order to plant surveillance cameras in Johnny Tapia's rat infested mansion. I didn't find it funny, just stupid, much in the same way I found many of the scenes in this film that used gross out moments to elicit a cheap laugh. If you find the thought of police cars running over someone's deceased family members humorous, then you'll probably have a big guffaw, but you're not somebody I'd care to know.Enough people in the U.S. liked BAD BOYS II well enough to put $138 million in the Sony coffers. Enough people overseas liked it enough to add another $134 to the Sony Bank Account. What that means is between film gross and DVD sales, we could definitely be in danger of having BAD BOYS III thrust upon us. And when I feel as if I'm in danger of having to sit through a third mess, I have no choice but to give BAD BOYS II my grade which is a D-.   </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action-Packed Sequel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bad Boys 2 is a very good, action-packed film. If you thought the action was explosive in the first film, wait till you see this film. This is an action masterpiece mixed with funny, similar comedy from the first movie. I just admire Will Smith and this has to be Martin Lawrence's best movie.The movie started off slow. It was kind of boring in the beginning of the film, but after a half hour, action dominated the course of the movie. Basically, this movie is about the police trying to stop drug transportation.Overall, this is not a bad movie. I hate it when people rip off Michael Bay. He is a talented director with a thing for explosions. The soundtrack is also great. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bad boys for life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Smith &amp; Martin Lawrence are back as buddy-cops, Mike and Marcus respectively. This time they're on the trail of an Ectasy drug ring, but the insubstantial plot takes a backseat to the action overload that never let's go until the Bad Boys find themselves in Cuba, where the film takes a major downturn. All in all I liked this movie a lot because I took it for what it was, a dumb mindless action flick. All of the cast is good, even Martin Lawrence, whom I never cared for. Joe Pantoliano is ok, but never gets to really shine like I know he can, due to the rather one-note Police sergeant role. Many leftests have complained that this movie is racist, sexist, homophobic, etc... My response to them is a simple one, GROW UP!! Not every film can confirm to PC standards &amp; I for one am happy of that. There's only so much politically correct BS one can swallow. Liberals this is not a movie for you, go fawn over "American Beauty" &amp; the ilk.My Action movie Grade: B+DVD Extras: Disc one: Trailers for "Bad Boys"; "Bad Boys 2"; "Once upon a time in Mexico"; "Radio"; "S.W.A.T."; ' the new spider-man cartoon"; "the Missing"; &amp; "Underworld" Disc 2: 7 Deleted scenes; 2 featurettes; 6 Sequence breakdowns; production diaries; &amp; Jay z music video 'La la la'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The THX trailer logo had a more believable plot"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Bill Maher said on his show 'Real Time', and I quote "I went to see Bad Boys 2, and the THX trailer logo had a more believable plot." I could not agree more. In fact, I don't think there could be a wittier remark about such hideous film-making. 'BB 2' to put it simply is not a film; it's a montage of stylized noise and explosions.Michael Bay (the director) is a distinctive filmmaker who I've had mixed thoughts about. But after viewing this abomination I think Bay can be uniquely talented, but he also be uniquely patronizing to the audience. His movies have no authentic characters and no story. His films are nothing but action orientated situations, from an over the top A.D.D. imagination. Bay tends to downplay character, and exposition to such a small serving that only a four year old would consider it legitimate storytelling.As for the action sequences, I admired some of the camera work, but they go on too long. One car chase has a running time of about ten minutes with so much repetitiveness, that it's hard to believe there are more car chases to come. And the time fillers that take place between the action are useless. There just in the movie to give us mandatory character insight so the movie has a feature length running time. Smith and Lawrence do what they can with the humor, but the humor is so bad and vulgar that it's hard to even think about laughing.So here's some advice to Michael Bay. Try to be more intelligent and more creative with your next film. It's the only way you can gain more respect in the film industry. Lord knows you need it. You're on the fast track to becoming a successful version of Ed Wood. And here's a quick memo to Mr. Bruckheimer (the producer.) Now that you've had a good run and made a lot of money, maybe its time you head back to Middle America. To put it rather honestly you're not a filmmaker you're a businessman. A businessman who overuses film motifs that appeals to Middle Americans to produce maximum box office returns. There are reasons critics loath your Middle-American touch. You have a tendency to be too sentimental and too abridging in your work. Your films are reflections of what the market research says, not what your passionate creative impulse says. And for that, I fear you maybe turning the cinema into a dump of schlock, YIKES!!!!!!!!!!!!. Don't even think about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow. I don't care.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long, tedious action adventure with repetitive dialog, bad plot holes, and generally boring characters is how to describe this little foray into following up the characters from Bad Boys.Marcus and Mike are out about, trying to find some ecstasy they've been alerted about. They get into a bunch of fights, a bunch of car chases, they get in trouble, they argue with each other. Then they go and they get into another fight, then they get in trouble, only this time they argue with each other first. Then they argue with each other, then get into a fight, then get in trouble. Then they get into trouble, argue with each other, and get into a fight. The fights? The same thing, over and over again. Marcus is upset because he feels his life is in danger. Mike is upset because he feels Marcus is bringing in negative energy. They parody relationship therapy.There's another thing happening. It's this Cuban antagonist. We don't really care about him, really. He just kind of runs around, being Cuban and evil and all. Then we get to see him get angry at people. Then he becomes devious. Then he becomes malicious and angry again.So we watch, for over two hours, with just enough action to keep it moving. Action that involves a certain camera movement, then a reverse shot, then the same camera movement, then the same reverse shot, then the same camera movement, then the same reverse shot... The only truly interesting action scene occurred in that house with the Rastafarians, with that spinning camera thing. That was pretty clever. That's why this film got any stars at all from me.Really, all I got from this film was the feeling that the filmmakers were trying to make the Bad Boys series, if there will ever be one (probably...) into the Lethal Weapon series. I also got a lot of stuff about terrible psychoanalysis which was, to me, Michael Bay telling the world that male attraction to action adventure movies is not some weird psychoanalitical crazy mess, but just good natured fun. Which is why the movie got a bit more of a higher rating from me.Otherwise, wow, was that tedious.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

Have that people ever been on a cinema......? You really start to wonder. Michael Bay has made two good movies, and that is The Rock and Armageddon.
