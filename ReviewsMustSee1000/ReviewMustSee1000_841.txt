		<shortDescription>Rachel Weisz truly gives an Oscar worthy performance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Crisp and heartfelt thriller that gives you the right shot in the arm with an Oscar caliber performance by Rachel Weisz and an equally Oscar worthy performance by Ralph Fiennes. This is a film about the horrors of big business and the way they are willing to experiment on the poor to achieve their goals. Rachel Weisz plays Tessa, A feisty activist who uncovers a conspiracy by a pharmacy company to test experimental drugs on the poor natives of Africa. She then tries to fight them and expose the conspiracy until she is brutally murdered. Her husband, a quite diplomat then begins to take up her cause and try to give his departed wife justice while trying to uncover the hard truth of what is going on.Fernando Meirelles Follow up his masterpiece ":City of God" with an equally satisfying journey of self-discovery, love and Justice. Ralph Fiennes owns the role of Justin and he takes you into the center this thrilling journey and into the center of his soul as well. The real showstopper here is the performance of Rachel Weisz, who gives the right balance of self-righteousness, heart and determination with her role. Weisz makes you believe in the film and makes you equally as determine as Justin and she was in uncovering the conspiracy and uncovering the true about what had happen to her.This is one of the best films of the year and if there is any justice in the world, this baby would be nominated to the hill with Oscars and Rachel Weisz would get one as well because her performance is easily the best performance of any actor we have had all this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meirelles, Weisz and Fiennes make a modern political masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Intelligent and moving political thriller that should be held right up there with "All The Presidents Men" and "The Killing Fields " as one of the best political thrillers ever made. Fernando Meirelles tops his last directional effort with a thriller that is moving, scary and down right forthright in it's views of big companies gone wrong and the horrors that they are willing to inflect on others for the sake of profit. Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes give career best performances in this film and that's a huge compliment considering the fact that they are good in almost everything they do, even in bad movies. Weisz is strong willed and obsessive and Fiennes is determine and endearing and both of them compliment each other with there destine to be award winning chemistry and acting chops. The director compliments both of them with a view of Africa that is rarely seen in film and a sense of reality that is only found in real life.Rachel Weisz, Ralph Fiennes and Fernando Meirelles all should be honored at award season for their amazing efforts in this film because as of right now, this is with out a doubt the film to beat come Oscar time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, Haunting and mesmerizing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great romantic thrill ride that is made even more special by the performances of Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes, who both give this adaptation of the John Le Carre book a real sense of beauty, dignity and grace with their on target performances. Weisz is perfection as Tessa Qualye, a civil rights activist who is murdered for trying to bring awareness of their illegal practices on the poor natives of an African village. Weisz gives her character a self-righteous drive that is made poignant by her determination and sheer will and she also makes her character human, not a stereotype, which makes her performance the more real. Ralph Finnes plays her grieving husband Justin, who takes up her cause and begins to lean of how wonderful his wife really was and what he missed during the time she was alive. His haunted performance is in my opinion his best ever and is the driving point of this haunting odyssey of justice, lost and self sacrifice. Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes both deserve Oscar nominations for their superb performances and Fernando Meirelles deserves one as well for his superb direction that puts you smack in the middle of the story that is unfolding right in front of you.Hands down, the best film of the year so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3-in-1 Film: Romance, Thriller, and Social Realism!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Constant Gardener" seeks to juggle three film styles?the romance, the thriller, and provocative social realism. On all three levels, the film succeeds, especially with the latter.Much credit should go to director Fernando Meirelles, who has synthesized a virtual textbook of different film techniques. The uses of set-ups, location filming, lenses, film editing, and close-ups were simply dazzling. While the panoramic scenes of the African landscape were breathtaking, there was a starkly contrasting approach to the close-ups in the scenes in the city. The jittery, hand-held camera sequences added to the dramatic tension and underscored the urgency of coming to terms with poverty and disease.The romantic portion of the film was anchored by the two characters played by Ralph Fiennes (Justin) and Rachel Weisz (Tessa). Their first meeting was dynamically presented as Tessa was a social activist heckling Justin as he was making a political speech. When the hall was cleared, however, it was Justin who was actually comforting Tessa after her outburst. The juxtaposition of the placid, passive Justin versus the fervent, hyper-kinetic Tessa was brilliantly established in that opening scene. The strands of thriller and social realism are inextricably tied together in the film. As a whodunit, "The Constant Gardener" seeks to uncover what actually happened to Justin and Tessa on their African journey. At the same time, the main culprit that emerges is the heavy hand of greed as the pharmaceutical companies exploit helpless victims of tuberculosis for the purpose of testing and marketing an experimental drug. At one point in the film, it is disclosed to Justin that the pharmaceutical industry is no different than "arms dealers."Another British film entitled "The Girl in the Café" appeared recently on American cable television. That gem of a film is a low-budget version of "The Constant Gardener." Both films seek to raise consciousness about the tragedy of world hunger and disease. The title of "The Constant Gardener" is an important one because of the time and care taken by Justin in his garden both at work and at home. In the process, however, he has ignored the urgent pleas of his wife, and he has lost touch with the world crisis to which he is arguably a contributor. The eighteenth-century French writer Voltaire ended his famous novel "Candide" with the slogan "One must cultivate one's garden." This film would appear to suggest that instead of tending our gardens, we need to follow the lead of Justin and Rachel and see how we all might work to help others right now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting, Heartfelt and Horrifying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slow tension building thriller that is charge even more with the great performances of Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes, who both bring an essence of realism to their roles and a sense of chemistry that is really not found in movies like this anymore. Rachel Weisz brings a ferry fury that is ripe in it's convictions and Ralph Fiennes brings a cool, collective zeal that is a slow building timer ready to emotionally exploded at any minute. Both performances compliment the fine directing of Fernando Meirelles, who gives this tale a sense of brilliance in its storytelling and a sense of the way the world really works. It's a heartfelt story of lost and redemption and it's hauntingly poetic in it's horrifying look at the horrors of a world that is willing to cast a blind eye at the problems of big business and corrupt governments that are willing to do anything in order to make a fast buck. Even going as far than to destroy human life to achieve their goals.This is a brilliant film and I can't wait to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful and haunting story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been less than a day since I have seen it and I find it difficult to get it out of my mind. The images and feelings stay with you. The direction, cinematography and editing is superb. If you loved the style of "City of God" with its "documentary style" camera work then you'll love this too. The story is done "non-linear" like it was in the book?.and I thought it made the experience of seeing the movie so much more enjoyable. Since the film starts off very early with the death of Tessa and then continues with Justin's journey of discovery to find out the cause of her death which only seems to bring even more heartache and anger.....the non-linear style allowed for some light hearted moments from Justin and Tessa's marriage to break up the tension.The performances by both Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes are excellent. The relationship between Justin and Tessa came across as very real and touching and it's a testament to the chemistry between the 2 actors. The intimate moments were some of the most realistic I have ever seen of a couple in love?...unlike "Hollywood movie love". Fiennes performance is unforgettable. I would have to rate this very close to the quality I saw in "Schindler's List". He demonstrates such a change from the beginning of the movie to the end. He conveys so much with just his face. Justin will break your heart? especially as he gains wisdom. The soundtrack provides a wonderful complement to Justin's journey of discovery. The music has a haunting quality as does this movie. It's a testament to Meireilles that the movie seems to slowly draw you in and hooks you as you go along with Justin. It challenges the viewer to see the poverty and forces you to face your own complacency in the world. So as Justin gains wisdom and is forced out of his complacency?.. it is like Meireilles is turning the mirror towards the audience and asking them "Do you see what's happening in the world? What are you going to do about it?". It is a powerful and moving story and I think will soon become a favorite. I expect nominations for all the major categories.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a rare gem in today's gravel pit of features. Rachel Weisz is truly transcendent. She is just so immensely real and powerful and alive! Fienne's role as that of a somewhat distant man is the perfect complement to this.Visually, this is one of the finest films I've seen in years; the editing is brilliant and the cinematography is beautiful; the DP gives us subtle stylistic cues and approaches which highlight the many different worlds we encounter, from the abject poverty of Africa to the interior of a private London club. See this film...and see what a movie can really be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A compelling love story, very original? and an intriguing drama with a flavor of reality?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie opens with a genteel British diplomat whose hobby provides the title, falling for a fiery human-rights activist Tessa (Rachel Weisz), after she harasses him during a speech?They're soon married, and she follows him on a placement to Kenya? There, Justin (Ralph Fiennes) becomes increasingly uncomfortable with Tessa's strange relationship with Arnold Bluhm (Hubert Koundé), a black physician, doing?well, he's not sure what? Suspicion of her brutal assassination soon falls on her confidant Bluhm as he was the last one seen with her, and he's now missing? Justin's journey for answers takes him on a tragic odyssey fraught with mystery and peril? Haunted by memories, Justin undergoes a personality change to become more assertive when he uncovers a huge conspiracy that will stop at nothing even to make money at the expense of helpless Africans, who can't fight their own fight? The film is visually brilliant, and the best aspect of it, is the murder mystery? Is Tessa really in love with Justin? Is she having an affair? What is she really up to? Based on the best-selling novel by master thriller writer John le Carré, "The Constant Gardener" is a fine love story wrapped up in a parable which has real power and it has credibility? It depicts the breach between the rich and the poor and demonstrates quite well that the world is deeply corrupt? Fiennes' character, Justin, is a minor member of the diplomat corps more interested in his garden than in other people, until the passionate, radical world of Rachel Weisz's Tessa turns everything on its head? Justin respected Tessa's spirit and her conviction and idealism? And because of his love for her, he had to finish what she started? Of course people don't want the information to get out and they will do anything to silence him? Rachel Weisz won her first Oscar on March 5th, 2006 for her impressive performance as the beautiful, kooky young woman, whose passion for her cause initially overshadows her gentle side?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought Provoking and Beautifully Stirring Political Potboiler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ralph Fiennes stars as a British diplomat whose complacency is challenged when he is forced into a soul searching quest for the reasons behind the tragic death of his activist wife (Rachel Weisz) that uncovers a sinister pharmaceutical company in cahoots with British and Kenyan governments testing a new TB drug on expendable HIV+ Africans.Fiennes gives his most humanistic and endearing performance ever, perhaps even topping his Oscar nominated turns in "Schindler's List" and "The English Patient." Rachel Weisz is an illuminating revelation, turning in the performance of her career. Her character develops and becomes even more compelling after she dies and we learn her secrets through expertly paced flashbacks. Director Fernando Meirelles takes the amazing style he honed with "City of God" and adds a heart with "The Constant Gardener," a big heart that bleeds a beautiful cinematic poeticism onto the screen.This film truly rewards its audience as it works on so many levels. Like this year's earlier word-of-mouth and hot-button issue sleeper, "Crash," you won't be able to stop talking about it after you leave the theater. The politics here are engaging and bound to stir up even the most complacent viewer. What's even more amazing is that all of the timely political discourse and subsequent thriller aspects of the film (courtesy of the source material, John Le Carre's novel) are wrapped up in a timeless romance. We the audience join Fiennes on his journey, and we rediscover the love story between he and his wife that anchors the film in a poetic realism usually reserved for movies with much less on their minds.To top it off, it's all delivered in the maddeningly genius Meirelles style that took critics and audiences by storm in his debut "City of God". We have the shaky hand-held camera darting through vibrant and colorful third-world locales juxtaposed with jaw-droppingly gorgeous aerial photography of Africa in all its blazing glory. Meirelles again shows us he is a true artist willing to show both the shocking beauty and abject horror of the people and places that populate his films. Again he delivers a message that people are doing horrible things to other people the world over (be it in the form of wishy-washy governments turning a blind eye, greedy corporations putting a price tag on a human life, local thugs preying on the misfortune of their neighbors, or friends betraying friends). With "City of God" he seemed to be saying the only hope is to document it. With "The Constant Gardener" he makes that argument again and takes it one brilliant step forward. We may not be able to stop a war or a huge global injustice, but we do have the power to help one person at a time. It takes a courageous film to make such a statement, and a brilliant film-maker to deliver it, and that's just what "The Constant Gardener" does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Great film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the movie was great and worthy of the praise it has been getting from audiences and critics alike. Ralph Fiennes gives the performance of his career as a grieving man looking for answers and is slowing discovering the corruption all around him and Rachel Weisz steals the film whole heartily with a really deserving Oscar worthy performance as a human rights activist who will stop at nothing to get at the truth. The story is pretty scary and the cinematography is fantastic. Yes, the shaky camera can get in the way but it's not distracting enough to ruin the film.If you want to see a movie that will make you think, this is it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its difficult to convey how much of a disappointment the Constant Gardener was. On a scale of 1 to 10, it would be -25, for several reasons.Firstly, as a thriller the ending was in the synopses - we knew the culprits and the deeds. This leaves the details providing the only dramatic tension, which were slowly and painfully dragged out of the characters in a way which left the audience gasping for events to complete themselves.Secondly, the characterisation left the audience disinterested in the main parties. Fiennes' love for Weisz is drawn in so many clichés, and is so poorly sketched by the repetitive flashbacks, that we are left wondering why they were so interested in each other in the first place. The film then fails completely by centring the plot on this vapid excuse of a relationship. We see Fiennes cry over their first meeting, without knowing what exactly formed the basis of their relationship or why they had married. Its sad but I couldn't care less about his grief when I don't really understand why he is grieving or believe in the relationship.Thirdly, the film itself was a dog. Each character spoke in a continuous monotone, in a language which I assume was the screen writers idea of how diplomats and aid workers speak to each other. With the exception of Bill Nighy, who should have been given more screen time, each actor or actress was reduced to barking their lines to a fridge buzz. Worse, the direction was scattergun and failed to take advantage of the potential for holding any kind of drama in the situation. To try and pick the pace up, a few car/horse chases are thrown in to make up for the previous hour and a bit's plodding. They are too late, i'm afraid.Fourthly, it did a total disservice to a very deserving topic. This *should* have been a brilliant film. Instead it was a dull shell over some very worth while points about the irresponsibility of corporate power. I'd much rather seen a documentary about some real events than entertain this poor exercise in intellectual entertainment and chin stroking, cynically designed to satisfy the audiences' self-regard.There is a good corporate thriller, and it is The Insider. In that film, no one dies, yet it is compelling and fascinating despite being about a fairly idiosyncratic topic. Four people die in The Constant Garderner, yet I was completely unmoved. 3/10, please try harder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Political thriller viewed through the lens of a romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films that are written as thrillers, suspense stories and romances all feature certain story elements that define the genre. How the elements are combined to tell a specific story is the measure of a story's success at convincing an audience of its worth. "The Constant Gardener" is a well-crafted story with many fine performances, starting with Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz, and including the many character actors who make this film feel viscerally real and true. In the tradition of films like "Silkwood", "Z" and" The Insider", the director of "City of God" takes the audience on a tense, suspenseful ride with characters who dare tell truth to power. The film viewing experience feels dangerous and worth-while. No doubt, "The Constant Gardener", like "City of God" will fuel discussion about the politics which is the basis of this film, and will also send more people to read John Le Carre's book, which is the basis of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is very competently made, but I think in the final analysis, fine performances, fine production design and fine cinematography count for little when a film is so wrapped up in its smug self-deception that it demeans the causes it affects to champion. Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes), a decent-hearted civil servant, falls in love with Tessa (Rachel Weisz), a political activist brimming with youthful righteousness. At the beginning of the film, Tessa weeps and rants about the decision to go to war with Iraq; we have the cliché of the "over-emotional" woman whose excess of feeling is supposed to chasten the buttoned-down conformity of the people around her. She says nothing of interest about Iraq. The subject of Iraq is a mere dramatic shorthand for any fashionable subject about which "people like us" hold the same opinion. Not two minutes later (of screen time at any rate!) our couple are shown having beautifully-photographed sex. Beautiful souls to beautiful bodies - how appropriate! How exquisitely civilized! I know an Iraqi guy who told me that in England, when people find out that he is Iraqi, they almost always apologise - "I'm so, so sorry". Why, he asked me, do they do that? Of course I replied that the majority of us in the UK opposed the war and we feel appalled by the misery that has ensued, and that the Labour government having been legitimately elected, we all feel in some way responsible for its policies. However, watching The Constant Gardener, a more sinister explanation presents itself. Perhaps those apologies to this random Iraqi are offered more as narcissistic tributes to the English person's sense of ethical superiority. Perhaps what they are saying is "how beautiful I am that I care". And Africa? We have only one properly presented African character, a doctor, who has to have Tessa do his talking for him when the big men are around, and who has in fact so little in the way of a rounded character that he can be arbitrarily labelled as "gay" half- way through the film to service a plot-twist. Otherwise, the Africans are smiling children of the sort beloved of passing tourists, or corrupt policemen in fly-blown offices. There is no more than a superficial effort made to present the African locations as specific, coherent societies. "Africa" is merely an object for the viewer's "compassion" or repulsion. The constantly whirling camera-work flings us into the exhilarating chaos; it never occurs to the film-makers to stop and actually look at anything. That said, the plot mechanics do their mechanical thing efficiently enough, and the characters get a bit sweaty with the stress and fast activity. Look elsewhere, however, for emotional risk or psychological insight. If the unexamined life is not worth living, neither is the life turned admiringly in the hand like a priceless netsuke. The Constant Gardener, with it's smugly cathartic ending, allows no unpolished feeling to disrupt its narcissism. I wonder if this narcissism isn't symbolised in the film by Quayle's mourning the loss of Tessa, political activism motivated by private erotic conscience, a gentlemanly pre- occupation with the conflict between duty and propriety. The Constant Gardener ends up insulting Africa rather than redeeming it, precisely because it has redemption on it's mind. One could defend it I suppose by saying that it at least "raises the issues", but there is nothing empowering, nothing motivating about this film. It is in fact extremely boring. As it drags into its second hour, it is a movie one feels oneself wading though, up to one's waist in the sludge of fine cinematography and flashy editing. But films like this will always find a place in the market, as gloss substitutes for genuine attempt at care and insight. The times will continue to demand them</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More manure for the garden</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Constant Gardener" is a moderately skillful, utterly predictable piece of left-wing propaganda, masquerading as "powerful drama". It has a plot of sorts: "Radical girl" meets repressed, "spineless boy" who stupidly serves the establishment. She knows that the drug companies are evil and that in their mad pursuit of profits are conducting unethical and even lethal clinical tests on the African population. Naturally, anyone who threatens to expose the drug companies is simply "offed" by their army of hired thugs. After the drug companies murder "radical girl" for getting too close to the truth, "spineless boy" discovers that he has a backbone after all. No longer the timid, ineffectual man who escapes the world by pottering around in his garden, he fearlessly pursues his own investigation and digs up the necessary evidence, before he too is murdered.If you are one of those who "know", despite the unambiguous lessons of history, that private property and profits are "evil", then you will find the plot plausible and may even recommend this abortion to others. On the other hand, if you have some contact with the real world, you will wish you had brought an air-sickness bag to the theater with you. There is no doubt that all of those involved in the making of this film, as well as all those reading this review, use pharmaceutical products, nor that drugs have improved the lives of billions of people. Anyone who occasionally reads a book or newspaper knows that drugs are expensively and exhaustively tested for safety and that blunders are both rare and ruinous for the drug companies. Any drug company that wishes to turn a profit will NOT do so by developing a drug that kills people. Finally, if drug companies really murdered those who criticize them or sue them, then why is there no shortage of plaintiffs ready to take them to court? And why are the people who made this movie walking around without body guards? Of course, the reason is that the plot is a paranoid fantasy. Those who enjoy wallowing in that kind of idiocy will enjoy the film. Others should give it a miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utter junk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every 5th movie made in the last five years or so has been produced in this junk style of quasi-artistic film-making characterized by erratic photography and Cunard editing masquerading as tension and suspense in a screenplay that runs the risk of being discovered as devoid of plot if presented in sequence or photographed in an intelligible manner.Why!? To simulate reality? If anyone's life actually occurs in such an obscure and disjointed manner, then the anti-depressants aren't doing their job (I mean the directors').When Spielberg filmed the Normandy invasion this way, it was an achievement of craft that brought the experience home to the viewer with unparalleled impact. Filming every scene since Private Ryan, however--whether of a lone actor getting into a taxi or two inept ones in an awkward love scene--in this same frenetic manner does not substitute for "art" or "chemistry" when the actors and direct have so glaringly not provided it during the filming of the scene.I dearly wish that those who are adept at naming film styles would please acknowledge and name this abysmal, fumbling mode so that those of us who would not rent, lease, purchase, or otherwise cross the street for this kind of product would be mercifully warned away by the advertising.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film without a screenplay and a foreign intrigue story without a mystery.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Constant Gardner is a conspiracy story set mostly in Kenya. The story starts near its end, as Justin Quayle sees his wife Tessa and Arnold Bluhm, her friend and associate, depart on a flight to the Kenyan outback. Shortly thereafter, Quayle is notified that Tessa and Arnold have died when their SUV overturns; "foul play is suspected" as they say. In his mind, Justin recalls events leading to Tessa' death to determine if she was murdered. We learn that Justin is a relatively clueless second generation British Foreign Service professional when he meets Tessa just a year earlier. Tessa, an outspoken activist, sees evil hiding behind corporations and government agencies; she quickly seduces, romances and marries Justin. Their transfer to Africa provides her with a fertile hunting ground. Tessa becomes involved with Arnold, a United Nations associate, working with Aids treatment programs. She immediately suspects the big pharmaceutical companies may be using unsuspecting natives for more than Aids research. Being what she is, Tessa starts turning over stones, writing reports and involving professional activists over the Internet; not good behavior for a Foreign Service wife. The entire British Foreign Service establishment is not asleep at the wheel; Sandy Woodrow the local representative and Sir Bernard in London take notice of Tessa's activity. Was her death in vain? The Constant Gardner is adapted from a John LaCarre novel. In his classic style, it's told through the protagonist's minds eye (flashbacks) and has little live dialogue. This is a film without a screenplay and a foreign intrigue story without a mystery. The film opens at midpoint in the story with neither context setting nor character development as an introduction. The viewer must sort out the characters, storyline and plot in piecemeal fashion within the flashback sequences. The plot or conspiracy in this case is quickly apparent, since it's stated early and often with increasing emphasis as the story progresses. (Not even a Louisiana politician could misinterpret the message.) The story is told incrementally, as repetitive flashbacks and recollections add pieces to the puzzle. This turns the 2-hours runtime into an interminable evening.The Constant Gardner is being praised as one of the better films of the summer 2005 cinema season. This assertion unwittingly speaks volumes about the quality of big screen entertainment. The film is not totally without merit; Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz are perfectly cast and deliver credible performances. Fiennes is the quintessential LaCarre protagonist; self-centered, contemplative and enigmatic, he lives life as a mental not a physical exercise. Rachel Weisz projects a powerful presence and fills a big screen in all dimensions; this is an activist who will not be stopped. Finally, if you're suspicious of public institutions and believe that nuclear medicine, vaccines, antibiotics, electronic imaging and cardiovascular replacement parts grow on trees, this is the conspiracy film you've been waiting for all your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The constant gardener has it easy. It picks an emotionally charged subject matter and involves issues that are at the forefront of the political agenda. It has to be easier to make a film that has an impact on its audience from this starting point. It could have been genuinely awesome.However i felt that the film was totally one dimensional. For those that haven't seen it (and this will in no way spoil the plot), the central theme is large biotech companies in Africa. It is undeniable that such companies do exploit the poorer nations but it is likewise undeniable that if such companies didn't exist we would not possess the range of drugs that we do today. There is no question that these companies do some good. With such a rich subject matter an exploration of shades of grey of the debate could be the basis for an excellent film. Sadly the film fell firmly on the anti-biotech side without any sort of fair trial. It is the lack of sophistication about the biotech = bad message that i objected to. Then as if the portrayal wasn't one sided enough anyone involved with either the British government or the biotech company was made a thoroughly unlikeable character in terms of personality.I don't mean to suggest that as a stand alone piece of work the film was bad. The fact is that by choosing a subject matter that is so emotive the filmmaker must take on certain responsibilities. In the case of the constant gardener i thought the complex issues were not explored at all. We've all seen brilliant movies that balance both sides of a debate, exploring both the "hero's" and the "villain's" motivations, and justifying both to us. The constant gardener does not do this, and i believe is a worse movie for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unbelievable (in both senses) piece of crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Literally, nothing holds water here. Is this the same John le Carré who wrote some of the best plots ever? Forget about the pretentious narration (OK, we got He loved Her SOOOO MUCH after the second flashback...) and the shaky "more real than real" cinematography. But the story! Another universal conspiracy everybody's part of and no one knows about because all the good guys get murdered in a very complicated way. Two utterly obnoxious leads (the only lovable person in the movie is Bill Nighy's baddie, but there's not nearly enough of him) who behave like lunatics (Fiennes delaying the plane's take-off...). A VEDDY VEDDY important report of which one single copy is sent to the only guy who shall throw it into a shredder. A compromising letter which suddenly shows up in the middle of Africa, because no one thought of hiding it well. No Guardian's or NYT's reporter to be seen. A pharmaceutical firm killing people apparently for the sheer kick of it, because no other point could be guessed.Come on, we know capitalism is the absolute evil, but even this dead horse can be and has been whipped more efficiently that THAT.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disapppointing, smug view of Africa by do-good westerners</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of 2005 most disappointing films. Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles had made before the great gangster film "Cidade do Deus" about the brutal life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro. So expectations were high for his second film. Alas, he choose as its material a recent novel by John Le Carre, an exciting writer of spy novels in the 60s and 70s, but someone who has since the 90s been very disappointing in his work, turning the moral ambiguity of his earlier books into shrill indictments of the West in his later ones (not that he does not have a few points here and there in those books). So, from this unpromising material, Meirelles has made a truly awful movie. Basically, the plot is about a timid British diplomat (Ralph Fiennes) trying to solve the murder of his activist wife in Kenya (Rachel Weisz, playing an insufferably smug individual). Fiennes character eventually finds that she was on the track of evil western pharmaceutical companies testing new drugs on African patients without obtaining their fully informed consent - not Africa's most pressing issue. What is most disturbing about this movie, though, is that Africans are basically used as props, useful for the filmmakers to show their superior moral status over other whites. Africans are at most exotic objects here, not subjects of their own lives. You never get to hear their own voices in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Politics of the Medical Industry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The murder of a diplomat's wife under mysterious circumstances is the crux of John LeCarre's complex political thriller THE CONSTANT GARDENER. While thematically, this type of story has been filmed before, it's not concerned so much as to who did it, or why (even though these elements remain as important as ever throughout the plot), but the gradual revelation of a woman whose story is told after her death through flashbacks, pieces of previous conversations, and recollections.Such a woman is Tessa (Rachel Weisz)who while being an aggressive activist and a vocal force to be reckoned with is as mysterious as the people behind the wheel whom she encounters while on stay in Kenya. It's completely believable for a man like Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes), a diplomat and all about control, to fall for her. She has that vibrant energy that complements his quieter nature, and even when he discloses an email that could jeopardize their marriage, he remains devoted to her where any other man would have initiated some form of argument.So when her murder occurs ? right at the beginning of the movie ? Justin realizes how little her knew of her. The deeper he gets into unveiling who killed her the clearer this picture becomes, but it fails to answer any questions except the lingering thought that she was trying to disclose something nasty in the medical department but was stopped. He even recalls a moment when she pointed out to him right after her miscarriage that another mother was being systematically murdered by the medics attending her (as she nursed her baby). Justin takes some time to understand, but by the time he does come to, he's neck deep in murky waters.I will admit that like Justin it took me a while to get into the meat of the story. Political thrillers have a way of meandering about, hinting at a lot of things while incorporating the main idea, that can make them a little difficult to get at first shot. Like SYRIANA, THE CONSTANT GARDENER has numerous agendas that support each other as they wield an increasing pressure on Justin, and like such, offer no easy answers or an easy way out. Pete Postlethwaite's character's very presence late in the film (and in the moment Tessa realizes the baby's mother is being murdered with untested drugs) suggests he is only another player in a chess game where powers demand results and human lives are expendable, if their drugs will eventually surface as the ones of choice.I enjoyed the ambiguousness which lay throughout the movie. Danny Huston and Bill Nighy come through as people without souls who are all about their positions. Both have incredible scenes of hypocritical restraint with Fiennes, as if they knew a huge secret that they wouldn't tell and were urging Fiennes to stay away from further probing. The cinematography and editing, as well, is excellent in capturing just how big this conspiracy plot it and how weak we are in stopping it. At the same time, muted colors dominate throughout ? Justin's life is essentially over ? and only come alive whenever Tessa comes on screen. Even so, their very brightness seems to be an illusion, because despite the fact that love does triumph (if in Justin's devotion to Tessa), corporations remain the same, even after a crucial denouement involving a damning letter. A movie that should be seen several times to grasp its meaning, THE CONSTANT GARDENER is a thriller with a heart and a strong voice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"City of God" director, Fernando Meirelles, does NOT disappoint with his film translation of the John Le Carré novel "The Constant Gardener." His treatment of the violence is on par with "COG." Subtly shown, emotionally felt, yet not glorified. In comparing the slums I've personally seen in South America, I'm drawn to the Kenyan slums on film, because of the way Fernando renders them. Yes, they are terrible, but you really don't want to look away. Unfortunately, I have not read the novel; therefore I cannot draw conclusions (this situation will be remedied next week).Major kudos to Ralph Fiennes for choosing Fernando Meirelles as director and to Richard McCabe, Pete Postlethwaite, Rachel Weisz, Bill Nighy, Hubert Koundé, Gerard McSorley for a job well done ? they're a fabulous cast. "The Constant Gardener" is a visually alive, emotionally moving film, not as ferocious as "City of God" but thought-provoking nonetheless.Personally, I found Mr. Meirelles focused, curious, not at all jaded &amp; cynical, down-to-earth, warm and compassionate. He conducted a Q&amp;A after the screening of "The Constant Gardener" in Washington, DC last night. At the post-screening reception, Mr. Meirelles graciously made himself accessible to all attendees. I hope the lovely people of Venice accept "The Constant Gardener" to their festival!! Mr. Meirelles is currently making a new movie that, through the effects of globalization, unites 5 different stories of people, spanning a myriad of cultures in Brazil, China, Kenya, NYC and the desert. Best of Luck!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Passionate, Intense and moving political thriller that not only fulfills it duties perfectly as a great and passionate film. Ralph Fiennes is at his best with a performance that should once and for all show people on how versatile he really is with a somber performance that is a study of how human expression can tell one' feelings and one's actions. To just look at this man act is a gift in itself and he is at his best here. While Fiennes is at his best, he is outdone by the powerful and graceful performance of Rachel Weisz, which makes this film as powerful and as haunting as it is. She brings a sense of playfulness, mystery and strong will that has not been giving by an actress in the last few years. Her character is wrap in mystery and is only remembered in flashbacks but while you are trying to piece together the truth, you still will morn for her character in the way Justin does for her and be outrage by the circumstances that is responsible for her death. The cinematography is amazing and the direction by Fernando Meirelles is just as inspiring. He lets the actors become the characters and it flows like a running steam of fresh water that is refreshing as well as uplifting.Movies don't get any better than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the brilliant, Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles once again makes a film about things the global community has minimal exposure to. . the raw, powerful cinematography, the graphic honesty, poignant score, art direction and production values that we saw in CITY OF GOD is here in this exquisite, unpretentious, important film. i am one of those individuals who stays to the very end of the credits and i read the personal note written by Meirelles. my hope is that every individual who sees this courageous film stays long enough to read it. i am also hoping to see this film with the inclusion of the edits made before it's release. there is nothing controversial about this film. it is a small part of a much larger truth which affects all of us. and i would be remiss not to mention the performances in this film. Rachael Weisz and Ralph Fiennes were characters not so different from you or i. they and the rest of the cast were brilliant, contrasting yet binding. and that little girl who ran beside the plane she disembarked broke my heart by the simple purity of the scene. this world we live in is a constant battle between good and evil, and those definitions are often blurred by individual perspective. but not here. Meirelles has done us all a great boon by making this film. even for those who have told me they only go to movies for the popcorn. if we, in our complacency, are not part of the solution, then we are part of the problem. supporting this film is the very least we can do. and the bonus is that it may encourage other directors to make like-minded films filled with beauty, honour, redemption, and exposure of the worst kinds of evil that spends billions on direct advertising, gifts to doctors, suppressed information and out-right lies and misinformation. this film enhances us as a species, enriches our minds, and reminds us that films do not always have to be frivolous entertainment fueled by box office returns.</fullReview>

A love story told from a unique perspective, the plot extends through corruption, murder and how international corporations influence government and value peoples' lives by the currency of their relative media value.I loved the film and the story despite the deep shame it made me feel about my ignorance of what the government that claims to represent me might be doing around the world and the genuine plight of the African peoples and how, probably, some of my good fortune in life is at their expense.This is a thought provoking film - there was almost absolute silence in the theatre when the film finished - I hope lots of people go to see the film and then stop to ask themselves how much of the story is true, how much is credible and what they want to do about it.Credit goes to Le Carre, he has a position where he can raise the profile of hugely important issues in the public eye, ask difficult questions and if this is the standard he sets, long may he continue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love is the bate; intrigue of globalized plutocratic exploitation the hook</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A beautiful young woman, Tessa Quayle, with a scintillating and irresistible personality, dazzling intellect, unflinching courage, and undaunted dedication to fighting a vast conspiracy between cross-national governments and a collusion of pharmaceutical companies to exploit impoverished Africans for multi-billion-dollar profits sets the stage for an absolutely compelling cinematic drama. An endearingly descent but insignificant UK diplomat to Africa, Justin Quayle, is the thread used to interweave this amazingly complex tapestry of global crime composed of compromised spies, corrupt bureaucrats, high-level corporate wheeler-dealers and their operatives, research scientists, and even doctors. With such a vast collection of conspirators, it is impossible to detect those ultimately responsible for their exploitation the destitute AIDS patients in Africa. If they do not eliminate the casualties from their experimental drug, their claims for their miracle drug would be undermined. 'They' use long, loosely connected, chains leading down to small-time, obscure hit men to remove anyone who becomes 'a problem', meaning who might expose them. While this is the story's underlying plot it is also its raison d'?tre. The vast, lofty, impenetrable, world of secret connections and villainous transactions within the shadowy official corridors and exclusive club salons of the untouchable rich and powerful elite confounds attempts at comprehension. Just as confounding, is the virtual miracle of compressing all of these diverse elements into a single plot while blending them with an eye-moistening romance by the expert triumvirate of LeClare, Meirelles, and Caine. While the camera work is a 'stopper', as a spy story, it is a masterpiece. It is also the artists' clarion call to a sleeping world naively putting their trust in those steering the fate of the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I walked away from The Constant Gardener wondering how drug companies actually bench test their drugs. (The current Vioxx settlement certainly inspired cynicism) This is a thriller for the thinking crowd ? with sufficient chase scenes and action sequences to justify the genre. It's paced slower then the average Grisham or Ludlum (Jason Bourne) movies I've come to love. But if you're interested in the stark realities of how medicines are tested in third world nations without having to endure negative consequences, this is a film you will want to see. It purports to reveal real-world events from Africa.Pharmaceutical company corporate greed and compromised government ethics set the mood as Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz (on separate courses) do what they can to reveal the corruption spinning all around them. Fiennes is a British diplomat who understands what it takes to succeed in a compromising diplomatic position. Weisz refuses to give in. She's on a mission to reveal the truth - taking the political activist route - from the moment they meet. Fiennes is a love interest to the luscious Weisz, someone who offers an opportunity to cut the red tape and speed the truth about the mischief to which the drug company(s) are up to in Africa.It's a brilliant movie showcasing how third world countries are (or can be) exploited. It deals with how a major pharmaceutical firm conducts harmful tests on ignorant, unsuspecting Kenyans. We see the other side of Africa ? the side unseen in the enticing Kenyan safari tourist posters.This is a thriller that thrills both the mind as well as the spirit. It left me wondering, "how close to the truth did they actually come?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Cinematography - Good Plot - Disappointing Direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I picked up the DVD by reading some Critic's punch line mentioned on the Cover "hair-raising thriller with unforgettable end". I am still figuring out what was Hair raising in the entire film &amp; what was so memorable about the end. As soon One plays the Movie, he or she shall struck immediately by a Deja Vu effect, a reminiscent of "The English Patient" which in turn was a massive boredom. And then one realizes that what its like to see a movie which is lifted from a romantic thriller Novel which keeps on narrating events which are good only for reading &amp; which is made from Director who is aspiring to hit the Oscars. So "The Constant Gardener" is not at all a Thriller nor a Noir nor an Adventure. Its just a collective shots of various events undergone through the main line of characters and some boring scenes which are only good for Novel. Director Fernando Meirelles seems to have lacked the ability to establish the Drama for a Big screen from a Novel based Screenplay. After seeing this film, We then admire the work of Directors like Janathan Demme &amp; Francis Coppolla who are the real achievers capable to create great Movies from books. The Plot of the Movie is very short. Its about an English Diplomat played by Ralph Fiennes working in UK High Commission in Kenya &amp; his wife played by Rachel Weisz who is an AIDs awareness activists. Rachel seems to have cracked open a conspiracy involving some Pharmaceutical company, UK external affair ministers &amp; Kenyan Health Ministry, who all in-turn are attempting a deadly trials of a T.B. Drug on Kenyan poor community. Rachel is murdered and soon Ralph who was unaware about the scam is on his journey to nab down those responsible. The plot seems to be promising. But to one's disappointment, there is no substance even in the post-murder investigation by Ralph. The Movie wins only in One aspect which is Cinematography. Its Awesome. The Last scene in Sudan is shot brilliantly. But the Deja Vu factor persists till the End. The Nude scene was totally unnecessary. One feel questioned about, what the film makers are trying to do ? Does some nude scenes shot by shaky hand held camera adds up value ? Was it why "The English Patient" won an Oscar ? Are those irrelevant lenghtening &amp; boring scenes deliberately planted to mold a better quality movie ? So finally, a small plot is stretched too much that the out come is a boring life less flick which was trying to attempt itself to be an Epic Saga.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A depressing and frustrating experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie's frustrating because it gives you a problem in this world to be angry about, depressing because that problem probably won't be solved anytime too soon. It becomes even more depressing because it puts more than one face on the problem and allows us to see the issue through someone who experienced it firsthand.It doesn't matter if that person is fictional or not. Ralph Fiennes makes him real, and Meirelles surrounds him with what looks and feels like the real world. Ralph Fiennes plays Justin Quayle, a British diplomat married to Tessa (Rachel Weisz, in a heartbreaking performance just as noteworthy as Fiennes's). Justin has a job to do in Africa, and Tessa makes him take her with him, despite his misgivings. They end up entangled in a pharmaceutical battle that has taken lives before and, before the movie is over, will take many more.The subject matter here begs to be heard, and Meirelles has provided it with a compelling venue. He films with a style that constantly keeps us engaged. It's hard to find fault with this movie. I didn't find myself wholeheartedly loving it either, but I admire it for its courage and emotional truth. The Constant Gardener grips you from the start in the lives of these two people and never lets you go, not even when the movie is over. It's hard to forget this story. I wouldn't want to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was good; the well written script had a lot to do with it. While many films have plot holes and silly stunts, this movie had a real story and was realistic. You could picture something like this happening in real life. A diplomat's wife, Tessa, is gathering evidence against a big pharmaceutical company, that is using an experimental drug on the poor of Africa. The Africans must give consent to take the drug in order to receive any kind of medical care. The company covers up the people who die from the drug. They are buried in unmarked graves. It seems the company doesn't want to go back to the drawing board with their drug by admitting it has serious side effects. It would the cost the company a couple of years and millions of dollars to redesign the drug. Instead, they adjust the drug undercover so, they can keep running trials on the poor.Tessa is murdered along with her friend who was helping. Her husband, Justin, starts investigating what his wife was working on, and soon finds his life is in danger.So, the movie is basically a well acted murder mystery with a believable plot and resolution.FINAL VERDICT: Well written. I'm sure the teen crowd would say its slow and boring since there are no explosions and girls in bikinis. But, I recommend this if you like intelligent films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The tag line of Constant Gardener, according to my trusted IMDb.com (internet movie data base) says "love. at any cost"... When I saw that before seeing the movie, I thought "that's kind of cheesy, isn't it...?" Also the preview of the movie led me to think it was more or less of a love story between Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz... so I went to see the movie with somewhat high expectation since it was with great actors, great director (Fernando Meirelles of City of God) and great novel (written by John Le Carr?) it was based on... And expected a great romantic love story... I loved it... It WAS a great love story? But not only about romantic love between two people... It was about love between people? Caring about others? And managed to keep it all going under any circumstance and threat? I have to admit that I do not know so much about Africa? All I know is mostly through a few news articles or TV clips or even movies? And most of them are very gloomy? Like children suffering from AIDS left to die and sometimes even blamed to be responsible of infecting others? Or housewives (or any female in that matter) being constant subjects of domestic violence? Young children forced to go to fight in civil war and losing their limbs? Most of time, I'd read it and get enraged for a few minutes then went on with my daily life? Because it's happening from far away? I wasn't really involved? Like those who pulled out from Rwanda? Leaving so many of them dead? Because there wasn't enough for the other countries to benefit from by helping them out? So? This movie was about those who cared about people in Africa (kenya to be exact) and tried to do their best to help who's in need? Their love, compassion for people they were not directly involved yet they went out of their way? And even risked their lives? Yes, it's fictional but you can only imagine what's happening in the movie is based on reality? Even at the very end of the credit, they dedicated to the movie to the people died for giving a damn? Also the way the movie shows Africa is heartbreaking? It shows people who are in desperate situation yet strong to survive? And positive? Really hope one day we all realize that we cannot go on ignoring them? Especially the children? ? In terms of movie making? it's just beautiful? Ralph Fiennes is absolutely one of the best actors of our time? Then Rachel Weisz is a dynamite here? You can see how their characters changes throughout the movie? Ralph Fiennes plays Justin, a diplomat who is very tender, loving, honest and loves gardening? And he meets Tessa (Rachel Weisz) who is strong willed and humanitarian? Then they fall in love? Their love scene was one of the most beautiful love scene I've seen in years? (wait, I just saw another great one in "Grand Hotel (1932)"?) And the way Fernando Meirelles filmed it with so much light was just gorgeous? Then they move to Kenya together and Tessa gets heavily involved with social workers there? Yet she decided not to involve Justin that makes Justin feel uncomfortable and losing his trust in her? Yet he still loves her by all the ways he knows? Like how he cares about his plants? With all the tenderness and care? Then Tessa gets murdered mysteriously while she was on a trip with one of her closest friend who happens to be male? With so many secrets left, Justin wants to find out what Tessa was doing? Which leads him to get to know her better and truly touched by her? And understand her and what her world was made of? ? It sounds cheesy but I think this movie showed true love? Love. at any cost?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The British diplomat Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) meets the impulsive activist Tessa (Rachel Weisz) in a lecture, and briefly they get married and move to Kenya. When Tessa is brutally raped and murdered, Justin decides to investigate her death, disclosing a powerful secret involving corruption with the members of the British High Commission and corporations of pharmaceutical business."The Constant Gardener" is a complex, intelligent and strong political thriller. The plot recalls a Costa-Gravas movie, exposing a hypothetical abusive situation of corporations in a poor Third World country. Although being a fiction, the story is very realistic. Ralph Fiennes fits perfectly in the role of the calm Justin Quayle; the evolution of the versatile Rachel Weisz in her career is amazing and she has a stunning performance in the role of a passionate activist; and the Brazilian Fernando Meirelles, in his first work after "Cidade de Deus", uses the same style, with a work of camera that looks like a documentary. After the excellent "Hotel Rwanda", it is good to see another serious movie showing the poverty of people of Africa. One day, worldwide public opinion may be enlightened and press the United Nations for relevant help to this continent. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "O Jardineiro Fiel" ("The Faithful Gardener")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A love story, a political story, a relevant story , all wonderfully told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fernando Meirelles proves what a fine director he is by telling a compelling story that works on numerous levels. His uses of location settings, editing, camera movements, close-ups and the actors' non-verbal language add to the starkness of the story and support his style of execution. The panoramic scenes shot with digital camera in Africa sharply contrast with the scenes in Europe. The 'clumsy' camera shots help build the tension and adds a rawness to poverty and corruption. To that he adds a beautifully musical score which he carefully avoids from overuse by allowing it to be part of the scene.The two protagonists are Justin (Fiennes), a professor who is passive and patient and his wife Tessa (Weisz) who is hyper, fervent and a determined social activist. The contrast in their personalities is evident in their first meeting at the lecture hall yet it is this difference that attracts them to each other. When Tessa breaks down in the lecture hall, Justin calms her down with his patience and admiration for her beliefs. The title, refers to Justin's fascination for plants and his dedication towards them in his garden while he fails to see his wife's plea and the world crisis (to which he unknowingly contributes).Both Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Wesiz deliver wonderful performances. While Fiennes brilliantly underplays his part with great ease, Weisz knocks out the audience by breathing fire into a strong but vulnerable and determined but desperate loving Tessa Quayle. I've read that many British critics have trashed her performance. Could this have to do with the fact that her character protested against the British government, or that the film is 'against' the British Govt? The actress gives one of her finest performances to date. The role is a great contrast to the funny bubbly character she plays in 'The Mummy'. Support by Hubert Kounde, Archie Punjabi and Danny Huston stand out.While the film does raise awareness towards poverty, it does imply the ignorance of the industrialized nations towards (or taking advantage of) poverty-stricken nations. On the one hand we see how, after a tragedy, people become more aware of taking action (as Justin does after Tessa's death), how some people prefer attending home to their daily life (Justin in the garden) and how others do something to make a difference and help the needed (Tessa's mission) and how the more fortunate take advantage of the lesser ones (The pharmaceutical companies and Africa). Meirelles uncovers these in a wonderful tragic story 'The Constant Gardener'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unbearably fidgety camera work, for little or no reason it never stopped moving, tracking in, tracking out, hand held, on dolly, tilted one way then the next, knee high, up in a helicopter, down in a pit looking up. Why not give the actors room to work instead of how clever is the camera. lighting, what lighting? No shot long enough to be able to judge. What disservice to John Carre and the superb actors who were but a background to the camera. What was going through director's (Meirelles)mind? Why distract from the brilliant story with this overly mobile camera and using such very short takes, let us look at the actors faces, they are the stars not the camera.

		<shortDescription>Intense, enigmatic and cathartic but in some strange way not quite enough.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Constant Gardener was made after a novel written by John le Carré. I just couldn't believe that he's the same man who wrote the novel for The Russia House, because there were several times when I actually thought of that movie during this one. One lucky guess, I guess. The Constant Gardener is at first concentrated at a couple, Justin Quayle and Tessa Quayle. He's a diplomat, she's an activist and both are present in a remote area of Northern Kenya. Tessa or 'Tess' is quite a sensitive and bold woman, which is clear from the beginning when she openly criticizes Britain's passivity and suspicious standards of morality. Considering the country's foreign policy of course. Her bold and uncompromising character is pretty much the reason why Justin devoted his attention to her in the first place. The technique isn't quite new, but the exchange of past and present events in their private lives really anchors you into their relationship. Then comes the journey to Africa, specifically Kenya where Tess is really anxious to escort her husband. They both seem to be well assimilated to it as we already see them living there. This is where the trouble start. Tess is getting more and more involved in the local pharmaceutical affair and finding out more, without her husband ever even suspecting a thing. She does this with the help of her husband's colleague, Sandy Woodrow. What she finds out doesn't stay hidden because of her informing a few high officials in Britain. Despite the warnings, Tess refuses to keep her voice down about the local community being an experiment for global pharmaceutical companies. That is pretty much the reason for the mysterious murder of her and her good friend Arnold Bluhm. Justin is now left alone and shocked, not having a clue about what happened. The same goes for the viewer as the rest of the mystery is yet to be revealed by Justin's relentless search. The most important part of the movie is the unraveling of that single mystery. Director Fernando Meirelles, well-known for his previous film City of God, draws the techniques of zooming, camera shaking and using vivid colors to the max. This is what makes this film more exciting and thrilling to watch. The story is quite complex and at times too rapid to comprehend all that is being said. It kind of reminds me of JFK because it's stampede throwing of all sorts of facts. Nothing wrong with that, it actually makes the story look more intelligent and dynamic.Of lots of espionage and political thrillers released in the past decades, this one could be considered good not because of it's plot, but because of it's execution and the authentic presentation of completely different societies. It really is one of the rare movies to make the constant change of surroundings look quite untroubled. Adding really fine performances should do the trick for me but I didn't find the story as thought provoking as I hoped I would. I think that all of the techniques and tricks used by the director worked as a disguise to make us forget what the reason for killing Tess was. We already figured it out. You might think that there's a grand conspiracy waiting to unfold itself, but you are left a little disappointed. The Constant Gardener is mainly a very good thriller, enriched with some great performances and stand-out direction as well as editing and credible presenting of different environments. A specific extra is the all-embracing sensation of guilt for all the suffering of mankind. Something rare in films today. It missed an 8 within a hair. 7.5/10........ - 4/5 .......</fullReview>

The story moves along slower than slow and watching paint dry on the wall is more interesting.Credits to Rachel Weisz for her portrayal of the eccentric, passionate and at times naive Tessa Quayle. The fact that Ralph Fiennes doesn't pull off the grieving widower that seeks out the truth his wife has been fighting to uncover and also to solve his wife's murder makes this film ever so boring.To sum up, this is definitely not how a thriller should be done in 2006!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not brilliant; but plants a few ideas in the multiplex.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who madly overrated Fernando Meirelles' *City of God* from a few years back, this new low-key adaptation from a John Le Carre novel (I know, I know -- "low-key" and "Le Carre" are synonyms) will likely be a disappointment. Myself, I found *The Constant Gardener* to be an improvement, though not enough of an improvement to warrant a whole-hearted recommendation. But it's fairly involving and occasionally intelligent, which naturally puts it above the other mainstream movies currently inhabiting the multiplex.Let's dive into the faults first. Actually, first a word to the fire-breathing Free Market Warriors dutifully parroting the talking-points from their preferred right-wing AM radio programs: the "thriller" (I use that word in a technical sense) part of the plot of this movie is NOT far-fetched. Big Pharma (and, to be fair to the Free Market Warriors, Big Government, too) has utilized human beings as guinea pigs more than once. I'm not going to belabor this review with links -- Google it, pal. Sometimes, lab chimps just don't cut the mustard. And the obvious riposte to those on these pages defending the saintliness of Big Pharma is that drugs are tested on people EVERY DAY in clinical trials. Does the average hard-up undergraduate or senior citizen padding his Social Security with a $100 payday have the all the knowledge about a particular drug's side-effects? One may reasonably ask if the fictional pharmaceutical company depicted here ("Three Bees") is doing anything fundamentally different. Where I'd AGREE with the Free Market Warriors is that maybe this isn't such a bad thing. In the film, the company is testing a new drug that is supposed to fight a virulent new form of tuberculosis. The icky part is, they're testing it on Kenyans infected with HIV and AIDS. The fictional drug, called "Dypraxa", may have some horrible side-effects -- like death, for instance. Three Bees is cynically, though perhaps understandably, seeing what the hell the drug actually does to people, people whom are already tagged with a death-sentence.To Le Carre and Meirelles, evidently, testing drugs on the doomed in order to save the rest of the world is a necessarily evil act. I'm not so sure about that. I AM sure that the movie would have been invigorated by the obvious moral ambiguity inherent in the premise. Instead, the writer and director pretend that this ambiguity doesn't exist, making the representatives of the British government nasty jerks who are complicit in the side-effects cover-up. You can see the rest of it coming a mile away: Three Bees lobbyists greasing the financial skids for the British and local Kenyan politicos in order to dodge any "official" whistle-blowing on the new drug. Needless to say, Three Bees will occasionally hire some strong-arm locals to rub out any meddling goody-two-shoes, such as the Rachel Weisz character. Even more needless to say, Weisz -- who is, let's face it, really hot -- feels that she must promise a night of wild sex with a British attaché (Danny Huston) in order to get the message through to the higher-ups that Dypraxa may not be all that it's cracked up to be, quite apart from Three Bees turning the locals into human guinea pigs. The villains are clichés: vile, pot-bellied bureaucrats with rancid libidos and weak stomachs. We've seen it all done before in the Seventies -- and done better.So: a subject not exactly throbbing with cinematic excitement (Big Pharma in the 3rd World); cardboard villainy; Rachel Weisz with a prosthetic pregnant belly patting the heads of poor black kids; pointless DV HandiCam pyrotechnics accompanied by over-saturated color (usually when Fiennes is doing something really James Bond-like, like driving a car or something) -- all demerits, of course. So why see *The Constant Gardener*? It's the depiction of the star-crossed marriage between Fiennes and Weisz that stays with the viewer. The slow peeling away of Weisz' obfuscations after she is murdered, the nagging suspicions of Fiennes about her fidelity, the deeper secrets she carried -- all these plot elements develop several meaty themes about intimate relationships. How much about one's spouse does one really know? Does an ill-advised marriage become more valuable in retrospect after it's over -- and is that because the parties involved arrive at a deeper appreciation of their former partners after they don't have to live with them anymore? And how prominent is the role of sexual desire in the corridors of power? *The Constant Gardener* suggests that desire is an irresistible, sometimes destructive, sometimes redemptive, force. All of which is pretty heady stuff for the multiplex, and certainly appreciated by this viewer, who doesn't see very much of this sort of thing in mainstream cinema these days.5 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was jazzed up to watch this movie when some friends showed up one night with it in their hands. The DVD jacket promised an intellectual thriller with a climatic ending never to be forgotten.Unfortunately, the movie that was actually in the DVD case was not "The Constant Gardener" as described. It was the cinematic equivalent of a CAT-scan. Several hours of absolutely nothing, with a little medical tension thrown in to keep you from falling asleep. And it barely managed to do that.The story managed to speak to no one. I shared my living room with people who as recently as a year ago were from Russia, India and several different regions of the United States. We all had the befuddled reaction to the movie, so I know it wasn't just me.The acting isn't so bad, but the direction is among the worst of any movie I've ever seen. The character development simply was absent. There was absolutely none. The plot, for lack of a better word, was tedious and specious at best. It basically was a two hour long fluff piece for the United Nations.WARNING: PLOT SPOILER! The premise of the movie boils down to "Corporations.. specifically pharmaceutical companies.. are bad. In this case, the evil companies decide that it's easier to kill various people, including foreign diplomats and their families, rather than fix a drug that allegedly kills people. You see, the evil pharmaceuticals want to sell their drug to billions of people around the world. And they can't get FDA approval if a couple hundred people die from their testing in Africa. So they cover up the poor test results. Come on, people! That's incredibly idiotic! If the drug is killing 5% or more of the people being tested, it obviously would end up killing millions of people on the worldwide market. No pharmaceutical company on the planet is remotely interested in releasing a drug like that since they'd obviously be sued into oblivion very quickly.So the whole premise of the movie is based on a completely asinine idea. And anyone who actually thinks crap like that is happening somewhere needs to put down their copy of Mother Earth and reacquaint themselves with the real world.The one thing that I did find rather interesting about this movie is that it is EXACTLY two hours long. To the very second. So be prepared to waste two hours of your life if you rent this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best political love story movie with the best performance of the year by Rachel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is what we call acting which truly mesmerizes you till the end even if the actor has a very limited role in the movie .Wow, Rachel is awesome in the movie simply breathtaking .Yes, a the lead actor too has done a brilliant performance very soft and innocent who turns out to be very strong at the end to avenge his wife's death .But Rachel is so good you keep thinking about her in the whole movie even if she is not there .She completely steals the show .Hats off to Rachel for such an astounding performance I hope to see her more in such strong roles .I think among all the Oscar winners this year she was the most deserving one if the Oscar hadn't given it to her then it wouldn't be not worthy to be called "THE Oscar". I liked the movie too specially because it involves the story about the a person who wants to fight for justice but not for herself but for them who are in trouble and are suffering .This is the best political movie I have ever watched .And the fact that it is a political love story is even more wonderful .I specially love the role Rachel plays specially in the scene where she meet her husband for the first time and the part where Tessa's husband tries to complete the thing that his beloved wife had started and died for. And that scene where Tessa feeds the child of some other woman and where she asks favor to her husband to give ride home to the mother and son who had to walk home for one day was so touching .Can people like Rachel really exist in this ruthless 21st century world? I don't think so .Other things very good about the movie is that it speaks the truth it tries to uncover the stories that are knowingly being hidden from the public's view .Truly a part of me did get moved after watching this movie ,are this things really happening in places like Africa .As I myself am from an underdeveloped country this movie forced me to think that what will happen to my country if we aren't going to something right away .And lastly the best for this movie to be so good is because of the brilliant performance by the lead actor and actress. A truly wonderful movie with a great story where Rachel is at her best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was a good movie here. The start was fine - interesting, engaging - good enough to win an Oscar for Rachel Weisz, in fact. And for the rest of the film, there still seemed to be a good movie happening, but not quite within the viewfinder of the camera. After a certain point, the method of shooting the film shifted and the camera never again focused for long on any of the characters or on the setting. What's actually on-screen are pieces - pieces of out of focus landscape, a nose, a stubbly chin, the very front end of an airplane, a mysterious lump on the ground, and on and on. This is so distracting and unsatisfying that whatever good there is in the film is lost.Technique should never get in the way of what a movie has to say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem is not just bad film making but a bad story. It might have been a better story or a least felt fresher if it had been made in the early seventies where conspiracies of big business were just starting to take off in the public mind. At the current times the who story seems a bit of a, "so what". Corporation and government can't be trusted, so what. Are we really supposed to believe that a person schooled enough to become a British diplomat would be so naive as to the main character? The film apart from the bad story is just plain slow. It had all the pacing of a Melville novel. I'm no fan of Rambo action crap, but if I had a choice between watching this slow movie or watching an action version I would clearly chose the action. This one actually has you wanting someone to die or get murdered just to hurry the film up a bit. I had no idea watching it that it was made by the director of City of God. If I had know that, I would have been even more disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A not very credible plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find this movie not credible for a few reasons and totally overrated by the people who gave it 10 stars (of course they will disagree with me on this). The most important one I believe is that there is so much information that Tessa gathers that it can junk the company that makes the drug and that is getting profits out of killing people and manipulating scientific evidence on the drug. She can pretty much destroy the company by just disclosing the stuff she has been finding to the NEw York times or similar. A big rumor can have very big consequences on the stock of companies and for something as dark as what is shown in the movie, I don't doubt there would be such a loud out cry that an investigation would develop and there again would be a huge hit on the stock price of the drug maker. But the movie presents this as if Tessa's only way to do something was to contact the British government. HELLO!!! The movie doesn't do a good job in describing how the main characters would love each other since Tessa married Justin just for the sake of getting into Africa and the movie shows that the husband never knew anything of what she was doing. That happens in an uncommitted relationship, or one without love. So it seems internally inconsistent that the characters actually loved each other. Finally, I find completely unnecessary to put Rachel Weisz naked in the movie. Not needed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently listened to an audio book of The Constant Gardener. When I was a kid my father used to read every John le Carre novel, but I was never a fan of spy novels. I got him the audio book as a gift. Having heard good things about the movie I decided to give it a listen. I was blown away. Every day I anticipated getting in my car and listening on the way to work or on my way home. I took it with me hiking so that I could listen for more than just the 20 minutes I'd spend in my car each way. In fact, it became my motivation to go hiking in this unpleasant northern Ohio weather. I finished just a few days before the movie came out on DVD. Last night I watched the movie with my wife and while it was good, it didn't seem to pack the emotional wallop of the book. One reason, I think, is that they mishandled the flashback scenes. The first half of the movie is almost entirely a flashback and they lay out most of what Justin needs to discover for us. Instead of going along on this wild ride of discovery with him, we're left waiting for him to catch up. This is what makes some of the harsh reviewers on this site think that he is utterly clueless. After all, we already have most of the answers before he even begins his investigation. The movie, as all adaptations do, leaves out several characters and scenes and also consolidates key elements of the story. His trip to Vancouver after the beating he takes in Germany is entirely skipped over. Two characters that should not have been left out were the Scotland Yard detectives who come to Nairobi to investigate the murder. Many of the flashbacks are hashed out during their interviews with Justin and Sandy, both of whom stonewall the detectives for their own reasons. Sandy as part of the cover up. Justin because he can't trust anybody at that point. Despite this, the detectives work tirelessly at getting to the truth, only to have their case shut down just as they are closing in. With them missing from the story, Justin is left to play out some of their critical scenes, such as confronting Kenny K about a meeting he claims never happened. HERE COMES THE SPOILER For those who might have thought that the movie's ending was sad, I can assure you that the book's ending was downright tragic. There is no reading of "the letter" at Justin's funeral. All the bad guys get away with it and continue to be bad guys. Some get handsomely rewarded for their deceit. Justin's estate nags at them with endless lawsuits, but the world just continues to turn and it doesn't miss three good people who gave their lives in pursuit of the truth. For those who call it liberal hogwash and think it's O.K. to use Africans as guinea pigs, you should be ashamed of yourselves. Yes, pharmaceutical companies can make people's lives better. In fact, every character in the film with knowledge of the drug says it's a good drug, they just don't have the formula right yet. But as Lorbeer says in the book, but not the movie, they are beholden to "the God Profit." And we've seen plenty of cases in recent years where their worship of that particular "God" has led to tragedy for people on this continent. Overall, the movie is good, but the book was better. That's certainly nothing new.</fullReview>

The story is told in a documentary fashion amid the political turmoil in Kenya. Fiennes and Weisz are both excellent actors and give earnest performances. The problem is that there are too many talking heads and the story wanders all over the place and goes on forever. It takes an effort to keep up with the convoluted plot. It may have served the filmmakers better to focus on only the most important elements of le Carre's novel, thereby creating a tighter and more focused film. Maybe it's just not my cup of tea but I remember having the same feeling reading one of le Carre's novels (Tinker, Tailer, Soldier, Spy): too much tedious detail.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Constant Gardner is an extremely surprising film in which Ralph Fiennes takes the life of Justin Quayle and blends it into the globe-trotting secrets of his spouse, played by Rachel Weisz. The wife herself is on a secretive high speed mission to expose the deadly pharmaceutical business of uncaring corporations out to make millions on the bodies of dead Africans. With the wife surreptitious and "Accidently" removed from meddling into the affairs of their company, upper management believes that sufficient monies will keep the soft spoken and laid back life style husband out of their affairs. They are mistaken. Instead of holding him in place, all efforts by the corporations are unleashed when they learn that Justin will not rest until he exposes his wife's killers. Action based and moralistically implied, the film earned high praise for it's sympathetic approach to the plight of millions of starving and dying Africans.

		<fullReview>Hey ... what can i say about this movie?? Well, it was excellent and emotionally powerful. Being from Kenya myself, i have experienced firsthand the corruption that takes place within the country, demonstrated superbly by the writing of John le Carré. Yet, with all of this, the movie seems to capture the true image of Kenya, one of great beauty, overlooked because of the utter turmoil that takes place within it.The Constant Gardener however, did capture this turmoil in its truest form. Poor natives, living in slums, blackmailed into testing medication with the threat of no medication at all, all for the "good of humanity". A few expendable lives here and there, no one that will be noticed if they are lost.Throughout the movie, there was little emotional power, leave for one scene in particular, that of the UN plane and Abuk, the little Sudanese girl. At no point in the movie did i feel very emotional, but at this scene, i could not hold back. This was a scene that was brilliantly put together, and showed the harsh reality of the role of the UN in Africa. Where they are sent to help, but are unwilling to bring a small girl aboard a plane to save her from certain death. Never when i have watched a movie, have i cried like i did at that scene. A scene that showed an extraordinarily brave little girl, who knew what was to become of her, yet still sacrificed herself knowing that she would not be allowed aboard.To all of the people who tore apart this movie, saying that it was socialist propaganda made to harm major companies, i have but one thing to tell you. You have absolutely no idea what life is like in countries like this, what happens here everyday, while we in the west take our lives for granted. So before you jump to such quick conclusions, read into the subject, learn about what is happening around you, and educate yourselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an interesting but sometimes irritating and depressing film that raises some good issues. It functions on several levels: -It's a lament for Africa and all its problems, especially with diseases.-It's a passionate indictment of corporate greed and government malfeasance.-It's not really a thriller but it is based on a John LaCarre novel and there are car chases and a raid by Sudanese bandits as well as corporate and government intrigue -Mostly it's a love story. Ralph Fiennes plays a career-minded British diplomat who seems more concerned with his garden than people. Rachel Weisz is his activist wife who finds out that pharmaceutical companies are testing dangerous drugs on African patients in exchange for what should be basic health care. She gets killed and he tries to find out why and finds out all the things she had learned, then becomes the target of the same assassins. In doing so, he comes to understand her and love her more than he ever did when she was alive.This later is the best part of the sometimes powerful film. The worst part is the camera work, which features constant use of hand held cameras which bob up and down all the time. Bring your Dramamine. Also, it's not exactly escapist fare. Instead it shoves your face right into the world's problems. If you liked "Wedding Crashers", you'll hate this. But you won't forget it anytime soon.</fullReview>

Weisz gives a very strong performance as a conscientious intellectual that challenges the world in an headstrong way. Fiennes really gives an outstanding performance as well by allowing the public to discover the different aspects of his character.

		<shortDescription>Boring and obvious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking at the polls, I may well stand alone in my critique of this movie. I thought it was dull and boring. I had managed to work out the plot and outcomes in the first 15 minutes of the movie, most of it within the first 5 minutes. The characters were one dimensional naive twits who believed that by stamping their feet they could make the world a better place. I felt no empathy for the characters, despite their noble intent. The lead characters did not seem credibly connected at all.The camera work at some stages was simply irritating: close up shots, action shots and landscape shots with no apparent connection or meaning.On the plus side, some colourful African scenery and it was pleasant to see Ralph Fiennes play a sensitive soul for a change.My advice... see something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Constant stupidity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sloppy, sloppy writing, badly contrived root conflict, extremely poor plot desperately trying to justify some cliché ridden feel-good leftist rants. The colours of Africa are what they are but their beauty cannot compensate for the artsy-fartsy cinematography, the jerky camera movements intended to create a documentary like atmosphere. Nothing in this movie makes sense and neither is there any of the brutal honesty that made the City of God such a watchable movie. The only thing I find more scary than the utter stupidity of this movie is the admiration expressed for it here by other reviewers. What this movie seems to do well is pushing the emotional buttons of those who cannot think for themselves. Sorry, let's make this 'those who cannot think" - period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to a suspenseful thriller something that will engross me and add a bit of energy in what seemed to be a tired evening. Well I was wrong this was a long tedious study of an incredibly artificial Ralph Fiennes (I usually think the world of him, not here)...There was 90 percent dialog with the rest of it divided to 9% driving and flying around Africa and 1% action. I get the idea behind the whole thing but it would have better served in a documentary about the exploitations of the poor Africans by the big drug company and not masquerade it behind a "thriller" huh? Did I miss the memo? I rented it on DVD,,,would I have paid for movie tickets i would have been livid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a waste of time...this film could have been so great! Le Carre novels are a full of wonderful characters and suspense, but the film did not deliver. I wish the director would have let your eyes rest from time to time, and allow the actors to tell deliver the story. I really wanted to find out more about what motivated these characters but the cinematography and plodding script took over to sink it. The actors were all great, when I could focus on them, but the constant camera movement, poor exposure values and jerky quick cuts were more than my stomach could stand. I enjoy interesting camera effects which move the story along,and at first, I thought it was an creative way to handle the beginning of the film involving the flashback sequences, but this style of camera work took over all aspects of the film making it ultimately for me unwatchable. Literally! I had to close my eyes for about 30 minutes and to listen, hoping for the plot to take a step forward. After two hours of the spinning tea-cup ride and with no resolution in site, we left.If you are prone to motion sickness, beware! (I am not usually). Or see it in a big theater and sit way in the back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. LeCarre's cold war books were amazing. But since the end of the Cold War, the Soviet Bloc is not the only thing that failed. If this film has any similarity to his book...both are a waste of time. I recommend a Jim Carrey movie...or Eminem. The premise here, the relationship, the wife's plan are all cardboard. Then there is the stumbling pace of the film. Okay, I tried to suspend reality. The very pregnant wife is shown lovingly in several scenes, then in hospital her child is stillborn...and the characters barely mention it! They're busy talking about clues to the international mystery. COME ON. "Hotel Rwanda" is 50 times better if you want an Africa tale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was absolute rubbish. The cinematography was even worse. The movie was blurry, there was terrible depth of field in most of the shots, and the camera wasn't steady. It looked like it was filmed by some amateur holding a cheap home movie camera from the early 90's who had just drunk a pot of coffee. If this is what they call good photography now then I think I'll stop going to see movies. The colors were also screwed up. It looked like they had been intentionally altered after being shot to give it a more gritty look or some other lame reason. I couldn't watch it. I have to admit, I didn't sit through the whole thing. But this was the worse shot movie I've seen ever, without question. Not to mention Hollywood still can't over the fact that the war in Iraq happened.. it's time to move on people, it did happen. Quit whining about it and stuffing this crap your movies at any opportunity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>with apologies to "Crash", the best movie of 2005...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rather than offering the same contrived review that most people simply skim through, I am going to evaluate the movie based on several categories. Each category will be given a grade (A thru F) accordingly.Directing: Awhy: Fernando Meirelles (City of God) repeats in Oscar-worthy fashion. Without giving anything away, the structure of this movie is incredible. Cinematography: Awhy: Meirelles and Cesar Charlone combine a thrilling adventure with one of the most phenomenal displays of cinematography I've ever seen.Plot: B+why: while the first 3/4 of the movie are exhilarating as any, the last twenty-five or so minutes of the movie couldn't keep up the high suspense. Script: B+ why: the film takes place in London and Kenya and the script complies, and very well at that.Acting: Awhy: Ralph Fiennes is obvious the new Liam Neesom. Fiennes delivers a stellar performance and SHOULD be a top candidate for Best Actor in 2006. However, Rachel Weisz stole the show. I was amazed are her ability to maintain the emotion and power throughout. Wow.Editing: Awhy: editing was on par with directing and cinematography - maybe even above it. The editing and mish-moshing of scenes was AMAZING and ranks among the top 10 I've ever seen.Music: A-why: the original score fit the movie. not much else to say about that.Overall Grade: Aa touching, exciting film shot with such beautiful creativity that it'd be a shame if people ignored it. it's movies like this that will be remember through time, not the horrid garbage the mainstream public wastes their $10 per ticket on. SEE THIS MOVIE, YOU WILL ENJOY IT.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>CONSTANCY Inevitably Unearths the Truth!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...........................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA.....and ORLANDO, FL The Constant Gardener shines with great intensity, but in a way that is rather subtle, somewhat occult, just beneath the surface. It's the kind of "Thriller" where more often than not, a silent expression or a nervous pause communicates more than a hundred words of dialog! Directed with panache, intrigue and passion in both scope and focus by Brazilian Fernando Meirelles (City of God), has created a tale of international dimensions.Based on the work of John le Carré, Gardener shows us the sinister side of pharmaceutical multinationals, where human life in Third World countries serves to supply perverse drug trials, in pursuit of even bigger record profits. Rachel Weisz (The Mummy, The Mummy Returns, Constantine) has been awarded a much-deserved Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress for her role as activist and wife. Also, Ms. Weisz most certainly deserved her Oscar win! The subtlety, complexity, originality and freshness of her portrayal are nothing short of amazing.Ralph Fiennes (The English Patient, Maid in Manhattan), despite giving one of the best performances of his life, curiously, did not even receive a Golden Globe nomination! Gardener demonstrates to us that often the reality of things is not what it seems at first glance. Justin Quayle (Fiennes) is a mid-level diplomat, who is tormented by persistent rumors and some strong indications of frequent infidelities by his activist wife.When she becomes the victim of a violent and gruesome murder, perhaps at the hands of her alleged African lover, Qualye senses something is askance and begins a methodical and patient investigation. To the extent that he gradually inches closer to the truth, threats and pressures to desist his inquiry increase exponentially! But as secrets of his late wife's life continue to be revealed, her image is vindicated completely; Mr. Quayle has become obsessed with arriving at the truth, regardless of the consequences. Also, Quayle, now quite repentant for having doubted his wife to the extent he did, now comes to realize that the most suitable place for him would have been beside the woman who loved him so much.Thusly, Gardener combines several diverse elements like suspense, political intrigue, romance, action, research and international outreach with masterful skill and powerful intensity....9*??ENJOY / DISFRUTELA! ]Any comments, questions or suggestions, in English o en Espa?ol are most welcome!......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Not such an effective thriller"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of the film concerns a couple. They work for the United Nations. The wife gets killed owing to blaming and finding evidences related to some illegal work going on in Africa. The film struggled all the time to keep up pace with one thing. As soon as the thrill of the film starts to build in present times, we are taken through flashback to the past when the wife was alive and working. The pace at these two times is not smooth owing to abruptness. The story itself is fine. As a matter of fact Countless stories have been formed concerning the drug and other illegal activities in Africa. All capture the same type of environment. The film comes from a director who gave us a master film like city of god. The effect of that film is heavily visible in the editing here. The fast pace alternated with the solidarity of the protagonist didn't seem to work as the emotions did not came out to a satisfying level. The camera work is eye catching. Introducing fast movements according to the mood and normal well established shots wherever necessary. The film also took a long time to establish the characters and till the half time it was engaged in establishing a great deal of sub plots. The approach and work with which the truth of the companies in the film was brought forward in the end, also seemed dull because the protagonist every 10 minutes was emotionally disturbed. The film could not eventually support so many things that it showed. And as such the thriller genre can't be justified. VERDICT: "Watch at your own risk."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>These days we often read of "raids" by some radical outlaw group on third-world settlements. The image we have must be abstract for most of us because we've never been through one or seen one on video. The most shocking scene in this film describes such a raid. It results in hasty flight, kidnapping, and death. It's terrifying.Ralph Fiennes is a minor diplomat whose wife, Rachel Weisz, disappears while doing some humanitarian work in Africa.The plot involves a corrupt pharmaceutical company, friends that can't be trusted, beatings by strangers, and ultimately murder -- not counting the murders of the African patients who died as a result of ineffective medicines. Weisz mostly appears in overlighted flashbacks, a beautiful woman with a splendid broad nose.Fiennes unravels the mystery, to his own disadvantage, but it's a complicated business with many characters, helpful and deceitful, worthy of John Le Carré.Fiennes is good, it seems, no matter what his role. He was a government contractor in "The Hurt Locker" and looked dangerous. Here, he's earnest, determined, and in the end resigned.Aside from the usual, lamentable habit of shaking the camera and editing the film into tiny bits, the director does a good job of capturing Kenya in all its third-worldliness. The litter-strewn streets of the towns; the bleak desolation of its outback. The photography is in high contrast and drained of some color, more in some scenes than others. No slow motion, thank God.The flashbacks to Fiennes and Weisz together are overexposed and the effect is that of walking out of a dark theater into blazing sunlight. When we're not in Africa, we're in one of London's impeccably appointed private clubs with lunches and ridiculous rules.Nice job overall.</fullReview>

But when evil company meet corrupt government and uncivilized people, things like in this movie could happen - well actually the movie is based on a novel that inspired by a real-life event. Anyway, I found the trusting issue between the couple is slightly more interesting than the political issue. It is subtle but deeper. Try to enjoy it, no matter what your political value is.

They don't use their brains, only their hearts...their bleeding hearts that is. They anger people when they should be involving them, and they use a hammer when they should be using surgery. They are so smug, that they are self-destructive and their brains left them ages ago.Well, this is the movie equivalent of these people.A female activist discovers wrongdoings in Africa by an all-powerful pharmaceutical company. She is killed (this happens at the beginning of the movie), and then, after some flashbacks coupled with investigations, her loving husband contracts her disease of bleedingheartitis and starts doing the same stupid things she was doing only worse.I hope the pharmaceutical companies work on a drug for bleedingheartitis because this movie would have me believe that it is contagious.What did his action at the end of movie even try to achieve? Just more meaningless, useless and brainless 'heroics'.The only things I liked about this movie are the landscapes, the acting, and the touching sequences where he discovers that many of his suspicions were unfounded, leading to belated mourning.Other than that, if you are going to make a leftist 'message' movie, then next time don't make it preachy, stupid and manipulative because you are only achieving the opposite effect. This movie even uses victimized children's faces with cute puppies to rally its cause!If you want to see a liberal movie about Africa done right, then watch Cry Freedom (although it covers a completely different topic: Apartheid).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thriller set in Africa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Constant Gardener is entertaining and intelligent thriller cum love story. The movie is set in modern Kenya, which is depicted as corrupt and AIDS infested. Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) is a shy middle ranking diplomat based at the British High Commission in Nairobi. He has a fiery and idealistic wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz) who takes an interest in the activities of a major pharmaceutical company carrying out trials of a new tuberculosis curing wonder drug. The company wants the product on the market quickly, and this requires the drug to be tested on unfortunate Africans. Tessa is brutally murdered and Justin begins an investigation into her death. It leads him into a murky world of corrupt Kenyans, dim-witted British diplomats and ruthless pharmaceutical executives.Tessa is rich, beautiful, outspoken and devotes her time to saving the world. She has a passion for involving herself in controversial issues and trying to help the less fortunate. In this story Kenyan government leaders are willing to exchange the lives of their citizens for cash in a Swiss bank account. However, it's hard to believe that Sir Bernard Pellegrin (Bill Nighy) a senior British diplomat in London is willing to participate in this conspiracy in order to win 1,500 pharmaceutical jobs for the Welsh. He confesses his sins in a memo to his subordinate Sandy Woodrow (Danny Huston) which seems barely credible in someone depicted as a worldly sophisticate. Le Carré belongs to a generation and class that views business people as crude and vicious oiks. In this film the drug companies are prepared to execute anyone who get in their way ? even the wealthy and well connected. Having worked for several cautious multi-national companies an expat hit-man on the payroll just seems ridiculous.Fiennes gives a tremendous performance as Justin, the mild-mannered and unambitious diplomat who turns into s tenacious sleuth. Weisz is a revelation as Tessa. She is required to play someone more complex than the typical movie heroine. Tessa is strident, obstinate, clever, vulnerable, sexy and fun. There are also great supporting contributions from Danny Huston and Bill Nighy. The cinematographer, César Charlone, shows an Africa full of colors and poverty.</fullReview>

Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes are superb as a husband a wife living in Africa. Justin Quayle (Fiennes) is an English Diplomat at the Kenyan Embassy and Tessa (Weisz) is his altruistic wife who stumbles upon a pharmaceutical cover up that is killing people by the dozens without care. As she begins to dig she pulls away from Justin who is being told to keep her on a leash. It is only after she is found dead that Justin begins to understand why she held him at arms length. He learns more about his wife and her willingness to give up her own life to save the lives of others. It is a look at Africa and the poverty and violence that is there. This movie will make you cry but you will love it and the message it conveys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched "The Constant Gardener" on PPV and thought that Rachel Weitz was the best thing in it. She was passionate and natural. Fiennes is not a favorite of mine - but was good enough.My main fault was the endless tracking shots of the poverty and filth with the crowded towns and hovels people lived in. Set the scene, for Gods sake, and get on with the story.That one looooooong shot after they first get to Africa was magnificent in setting the mood and driving the point home. But the director was not satisfied, and kept going over and over it, until I just didn't care any more.Hard hearted - maybe. But it is the directors business to know when enough is enough.The cast overall was very good and all the character actors did a fine job.

		<fullReview>For the devotees of this film, I'm sorry to say that this is one that didn't grab me. Maybe it was the disorienting flashback style, or the fact that characters in the film were often hard to understand when they spoke. I won't deny the stand out performances of Ralph Fiennes or Rachel Weisz, but there was something about their characters that didn't really translate into my caring about them as individuals. That was especially true after Tessa (Weisz) compromised herself with the creepy attaché Sandy Woodrow (Danny Houston). It made me feel like she trapped her husband Justin (Fiennes) in pretty much the same way to get a toehold into the 'exposing corruption' game. Again, it boils down to sympathy for the characters.The ending as well didn't ring true, as Justin calmly and unceremoniously awaits his fate in the African wilderness. Was the ordeal of uncovering the truth too much to bear, or did he simply take it as fact that a contract on his life would unavoidably succeed? For me, this is one thriller that didn't thrill even as intrigue mounted and plots were uncovered. Except for the skills of it's principals, this is one film I would find hard to recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspense thriller or social/political message?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is not a spoiler to say that the female protagonist Tessa Quayle (Rachel Weisz) dies because the audience sees this about 10 minutes into the movie. The main plot of the movie is her husband Justin's (Ralph Fiennes) investigation of her death, told in a simple linear fashion, mixed with flashbacks. If we consider the murder investigation to be the body of the movie, the soul is the tender love story of Tessa and Justin, told in the flashback as well as in the Justin we see after Tessa's death.Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles who shocked the world with "City of God" has gone essentially main stream with this adaptation of a John le Carre novel, but his signature camera work is still very evident - hand held camera, ingenious deployment of angels, challengingly disturbing colours, and so on. Despite the cutting edge filming, storytelling of the investigation is along very traditional lines of step-by-step tracking of clues from one person to another. The underlying subject of the conspiracy is chillingly close to reality of today, as the threat of global epidemic of tuberculosis in the movie may very well be a proxy of avian flu. The conspiracy of high government official and big business to benefit at the expense of the mass population is only too familiar a tale.It is the love story in "The Constant Gardener" that I find most affecting. To get the red herring out of the way first, it is interesting to note that the set up of a faked affair (on the part of the female protagonist) for higher purposes is strikingly similar to what we recently saw in "The Legend of Zorro", except for the markedly different degree of gravity. The love story of Tessa and Justin, told in not so many words (i.e. inches of film), is hauntingly, deeply touching. One particular scene, cutting back and forth between Justin's biting agony alone in his gloomy garden and his recollection of happy times with Tessa, shot in ethereal light, puts this movie in the company of love classics through the decades, such as "The Eddy Duchin Story". Crystallising Justin's emotions is a line written and heard probably many times over the years but still heart-wrenching when used at the right time and the right place. When advised to leave the danger of Africa and go home, Justin replies, "I have no home. Tessa is my home".Two other things warrant mentioning. Sprinkled all along the movie are interesting characters that are better done than those found in your average, run-of-the-mill suspense thrillers. Standing out is Bill Nighy, whose screen presence never fails, whether he is an over-the-hill rock singer, a thousand-year-old vampire, a science-fictional engineer or the wicked-to-the bone government high official in this movie. My personal favourite is the computer wiz kid (really a kid), impressive but surprisingly free of tedious exaggerations that you often see in similar roles. The other thing is that some people attach a lot of importance to the social/political "message" of mass exploitation. Personally, I am always sceptical as to whether a movie can do full justice to such grave and broad issues. I would therefore rather look at the exposition of social/political problems as a useful backdrop for a movie that is essentially a suspense thriller and a love story, rather than as an end itself.</fullReview>

The director's idea of 'artful film-making' is to show grainy footage of birds flying repeatedly. It's completely contrived and embarrassing. Worse, the plot is, without giving anything away, utterly ridiculous.

		<shortDescription>Hearts and minds: how the mind of a British writer is transformed by the eyes of a Brazilian</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is truly magnificent, a work of genius, one of the best I've ever seen. Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles, of "City of God" fame (unjustly passed over by this year's Oscar, but very justly voted by IMDb fans as one of the 100 best films ever) delivers a cinematic masterpiece that deserves a place even higher in the "One Hundred Best". This is how movies should be done, the fusion of mind and heart, of social conscience with sheer visual emotion, riveted into place with gorgeous acting. Pain and love, the quality of color, the jarring images, the breathtaking views of an Africa which is beautiful at a distance, as seen from above, but transmutes into overpopulation, disease, poverty, dejection, suffering, crime, corruption and horror when you really get down. Le Carré's novel is superb, as always (he is one of the Cold War spy book authors who actually survived to the end of the Evil Empire). But, my opinion is that he needed Meirelles to improve on his harrowing story: only a Brazilian director could do this. European and American eyes and minds couldn't just look into the social picture with the same feeling for detail and meaning as Meirelles has done (in the same style as COG, which, by the way, was haunting and shocking even to Brazilians, who are accustomed to the horrors of developing countries.)Congratulations to Meirelles, Fiennes, Weisz and all other members of the team who gave such a gift to all fans of movie picture quality. I hope Meirelles gets the Oscar now.</fullReview>

I missed this movie in the theaters, but on seeing the plot written, was quick to rent it when it reached the video stores, expecting a great movie. My wife and I both watched it to the end, and agreed we are glad we didn't waste our time in a theater. We did watch it through to the end and agreed it had no redeeming qualities. I rate it as one of the worst waste of time movies I have ever seen. The constant flash backs were indicative of poor directing and as a result greatly diminished the video effects. As far as I and my wife are concerned, this film has no redeeming qualities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is a fraud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate these unrealistic conspiracies. According to Hollywood/European liberals, corporations are the bad actors and terrorists are freedom fighters.In this movie the drug company is more powerful and evil than the Mafia and KGB combined, offing anybody who will expose them! They are killing people left and right worldwide and they think nobody notices? And there is no other evidence except a handwritten letter? Excuse me don't they have documents and email that can simply be supioned Please give me a break! And no white liberal is going to have her baby in such a filthy African native hospital just to make a point. The pacing is so slow I use it instead of a sleeping pill now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Average movie. It was a little too long. Unfortunately what I'll remember the most is the shaky camera! This kind of camera work was made famous on the TV show NYPD Blue. This movie takes it to the next level. My wife left the theater to puke but liked the plot enough to come back in.The relationship between Fiennes and Weisz kept the movie held together. There was always a feeling of betrayal but I wanted to believe that Weisz's character was truly honest. As much as I enjoy conspiracy theories I didn't bite on this one. I'm not saying that it isn't happening but it didn't intrigue me. I was a little turned off by the overly political slant but it was intricate to the plot.Overall it was strong performances and a story that kept my attention for most of the movie. My gut (pun intended) tells me this movie is a better rental. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece with exceptional performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It wasn't a nice film, but it was a masterpiece all the same. It lacked Hollywood glamour, which was a relief, and portrayed the agony and horror of its circumstances brilliantly. I didn't love it, and I can't say I enjoyed it, but I definitely respect it for being a very well done piece of art. It was haunting, heart-breaking, and intelligent, with a very strong script, tight dialogue, and brilliant cinematography. Seriously, the cinematography was incredible; creative and clever. It was suspenseful, but that only really picked up about halfway through. Still, there was always the hint of something not right, and plenty of unanswered questions to keep us guessing. Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz gave exceptional performances. Raw, honest acting, with Weisz proving she was definitely worthy of her resulting Oscar AND Golden Globe award. I'm a big fan of Rachel Wesiz anyway, but she was purely outstanding in this film. She portrayed an energetic, often annoying, but always passionate young woman, with much more to her than meets the eye. Overall, it was an intelligent, gut-wrenching thriller with a firm emotional core and lead actors who gave it their all. Very impressive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant film that finds beauty in sadness and triumphs greatly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually, I'm not super hot on adaptations of John Le Carré novels. His style tends to veer towards dense, impenetrable narratives that confuse and confound me, and are further frustrating because they have such wonderful casts and production value (I'm lookin at you, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy). The Constant Gardener, however, is a breathtaking story that I've enjoyed very much since I saw it in theatres at probably too young an age. It fashions a story that although is complex and refuses to be straightforward about what it's trying to say, contains essential beats and stunning performances from its actors. It's also set apart from other Le Carré yarns for having the most humanistic, compasionate core to its story, centering it's focus on the atrocities that humans can commit upon each other in mass, faceless fashion, and showing us the sparse, golden good deeds that a few kind people can put forth to counter such madness. An organic, emotional theme is nice compared to the clinical, detached style we usually see from this writer. The film is lucky in the sense that it has two deeply gifted leads: Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz, two actors who always resonate with a relatable human kinship in their work, and are both superb here. Fiennes plays Justin Quayle, a British ambassador in a god forsaken African region whose luminous wife Tessa (Weisz) is found dead in a remote area under suspicious circumstances. She was investigating several high profile pharmaceutical companies, under scrutiny for their sociopathic, amoral drug testing trials on the poverty stricken Africans. Intrigue strikes in after this, as shellshocked Justin pieces together what lead to her death, and how he can cripple those responsible using espionage and a level of keenness that's well above both his pay grade and mental constitution. Flashbacks abound as we see Justin and Tessa's early years unfold, adding all the more to the lumps in our throats as we know the ultimate outcome which the film frankly showed us in the opening frames. Welcome supporting turns come from other UK geniuses like Bill Nighy as an icy CEO, Richard McCabe as Fiennes's courageous brother in law, Danny Huston as a shady friend of Tessa's and Pete Postlethwaite as a mysterious doctor who figures later in the plot. Cienematographer César Charlone makes sweeping work of bringing the chaotic nature of Africa to life, it's people, landscape and aura beautifully rendered in shots that evoke the best of Monét and similar artists. Such beauty brought forth from a story filled with unpleasantness is interesting, almost a refusal to present the depressing story in any other fashion than to show us the virtue in tragedy, the cost of lost lives and unchecked corruption present for all to see and wince at, yet somewhat quelled by the undeniable forces of light also in play. Rachel and Ralph's work is an example of this; They are compassion incarnate, pools of hurt, determination and love for one another in the face of evil, unfair odds. They should both be very proud of their work here. Direct Fernando Meirelles has helmed Blindness and the classic City Of God, and as such is no stranger to infusing pain and sorrow with esoteric, positive qualities. He takes full advantage of the African setting, where suffering is commonplace and along with his entire troupe, throws all the lush, alluring kindness straight into the face of horror in an audacious stylistic set of choices which make The Constant Gardener one of the most achingly well constructed romantic and political thrillers of the decade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Constant Gardener (2005): Dir: Fernando Meirelles / Cast: Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Danny Huston, Bill Nighy, Hubert Kounde: Extraordinary thriller set in Africa about finding information. In this case, Ralph Fiennes must learn why his wife and her black lover were murdered. Plot mostly visualized through flashbacks with Fiennes and Rachel Weisz meeting leading to her infidelity and pregnancy. Central plot regards Fiennes searching for answers as to why she was murdered and the dangers he heads towards as her work in Africa becomes too focused. Very sad outcome concludes a detailed screenplay with director Fernando Meirelles giving vent to the hardships in Africa. Fiennes does a fantastic job as his crushed emotions give way to the willingness to complete his wife's work. Weisz is well cast as his wife whose mission was a secret to Fiennes although he comes to appreciate what he truly missed about her. Supporting roles seem more standard than anything. Danny Huston plays the British high commissioner on the scene, and Bill Nighy plays the head of the foreign office. Hubert Kounde plays a doctor first suspected of the murder he is found murdered. One can assume that this doesn't end well but the film is beautifully shot with strong themes regarding hardships of other cultures and carrying on what others began while burying damaged memories.

		<fullReview>Amidst the death of his wife, Justin Quayle(Ralph Fiennes) searches for answers to his wife's inconspicuous death. As he goes lurking in unknown territory for a detailed explanation, he realizes that his beloved wife was in an ordeal prior to her passing away with a multinational corporation.This epic movie focuses on the romance between two passionate individuals, and reveals the extent to which Western civilization exploits the people of nations that are in poverty. The Constant Gardener is an excellent film not only for its superb acting and gut-wrenching story, but because it manages to express such a deeply rooted message: that corruption is everywhere but it can be overcome.Society can learn a lot from this movie. People can as a mass or even individually accomplish great feats. Although The Constant Gardener is not based on a real story, it does contain many truths and revelations that actually happen regularly in the world today.I would recommend this film to any movie enthusiast since it balances romance and action in a manner that any viewer can relate with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fiennes,Weisz And Meirelles Elevates This Film Into A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Constant Gardener is a drama thriller directed by Fernando Meirelles. The film stars Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Hubert Koundé, Danny Huston and Bill Nighy.The screenplay by Jeffrey Caine is based on the John Le Carré novel of the same title.Justin Quale is a low-level British diplomat who has been given a new assignment in Kenya. Justin's wife, Tessa, is an activist with a keen interest in issues of poverty and social justice. Justin urges her to avoid getting too deeply involved in the people living in Kenya, who are constantly dogged by poverty, but she shows little interest in obeying these instructions. This isn't the only area where Tessa has disregarded her husband, who suspects that she may have had an affair as she started spending time with a handsome doctor once they settled in Kenya. One day, Tessa disappears, and is found brutally murdered; officials believe that she was murdered by the doctor after some sort of argument. However, before long Justin becomes convinced that there was a larger scheme that led to Tessa's death, and he begins digging into areas where he's not especially welcome, given his reputation as a man willing to let the wealthy and powerful do as they will.This movie is the kind of thriller that hasn't been seen since the 1970s: Smart, politically complex, cinematically adventurous, genuinely thrilling and even heartbreaking. Fernando Meirelles, the director, stresses old-fashioned storytelling and takes full advantage of his cast's brilliance particularly Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz,who show great chemistry they skillfully capture the engaging romance between Justin and Tessa as shifting back and forth in time.And on top of it all, the movie is visually stunning due to both its incredible shots of the African landscape which at times is haunting and unearthly and the gorgeous cinematography.It was definitely a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Constant Gardener is a film in two parts.Tessa Tessa (Rachel Weisz) is spunky, forward and aggressive. She is idealistic, resourceful and dogged. She is passionate, headstrong and pretty (in a non-moviestar way), and not above using anything at her disposal to get her way if she feels the end justifies the means.After a spirited and very public argument with a local politician Justin Quayle leads to a torrid but brief affair, Tessa learns Justin is to be posted in Africa and pleads for her to take her with him ? in any capacity.Shortly after they are married and in Africa (Kenya to be specific), with Tessa very pregnant and even more involved in a large number of activities, not all of them sanctioned or approved by the British Government.Tessa embraces the people of Africa and even while heavily pregnant ignores her own health while she moves easily among the poorer areas with her friend Arnold, himself a black Kenyan. Tessa ingratiates herself to all she comes across and integrates herself into what to outsiders is a barren and inhospitable land populated by the less fortunate ? and in many eyes less worthy. The only place where Tessa isn't comfortable is at the high society soirees run by the British Embassy, though Tessa is perfectly suited to intelligent discussions and polite discourse it is obvious that she is less than admiring of the true nature of many politicians and doubts the integrity of many sometimes very openly.Husband Justin is warned to more or less 'run Tessa on a tight leash', he is also reminded that certain parties have grown tired of Tessa's poking and prodding and would see to silence her. She is, as they say, a person of interest to those that you wouldn't want being interested in you.When Tessa is involved in a fatal 'car accident' that ends both her life and Arnold's everyone expresses great sympathy and remorse, the poor African people whose lives she touched meant it.Justin Justin on the other hand is unfailingly polite and civil, to the point that he is almost afraid to disagree or potentially cause friction with anyone. This very diplomacy perhaps makes him ill-suited to his role as a diplomat, given all the corruption and insincerity that surrounds him.Justin's life is about maintaining order ? he is the gardener of the title forever tinkering and maintaining the status quo ? the polar opposite to the whirlwind 'not happy unless she is moving things' Tessa.When Tessa dies Justin initially is told to let it go and move on by all including his best friend and colleague Sandy ? and initially he does so. But as with any unfinished business he has questions; Did Tessa love him or was she using him to achieve her goals? What WERE her goals and what was she doing when she was away? with Arnold? Was it an accident or did she really p*ss someone off? While I can't answer that here, it comes to light that Tessa was delving into the activities of both embassy staff and major pharmaceutical companies, Justin picks up the trail and continues to investigate, hoping that it might shed light on the real Tessa.As Justin's search leads him all over Kenya and also Europe he himself appears to become the dreaded 'person of interest'. I don't think I am giving anything away to say that he eventually learns the true nature of Tessa's research, and as always 'rich white guys' are behind everything. Rich, powerful, dangerous white guys with much on the line.The Constant Gardener demands constant vigilance, the plot moves forward regardless of whether you are ready or not and rapidly moves in directions you never imagined. But there is much reward for your attention and patience. There is precious little action or violence until the very end, but the film is never less than gripping. The cast is uniformly excellent and the smaller parts are filled with terrific actors including Bill Nighy and the late Pete Postlethwaite, Ralph Feinnes is superb as Justin Quayle and Rachel Weisz somehow luminous as the vibrant and magnetic Tessa.Anyone bemoaning the absence of quality drama from the big screen in recent years need look no further than The Constant Gardener.Final Rating ? 8.5 / 10. I am not ready to label it 'all-time' great, but it is a captivating film and richly rewards the viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Thriller, Decent Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following from the acclaimed City of God, director Fernando Meirelles' latest has been the subject of numerous nominations and a contender in several publications' top ten lists. Based on the John Le Carré novel, The Constant Gardener stars Rachel Weisz (The Mummy, About a Boy) and Ralph Fiennes (The English Patient) as a British couple becoming increasingly estranged on a visit to Northern Kenya. Beginning with the gruesome murder of Weisz' character, Tessa, the film is driven by a confused husband who begins to unravel both a corporate secret as well as mounting evidence of his wife's possible infidelities. This dual purpose sets forth an energetic thriller and is one of the best in conspiracy films. As with most suspense films of this type, there are numerous characters in the background, many of whom are complicit in the plot and others who are sympathetic to Fiennes' Justin Quayle. Set amidst the increasingly popular backdrop of poverty-stricken Africa, Meirelles' film is but one of many dealing with capitalist initiatives in third world countries.Visually, the monochromatic scenes help to set moods: despair, remembrance, and increasing helplessness. Making good use of the oft-dreaded shaky camera lends the film an interesting addition: the semblance of a documentary. The feeling is only there for short bursts, and especially scenes taking place in the African villages, where many look into the camera, staring into the eyes of Quayle and the viewer. Thankfully, the camera never becomes as nauseatingly bad as in 2004's thriller, The Bourne Supremacy. Where the film lacks focus is in keeping the viewer up-to-date with the various background figures. The Constant Gardener suffers from the horrible syndrome that is the "novel adaptation"; attempting to fit nearly 600 descriptive pages into a two-hour visual treat is nearly as hard as conveying wordless emotions in a novel. The various co-conspirators that likely had more development space in the novel are only briefly grazed over in the film, to the point where would-be shocking revelations may be lost on viewers who do not sport pristine memories. Of course, this is nothing a second viewing should not remedy ? a repeat trip worth taking.Apart from a few romantic stints no doubt stemming from his success in The English Patient, this marks Ralph Fiennes greatest role in years (though some may have recognized him as Lord Voldemort in Goblet of Fire underneath the hideous makeup). As the cool gardener who desperately loves his flight-risk wife, Fiennes plays admirably. However, the real star here may be in Rachel Weisz, who for a dead character finds a surprising amount of time in the limelight. Her secrets and intentions are expertly hidden beneath her bubbly exterior, and Weisz must be commended for keeping viewers in the dark. The Constant Gardener serves as both a good thriller as well as a critique on the role of pharmaceuticals and leading governments in third world countries. My only recommendation to those who watch this film would be to grab a feel-good one to watch immediately after, as the subject matter is obviously heavy. (8/10 Very Good)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine, very intelligent, with some faults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was longing to see this film, as a young member of the health care service, and to tell the truth, I was not surprised to see the lengths that pharmaceutical companies can go for their precious bucks; we, at hospitals, see their representatives and little games every day. However, not everybody knows what's going on, and this film does a good job putting question marks in people's heads about what may be going on behind the doors of the pharmaceutical "charity" business. And it does this very intelligently, and along with an identifiable love story. On the other hand, the film sometimes tries to take on too much, as in the scene where the hero and the doctor run away from the bandits to the plane. It tries to make all the possible points about Africa, when the pharmaceutical companies are burden enough. The scene was uncalled for, and unnecessary, in my opinion, like the two scenes where the hero gets help from 2 unexpected sources. Come on, it is really not quite logical that these people help him. But I wouldn't want to discourage anyone from seeing this film. It really is a good and thought-provoking film which just could have been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Required my constant attention</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie nicely intertwines a love story with an intricately plotted drama about corruption in the pharmaceutical industry. The love story concerns Justin (a representative for aid effectiveness in the British Foreign Office) and Tess (a hotheaded activist of the highest order). While Justin is happy tending his plants Tess is getting heavily involved in investigating treachery that involves the big pharma company KDH, the drug testing company ThreeBees, the Kenyan Health Ministry, and the British Foreign Office. At the heart of the scandal is the fact that ThreeBees is using Kenyan AIDS patients to test a new TB drug and is covering up the multiple deaths from side effects. If someone dies due to adverse reactions, that doesn't matter since they are going to die in any case and, by the time the drug hits the market, it can be modified to minimize the number of adverse effects. That is the rationale anyway. And the governments have their own reasons for behaving badly. Of course all is driven by greed.I have little doubt that whenever there is as big a pot of money at stake as in the pharmaceutical industry you are going to have some shady goings on. My eyes were opened in a very personal way when the brand-name drug I was taking went generic and the price went from $13 per pill, to $0.53 - almost a factor of 25. And you know some high-level lobbying is going on when the drug companies lobbied the U.S. government to prevent it from bargaining for prices on the senior drug benefit. However, my cynicism about the drug companies does not extend to encompass believing in their sending out death squads to quiet their detractors, as is presented here. I hope I am not wrong on that.A good part of the movie takes place in (and is filmed in) Kibera, a slum in Nairobi that is home to about 700,000 people. Filming on location in Africa adds much - we see ill-equipped health care facilities, poverty, crowding, food shortages, AIDS, and a frightening Janjaweed raid in Sudan. But there is an energy and beauty to be had among the people (there is an extended sequence in the deleted scenes on the DVD that has a guy on a bicycle riding to work that is just wonderful). There are beautiful landscapes, beautifully filmed. Africans seem to have music in their souls and the soundtrack capitalizes on this. Africa - so much potential, so much beauty, so much sadness.The story requires close attention - if you look away for more than a few seconds you are likely to lose crucial information. Director Meirelles, using the same skills and non-linear techniques on display in his "City of God," is able to weave the fragments of this story together into a satisfying whole. I particularly liked how the overarching unraveling of the pharmaceutical scandal parallels Justin's ferreting out the details of his wife's murder.Some may object to the extreme polemical quality and cynicism of this movie, but I think many will react by feeling compelled to make an extra contribution to Doctors Without Borders.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Constant Gardener" is a movie which lingers, the passionate work of Meirelles (who performed a very interesting work in "Cidade de Deus") achieves the viewer's empathy, yes. But the bitter images bump on us so fragile, that this cruel reality in which social density opens conflicts makes us feel changed, more human and more aware of what happens on the other side of the globe. The romantic story is also an important gear to fuel the story; the love of Justin to Tessa convinces him of continuing with her researches. He was faithful to her while she lived, and he will still be while she is dead. He is such a well-done character; personification has never struck so good. Both Rachel and Ralph make an incredible retro-feeding couple; applaud them. Meirelles captures Africa with cameras that a re quick; intelligent, stunning. The cinematography tries to make the audience feel as themselves are on the journey in the African open land; it is also set as a documentary style. The action is not so vast, but the film relies on the power to make the quest a quest for reasons that are far away from diplomacy or heroism. It is also about love. The conceptual ideas are very well developed, mainly thanks to the narrative power of the script and the fluency that John Le Carr? thrown in his book. The light flight of the birds, the open savannahs of the Nairobi desert, the warm hearts of the kids that are living in awful conditions: all elements that reach the audience, that puts them on the spot to think. Very personal film; open to receive the viewer and calm him with sad images, with riveting stories, with the human flare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful but flawed thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, as with all adaptations, deserves and requires two reviews. One for its innate quality, and one for the quality of its adaptation.As to its innate quality - it is a reasonably-crafted film, with intuitive and sensitive direction and good performances all round. That is all, really; too many characters feel a little rushed and two-dimensional.Take, for instance, Donohue. An intriguing character ends up saying he is changing his ways as he's about to die of cancer. Or how about Lorbeer; a character written as a plot point, so lifeless that an enthusiastic performance by Pete Postlethwaite falls flat."Rafe" Fiennes and Rachael Weisz give beautiful lead performances, especially Fiennes, and they have strong support from Danny Huston and Richard McCabe. The aforementioned scripting issues foil other promising performances.So it is a reasonable thriller, sensitive and intelligent. But it is not all it could be - in part due to a shoddy adaptation.The screenplay skilfully contracts some sequences not conducive to the movie format (Ham's legal background provides a shady passport instead of betrayed detectives; his son Guido replaces another Guido far away on Elba; and most impressively, THAT epistle), but completely fluffs up one of the two foundations of the book - an ensemble of three-dimensional characters.Take, for instance, Donohue. During a row with Kenny K, his inner monologue recalls his wife and he helping a starter football league in the slums; and how he reflected now that he wished he'd done more of that, and less of what he does. That is easily transposed in place of the cancer drivel, and builds up the old spook as a wild bundle of emotions and memories and dreams (as we all are) rather than a desperate cipher.Whilst Justin's Odyseyy does encompass four countries, the excision of its Canadian leg removes one of the keys to the character of Lorbeer; and without that strong, believable character, the key confrontation loses a lot of its energy.There is no need to continue comparing the book and the film; but given the material, and the number of mistakes made with characters, where a more faithful adaptation might have been in order, one cannot help but feel a little disappointed, on both of the reviewing criteria.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In many respects this is a movie about the perception that big business will go through much to hide problems so as not to jeopardize profits. The business here is pharmaceuticals, and involves trials in Africa of a new drug that is designed to treat TB. It is being administered along with treatments for AIDs. Is it mostly fiction, or is it closer to fact, with the names changed? But the movie starts with Justin Quayle (Ralph Finnes), an employee of the British government, reading a lecture because the intended lecturer couldn't be there. After, a young woman Tessa (Rachel Weisz) stands up and in a challenging way asks lots of questions, embedded with accusations. Naturally Justin couldn't answer all of them but kindly offered to buy her coffee. They instead end up at her apartment and very quickly, without their knowing much about each other, get married and are off to Africa where he normally works.It is not a spoiler to reveal that near the beginning of the movie Tessa is found dead near the side of the road in a vehicle, apparently murdered. So most of the movie is shown as various flashbacks. Tessa and Justin, in spite of their brief courting, seemed to be made for each other, in love, opposite personalities. He was the unassuming British employee, often seen taking care of his plants, while she was full of fire, willing to do anything to help the sick of Africa and expose what she viewed as mismanagement or downright illegal activities. So most of the movie is Justin dealing with Tessa's death and trying to put all the pieces of the mystery together.SPOILERS FOLLOW. The drug trials in fact were killing an unexpected large number of subjects, and that fact was being hidden. British officials and pharmaceutical officials were conspiring. Tessa was on the verge of exposing that and she was killed on orders from the British. A friend back in London had set up a "mirror" site for her web and email activity so, even though all her notes and computers were confiscated, in the hopes of thwarting the investigation, the "mirror" site provided correspondence and clues that allowed Justin to get "justice." In the process he realized what Tessa stood for and he became changed as a result, with a better focus to help others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Certainly NOT an Oscar performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are few plots as mouth watering for authors - and movie directors - as attacking the seemingly faceless and pitiless cruelty of big business. Recent examples such as, Enron - The Smartest Guys in the Room, Syriana and The Constant Gardner give ample testimony to this trend. This is no bad thing - particularly when handled as deftly as it has been in The Constant Gardner with the pen of someone as talented as John Le Carre. But, alas, I refer only to the book rather that the silver screen version. What a disappointment then it was to sit through what was, in my opinion, a wooden, characterless and totally unbelievable performance from Rachael Weisz which effectively torpedoed what otherwise could have been a truly memorable movie experience. The basic story line as developed by Le Carre is paid due homage but there, sadly, the similarity ends. The development of Tess' character in the movie was left as vacant as the Kenyan plains themselves and she appeared to drift through the movie as if it were an afternoon walk in the park. Her performance almost matched that of the truly awful Julia Roberts in Michael Collins which had most Irish cinema-goers cringing in their seats with ethnic embarrassment. The credibility of the Ham character (played by Richard McCabe) was also found wanting in that he never convinced us as a "hot shot" lawyer who wore his heart on his sleeve. Hats off though to Ralph Fiennes who, as usual, gave an outstanding performance and in reality saved this movie from an otherwise dismal showing. For Fernando Meirelles this had to be a low point after the wonderful City of God. Hopefully we can expect an upward swing in the curve in the not too distant future</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Long!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie could have been a great movie because the story (plot) is fantastic. However, the way the movie is directed and told is terrible. The movie keeps going back and forth, emphasizing too many love scenes, locations and even birds flying, rather than getting to the meat of the story!!! I think sometimes the "professional" reviewers give movies such high ratings, that they build up your expectations. When you finally see the movie, it is a disappointment. I was recently told that movie distributors did not want to show the new movie from Andy Garcia because it was too long. WELL, this movie is just as long and it's more boring than Andy's movie!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the three or four best directed films of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's something of an amazement to see a film like The Constant Gardener, because the filmmaker, Ferandno Meirelles, seems to be much ahead of the subject matter (and I mean this as a compliment). The story, context(s), and characters of John Le Carre's novel are interesting and (for the most part when not a little convoluted) involving, but it's the style that carried the film into uncharted territory. Like with City of God, Meirelles shows himself to be a director of immense urgency and documentary bravura sensibilities with the mis en scene. With equal credit to his cinematographer Cesar Charlone (also DP for City of God) and editor Claire Simpson, he carves the story into a landscape of African poverty, of desperation, (especially) paranoia, and a knowledge and usage of different lenses, filters, lights, and a knack with hand-held that is at times exhausting. If this were just a full-on documentary on pharmaceutical conspiracy in Kenya and Nairobi and such, with the same style, it might be my favorite film of the year. As it is, it's almost as if at times the story gets in the way. But thankfully, the substance at times tries its best to catch up with its director.Ralph Fiennes and particularly Rachel Weisz are very good in the film as Justin and Tessa, a diplomat and his wife, who in Africa witness some minor atrocities going on with the health-care system (more accurately, the lack thereof). She tries to do something about it, with her own sense of purpose, and gets killed. This then sets off Justin on his sort of un-checked 'quest' to find out what is behind all of this. So, alongside this sort of mystery/thriller in the Le Carre sense (I can recognize a certain narrative style as well from the Tailor of Panama, another of his works), with the Government right on our protagonist's tail, Meirelles keeps up this frenetic, powerhouse kind of style going. What it arguably could lack in the personal connection that was fully blazed in City of God is made up for with a kind of subjective connection with the locals of these villages, the tribes, the customs. Many of the best scenes of the film are when the plot takes a rest and we see these people and what they do (there's a little stage play about the danger of AIDS, or when cooks prepare for the upper-classes dinner, or when rebels come down to attack a tribe on the outskirts).I've seen the film twice now, which I think was really the only way to go about it before writing any kind of assessment of the film. The first time I wasn't entirely sure on the story, of certain things that were going on with the whole pharmaceutical conspiracy, and I kept getting diverted by all the images and the pacing of it. The second time around it was still the same, though with a somewhat better grasp on the story, and a lot more attention on the visuals. As well, I got to be even more comfortable with Justin and Tessa, who I thought on the first go around were slightly two-dimensional (in reality, they really aren't). In the end, it was the filmmaker and the trust that he has put into his crew and to his actors (many of the excellent character types like Bill Nighy and Pete Postlethwaite) that reeled me in. Even when something with the plot flew over my head, the film kept going along, and I really didn't mind at all. It's a filmmaker like this, who has given a one-two punch over the past couple of years, that reminds me why I love going to the movies. I'm not even sure if the Constant Gardener will or won't end up in my top ten list of 2005, but I wouldn't be surprised if he got another Oscar nomination for his work here (Charlone too).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw the movie tonight at a local film fest and it was packed. I really enjoyed the scenery and the truly local scenes as it made it more true to life and plausible. Ralph Fiennes is becoming one of my favorite actors and he picks such good movies and is so well suited to the role of the mild mannered British Diplomat Justin. I look forward to seeing more of Rachel Wiez also and she is definitely the fiery activist lawyer, Tessa. It also helped that I had read the book and knew about the storyline and the film followed it really well. We need more intelligent films talking about the reality of the world we live in and stories about what is happening in Africa right now and the possibility that pharmaceutical companies are doing things like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A watchable disappointment. This film is slow, but I like plot development, so that didn't bother me much; however, the frequent extended flashbacks became jarring and annoying. The premise was weak too. First, I believe that large drug and medical device companies are in the business of making money, not saving or improving lives--that's just how they make their money. Second, executives reach the top due to ambition, aggression, manipulation, and supreme but generally unjustified self-confidence, not because they're the most competent, most accomplished, or the best and most visionary leaders. But still, they are narcissistic and greedy, not truly evil or completely stupid. Given those two realities, the level of malfeasance in this movie is just too unrealistic for anything more than a James Bond flick. Assuming the initial conspiracy and cover-up depicted in this film succeeded, the absolutely inevitable, intense, in-depth investigation of this literally fatally-flawed product that would have followed after it's widespread distribution and concomitant deaths would inevitably have brought the entire shaky house of cards down. The very self-interested C-suite execs might not be the geniuses they think they are, but they would definitely foresee the criminal, not just civil, prosecutions that they themselves would eventually be facing. They simply wouldn't be this blatantly, transparently, and unquestionably evil with absolutely no plausible explanations or excuses to hide behind. Not to mention, once the problems started showing up, the company's net worth would have been vaporized along with their compensation. (A lot less severe problem than this nearly did in Merck.) While I guess it's still possible that high-functioning sociopaths might risk the monetary loss, the near certainty of a cold, hard, jail cell is another thing entirely. So you've got a slow, long, disjointed, nonlinear movie built around an unrealistic premise, but, on the other hand, the cinematography and acting are both very good and the film is emotionally powerful (actually too maudlin). Might be good to watch with your girlfriend though--it'll show how sensitive you are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Constant Gardener (2005) Ralph Fiennes plays the unassuming, quiet diplomat that falls in love with a beautiful activist. (Rachel Weiss) She seduces him and ends up in Africa with him to do Amnesty work. This woman is a die hard activist who doesn't care about who she is up against or what the consequence is as long as she has the power and ability to do her work and let the truth that she has discovered be known. She cannot and will not desist because she wants to save people. This movie is heart wrenching and the soundtrack breathtaking. It doesn't matter that it isn't a true story because in any news story on TV, if you read between the lines, the same things are happening all over the world. Justin (Fiennes) embarks on a journey that is as passionate as his wife is fierce. He gets to a point where he knows there is no going back and he is so dignified and soft in his demeanor and behavior even after all that he has seen and done that it allows you to watch and feel the sweet homage that he pays to his wife. An excellent cast all around, excellent script based on a novel by the same title and an excellent source for thought and evaluation.</fullReview>

And indeed, he was.I won't discuss the plot at all--any viewer should discover it as it unfolds, as I did. I am glad I did not know much more than the basic theme. The story was told flawlessly--without cutting corners, without easy shortcuts. This film could not have been made on a studio back lot--it had to be filmed on location, as indeed it was. Among its many other graces, the acting was superb from everyone. Rachel Weisz won a deserved Oscar for her performance, but I thought that Ralph Fiennes was just as good.

		<shortDescription>To Do the Right Thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "constant gardener" of the film's title is Justin Quayle, a British diplomat based in Kenya, whose hobby is gardening. Early in the film he learns that his young wife Tessa has been found murdered along with her Kenyan driver. The film has a quite complicated structure, looking both backwards and forwards from this initial point. A series of flashbacks looks back at the history of their marriage and Tessa's actions leading up to her murder. The film also moves forwards, however, as it also follows what happens to Justin after her death. In the flashbacks, we learn that Justin and Tessa are very different in personality. He is quiet and shy, a conformist Establishment figure, a diplomat by nature as well as by profession. She is completely undiplomatic, an outspoken humanitarian and left-wing political activist. This contrast in their personalities recalled a similar married couple in "Plenty", a film from the 1980s which also dealt with a British diplomat married to an outspoken wife whose activities caused him difficulties in his career. "The Constant Gardener", however, deals with its theme in a quite different way to "Plenty" in which the wife, played in that film by Meryl Streep, took a much more prominent role than her husband. Here Justin, originally self-effacing, emerges as a major character as he attempts to uncover the truth about what really happened to Tessa. It is gradually revealed that she was trying to uncover the truth about unethical drug tests being carried out by a multi-national pharmaceutical company, using local people as guinea-pigs. The film was based on a John le Carré novel, which in turn was based on a real-life scandal in Nigeria. Justin continues with his investigations, even though his superiors would much prefer him to drop the matter, and even though he realises that he may himself be in danger. (Le Carré may have intended the Christian name Justin, with its overtones of "just" and "justice", to have symbolic significance). The ruthless company executives are quite prepared to commit murder in order to protect their guilty secrets. In form the film is a thriller based around that tried-and-trusted plot, the one about the courageous individual out to expose misconduct by powerful corporate interests. (The film's leading lady Rachel Weisz had earlier starred in another thriller of this type, "Chain Reaction"). Some such films remain on the action-thriller level, and I think this is true of "Chain Reaction", although it is a reasonably good example of that particular genre. Others, however, such as "Erin Brockovich", manage to rise above that level and take on a greater significance, and I think that "The Constant Gardener" falls into this latter category. The main reason for this is the quality of the acting. There is a good contribution from Bill Nighy as Sir Bernard Pellegrin, Justin's hypocritical, self-serving superior, but the main burden falls upon the two leading actors. This was the film which won Weisz her "Best Supporting Actress" Oscar. I would not quarrel with that award, except to say that as Tessa is a leading role she should really have been nominated for "Best Actress" instead. I would, however, quarrel with the Academy for not even nominating Ralph Fiennes for "Best Actor". Many of Fiennes's most memorable performances have come in villainous or unsympathetic roles, most notably as Amon Goeth in "Schindler's List", but also as Lord Voldemort in the "Harry Potter" series, as Eugene Onegin, as Francis Dolarhyde in "Red Dragon" and as the cold and emotionless Duke in "The Duchess". "The Constant Gardener", however, gave him the chance that he can be equally effective in playing a heroic character. As portrayed by Weisz and Fiennes, Tessa and Justin cease to be merely characters in a drama and become figures of courage and integrity, people who are prepared to sacrifice their own interests, and to put their own safety at risk, in their willingness to do what is right. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is another elaborately plotted mystery story from John LeCarre, who wrote elaborately plotted mystery stories. It is a little too long and the labyrinthine plot almost defies understanding. The saving grace is the impeccable acting of all concerned, especially Rachel Weisz and Danny Huston, a very unheralded and underrated actor. Ralph Fiennes is his usual competent self.It is set in Africa amidst grinding poverty and desolate African wilderness. In a nutshell (tall order, but I'll try), Fiennes is almost a bystander as a land cultivation expert who meets ass-pain activist Weisz at a symposium. She is teed off about a multi-national pharmaceutical company taking advantage of Africans with an inferior drug used to combat Aids and TB. They marry, and he is caught in the vortex of the plot as she is murdered, presumably for her activism.OK. That's enough plot, which becomes more involved by the minute. It is largely a trudge across Africa in search of clues but the picture is also a love story, and a tender one at that, between Fiennes and Weisz. This was a four-watch movie, meaning I looked at my watch four times along the way. I don't know why LeCarre's stories have to be so intricate, but they are a tough read and even tougher on screen - in books, you can flip backwards and pick up the loose threads of the plot, but at the movies you can only hope you are up to speed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Changes up the thriller genre with romance and beautiful visuals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Constant Gardener" is a rare romantic thriller, where a love story is actually the driving force behind the plot, which in this case is trying to crack open a giant corporate cover-up. It's not the most sure-handed vehicle for a genre generally riddled with twists and turns and a mystery to be solved, but it definitely offers something different for film-lovers' tastes.Directed by Fernando Meirelles, the man behind the stunning visual drama "City of God," "Gardener" is a mixture of passion and mystery that is brought to life in only a way Meirelles can. His use of light and the way he weaves the film's critical flashbacks in with the present are a golden example of incorporating flashbacks. In the film, British diplomat Justin Quayle (Fiennes) learns that his wife, Tessa (Weisz) was murdered in Kenya. As he seeks answers, we are bombarded with memories of how he and Tessa met and are even let in to some flashbacks that are not part of Justin's memory so that we can begin to understand why this happened to her. As the film progresses, we see that Tessa was on to a giant cover-up by a major pharmaceutical corporation testing a TB drug on Africans.Fiennes and Weisz give equally strong performances. Perhaps mature is the best way to describe both of their careers and their acting styles and it certainly rings true in "Gardener." Weisz in particular continues to remain one of the most underrated in actresses working today. She excellently pulls off the challenge of Tessa, a woman madly in love with her husband but aggressively passionate about certain things enough to the point that she must hide them from him.Unfortunately, Justin's pursuit of the truth and finishing the job Tessa started doesn't always stay the film's focal point. A large amount of time is dedicated to poverty and Kenya and their medical issues. The film is educational from this standpoint, but it doesn't exactly motivate or intrigue. If the film could focus more on eliciting sympathy for Africans, the emotional impact of Tessa's work would be felt, but because the film has to develop the love story, there just isn't time to feel like the serious issue-side of the plot matters equally. In ways, "Gardener" tries to do too much, but it still comes across as beautifully made."Gardener" is a film with a visionary at the helm and two great actors who challenge the genre and make a film that is visually bold and eye-opening. As far as sheer entertainment is concerned, it's not something for mainstream tastes, and its many facets prevent it from leaving a lasting affect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Besides the already known criminal plagues that affect our "civilized" world such as women and children traffic, drug trafficking, arms trafficking, the children-soldiers, the domestic violence, etc. it failed to draw our attention to another one: the experiment of new not fully tested medicines on poor Africans making them real guinea pigs, without any control about collateral effects which very often are lethal, taking advantage for that of the collaboration of corrupt local authorities. This is done under the fever of competence among laboratories and pharmaceutical enterprises to be the first to be able to introduce the new medicines in the markets of the First World which means that the first to do it earns millions though at the cost of many lives. The multinationals involved don't hesitate in bribing those who can help and even ordering that those who oppose it be killed. This movie is about all that. It's the story of a courageous young woman that decides to investigate those practices and ends by being murdered by thugs hired by a powerful lab enterprise when she gets near the truth. Her husband is a British diplomat in Kenya where most of the action takes place, who ignored everything about his wife's activities because she always wanted to protect him and his career. Besides the beautiful and moving love story the movie also narrates, we have afterwards the story of the husband who initiates an also courageous investigation about his wife's murder which turns him into a chased man too. Cut is well done with short sequences and many moving sentimental flashbacks where they are needed to bring back the memories of a love so violently destroyed. This story is well told except for the little flaw of the fact that we never know how the thugs hired by the multinationals always finish by finding our man in the various places he goes secretly to in several parts of Europe and Africa. But this is a minor flaw and we may presume that for that purpose those criminals must surely have had him always under track with the means and tentacles those organizations have everywhere although this is not shown in detail in the movie. This is a movie worth to be seen moreover with the permanent tension in which it develops itself, keeping always alive the viewer's interest and adherence.</fullReview>

The theme of corrupt pharmaceutical gigantic companies that test their medicines on poor Kenyan people is very fresh and really very serious. That is really worth the watch... And then, this is not a sweetish Hollywood happy end type of a film. No, that is far from that. There are too many dead people here, so much of serious and even grave matter to ponder on, that this is a film for those to like to think and really enjoy good movies...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Believe it or not, this was the first film I watched completely on video (17" monitor). I couldn't have picked a better choice. I was surprised, though, that the long-and mid-range shots came across better than closeups. The one scene in the film I found unconvincing was Justin's confrontation with Sandy in the garden. It looked stagy.I had read LeCarre's book so was alert for the portrayal of the diplomatic community, which turned out to be one of the strengths of the film. Seems as if British spy novelists delight in showing their government as corrupt and bowing to special interests. I'm not objecting.As I don't watch TV, I became much more interested in Africa after seeing The Constant Gardener, not only for its portrayal of the people in the desert and Kenyan towns but also for the view of middle-class and upper-class Mexicans. Now I won't skip over news of Africa.I thought the script and direction were true to the spirit of the novel. Seemed to me the end scene where Justin is sitting by the lake reflected his grieving as well as, perhaps, his sense that he too would not escape. Ralph Fiennes was acting every minute, I know because I watched some scenes several times.One other comment, I am from the US but saw this film in the original English with Spanish subtitles and was very aware how differently Americans and Brits speak.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing collaboration of Le Carre, Meirelles, Fiennes and Weisz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to rent out this movie because I was interested about drug companies in Africa and 2 of greatest actors, Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz. I knew Ralph Fiennes would always be good in romantic tragedies. But this film was so much more than that.It is such a painful, emotional film. It forces you to face the other side of real world that is neatly covered from our eyes. Justin, the British diplomat is a quiet guy, content in his life in Nairobi, surrounded by greens that he takes care of, and the beautiful young wife Tessa.But everything changes when Tessa was found murdered near Lake Turkana. Justin starts walking into her life that he had been avoiding, and starts finding out about what a drug company "Three Bees" was doing in Africa.I was emotionally moved by the scenes showing the slum in Nairobi (just outside is a golf course with beautifully trimmed green), local hospital where Tessa gives birth, the village in the dessert which is later attacked by a raid by horsemen, and painfully beautiful Lake Turkana... I see that these impressive shots are largely due to the talent of the Brazilian director, Fernando Meirelles. I haven't watched "City of God", but this film makes me want to do so! Both Fiennes and Weisz are showing believable, strong performance. Fiennes shows changes of Justin from gentle, dull character into man of conviction for his love for Tessa. Weisz is depicting Tessa as passionate, extreme character but with motherly love. (She is exposing her nudity in her full months of pregnancy, and this is actually adding depth to the character.) Now the story. Both original story as well as the script were written by John Le Carre, the famous spy story writer. Both story and characters were very well developed and has impact and depth. In the early part of the movie, Justin tries to stop Tessa when she wanted to offer a ride to a boy, saying they could not do the same to thousands other. Toward the end, Justin tries to do the same. This is when we, the viewer starts sharing the sorrow that we cannot offer help to everybody who needs help, even when there is 1 person in front of us who we might be able to help.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The insider", "Traffic", "Syriana"... they're all movies that denounce some of the biggest injustices of our world using the means of Hollywood studios. "The constant Gardener" has a similar style, there's drama and there's intrigue, and this time the "pigs" are the pharmaceutical corporations (the biggest genocide of our time). Fernando Meirelles probed many years ago that he's a great director (remember "Ciudad de Dios"); but for "The constant gardener" he needed something else. He needed to deal with biog budgets and with some stars... and he got through without any problems. Raplpsh Fiennes and Miss Weisz make an awesome job, there's real chemistry between them. This movie it's gonna become a referent of 2000's cinema. *My rate: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Romantic drama. Justin Quayle(Ralph Fiennes)is a low-level British diplomat who has been given an assignment in Kenya. Justin's wife Tessa(Rachel Weisz)is a zealous activist that is dedicated and passionate in her attempts at exposing a major pharmaceutical company carrying out tests on helpless women in Kenya. Her activities are embarrassing certain members of the British High Commission,which wants her husband to pull in the reins. When she is found brutally murdered, Justin will not be stopped until he can prove his wife's secret and who had her killed in order to keep it. Beautiful photography of a not so beautiful landscape. Well written and suspenseful. Others in the cast: Danny Huston, Bill Nighy, Hubert Kounde, Donald Sumpter and Pete Postlethwaite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the question of why has been set right at the beginning, if you are prepared to allow the slow but steady build up for the next quarter of an hour, the intrigue will draw you in. Bear through the flashback sequences between Justin and Tessa and you have a pleasant but steady paced film. Don't expect a lot of action here as it's one of those films where you're supposed to think about what goes on elsewhere in the world. Basically we have the morals of the individuals against those of politics and business. Can you really expect to win against them at the end of the day?

It's a great and compelling screenplay, based on one of John Le Carrés bestsellers.Both Fiennes and Weisz give a remarkable performance, as do the rest of the cast as a matter of fact... The director (whom i had never heard of before) tells this story of love &amp; betrayal, humanity &amp; inhumanity, but also death &amp; deceit, with an unbelievable accuracy. I haven't got a clue as to whether the story in one way or another is based on facts, but while you're watching the plot reveal itself, you will start to believe that this is the way modern colonization is taking place.If you like a slow-unfolding mystery-plot, stunningly beautiful cinematography and a very realistic plot, check this one out.

		<shortDescription>Intelligent, thought provoking, and complex thriller with perfect acting and directing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I must say that this is not a film for the easily lost or bored. This is a political/psychological thriller, meaning there's lots of thinking and not a ton of action. The Constant Gardener is a complex and gripping adaptation of John Le Carre's novel of the same name, and it manages to keep you drawn in throughout its running time because of the phenomenal acting, beautiful cinematography, and brilliant direction. However, it does drag a little bit at times and can get a tad boring, and if you don't pay full attention, you might miss something. The end does leave a bit more to be desired.Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes; Schindler's List, Harry Potter 4) has just lost his wife, Tessa Quayle (Rachel Weisz; The Mummy, The Fountain), who appears to have been murdered. After discovering that she was trying to change things around the world, making enemies along the way, Justin must deduce who killed his wife and why.Now, first off, I must commend the actors. This is one of the top five acted films of 2005 (Only Crash had better performances). Ralph Fiennes gives us easily the best character of the year in Justin Quayle. It is a spellbinding, real, and touching performance of self-discovery and unwavering dedication to his goal. He is by far the best actor for the part, and what amazes me the most is that he didn't get an Oscar nomination out of this. I would have substituted him with David Strathairn or Heath Ledger any day of the week. Justin is a deep and complex character that is quite the example of acting from Ralph Fiennes. Any student of acting should study this performance. Just as good, if not better than Fiennes is Rachel Weisz in a Oscar winning performance as Tessa Quayle. Her character is just as good as Justin, as Weisz transforms Tessa throughout the entire movie through flashbacks and how other people talk about her. She is very mysterious, and it is her performances that is the foundation of the film. She is touching, lovable, and at the same time, very interesting and mysterious to the point where you don't know what she is really about until the end of the film. In a nice supporting role is Bill Nighy (Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest), and he once again turns in a great performance in limited screen time.Fernando Meirelles (City of God) is one of my favorite directors for this reason: he makes you think. You'll be thinking about this film for a long time after you see it, not to mention your mind will be racing during the time you watch it. Meirelles is near perfect in the film. His shots are beautiful, yet so real, making this film feel like you're there with the characters. His gift for film making is obvious, and I look forward to see more of his films as time goes on. The Constant Gardener is one of the more complex films of the year (second only to Syriana), but don't stay away from it. It makes you think more about life and reels you in with terrific performances from Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz. Both of them are at the top of the class of actors. The Constant Gardener is one you can't miss, and due to the graphic, complex, and adult content, only people ages 17 and up should watch this film, unless you're a really smart kid.8/10 --spy</fullReview>

I can find no mention of her anywhere on the net. I found this an interesting, provocative movie with some terrific shots of Africa. The acting was excellent, and there was some good foreshadowing. It doesn't hurt that I think John LeCarre is a brilliant writer. I had to use the subtitles to get all the lines. There were some muffled lines especially at the beginning. I especially enjoyed watching the young children of Africa, and the "play" being put on in the marketplace early in the African scenes. But most of all I am haunted to know what made LeCarre write this novel, and if he knew someone by the name listed above. Any information would be most appreciated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really disappointed in this movie, I was however enthralled by the acting ability of the two main characters and Ralf shows he is real talent capable of many emotions and shows an ability to portray emotion that is somewhat stuffy and stifled. Where this movie really fails is in the screenplay and direction. It is lifeless and so drawn out and at times tedious. The use hand held cameras, is overdone to the point of nausea ( it makes me feel sick) He presumable did it to create a "Fly on the wall docu" style to many scenes however for me it detracts and makes it hard to follow. I prefer it used to portray disorientation, and panic like in the beach scenes in Saving Private Ryan. I also think that the story is rather thin and the plot is rather pretentiously spread out to create a depth that is not there. My wife and I worked the plot out within an hour of the movie starting. However the climax at the church near the end is very good and I thought carried weight. Just a word on Bill Nighly, he lifts this movie every time he is on screen, and is a joy to watch. Pity we did not see more of him. I also found the views expressed one sided and felt it could have been more thought provoking if even a hint of the good that may have come from the drug testing could have been shown I don't know if this aspect is covered in the novel. Having seen Crash which won the Oscar last year I agree with the academy on this one this was a poor second.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had me in its grip from the moment it began. I had been doing chores, and was thinking about popping out for some Italian take-out when I saw this movie just beginning on one of the movie channels. Within about 2 minutes, my chores were forgotten, the take-out was forgotten, and I didn't wander away from the TV for a second while this movie was on. I didn't eat, I didn't even want to blink! Rachel Weisz was unbelievable. She's definitely going to go down in history as one of the UK's best actresses. Even Ralph Fiennes - who has never done much for me in anything I've ever seen him in - did a stellar job.This was one of those rare movies that I think could not have been more perfect. The title was really sublime, the acting beyond reproach, the part where Tessa's lawyer read the letter from Pellegrin at Justin's memorial was done with real class (my only complaint at the movie? - that part was a bit cheesy), and had me cheering at my TV. The end was really treated with gravitas and restraint, which made it even more powerful. The directing, the cinematography, brilliant brilliant brilliant...I will be buying this one on DVD.HIGHLY recommended. But don't take my word for it. See for yourself. I think you'll be glad you did.Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Readers, John Le Carre is probably the ultimate Spy Novelist. An ex-member of the MI6, Le Carre writes amazing novels of espionage and conspiracies that stand tall over James Bond, Mission: Impossible, and xXx and run equal with Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Identity. The most latest masterpiece movie adaptation of John le Carre is The Constant Gardener, an amazing piece of work from the Director of City of God, Fernando Mierelles.Justin Quayle is your average British gentleman who loves gardening working for the British Embassy in Africa. He meets and falls in love and marries a young Activist and they go to Africa together. Justin soon discovers his wife's secret agenda to find out about an anti-tuberculosis drug called Dypraxa. Before she is finished, she dies mysteriously in an accent with a friend. Justin delves deeper into why his wife was killed and learns the British Embassy and the Pharmeceutical company producing Dypraxa know that the drug kills people. Now fighting for his life, Justin travels the globe to piece the pieces of the puzzle together to prove to the world that the conspiracy is real.The Constant Gardener is the second best spy film ever, topped only by the Bourne Identity. Ralph Fiennes is charming as Justin while Rachel Weisz is pure awesome as Tessa. She and Ralph fill the air with wonderful chemistry and make a perfect couple. Bill Nighy is his usual villainous self as the suave head of the African branch of the British Embassy: Sir Bernard Pellegrin. Sadly, Pete Postlewaite's performance is good but is very short, leaving you hungry for more and more. The ending was powerful and tear-jerking and closed the film perfectly. My god, what a great film.Signed, The Constant DVD Collector</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Constant Gardener" (2005) is a well done film on all fronts. To begin with the story and script are top-notch - it's amazing how the screenwriters could put together a story (which was nominated for the Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published Oscar for 2006) that involved a thriller genre with a social realism twist to it - done in a nitty-gritty documentary style of cinematography. The director Fernando Meirelles knows how to direct his actors - Rachel Weisz gives an amazing performance as the activist wife Tessa (winning the 2006 Best Supporting Actress Oscar) and Ralph Fiennes shows his strengths again as the conservative businessman husband Justin. Also a nod to the Oscar-nominated original score by Alberto Iglesias, which really complements the film. A true gem all around at an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

Our caring gardener can't help to (and also we, by the hand of the director) suspect and assume that his trust is not respected and corresponded. The character of Ralph Fiennes finally finds it otherwise, even though unavoidably too late, and turns into a martyr as, moved by the love for another, shows the ultimate love for every other. Once again, Fernando Meirelles shows us (this time in the background but along with the message that we can and should do our little bit about it) the alternate and miserable existence of so many misfortune's and contemporary equals to us all.</fullReview>

The truest, deepest, enduring and eternal love was portrayed in a way unlike I have ever witnessed before.This film communicated a very deep sense of personal integrity from the characters point of view and saw them fighting and winning against a tide of greed, malice and covertly hostile elements. If there is one message this film communicated to me, it is that if you care enough about something, then despite all personal danger, one should pursue that goal, even in the face of certain death. This film stands above the level of receiving an Oscar.It is art in its truest form and should therefore have no critical analysis held against it. Wishing an Oscar on it will make it no more an appealing film than attracting bees to flowers by smothering them with honey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excellent insight into the power of love to cross boundaries of fear and indolence. Fine performances from all actors; the lens of a Brazilian director gives us a point of view that we might otherwise take for (first world) granted. The storyline holds together in a well- researched way, always maintaining a rich emotional level. The Englishman at the centre of the story has never quite found his courage, and so he speaks for many of us in his mild- mannered way. Yet in this minor diplomat as in all of us there is a yearning for courage. He finds his in a passionate woman who longs for something more out of her life than the consumer life. She is his lifelink, the sign that we can all find our way back to the heart. In the DVD bonus feature there's a mention that Hollywood dropped this film because of the 'A' word. That's right, 'Africa'. It doesn't sell, they would have you believe, and yet true stories sell, wherever theycome from, Nairobe or not. See this film. Think. Feel.

The film also demonstrated just how corrupt Governments and Secret Agencies can be and goes to prove that nobody can be really trusted, not even your next of kin.I was sad when the movie ended as I was enjoying it so much and the fact that the movie had a sad ending didn't do much to help matters.I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone (especially the guys) and I plan to add it to my DVD collection in the near future.Superb!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now i'm not a huge fan of John Le Carre's work or Rachel Weisz's acting ability but I absolutely loved the film 'City of God' by Fernando Meirelles and this being his next film I thought I'd give it a go. I'm so glad I did this film is amazing. At over two hours it is a long haul but one you don't really notice as the story is so engrossing. Told in a mixture of present day and flashback it is a gritty conspiracy thriller centred on a love story. Fiennes plays a British diplomat whose wife is very pro-active in her role righting wrongs in Africa's slum neighbourhoods. Along with a doctor friend of her she puts together a damning report about how a pharmaceutical company is killing Africans by testing drugs on them. When her report is sent off to the relevant authorities she and her friend turn up dead. Someone wanted the report silenced but whom? From here on in we get the story unravelled to us as Justin tries to find out why his wife was murdered? And as he gets closer he starts to understand the magnitude of what is happening and begin to realise how far it all goes. Set against the backdrop of the African plains and the colours of life in the slums the palette of the film is quite similar to city of god, very rich and deep. The camera work is at times dogma in its feel, which along with the music only draws you in further. Like a cross between the English patient and city of god with more twists than a pasta twirl like it says on the poster this is the stuff that gold statuettes are made off. A fantastically intelligent movie, one that deserves all the acclaim it gets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mystery and Romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Constant Gardener is a dramatic film layered with the element of romance. A husband finds out his wife was brutally murdered and he decides to investigate. Tessa (played by Rachel Weisz) lived with her husband Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) in Africa. She has a great desire to help people and had been researching a new experimental TB drug called Dyproxy. Her inquiries revealed cover ups and deaths. Justin then discovers all this as he takes up his wife's work.You can see, as the story progresses, how much Justin becomes like Tessa. He now understands what she had been fighting for and wishes he could do even more to help those he can't.Ultimately, a story of mystery. Throughout the beginning of the movie, much of the story is told through flashbacks and the director (Fernando Meirelles, "City of God") does the transitions in seamless ways and tells the rest of the story passionately. Fiennes and Weisz make an excellent on-screen couple and never travel away from a normal relationship.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a good advert for Africa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally, I enjoy John Le Carre work although sometimes I feel they contain complex plots and non conclusive endings. I appreciate they aren't sometimes as enjoyable or entertaining as we would like. (More the thinking person's book/movie). Despite the great acting performances by all, and the cinematography was excellent, I thought the editing and continuity was somewhat confusing in parts. And I would have liked a more conclusive ending.I always felt Kenya was the cream of East African states, and Niarobi was a beautiful city. Well run government etc. So this film actually explored the more realistic non tourist version of the country? It is a known fact that drugs that have been removed from the developed countries are being administered in third world countries. And no doubt these poor inhabitants, are used as guinea pigs, and ethical practises are not applicable. But in an AID's blighted continent, what I found awful, was when people are used as guinea pigs, and are actually not getting the treatment they think they are getting, and die as a result. However, I felt the continuity (and editing) sometimes added to my confusion over the time frame from Tessa's murder and the ending. In the deleted scenes shown on the DVD, Quaile goes to Canada and interviews a hesitant researcher on the TB drug they are experimenting with in Africa. She gets killed right in front of him in Canada!!! Then he's off to Africa. What time frame are we dealing with here? How is he getting back and forth on a false passport????One would realise then, his days are numbered, he is one man against huge powerful pharmaceutical companies, and his own government.Although the ending was not applauded by some, and I felt this initially too. I feel that he was a marked man, and up against powerful enemies. Left at Lake Tukana (How did the plane land there. It's in the middle of no where in the Rift Valley the cradle of humankind, re palaeoanthropological finds) one very English sounding voice calls his name. Then we switch to Westminster Abbey where we find he has been murdered?He was destined, so the Commissions MI6 contact told him, his death would look like suicide? Well it was not to be was it? Eight bullets, non of which came from his gun. At least he has exploited the fact his wife and African partner were onto something that some people wished to keep quiet. And of course what a wonderful eulogy the letter sent to Sandy, read out at their memorial service or his.What is sad, did the government ever follow this up or did the culprits get away with it. That is the question? Nice to see Bill Nighy in a sinister role for once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gardeners will be disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Put out a movie about Africa and my wife will want to see it."The Constant Gardener" stars Ralph Fiennes (Justin) and Rachel Weisz (Tessa). Justin and Tessa meet at a lecture in Britain and by the end of the night they have expressed their love physically. It seems a beautiful relationship has bloomed. Problem is, Justin has to return to Africa to his role as a British Diplomat. Tessa is passionate about human injustices and begs Justin to let her come with him. He evntually agrees and off they head. They soon marry and get pregnant. While Justin is off doing his job, Tessa is investigating what she believes to be a huge scam being run by a medical company that is killing many of the locals around her. The further she looks, the more warnings she gets that she is entering dangerous territory. Eventually it does cost her her life when she is brutally murdered. Previously ignorant of his wife's research, Justin decides to take up her work and get to the bottom of this investigation. Will he discover the truth, will it cost him his life too? See it and find out.Overall was reasonably impressed. Excellent cinematography and directing, as well as a well unfolded story. A solid supporting cast too, including Pete Postlethwaite in maybe his best role since "Strange Bedfellows".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Constant Gardener is a good, realistic movie with good performances by Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz. This movie portrays the horrible, unfortunate plight of several Africans and opens our eyes to the reality of money-hungry capitalistic companies exploiting the Africans. Yes, the African continent does have it's own internal problems (civil war, horrendous corruption, etc.), but big western companies don't miss an opportunity to exploit anybody. Pharmaceutical companies have considered Africa as a testbed for clinical drug trials as it's the second largest continent and disease-laden. Though I haven't read the novel, I believe the ending in the film is different from that in the novel. Good choice of locations. No over-acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Constant Gardner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My fascination with suspense movies has lead me to comment on this film. The Constant Gardener made me think. What does it all mean? Hidden meaning lies within the lines of the film. I am not surprised that Germany is listed as the country behind this film and I believe the film has some local meaning here for some in the United States.I did not see Rachel Weisz as the righteous character. There is a fine line between righteous and self righteous. Following the death of her newborn, she spoke of her marriage as "a marriage of convenience and nothing but dead bodies would come from it." Deceitful is the word I would use to describe that specific action by Tessa. I do not believe she loved the husband, Ralph Fiennes. In that respect, she was untruthful. Fiennes stars as Justin Quayle. For some reason, I do believe the character, Justin,is totally taken by the person Tessa Quayle. Both characters are wrapped up in the undercurrent within the African Contenant. All of the stars are superb actors and I believe the movie deserves much more attention than it has been given thus far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Constant Gardener (2005) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very good if somewhat flashily directed film with excellent performances (adapted from the John le Carre' novel) which, however, seems to have too many things going on at once - political intrigue, social conscience, character study, local color - so that it ends up being aloof about most of them! The relationship between Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz (a deserving Oscar contender) is credibly developed, the double investigation undeniably gripping, but the socio-political emphasis is a matter of taste as it all felt rather dreary to me. I had watched Meirelles' CITY OF GOD (2002), about which I had more or less the same reservations; as for John le Carre', I've always been interested in catching up with cinematic adaptations of his work though, so far, I only have three under my belt - the others being the Cold War-themed (as it was for most 60s spy thrillers) THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD (1965) and THE DEADLY AFFAIR (1966), both of which are first-rate (I do have THE TAILOR OF PANAMA [2001] on VHS, however).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a disappointment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I nearly went all the way to Berlin to be able to see this film in English. That would have been twice three hours and ten minutes or 35 euros for the coach ticket not so well spent. Thankfully I didn't go because I could rent the region 1 DVD.First the wobbly camera work got on my nerves. Then the story that went backwards, forwards, backwards... Then the camera work annoyed me again - or was still annoying? I couldn't concentrate on the actors because I had to concentrate on the picture so hard. Just nasty.This film was all in all such a disappointment that I fast-forwarded lots of moments because nothing really was happening. I really love arty films, slow films, not that blockbuster stuff, quiet films, with lots of dialogue and so on, but that was just a bad film. I can't understand what other people see in it. When I remember correctly the film was nominated for lots of BAFTAS and got none. I don't wonder why. It is just a bad film. Unfortunately so, because there were such good actors in there. Disappointment. 2 out of ten. One for the African landscapes and one for Bill Nighy - the reason I watched that film. But even he couldn't save it for me. Sorry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth watching, but hardly an epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film (and REALLY liked "City of God"), but there were a couple of things in it that detracted quite a bit from my ability to take it seriously.First, I found it very, VERY hard to believe that Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) could have lived his life as oblivious to his wife's activities as he was. It seemed like everywhere she went in the entire film, everyone knew her and knew what she was all about, but Quayle was totally clueless. It didn't make sense. While Quayle was a bit of a bore, he was hardly an idiot. Their relationship was such that she had distance to do her work, but for god's sake she could have been a prostitute for all he knew! That's just not how functional relationships work in real life, I mean, what did they talk about over dinner? You can only gaze into each other's eyes for so long...like about an hour.The other thing that kind of irked me was when Quayle flew to Sudan in a U.N. cargo plane. It seems to me that if you live in a desert village in Sudan, it's a pretty special day when the U.N. plane comes, and it's even more of a special day when it brings a strange white man looking for some other white man in your village. Not only did these things occur on the same day, but an hour after the plane arrived the village is attacked and destroyed by a band of marauders. It's safe to say that: a) If there was an airfield there, the village had been there for a while, and b) Seeing as how many of of the men were killed, and many of the children were taken (as well as the food taken and huts burned to the ground), that they would be moving what's left of the village. My point is this--the village doesn't get ransacked every day. So what are the chances of a plane coming to a remote desert village, with a rare stranger aboard, all within an hour of an attack by a band of nomadic marauders?That's one busy day indeed.Other than that, the acting was very good, and I did enjoy the camera-work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film left some unanswered questions and mixture of emotions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie did have a powerful effect on me, but I quite do not know exactly what the effect is. What I do know is that I was moved by the plight of the African people. However, it took me some time to have feelings towards the murdered wife and the grieving husband. When I realized that I started to care about any of the characters, it was the grieving husband that I started to care about first. His life was turned upside down by his wife's activities. You figured out almost toward the end that the wife did love her husband and that she was not having an affair. I still felt sorry for him because he really was not in this real marriage where couples shared their passions. The wife really was married to her social activism and was more intimate with those people who shared her passion. He ended up loosing his life at the end, but for what? It was almost like he was trying to be in a marriage after his wife died by searching for the truth of what she really did and who really killed her. Their was more of a connection between him and her after she died. The viewer is allowed to see one or two joyful moments between them in the flashbacks, but most of the time you see them living two separate lives.I believe this is just me, but I had a hard time following very closely to the plot. I missed a lot. I had a hard time just really keeping up with the conspiracy and who was behind the conspiracy and who was ordering the killings. There was so many gaps in the story. One minute the two are in the bed having sex. The next scene she asking him to take her to Africa. The next scene they are in Africa, and I think she is very pregnant in that scene. Then the next thing you know she lost the baby. I miss completely what happened there. How did the baby die? Why and how could she breast fed someone else's baby right after loosing her own? The grieving husband was not just a grieving husband. He seem to be totally passive and invisible especially to his wife. It seem even after loosing her child that she was still the activist in the hospital. Her husband, her friends, and her were to focus on the lady in the bed next to her. There was not even a pause in the movie that the viewers and the parents grieve for that baby she lost. I finally felt I had to have feelings for her because the writers made her with absolute integrity. She fought for the poor even if it meant her own life, and her marriage. She did not even let her grief of loosing her baby stop her from breastfeeding the dieing mother's baby and talking about the conspiracy that was happening to the Africian people. I have never in all of my life met anyone like that. I am sorry to say that I am not like that, So you see as I was taken on this journey of this couple's life and the conspiracy that finally kills them, I had a difficult time falling in love with the characters. And I am still confuse as to whether I like the movie overall. I could not think though as I was watching the movie that the wife really had enough information to leak to the press to expose the corruption. I also had a hard time believing that she would be that naive to think that her life and those around her were not in danger, so why could she not just turn the rest of her investigation over to some investigative journalist that could have given the story wide exposure. Did the husband towards the end also have enough information to expose the corruption. I do not buy that he really had to die. I think for me, having mixed emotions comes from the way the story flowed. It was hard for me to become emotionally involved with the characters, and at the end, I did not believe that either one of them had to died. What I did like about the movie was how respectable they were of the African people. The depiction of the African people proved-stricken life was handle properly I thought. Meaning, I think even though the movie showed these people in property, it showed the viewers more incidents of dignity of the people than showing the corruption within Africa between the African tribes. Which if they did, the story could get real confusing and loosing focus of the point of the film which is the drug companies corruption. Finally, I really did feel truly sorry that the wife and the husband had to loose their lives, and at the end of the movie, I was sold on their love. Hours after watching the movie, I felt a disturbing sense of lost. I guess that is the powerful effect it had on me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like watching a group walk by a unique painting for the first time, The Constant Gardener will evoke different emotions and feelings from everyone that gazes upon it. Critics far and wide have praised this film as a deeply political thriller that speaks passionately about the corruption surrounding the pharmaceutical companies, while there have been others that have called this the best "revenge" story to be released in the past decade (apparently they missed Oldboy). Hearing these comments shouted at me from nearly every angle, I wasn't sure what to expect from this Oscar nominated film. I had to see it for myself. When I walked by this shattering portrait of humanity and humility, The Constant Gardener spoke to me about at theme that many have refused to acknowledge, I saw this as an immaculate love story. What transforms this tale from your typical romantic thriller is the way that director Fernando Meirelles has crafted his story. Taking it from the pages of acclaimed writer John le Carré, Meirelles uses apt cinematography, non-linear storytelling, and bold characters that sweep you passionately off your feet and never put you down. It is told convincingly and sublimely enough that emotion will grip you by the end and make you hold your loved one even closer.I would like to quote a line form this film that I believe summarizes this film in its entirety. I use this line because it has remained in my mind long after the final scene of this film. The line that I refer to is said as Justin is passing, almost secretively and mean spirited, by his wife Tessa. It is a simple line that I believe was the first time I really saw this film for what it was. The line is, "It's like it's a marriage of convenience and all it produces are dead offspring." When you read this line, especially in the context it is used in the film, it gives off the sensation of anger and hatred in a bitter, disastrous relationship. Yet, when it is used again in this film it shows the passion in both of these characters, and really opens your eyes to the truth surrounding this amazing motion picture. I cannot stress this idea enough, but The Constant Gardener was on the surface a thriller/espionage film, but when looked upon closer, I saw this as one of the most amazing love stories told. That may be big of me to say, but I believe that director Fernando Meirelles has transformed the idea of your typical love story and demonstrated his cinematic power to create a genre that has been recycled through Hollywood time and again. Meirelles has rediscovered the romantic love story and provided a modern day twist, coupled with insecurities, passion, and of course, political lies.Again, maybe I am speaking too generally about this film, but it was difficult to see this film as a "first-rate spy game" as the cover of the DVD boasts. The connection between Fiennes and Weisz is immaculate. Never before have I witnessed a finer pairing in Hollywood. The two ooze with passion for each other, while both securing themselves so well in their characters that you forget that they are actors. I believe that Fiennes is one of the greatest actors of our generation. He has this ability to play down characters, as in this film, and suddenly bring them out in such a force that you never saw it coming. Weisz has those eyes. By this I mean her eyes can lie to us and reveal so little. The beginning of this film is a perfect example. During the couple's first courtship Fiennes says something along the lines of, "?thank you for that gift", and she responds with some line, but her eyes say something different. It is hard to find actresses so dedicated to finding their character completely that it was refreshing to see that in Weisz's performance. I do believe she deserves the credit that she is finding.One cannot talk about this film without talking about the power behind Meirelles' camera. This could have been another simple Hollywood "who-dun-it", but instead Meirelles takes it several steps further and creates a portrait of corruption coupled with love. His quick shots, off-centered close-ups, and grainy character camera angles were sublime. What kept me glued to my seat were not these long, drawn out picturesque landscape scenes, but instead, flash shots coupled with beautiful imagery. I don't know whom he uses, but it was a similar feel to his other amazing film, City of God. In both of these, Meirelles uses modern cinematography, classic tales and plot devises, and constructs some of the best cinema to be released. He is a master of his trade, and The Constant Gardener proves it.Overall, I was very impressed with this film. I was angry at the beginning, curious towards the middle, and sad by the end. Who else can say this about an espionage caper that does not involve huge explosions or meddling bad guys? Who else, outside of Fernando Meirelles, can capture this range of emotion in a film? Why is his work constantly breaking boundaries in cinema and reaching better expectations each time? He does this by keeping us, the viewers, on our toes. He does this by not conforming to typical Hollywood standards and keeping his own sense of originality and independence. He does this by keeping his camera modern, while his stories are not. He does this by employing amazing actors whom are at the top of their game. He does this by creating films like The Constant Gardener.Grade: ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Constant Gardener</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally! After such a long wait, this movie has finally made it to our shores (I have been lamenting the same fate of other acclaimed movies recently). Directed by Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles (who did City of God), The Constant Gardener finds itself sandwiched between two others movies released here in the same period, sharing with North Country an aspect about whistle-blowing, and with Syrianna on the corruption of conglomerates.While Syrianna takes on oil corporations, Gardener tells a tale of clandestine governments, and the morality issues faced by pharmaceutical companies. Adapted from the novel by John le Carré, Gardener explores and suggests what-if scenarios (I say "what-if" as I humbly ask if what was suggested by the film could have been inspired by some form of real happenings), of having human guinea pigs in the testing of new medicine. In contention here is a new drug for the treatment of tuberculosis, though HIV was also briefly sharing the spotlight in the plight of the African nations. The stark question posed, which makes you wonder, is whether it is right to have dying Africans, or those who are already terminally ill, test new medicine, and presenting to them Hobson's choice.And Kenya was the choice location in the movie, with having both the hustle and bustle of the cities, and the lush desert plains both beautifully captured on film. While you feel the chaos in the cities and rural squatters in rusty brown hues, you'll also feel the peacefulness and emptiness of vast lands. You'll contrast the corruption of officials of the Haves in their cocktail parties, and the simple, poor lives of the Have Nots.Ralph Fiennes puts up an excellent performance as Justin Quayle, a British diplomat in Her Majesty's Service. It's indeed a surprise exclusion in the Academy for his portrayal of an easy going man with green fingers (hence The Gardener). His mantra is to mind his own business and not get too involved with the locals, but as the movie evolves, we will see a change in this stand. However it calls to mind certain issues that again will set you thinking - if you want to help, how much and how far will you go? And why a certain group, and not others in similar situations? Resources will be your constraint, but what is the criteria in which you will base your decisions on? Now that you're made aware, will you still continue to turn the blind eye? His spouse Tessa Quayle is played by Rachel Weisz, whom I'm not sure why her performance, while solid, is nothing to warrant a shout for an Academy nomination. Nonetheless, she's the center of the entire scheme of things, and her story gets mainly told in flashbacks. A whistle-blower definitely ruffles feathers, and you know you're in a fix when you ruffle the feathers of the wrong bird. Extremely blunt and determined (and also giving the filmmakers an opportunity to air their opinion on the Iraqi war), she discovers that there's more than meets the eye in the way medicine is dispensed to the African poor, and sets off on a crusade in which the means could justify the ends.But we slowly learn and unravel the mystery of what happened, and who's involved, as the Gardener takes us on his trail of investigation, digging through clues, and weeding out red herrings, piecing together the entire event. It is the film editing here which gets the thumbs up. Just as you accept something at face value, there is enough suggestion again to make you think otherwise.In case you're wondering if the meandering narrative or themes will put you off, you might be glad to know that central throughout the movie is the love between the couple. How so much unsaid, and circumstances not explain could lead to suspicion, or deliberately done so to protect the other. Although the leads spend considerable time apart, we could feel, especially from Justin, the strong emotional attachment he has for Tessa, right up until the ending, which is just about right in the way it should end.It's a wonderful film, one in which you'd have to stay attentive to truly appreciate, and one which prods at your conscience. Given it's insane release schedule together with Walk the Line, Jarhead, Syrianna, and with North Country and Match Point already screening, we're indeed spoilt for choice which to watch first. I'd say watch them all!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Angry Enough for the Theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Justin Quayle (Fiennes) is a English Diplomat and he marries Tessa (Weisz), who thinks she knows why many Africans Aids victims are dying more than they should be. When Tessa gets killed Justin begins to take an interest in Tessa's work and leaves his gardening to find out who killed her and why. There are also rumors that Tessa had an affair.This is a movie with a message and it seems to be that the whole world ignores and takes advantage of Africa and the results are devastating. There is enough of a mystery here to keep going. You learn things as Justin learns them and still Justin and you also are not satisfied.The performances all around are good. Not Oscar worthy. I wouldn't say more than good just because this is based on a John LeCarre novel. I have heard that this is LeCarre's angriest novel, yet I didn't see that anger or passion in the leading characters in the movie version. Tessa, in the beginning, (we see many flashbacks) gets angry attending one of Justin's lectures and that was just about it for anger. After that it is all lip service as to what the problems are. Are we too civilized to get angry over something we know is wrong? So while LeCarre may have been angry in his book, this movie does not get angry. Justin goes about his business learning about Tessa's work in Africa as a detached detective would go about solving a murder mystery, or as a gardener weeding his garden in a systematized manner. Lip service, not passion, is served up.And, keep in mind that Justin wanted to save Tessa's memory and finish her work. Tessa wanted to save Africa.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disappointing adaptation of a good book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of John Le Care. I try to read his novels as soon as I can get hold of them, and 'The Constant Gardener' is one of my favorites. I was waiting with impatience to see this production, especially as Fernando Meirelles of 'City of God' is the director, but I was slightly disappointed by the film. In the center of the story stands a character typical to Le Care's movies, a British guy whose education makes him see the world though lens of order and decency and also makes him temper the expression of his sentiments. He is a clerk in the British embassy in Kenya, and it is only when his beautiful and young wife is assassinated he starts to understand not only the tragedy of the loss but also the deepness of the love he was feeling towards her. As with may characters of Le Care, sentiments (love in this case, friendship in other) lead him towards taking the path of engagement that his wife was on and that he did not understand or failed to understand while she was alive.It's not a bad adaptation, but it lacks much of the complexity of the book. Sure, there is no easy translation or adaptation, as with any good and complex book, but neither can we find any screen equivalent of what the book is about, and this is quite paradoxical because the track of the action does follow quite closely the main lines of the book story. Ralh Fiennes is good in the main role, sensible and caring, enacting well the discrete suffering and the emotional and political awaking of the character. Rachel Weisz is quite superficial, beautiful on screen but kind of external, and I do not think that she deserves the Globe she received for this role.Overall a fair adaptation, but does not come close to the value of the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The plot and character unfolding is very good. Very magnetic performance by Rachel Weisz. The last 1/2 hour, though, feels like a piece from some regular action movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is very good, very John Le Carré in showing how seemingly very respectable people will betray their friends just to keep their way of life, their social standing. And in Le Carré's plots "betraying" goes a long way.These normally hidden characters will be forced to unfold by an external force, called Tess, some sort of Mother Theresa (in her ends, not in her means) who is determined not let the large pharmaceutical companies get away with murder. She is more a natural than a human force, in that she doesn't care "what the neighbours say". In the end, of course, the people who interact with her have to show their true nature.The strongest point of the picture lies in how each individual reacts. A few of them are all good or all bad from the start, but others are more grayish: Just as most people cannot resist evil pressure, most people cannot resist the pressure of the good, either, and towards the end gray characters have turned a lot whiter or blacker.At one point there is another very John Le Carré thing that I like which is to show this social bitterness from the people who can't go into the gentlemen clubs towards those who do.I would have rated the movie 9, short of a masterpiece, were it not for the last 1/2 hour. It is as if someone (producer?) said: "Hey! We are in Kenya and this is a spy movie! Some gorgeous landscapes and some shooting!" Not that the last 1/2 hour is bad, but it feels like an added patch of some regular action movie.Performances are quite good, Rachel Weisz is tremendously seductive, but Archie Panjabi is not good, and neither is Bill Nighy in the last scene. Also, at times the plot is explained too quickly, one doesn't get all the details in one viewing.</fullReview>

Meirelles striking gold with 2002's "Ciade De Deus" and again with "The Constant Gardener". Again set and filmed in Africa with the staring role of Ralph Fiennes and always beautiful Rachel Weisz. When British Diplomate Justin Quayle (Fiennes) and his wife Tessa (Weisz) travel down to Africa and soon are discovering a newly found epidemic on their hands. After his wife goes missing Justin determined to find out the possible cover-up his wife was involved in.

		<fullReview>Hey everyone.. This is my first post. I just saw the trailer of the movie, and I noticed something. The music used is: "Su-Chou prison" ( which is the track number 1) of the score of Spy Game, composed by Harry Gregson Williams. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266987/ And his name doesn't figure anywhere...If no one knows that song, it must be possible to hear at least a preview on other websites (where you can actually buy/order the CD...) or you can go here: http://www.amazon.com/ and do a research on "Spy Game Score) and scroll down a bit...cheers, snake</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An African Syriana</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How strange that every year there are two movies that are very much alike, this year being Syriana and The Constant Gardener.In this movie, the focus is set on the illegal and covert operations of pharmaceutical companies, refining their drugs on African people, with the consent and support of different governments. Rachel Weisz tries to do something about it and she dies. This is the beginning of the movie, the rest being how her husband, ignorant on the activities of his wife, discovers what had happened to her.It is a dark movie, a little less entertaining than Syriana was, less action packed, but more attuned to the feelings of the people involved. Nothing shows pain more than the rare moments of self control loss by a true Englishman, played by Fiennes. The ending is, of course, the same: you can't really win these battles, but you can fight them and the fight is really what matters, the choice you make to not stand accomplice to inhumanity.Actually, my personal feelings were mixed. Why not try these drugs on the African people? These are Middle Age savages, still fighting for sheep in their make believe kingdoms, plagued by disgusting diseases and immoral conducts. The fact that they don't have a real choice in the matter is hardly our concern, is it? And from this moment on, you understand what the movie is about.Conclusion: a very good movie, albeit a little boring near the end, and a very thought provoking political thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>thought provoking and wonderfully romantic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film. It's disturbing. It takes no easy outs. Little things such as a the little girl he cannot take with him on the plane pack a punch but the result is realistic. The day to day uncertainty of life and stability of Kenyans is very well conveyed and heartbreaking.This movie takes its time crafting its story. Pay attention to all details as they may be referenced later. I appreciate when a screenwriter puts such detail in their writing. I am a fan of Ralph Fiennes. He accounts for two of the most romantic but tragic moments in film history, in my opinion. The first in The English Patient when he carries out Kristin Scott Thomas' dead body and cries. The second in this movie when he is in his garden and realizes Tessa really did love him, that she was faithful, and that she was only protecting him. He acts without appearing to try. Hopefully the Academy will wake up and realize he was sorely overlooked for the Golden Globes!! Weisz's Golden Globe win was well deserved. She convincingly embodies Tessa's activist spirit. It is about time that this very good actress gets a great part. She has wonderful chemistry with Fiennes who she has been paired with in a previous movie, Sunshine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie well worth a watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie brings to light the harsh reality of big corporate drug testing. It shows how a few million dollars being saved can justify death. Developing nations are unfortunately the testing ground to ensure that the fortunate few in developed nations can enjoy the benefits of modern medical science. The Constant Gardener played by Ralph Fiennes is similar to the ostrich in most of us. Too often do we see powerful corporates grossly abusing their position of strength against individuals and nations too weak to resist and do nothing. The movie is well worth the watch and is more contemporary and hard-hitting than another great movie that deals with "whistle-blowing" The Insider. The Constant Gardener is tragic both in it's story and the larger message being told.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best LeCarre Adaptation In Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised by how much I liked 'The Constant Gardner'. The writer's recent offerings have become increasingly tired: his diplomats are always corrupt, his intelligence-men principled but cynical, his heroes?well?you get the idea. Fernando Meirelles and screenwriter Jeffrey Caine do a marvellous job of stripping away the fat from the body of LeCarre's tale while leaving the emotional muscle intact. A clever use of flashbacks allows much of the mystery of the original story allows the relationship between minor diplomat Ralph Feinnes and his activist wife, Rachel Weiss, to evolve naturally, complementing the obligatory 'mystery' thread, as Feinnes discovers hidden truths underpinning that relationship. They work well together, and some of their exchanges are genuinely touching. Of the supporting performers Bill Nighy is loathsomely louche as Feinne's duplicitous boss in Whitehall, and Pete Postlethwaite is given the opportunity to re-use the half-Indian half-South African accent he adopted for 'The Usual Suspects'. Both these fine character actors are under-used, but the quality of the rest of the cast ? and this is very much an ensemble piece ? make up for that. The Kenyan landscape is well used, and the contrast between the lifestyles of even the most apparently liberal members of the diplomatic community and those of the locals provoke the desired effect. Anger. This is a bloody angry film, and one which, though at times unsubtle in it's politics, is never less than effective. A fine film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Constant Gardener - good movie, odd at times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a powerful movie, but I considered it so only after watching it to the end. I found myself thinking on Tessa's nature even the next day, and pondering on the moral change one person can bring, even when the social change they effect is limited. However, it was only in the second half of the movie that I started to believe the plot. I found it quite difficult, in the first half, to "suspend my disbelief". The character of Justin (Ralph Fiennes) is quite believable. He is a shy, uninvolved man, becoming a diplomat that does not have much input in the politics around, a man with no job personality. His is a world of gardening, not one of people. In total opposition is Tessa's personality, always direct and forceful. There is a beautiful parallel between Justin and Tessa: he strives to remove the weeds from his gardens, while Tessa strives to remove the human "weeds" from her world. In one of Justin's recollections of Tessa (after her death), Tessa tries to wake him from sleep, joking that there is gardening to be done, weeds to be removed. This scene was eerie, implying (to me) that Tessa's murder would be punished, that Justin has work to do in removing the human "weeds" that have caused her death. He certainly did not have a belligerent or even strong nature, and only manages to cause the sacking of one character by the end of the movie, but at least there was some measure of closure and justice. Justice for Tessa, but not for the African populace that was the pharmaceutical company's guinea pig. Tessa's character only fully unravels by the end of the movie. The beginning is quite choppy, and makes the viewer seriously question her personal integrity: she appears to meet, bed and marry Justin in one day, and her choice of him as husband appears to be caused solely by his job and connections, rather than her affection for him. At this stage, Tessa appears to be nothing more than an extreme activist, and, even though hers is a good cause, she appears a fanatic none the less. In the end, the viewer sees her as someone who, knowing the right path, proceeds on it without delay and without fear for personal safety. I felt that a lot of scenes of the movie were intentionally presented in a manner confusing to the viewer, as seen from Justin's point of view, unclear of Tessa's nature and motivations. In one scene, Justin happens to overhear Tessa talking to Arnold of a "marriage of convenience" (discussing the political ramifications of the activities of drug companies). To Justin, never knowing what Tessa's work involved, her comment appears to be referring to her marriage to him as a loveless marriage of convenience. On an even higher note, the scene at the hospital, after Tessa gave birth, shows her breastfeeding a black baby, as Justin and Arnold look on - there is heavy silence for a few good seconds. The viewer starts thinking that indeed Arnold is the father of Tessa's baby, until her dialog with a newly arrived Sandy explains that her own baby died, while the baby she is feeding is that of the African girl in the next bed over, who died in childbirth. In the end, the viewer is impacted by Tessa's strong determination, lack of fear and her capacity for love (to Justing and the African people around her). She never realizes that Justin has become suspicious of her, after reading an offensive email intended for her, in which she and Arnold are mentioned. Justin finds out from Ghita, after Tessa's death, that Arnold is gay. To his question of why Tessa never mentioned this to him, Ghita responds that perhaps Tessa never thought she needed to say this to Justin. Apart from the personal stories of Justin &amp; Tessa and the actions and motivations of their social group, the backdrop of the movie is the sick and forgotten African people, who are suffering and dying in huge numbers, caught between the machinations of greedy corporations and the abject poverty in which they are kept. The viewer gets a strong feeling that, for them, there is just no way out, and that one of the first reasons this is so is white people's lack of identification with or empathy for the Africans. Their "otherness", be it color or poverty, keeps the people of the developed world removed from the plea of the Africans. It is only the Tessas of the world that see beyond that, and choose to act, against all consequences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Films of this Year; One of the Best Thrillers of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin with, this film has an amazing atmosphere which rivals classics like Fernando Mereilles's City of God and Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List. The cinematography is gritty, saturated, and contrasted. Coupled with phenomenal editing and a score of heart-wrenching traditional African music, The Constant Gardener is deeply rooted in a realistic and passionate world. Beyond the realm of aesthetics, the film is elevated to an instant classic. The script, adapted from the critically acclaimed novel by John lie Carre by relatively unproved screenwriter Jeffrey Caine is provoking, moving, and enthralling, supported by an amazing cast that includes Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Danny Huston, Bill Nighy, Pete Postlethwaite, and Richard McCabe who all perform at the top of their game.The story follows British diplomat Justin Quayle (portrayed by Ralph Fiennes in one of his strongest and most moving performances to date) on a quest to find out who killed his beloved wife, an outspoken activist named Tessa (Rachel Weisz). The deception and conspiracy stretches much farther than he could ever have guessed, as he becomes entangled in a quagmire of intrigue involving major British pharmaceutical companies.This intense film functions not only as a fantastic, on the edge of your seat thriller, but is an emotional and grief-ridden tale of love, death, and retribution. Although heavily criticized in the media for its wordy pretentiousness and erroneous liberal agenda, The Constant Gardener is, in my opinion, one of the best and most gripping human dramas in recent years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Couldn't help thinking about the basic dishonesty of this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite all the highly skilled acting and directing and cinematography, there wasn't a moment that I didn't feel I was being had. The West has seldom had a very honorable relationship with the developing world, and people who attempt to right that situation have seldom done as well as even these hapless characters. And there's something almost comical about making the pharmaceuticals the iconic bad men of this piece. It's not that they're not deserving of such treatment, it's more that their everyday activity is far more insidious and destructive than this more dramatic stuff. I found Weisz' character not very agreeable or sympathetic though the acting was quite good. I found Fiennes' character far more sympathetic, and there's something very elusive about the subtle ways Ralph found to illustrate his character's humanity. Maybe I'm a little too jaded for all this, because I'm sure younger folk, say 20s to 40s will admire it quite a bit.Where do I see dishonesty? Sorry, but I can't help thinking these English characters are far more sympathetically drawn than they really deserve. But the worst dishonesty is yet another portrayal of the victims here as Poor Innocent Africans who need an enlightened Westerner to show them the way. When are the Africans going to speak up in protest?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>British diplomats, capitalist conspiracy and lust.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I prefer Indy and Foreign films, but occasionally a Hollywood release gets enough chatter that I have a look. This was well worth it. From the opening scene to the closing credits I was transported out of my living room and into the story written by John Le Carré and brought to the screen by Jeffery Caine and Fernando Meirelles. It is a complex tale of British diplomats, capitalist conspiracy, and lust, not 3 words you usually find in the same sentence. Ralph Fiennes is convincing as Justin Quayle, a mild mannered representative of her majesty's government with a passion for gardening. He meets Tessa (Rachael Weisz) during a lecture in London he is giving as a favor for the writer who could not deliver it himself. She is a fiery girl who clearly wants to challenge whatever is wrong with the world. When he asks her to join him for a cup of coffee I had to smile recalling that was a euphemism in London for something quite different. We learn he is being transferred to Africa, and the infatuated Tessa asks to go along "as your lover, your mistress, or your wife...." You must learn the rest on your own, as the story is woven through flashbacks and present time. I will leave you with one word....Riveting!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fernando Meirelles continues to shine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Constant Gardener, Fernando Meirelles's answer to his critically acclaimed City of God, continues Meirelle and his return cinematographer César Charlone on the road to greatness. Fans of City of God will have high expectations coming into this film, and i feel that they are met head on. The script is beautiful, intelligent,in-depth and well executed. César Charlone's immediately recognizable cinematography, is again beyond remarkable. The Constant Gardener follows Tessa Quayle, played by Rachel Weisz, an activist who is trying to uncover the murderous acts of a pharmaceutical company using the sick population of Africa as a cover to try out their new experimental drug. After prolonged agitation, the diplomats siding with the pharmaceutical company decide it best to have Tessa killed before she uncovers any more of the truth. This is when the film shifts weight to Tessa's quite diplomat husband, Justin Quayle, played by Ralph Fiennes. Through lies, betrayal, scandal and the misconception of an unfaithful wife, Justin becomes obsessed with finishing what Tessa started. As he unravels the threads, Justin becomes a marked man, and its only a matter of time before he is dealt with just as his late wife. The culmination of the cinematography, direction, and acting in The Constant Gardener is something so above what we have come to expect in films, that is is truly a must see film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As someone who is not familiar with the novel upon which the film was based, THE CONSTANT GARDENER was an entertaining, sublime journey, a magnificent film in both production value (great cinematography) as well as brilliant performances by Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz (in a pregnant/fat suit no less!).The film is told in flashbacks, following the lives of the Quayles. Justin (Fiennes) is a reserved, shy English diplomat and Tessa (Weisz) is the aggressive, outgoing activist wife who has a secret life that is slowly unveiled to Justin.We are shown how they meet, and it's evident that Justin has no qualms about living life by floating through it, trying not to disturb the waters, tending to his plants, letting life be as it is. His opposite is Tessa, who's willing to challenge the status quo and ask questions that others dare not.Upon her death (not a spoiler), Justin is faced with examining his own life and who Tessa truly is: Was she an over zealous activist or did she have a secret agenda that trumped their marriage? Was she having an affair? Who are his friends? Is dear friend Sandy to be trusted? Why is Sir Bernard Pellegrin so interested? Justin must come to terms with his own limitations in order to discover the reality of Tessa's life and find meaning in his own.</fullReview>

I stopped reading his books in the 70s because I simply didn't understand, couldn't work out what was happening in them... either he's improved, or I've gained a couple of IQ points. Anyway, I thought that almost everything about this movie was good.Almost everything. Why oh why the hand-held cameras? I came out of the cinema feeling seasick! I don't think it adds anything to a movie to make it look like it was shot by your cousin Arthur for his 9th grade English project... and it says something about a director if he feels it is necessary to use a technique that has been tried and discarded several times by many producers over the years - perhaps he thnks he is compensating for something else that his direction, or the script, or the actors, couldn't provide? That's the message that comes across, anyway, even if it's patently not the case.Please, directors, you have all that wonderful technology (tripods) at your disposal - bloody use it! Don't insult your audience by making them feel like upchucking their popcorn halfway through the flick...</fullReview>

Ralph Finnes is brilliant once again as the husband on the search for why his wife was murdered and the conspiracy her death tried to cover up. This is definitely a must see in a year that seemed to lack somewhat in blockbusters and worked to bring us smaller films with more importance.

Before seeing The Constant Gardener, I naturally thought about City of God and how this movie might compare. My conscience was put to rest as the first half of the movie swept along, overcoming my expectations at every shot. I expect that the 2005 Golden Globes will foreshadow the 78th Annual Academy Awards, by giving the awards to more popular movies, like Brokeback Mountain. If Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall were in The Constant Gardener, it would have undoubtedly be more exciting for the younger age demographic. Most young people today are unaware of names like Fiennes, and Meirelles, because they don't hear them often. I think the difference between pop-film and classic-film is that the choice to see a movie is at question; I want to see this movie because its interesting vs. I want to be entertained. I am not saying that all pop-film is bad, most of it is, but not all. I am only saying that the movies with more hype surrounding them usually is more recognized by the public.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Movie ,Some Great Performances.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the same old tired and beaten to death conspiracy theory about pharma companies doing testing of drugs on poor African people upon whom the world has given up, and doctoring the test results by quashing those who resulted adverse side effects.This is because the potential market for the drug is too high for it to go into re-designing and re-testing , by which time other competitors may enter the market.Tessa Quayle is a hot headed , passionate human rights activist and worker.She unearths this conspiracy between the UK government and a pharma company that could have serious repercussions for both.And, so, as the lingo goes, "she is silenced". However, her husband Justin Quayle distraught, heart broken and ashamed of having suspected her wife involved in an affair, sets out to complete the unfinished work of his wife.There was nothing new in the story.So, the only thing that could have saved this movie are good direction and good performances.Fortunately, both the director and the actors are up to the task.Ralph Fiennes is perfect as the soft spoken and charming British diplomat,and so is Rachel Weisz as the truth seeking activist.The supporting cast, in particular Bill Nighy and Danny Huston also turn in good performances.As for the director( whose previous work includes City of Gods among other things), the sun , sand, poverty,suffering,disease in Africa are all beautifully captured to provide a superb setting to the plot.However the movie is not without drawbacks.Although this seems to be a really high level cover up, the information seems to be lying around that almost anyone who puts a little effort can find it.I mean this is something that involves the whole government, for Gods sake! And still, our Mrs. Quayle unearths everything by just talking to a few people on the net.It all seems too easy to be true.Also, the watchdogs ,which seem omnipotent, become conveniently absent to allow the story to continue.A British diplomat, who, as the beginning suggests has spend his life giving boring lectures suddenly is able to elude the government and make trips from kenya to London to europe to again some place in Africa.and it seems these days almost everybody has a contact who can make u the perfect passport to get u thru customs.wow.So if you are willing to allow yourself a few logical flaws, this movie is definitely worth a look, for the brilliant performances, if not anything else.</fullReview>

The magnificent beauty of Africa can be seen in stark contrast to the heartbreaking ravages of AIDS, corruption, ignorance and a doomed desire to change things.

		<fullReview>I have just seen The Constant Gardener, and I must say, it was one of the most brilliant films I have ever seen. Part-thriller, part romance, it is about Justin, a Kenyan based English diplomat (Ralph Fiennes) whose headstrong activist wife (Rachel Weisz) uncovers a scandal so shocking it puts her life and the lives of the people she loves in jeopardy. When a tragic turn of events claims her life, Justin finds himself changing from a detached observer to a fierce whistleblower.What follows is a deeply emotional personal journey for Justin, as he digs around to uncover the scandal that multinational pharmaceutical companies and the British government have conspired together, and spilt blood over, to keep secret. With danger facing him at every turn, Justin races against the clock to uncover the truth, not only about drugs companies but also about whether his marriage with his late wife was one of convenience. Did she really love him or was it all a sham? Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz give extraordinary performances. Fiennes' subtlety and restraint was impressive. He beautifully inhabited the body and soul of a diplomat spurred to action by not only by grief, but by his realisation of the corruption surrounding him; the corruption claiming lives and stripping a people of their dignity. Weisz was equally convincing as the headstrong and fearless Tessa, willing to stand up for what she believed in, regardless of the cost.The cinematography was exquisite, depicting the extremes of the African landscape - at times rugged and brutal and other times, tranquil and calm - as well as the urban world of offices and crowded streets. The way the story unfolded - in flashbacks, told through Justin's eyes - heightened the suspense considerably.One of my favourite scenes in the part where Tessa wants to give a mother, her baby and son a lift to a city 40km away. Justin comments that they can't help everyone, and Tessa says, "But we can help these three". I think that captures the spirit of The Constant Gardener. The film is an eloquent plea for individuals to stand up, open their eyes and start making a difference to the world around them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful movie on how everybody f***s Africa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie not just about how the pharma companies are bad (nothing new there), but also about how everybody (Africans included) screw the Africans. Powerful performances from Fiennes and Weisz, on-location filming that takes you in the middle of human misery (whether you like or not), and a beautiful ending. The most horrifying part is that you can really see this happening - how profit margins and market competition might override ethics. However, the true core the film consists of the love between Fiennes and Weisz's characters, the depth of these characters, the anti-hero that Fiennes becomes, and the sad, harrowing, beautiful ending to it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay but inferior to the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Translating John Le Carre books to film has always been difficult and "Constant Gardner" succeeds no worse and no better than most. To be sure, Ralph Fiennes is a superb actor, Rachel Weisz is gorgeous and the impact of African scenery adds a good deal. But, although Le Carre's books always have a tightly constructed narrative, what makes them into literary sensations is not the story but the style and the interior development of the characters. That can't easily be transferred to the screen -- and for the most part attempts to do so have fallen far short. Anyone who imagines that seeing a movie based on a John Le Carre novel is like reading the novel is just plain wrong. The novels are invariably better than the films, no matter how faithfully the story has been rendered and no matter what has been added by giving visual reality to character and place. One can think of many other authors whose works likewise defy motion picture treatment but in most other cases it's because narrative isn't at the core of the book's strengths. The only author I can think of who is similar to Le Carre in the mix of narrative and style is Graham Greene -- and at least two of his books, "Our Man in Havana" and "Third Man" were made into exceptional movies. I wish some one would do Le Carre an equally good turn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The High Cost of the Truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Constant Gardener is a grim tale that meshes the personal and political, reminding us that most of us are pawns in the games that large-multi-national corporations play, and that there's virtually nothing that we can do about it, even if we're willing to pay with our lives. On the political side, the movie depicts a very convincing scenario (think Grünenthal and thalidomide, Merck and Vioxx, and every company that made and makes PCBs) that companies are willing to use populations as guinea pigs. Surprisingly, however, this is the less compelling aspect of the film. Most of us, while appalled when the news pushes an example of corporate arrogance and control in our face, resign ourselves to this state of affairs simply to get on with our lives. In fact, we *need* to numb ourselves to each new outrage, lest we become consumed with anger and despair and become non-functional.As Netflix critic James Rocchi notes, though, what drives the movie and what thoroughly engages the audience is the personal side of the story. Married just briefly, Justin and Tessa don't really know each other. They move in different worlds, he in hush and flutter of cocktail parties and official receptions, she in the miserable shantytowns of Nairobi and the Kenyan countryside. Only after Justin refuses to accept the official version of the circumstances of his wife's death does he begin to discover what Tessa did and who she really was. It is through watching Justin rise to the occasion, search for the truth across continents, stretched to his limits, that the audience cares about what's going on, because he is so obviously a man pushed by a painful burden of ruined love.Weisz is good in this movie. It would have been easy for her to reduce her role to that of an archetypal crusading humanitarian, but the scenes of domestic eros lend sweetness to her fierce intelligence and moral outrage. Fiennes is terrific, fleshing his initially austere and meek character out with gentleness and an impassioned courage as the movie progresses. The cinematography in this movie argues for seeing it in the theater, although it will translate fairly well to a home theater and well enough to a regular TV.The climax of the movie hit me and much of the audience like a wrecking ball. I was overwhelmed by the personal and political tragedies in this movie, and I went home to lie on my bed for an hour afterwards, distressed and depressed. So, be forewarned and steel yourself a bit if you intend to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Digging the dirt in murkiest Africa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films the Brits do so well - adapted from a British novel, in this case by John le Carré; set in an African country, once a British colony; and dealing, inter alia, with deep treachery by the British Foreign Office. Except, as it happens, apart from its two main leads, Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz, The Constant Gardener is hardly British at all, and in particular is directed by the Brazilian, Fernando Meirelles, previously best known for City of God, about young people living in a violent, poor quarter of Rio de Janeiro.The detailed plot, involving dirty dealing by the drugs industry, aided and abetted by senior figures and institutions in both the UK and Kenya, should not be taken too seriously. These days, any drugs company marketing a medication known to have dangerous side effects would be risking crippling law suits. Nevertheless, within the normal limits of cinematic credibility, the screenplay is convincing, and certainly the vulnerability of the African poor to almost any cr*p dumped on them by outside forces or their own Governments is true enough.Fiennes is well cast as Justin Quayle, a diplomat in the UK High Commission (embassy) in Nairobi, who is intelligent and sensitive, but essentially detached from the world around him, except for his beloved garden. Weisz is quite brilliant in her portrayal of his passionate wife, Tessa, a health-care volunteer, who discovers and investigates the drugs conspiracy, at the cost of her life. One lapse in the plot and characterisations (possibly present in the original book which I haven't read) is that Quayle's diplomatic work is left too vague. Some reference to his actual job might have allowed a deeper exploration of the contrasts in attitude of Justin and Tessa, who like many married couples have only their love in common. Other noteworthy cast members are Danny Huston as Justin's oily superior; and Bill Nighy, in a sinister role, as a senior civil servant, whose mild exterior conceals the frigid hole in his chest where his heart has been extracted.Visually, the film is compelling, with many scenes of local deprivation contrasted with the comfortable lives of the diplomatic corps. Also, when appropriate, Meirelles doesn't hesitate to depict Kenya's spectacular scenery. (Given the plot, it was perhaps surprising and brave of the Kenyan authorities to allow filming in their country.) Heightened (digitally enhanced?) colour adds to the visual and dramatic impact.Overall, this is a high class movie, raising some important issues, whose form and content are equally above average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic film which was very enthralling viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I felt this movie was very good. It's very heavy but you feel that seriousness. I must say that the last two movies I saw have both stared Ralph in it(Harry Potter and this). I feel that he is under-rated as an actor and he shows the amazing potential for a lead character that has the dramatic life that keeps an audience hooked onto all if not most of the words that is said. Rachel Weisz is one of my favorite actresses after she stared in Runaway jury with John Cusak. I felt that despite her part in runaway jury was good I feel this topped it. In this movie we see a woman living a double life after she is killed her husband goes on the tale of an investigation of her last actions she did when she was alive. The only down point is that it is quiet easy to get tangled up in the web where you don't know who is telling you the truth and who is lying to you. This is full thrills spills back-stabbing deals and shows the other side of a corporation. I went into the movie theater not expecting much and I came out blown away. I must say a congratulations to the cast because that was fantastic</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intelligent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I have to say that this is my first review and that I'm learning English at school. It'snot my mother language. I had read a review of the movie before watching it and it said it that the movie is very good. I wanted to see an intelligent and thrilling movie. I got both. And in addition to that I got a non-kitsch love story.Never in a movie I had seen such a look at Africa. The film has a very real atmosphere and I always had the feeling it is a little bit like a documentary. Of course this effect is hidden by a murder story but it's still very real. The story is a bit confusing, you have to watch this movie only if you're concentrated. For some it could be a little bit boring but I didn't mind. Between the last thing we see and the credits there is a short moment where it's black and there is no music. In this short moment there was absolutely no sound in the cinema because it's so sad because it's real.So watch it concentrated and think about it after you saw it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came away from this film with a feeling of unease. Sure, it works on one level as a well made thriller, well acted and beautifully shot. But at another level it - like the book on which it is based - is purportedly an exposé of the unethical operations of big pharmaceutical companies. At the session I attended, there was a promo shown before the film for the UN World Food Program, but there was nothing else to suggest that the film had more serious objectives or that something positive might flow from it to alleviate the appalling situation of the African people shown in the film. As one tends to when considering Africa and its problems, I was left with a feeling of hopelessness that probably things have not improved and indeed, given recent events in Darfur and the Sudan, for example, are probably worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an edgy, human / political drama about love and truth, versus exploitation and deceit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: Includes spoiler.The metaphorical title of the film may be a little too subtle for some, not to mention the weaving plot itself. However, the beauty of this film is that it works on many different levels. The rich metaphors and symbolism are extras that only add to the overall enjoyment of the compelling and very realistic, if sometimes sombre storyline. Justin Quayle (Fiennes), is the stiff, seemingly predictable Ambassador to the British High Commission and Tess (Weisz), is a passionate investigative journalist. During the question and answer session at an FCO press conference, an emotional outburst from Tess challenging the policy of the government, sets the scene for a tense, "opposites attract" romance. The relationship is so strong that when Justin's diplomat job is transferred to Kenya in Africa, he agrees to take Tess with him. So begins the journey of intrigue, discovery and ultimately, heartbreak. The richly cultured, yet destitute local people who live in shanty towns are dependent upon Western companies and aid agencies for food and medicine. Whilst Justin goes about his "deal making" work for the British Government, closely observed by his cool boss, Sir Bernard Pellegrin (well cast for Bill Nighy), Tess goes about her investigative work. As she becomes increasingly more obsessed with exposing the corruption she sees in this downtrodden society, the distance between her and her husband grows, along with the rumours of her infidelity. This is underlined by the presence of another man, Arnold Bluhm, the local medical doctor (Hubert Kounde) whose passion for serving his people translates into an intense relationship with Tess. As Tess becomes increasingly outspoken during public showdowns with powerful people she comes to represent an embarrassment to the British government. Justin appears helplessly caught in the middle and compensates by escaping in his garden and occasionally trying to secretly observe Tess's activities.When she ends up brutally murdered, Arnold the doctor, who is also found dead, is officially blamed. Whilst trying to make sense of the tragedy, Justin begins to conduct his own investigation and uncovers a web of lies that implicates both the African and British governments and a pharmaceutical company. As he digs through Tess's shadowy past, the conspiracy deepens and he too becomes dangerously embroiled in a life threatening scandal. Despite being warned off with death threats and beatings, the seeds of his love for Tess grow stronger, enabling him to commit the ultimate sacrifice: his life for exposing the truth.Conclusion: Director Fernando Meirelles (City of God, 2002) handles the entire project skilfully. The cinematography is stunning, the music evocative and the pace of the film perfect. Despite the sometimes upsetting subject matter and the twists and turns of the plot, the film is intelligent, charming and chillingly realistic. Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz give first class performances and great to see an appearance by Pete Postlethwaite as the slightly desert mad aid worker, Lorbeer. Overall Rating: 8/10 woodyb_97@yahoo.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wow! what a movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies I genuinely feel how movies should be. It is a worthwhile story. It has a strong undercurrent of romance. It has a potent modern day(political-?-) messages. It a marriage of the two perhaps...I have been watching quite a few movies this week. But this one truly was touching, memorable and thoroughly absorbing. One of the main actors deserve an Oscar. Ralph and Rachel truly give a mesmerising performance. In fact it never looked like a performance. It looked real. Very real.If you know about Fernando Meirelles, the director's earlier movie, City of God, then you may appreciate the altogether different approach he has taken in this movie. It has the same crispness. The cinematography is so memorable. Every shot couldn't have been better. Simply a great piece of work. The colours/tints and hues in the movie are also so conducive to the story that it altogether makes for a very good storytelling. In several places, subtle differences in the way the camera pans/moves and background sounds reveal what Justin Quayle(Ralph Fiennes)is feeling. It thus draws you into it within the first 10 minutes. I recommend this movie very highly. I am going to give it a 8/10. Money and time well spent. Rachel Weiz is great. Believe me when I say that you will remember this movie for a long time. It carries several very strong messages. About politics, corporations, capitalism, love, relationships, ethics, undying love... all in one movie! I was sad the movie had ended when it did. I wanted it to carry on. see more of everyone in it!!! It is that good. I am usually critical about movies and this one definitely pleased me. cheers, Dee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A difficult but poignant movie of the abuse of Govt/Civil Servant and corporate responsibility in Africa...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the past year there have been a few social commentary movies, and "The Constant Gardener" follows after the wonderful L.A. based movie "Crash", but unlike that film this one goes after social commentary in Africa with the British High Commission under the spotlight. The story surround the death of the wife of a High Commission Civil Servant of the UK Govt in Kenya. As you would expect, not all is what it seems as the broken hearted husband sets out to find out the truth, and along the way finds corruption and scandal amongst the High Commission tangled in with pharmaceutical companies out to test their drugs in Kenya at the expense of the needy and the poor.A heavy film this may be, with the topics it raises quite controversial, but the story plays well, and illustrates through many strands of people, the difficulties of the situation and the downright final factor of greed that is the basic reasoning for the exploitation and nothing more. The acting is wonderful and Ralph Fienes makes a great on-screen couple with Rachel Weiss who plays the battling moral minded wife.If you seriously want to watch something intelligent and thoughtful, then this is for you. The revelations are startling, but we shouldn't' blind ourselves to them. A very good film that deserves to be widely seen..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meirelles' talent flowers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When one considers the contributors to this work, expectations are high and fortunately they are fulfilled in a quality work that is nevertheless somewhat dispiriting because of its sombre political message and doomed love affair.The story comes from the 2001 novel by reputed thriller writer John le Carre; direction is the work of the Brazilian Fernando Meirelles who gave us the stunning "City Of God"; the main roles are filled by Ralph Fiennes as Justine Quayle, the restrained, quintissentially British civil servant who would rather tend to his beloved plants than become too involved in political intrigue, and Rachel Weisz as Tessa, the passionate and mercurial political activist whom he marries almost without knowing her, both giving naturalistic performances that involve an element of improvisation; and then we have first rate support performances from Danny Huston as Justin's colleague who is also mesmerised by Tessa and Bill Nighy as the reptilian senior mandarin who wants to keep his garden free of weeds.The plot - part love story, part political thriller - is constructed through a series of extended flashbacks, so one's constant attention is demanded, and Meirelles - transposing his camera-work from the favelas of Rio to the shanty towns of Nairobi - uses his trademark kineticism to put us right among the squalor and the action. As Justin discovers more about the machinations that led to his wife's death, so her learns more about the nature of her life.The social issue at the core of the film is the pandemic of AIDS in Africa and the villains of the piece are the pharmaceutical companies who dump outdated drugs on poor Africans and manipulate the impoverished to take part in rigged medical trials. Yet the political betrayal is parallelled by the personal betrayal in a work that is as downbeat (but as impressive) as Fiennes'earlier movie "The English Patient". The ending seems somewhat contrived and melodramatic, but this is still superior fare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a love story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be unfair to say that this film is just a love story, but it would be false to state it is anything else but a love story --- a great, one of the greatest, love stories in the cinema.Yes, another theme is present: Africa. But, although the film is dedicated to "those who worked and died in Africa giving a damn", and although the theme is, alas!, realistic, the theme is above all a fiction, from a novel, and regarding it as more than that would be a mistake.A love story, I said: of course, the cinema accustomed us to great and passionate love stories, mostly trivial and girlish, a few of them wonderful. But where this film triumphs is in showing us how Love can only grow when two people end up knowing each other: no, not knowing the favourite colour, or the sexual fantasies in bed; but knowing the thoughts and the passions of the beloved one to such an extent to love each other DESPITE these opinions at the beginning, and BECAUSE of them eventually, even when they are originally so contrasting and opposite. A few miracles occur in everyday life and so sometimes we watch loves who continue existing after the beloved's death; this film presents us with an even bigger miracle, astounding to seem almost incomprehensible, that of a love that grows and reaches the perfection AFTER the death.It's also the film of the similarities and of the differences: Ralph Fiennes so similar (too much?) to the English Patient (I cannot imagine him without an exotic place like? Africa), and of course his touch of German reminded me of his role in the Schindler's list; Alberto Iglesias' score so different from those we were used to with Almodovar; the director so different (in themes at least, thanks God!) from his City of God.Oh, by the way, I like the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought John Le Carre's most recent previously filmed novel, "The Tailor of Panama" (2001), directed by the great John Boorman, was a real mess, but with a different director, the Brazilian Fernando Meirelles, of "City of God" fame, journeyman TV writer Jeffrey Caine and a strong cast, the film-makers here have succeeded in producing from a Le Carre novel an affecting love story as well as an angry outburst against Big Pharma ? the multinational drug companies.Much of the film is shot in Kenya ? in the slums of Nairobi and in the semi desert country around Lake Turkana. Meirelles takes full advantage of the bustling city and the near-empty desert, not to mention the flamingos. In one shot the camera pans from an immaculate golf course, across a railway line to the most incredible slum ? surely the golfers can smell it. This one shot encapsulates Kenya, a country with substantial resources which could be prosperous, but which is held back by its history, tribalism, corruption and outside interference. The Kenya of the movie, this correspondent can aver, is all too true. Parts of it are like the Garden of Eden, other parts are hell on earth.The heroine Tessa, played with great charm and conviction by Rachel Weisz, (who I have seen only once before in "Stealing Beauty" in 1996 and who hasn't aged at all), dies at the start and is seen mostly in flashback. Her lover and husband Justin the British diplomat and Constant Gardner, (Ralph Fiennes, mesmerizing), remembering more of the positive then the negative, falls in love with her more deeply after her death, bringing him to rage against injustice to a much greater degree than he ever did while she was alive. In a way the whole movie is a tribute to Tessa, who gave herself to the cause of third world health without considering herself for a moment.Even Geoffrey Rush couldn't save "The Tailor of Panama" but here the supporting cast -are merely an added bonus. Danny Huston, a strangely under-employed actor from a famous family, plays Justin's ambiguous colleague Sandy with great skill, and Bill Nighy, often in ambiguous roles, this time plays with great relish an out-and-out villain (British bureaucrat variety), Sir Bernard Pellegrin. Donald Sumpter does a nice friendly Tim the Spook, and Pete Postlewaite, behind a thick Afrikaans accent, is the murky Dr Lorbeer. Hubert Kounde plays the most handsome Belgian ever to appear on the screen, and Richard McCabe (I think) puts an interesting spin on the character of Rachel's loyal cousin Arthur.In the end the love story outweighs the polemic. Big Pharma is hardly to be trusted which is why we have an army of regulators keeping tabs on them, at least in the first world. As for the Foreign Office, its employees have been checking their moral principles at the door for the last 300 years in the name of National Interest. But Tessa and Justin, however little they may have achieved have at least followed their hearts, and that can't be a bad way to live one's life.</fullReview>

Unlike others on here I thought the direction was spot on, and other than the fact that the film went on 20 minutes too long I thought it did well to hold my attention - especially as it was a Friday night and I wanted a drink! As many have said the acting was tremendous. The only problem was that this film merely adds to the paranoia that is currently invading intelligent thought throughout the world. Saying 'drugs companies' in the same sentence as 'AIDS' and 'Africa' seems to have normally clever people sagely shaking their heads in the way they do whenever George W Bush or Iraq come up in conversation. Please see this film if you want to watch a thriller and be entertained. But if you're the conspiracy-theory type who believes that the world is run by a cartel of drugs companies, oil conglomerates, serpents with big heads who suck blood and George W Bush I think it's better you stay away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The pharmaceutical mafia in Africa is striking everyday, or nearly everyday. Remember the polio vaccinations. Public research and testing in France by Institut Pasteur in West Africa, Private research and testing in the USA in the Ex-Belgian Congo. The two species of monkeys used by the two labs were monkeys that are carrying the AIDS virus without being affected. To say that is already an anti-pharmaceutical crime. There used to be an article in an English medical magazine about that experimentation. All traces seem to have disappeared. Only Mandela used that practice to get some rebates on the anti-AIDS drugs in the early 1990s. The only way to find out would be to get all the old issues of English medical magazines, and American ones at the same time, and check over the last 25 years (at least) provided one issue has not been accidentally lost in some shredder. Even the Internet is a pretty dumb tool if you are not more informed than it is, at times. This film is about such a scandal in Kenya. To get drugs the people there are ready to do anything. If it can save the life of their children, and eventually made their life easier, they can accept any experimentation. And that happens all the time. Be sure that it happens in our countries too, but in our countries we use the final product after extensive testing on animals and with computers. The difference is that in our countries there are strict rules before, during and after that experimentation and if something goes wrong the responsibility of the lab is entirely complete and total. In Africa? ! Can you repeat please, we seem not have heard what you said. A girl gets involved in such a fight against a pharmaceutical trust and she disappears one day, and a few other people. Her husband tries to find the truth and does find it but he did not leave Africa where he was the victim of an accident: bullets from eight different guns. That's a good well organized and efficient accident. He had been prudent though and a certain clandestine secret report will finally come to the public, thanks to a little money under the table to a comprehensive black pilot: the man did not need that money since he did not plan to get out of Africa. That's probably the worst thing you can imagine about Africa. It is the most fascinating continent on this planet but it is also the most dangerous place to survive in. Gun smugglers are a horrible band of monsters but I believe pharmaceutical guinea-pig hunters are definitely a lot more inhumane and we cannot say we are not directly concerned: we are using these products everyday and most of them have been tested on African children, most of the time without them even knowing about it. By the way why is it said that Aventis is closing some chemical operation in Switzerland and opening the same in their factory next to my village in the Central Mountains of France? I guess regulations are not the same or if they are, the regulators may need glasses in France. The pharmaceutical vampires are everywhere and you cannot escape them.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I know all your secrets, Tess. I think I understand you now."When British diplomat Justin Quayle's (Ralph Fiennes) wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz) is found dead in Kenya, is starts him on a journey to uncover many secrets. Those of his wife, as well as others.&nbsp;The Constant Gardner truly deserves the label of an intelligent movie. Often, the viewer is given a bit of information presented one way, and only later sees how it truly fits into the mystery of Tessa's life, death, and the overarching story of unethical practices by pharmaceutical companies in Africa. The narrative is non-linear, going from the past to the present and back again, while weaving an ultimately touching story of Tessa and Justin's relationship within the framework of the bigger story. And that relationship ultimately becomes the soul of the movie. It's satisfying and expertly told, but it did take me a while to become fully invested in the plot. This isn't an action-heavy movie by any means, so don't watch with expectations of primarily that kind of entertainment.&nbsp;Special mention has to be made of the outstanding performances given by Fiennes and Weisz, as well as the beautiful African cinematography. The two actors really give a sense of humanity to their characters, and slowly reveal their complexity in a way that can only be described as impressive. And the movie itself is filmed in a realistic way that at times completely makes you forget that you're watching a film. &nbsp;&nbsp;The Constant Gardner is a thought-provoking political/conspiracy-thriller that hits the right notes and becomes more and more involving as it goes along. Even if this kind of movie generally doesn't appeal to you, the performances of Weisz and Fiennes make it required viewing.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You can't montage love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Constant Gardener shows us what happens when a film's moral argument outweighs its story. The film has a serious thesis it wants to express concerning the plight of Africans and the responsibility of pharmaceutical companies that supply them with drugs. There's nothing wrong with starting with a theme and creating a story from that. But it had better be a good story.In The Constant Gardener the writer chooses the thriller and love story on which to hang the thematic line. A diplomat's wife is killed and he sets out to find out who did it and why. This brings him into considerable danger of being killed himself. He learns that his wife had discovered truly horrible crimes committed by drug companies in Africa.To make this work, the writer has two big requirements. First he has to show that this was a great love between husband and wife, because the husband must risk his own death to finish the job his wife started. Second, the writer must come up with a detective plot that is full of reveals and surprises, or else the audience is going to see early on that this story is just an excuse to attack international drug companies in Africa.Unfortunately the writer fails in both of these requirements. The husband and wife meet at a lecture, go to bed together in the next scene, and then head off to Africa as husband and wife. The wife doesn't trust her husband enough to tell him about the secret investigation she is pursuing. And there is little evidence that their marriage is anything but a convenient connection between two good friends.It's one of the great rules of storytelling that you can't montage love. An audience can't intellectually know that two people love each other. They have to feel it, and that takes screen time. Without the foundation of a strong love between the two characters, the husband's quest to uncover the injustice, in the face of almost certain death, is emotionally unbelievable. And the quest driving three quarters of the movie just falls apart.The writer also fails to come up with a detective plot to justify the length of the story. Detective stories work by withholding information from the audience. If that information, in the form of reveals, is not surprising or shocking, the story feels like a giant stall. The wheels of the mechanism show and the audience gets impatient and bored. If the theme is top-heavy to boot, the lack of storytelling ability is fatal.FOR MORE REVIEWS, please visit www.truby.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trivial thriller abuses serious issues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I can say without giving too much away, that the core premise of this film is an assassination which initially appears to be a random act of violence, but is actually part of a systematic attempt to suppress the revelation of evil conduct by powerful companies in collusion with governments both in Africa and in Europe.There are indeed real world problems related to the premise of this film. For example, how companies have actually been shown to behave when they have internal information that could affect their sales, and the inequalities of power and specific conduct of international companies and Western governments in Africa.However, as a contribution to our understanding of these issues, the film ranks alongside "The Day After Tomorrow" in internal illogic and lack of credibility, a hysterical distraction from the problems it pretends to address.Beautifully photographed</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just had to watch this film for the cast and overall I enjoyed it. I was however surprised that it has such a a high rating! I have to say that something about the cover led me to expect another movie on the same grand scale as the The English Patent and so I felt let down to an extent. But even ignoring that comparison I think the rating at the time I am writing this is just too high. The one thing that I did not like was that at some point this movie veered into documentary territory for a short while before switching back to being a story. On the other hand I liked the dramatic end which made it all the more a good story. Anyway if you enjoy watching Ralph Fiennes, or just great drama, don't miss watching the English Patient when you have a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dark side of the world of clinical trials in third world countries where there are no 'murders' ... only 'accidental deaths'...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given the fact that the movie is from the director of 'City of God' - and the theme about corrupt drug companies 'using the third world countries as their playground for trials', the movie was not as per the expectation 'benchmark' set for the combination.Ralph Fiennes plays Justin, a diplomat and loves gardening. He meets Tessa (Rachel Weisz) who is strong willed and humanitarian. Then they fall in love (or at least the guy thinks that way but certainly not the gal..). Then they move to Kenya together and Tessa gets heavily involved with social workers there and gets murdered mysteriously while she was on a trip with one of her closest friend who happens to be male. With so many secrets left, Justin wants to find out what Tessa was doing which leads him to get to know about the report she was onto about the drug co's trails which killed people. And when she wanted to make it public.. corporate crime takes over.The concept / theme / story is great about the how the world 'disposes' the disposable and obsolete 'drugs' on disposable people of the third world countries and uses them as a playground for new 'trials' for building a more healthy civilization on the graves of the lesser mortals... but the movie at the end of it focuses more on 'love' and 'emotion' in the second half rather than focusing on investigative journalism to build on the fantastically built first half.Positives: 1) Good acting by Rachel Weisz 2) Thoughtful and not 'over the board' depiction of Africa 3) A good first half 4) good story - corporate greed and compromised government ethics 5) Good Political thriller in the 1st halfNegatives: 1) Bad second half 2) story line sways between 'love' and 'revenge for dead wife' and at last no one wins -- wonder how close they got to expose the scam and nothing happened (blood diamond did well in finishing that part properly)All said, a technically brilliant film (and a good haunting background score) but could have been much better had it not focused more on 'love part'. Go see it for the 'other side' of Africa apart from the the safaris ...6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually brilliant genre mix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a another brilliant work by Fernando Meirelles, the director of City of God. The genre is a mixture between an exciting engaging political thriller and a tragic love story. The director has done a superb job keeping the very complex storyline flowing and entertaining and at the same time slowly unfolding&nbsp; the emotional diagram of the protagonist's state of mind. The film is visually vibrant because it's not told chronologically but goes back and forth in time being resolved bit by bit as the film goes along. At the end there are no unclear or illogical parts and all the puzzle pieces fall perfectly into place. What touched and fascinated me the most was the deep emotional impact of the story. It's actually a film about discovery: The wife&nbsp; discovers the pharmaceutical scam but&nbsp;does not tell the husband in order to protect him. The husband discovers his wife (after she is dead) and learns to love her for what she really is while uncovering her tragic death. At the end he resolves the crime only to realize that his life is nothing without her.Because this movie is visually perfect and the story works on so many levels and haunts you for a long time after you leave the cinema I give it a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grass grows in the Garden</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Fernando Mierelles, director of the foreign critical hit City of God comes The Constant Gardener starring some of the UK's best actors, Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz. The film tells the story of Justin and Tessa Quayle, two people who have their lives thrust into a mission for justice and tangled in a web of deceit, betrayal and corruption. After the death his wife, Justin goes on a quest to answer the events surrounding his wife's death.Weisz plays the tenacious Tessa in the best performance of her career. The sheer humanity and charisma Weisz brings to her role, very reminiscent of Kate Winslet's early works is such a triumph. I only hope Weisz can be this good again in the future. The viewers have never seen her like this before. With previous works in The Mummy series, her mainstream status never gave us indication of how powerful she could actually be.Fiennes who has been a talent for the past decade or so is just as powerful as he's ever been. The idea of the film is the first half is all about Tessa and how the audience falls in love with her. We cling to her like a young child to his mother, following her around and making sure she's happy. It is until we lose Tessa that Justin becomes alive to us. He steps up to the plate as our father, who was never around when Mom was having a bad day. Mierelles has the film adopt the audience into its arms. The sheer tenacity to have a film do that is remarkable.Fiennes, previously nominated for Schlinder's List and The English Patient, has great range of emotions. When Tessa's on screen he's a tamed Indiana Jones, researching and trying to keep Tessa at bay. After his loss, he's a full fledged superhero, scoping all the possibilities and tending to the audience when he can. This is a remarkable turn for the actor and definitely awards worthy.Mierelles gives off a message of awareness and loss. Knowing who your family is, and not only who's in your household but adopting humanity and its problems. The scenery of Africa, thanks to cinematographer Cesar Charlone invites us all in to the environment. Editing by Claire Simpson keeps the story within reach and pacing just right. And a beautiful, different score by Alberto Iglesias leaves us aching with pain at the sight of Tessa's death and ugliness and beauty that exists on the continent.The title leaves much to be desired but at least there's a heart under there for some people to find. The Constant Gardener is a tremendous action of dramatic proportions.Grade: ***?/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A career diplomat(RAlph Fiennes) finds love in the opposite attraction to an out-spoken and tireless social-political reformer(Rachel Weisz,always beautiful but maybe at her most haunting here),and their relationship becomes marriage,becomes what seems family in Africa,only to fall apart when the wife dies in a mysterious and possibly suspicious plane crash and the husband begins searching for answers. The answers her learns starts pointing him to something much larger than him,his wife,their relationship or anything he was prepared to handle.Such is for this shaky-camera filmed,haunting and over-dubbed offering from director Fernando Mareilles and screenplay writer Jeffrey Caine(off of a JOhn LeCArre novel). This film(or story for that matter)doesn't seem quite sure if it wants to be focused on the man and his haunting,passionate and yet interminably doomed relationship with her,or make itself larger,exposing the evils of tansit governments and businesses and dark,duplicitous dealings of both. But it still tackles both with enough passion and imagery that will haunt most viewers. THe labyrinthine conspiracy that is uncovered seems to demand almost ZApruder-like attention,but otherwise,this movie(featuring nifty support from solid character actors as Bill Nighy,as a corrupt government official and Pete Postelthwaite as someone working among the natives of the impoverish Afriacan nation Fiennes works in)has character and grit,something that is sometimes in short supply in the movies. Worth the rent if you haven't caught it on the big screen or cable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>an other great political movie.this movie is subtle, beautiful, peaceful somehow ... and it dares to talk about the so called humanitarian aid, which many medical companies use to get free lab rats in countries where human lives are cheap. and no, this is not really fiction, those things even get to the "free" press sometimes.starting with a beautiful love story, which lacks any kitsch and could make a good movie on its own, it slowly gets deeper and deeper in politics and reveals more and more ugly details about our cultivated, civilized society.the director has the patience to let the story develop slowly and subtle, doesn't destroy it by pushing useless action inside.the love between the leading characters can be felt all the time in this movie, even after the way too early departure of Tessa ... calm, strong ... eternal.and only this departure has the power to force Justin out of his safe little world and make him confront things he willingly ignored.all this culminates in a sad, poetical in a way ending, somehow fitting the beginning.Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz are fantastic in their roles, Weisz gets rightly an Oscar for hers. (not that an Oscar means much to me ... there are plenty of great actors who never get one) i watched this one after lord of war and had thus pretty high standards for a political movie at the moment, but this movie stays not a step behind ... beautiful --- Arthur "Ham" Hammond: "So who has got away with murder? Not, of course, the British government. They merely covered up, as one does, the offensive corpses. Though not literally. That was done by person or persons unknown. So who has committed murder? Not, of course, the highly respectable firm of KDH Pharmaceutical, which has enjoyed record profits this quarter, and has now licensed ZimbaMed of Harare, to continue testing Dypraxa in Africa. No, there are no murders in Africa. Only regrettable deaths. And from those deaths we derive the benefits of civilization, benefits we can afford so easily... because those lives were bought so cheaply."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty strong message, pretty weak movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Constant Gardener is one of those movies with a message. Too bad the message is stuck in such a dull movie. In this case the message is about the plight of disadvantaged Africans being used as medical guinea pigs by big pharmaceutical companies testing their latest drugs. When those drugs end up killing people nobody seems to care. Nobody is there to stand up for the poor as they are killed so the rich can become even richer. This film certainly succeeds in making you feel sympathetic for those being taken advantage of. Unfortunately it succeeds in little else.The film begins with Tessa Quayle, the wife of a British diplomat in Kenya, being murdered. From here, before we go forward, we go back to find out exactly who this woman was and what led to her meeting her untimely demise. We will find that this was a woman with great passion and conviction, a woman who stood up and fought for those who could not fight for themselves. She would not stand idly by and watch the drug-makers get away with murder. And she ended up getting killed for her troubles. Eventually the film catches up with itself and returns to the time of her death. From there it is left to her husband, Justin, to unravel the mysteries surrounding her untimely demise and to continue her work exposing the atrocities occurring in the quest for the next big money-making miracle drug.It is a rather intricate plot, one which would seem to lend itself to a very interesting film. But for whatever reason it just doesn't work. The film is slow and plodding. For much too much of the time absolutely nothing of any significance is happening and the story fails to move forward. While the two lead performers, Rachel Weisz as the doomed Tessa and Ralph Fiennes as Justin, are both very good in their roles there is nobody else in the cast who really adds much to the proceedings. Characters pop up, make hardly any impact at all, and then reappear much later as Justin tries to uncover the real villains. You may have a hard time simply keeping straight exactly who is who. There is a point where Justin receives some unexpected help in his quest and you may well look at the guy doing the helping and and find yourself asking, "Who are you again?" The film does a terrible job of establishing any characters beyond Justin and Tessa. Their doomed romance, and Tessa's brave work, are at the heart of the movie. When Justin and Tessa are together is when this movie shines. Too bad they are together so briefly. Despite great performances from Fiennes and especially Weisz, despite some wonderful cinematography which really captures the desolation so critical to the story, and despite a story which seemingly had the potential to go to some very interesting places the film in the end falls flat. There is a fascinating setup but the story just fizzles out, never living up to the promise it appeared to have. You get the sense that this could have been a very good movie but in the end it falls short of that mark.</fullReview>

I realize that Africa is a continent with very much social and economical problems but why do producers always choose to character the population as a helpless and misery people.And this love thing between Raichel Waiz and Ralph Finnes? Why did she fell in love with him on the first place?Why did he became so interested in his wife's deals after her death?And by the way they look awful together.They don't match.I like Wize, because she 's the only actress who gives a damn about acting these days.Ralph is just an Englishman and that's the best he can do.Being himself. On the other hand , Mereilles is a great director.He made me see the final, any other director would'not have that luck.I admire his director eyes watching and showing Africa or England.He can definitely catch the spirit and the culture.And thank you for showing us that in Germany they speak German, not English.(like most Africans) I give this movie a 6 because it's trying to be something more than a political/love/social drama.And it's still drama, not melodrama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been in Kenya for several months and would like to comment on the accuracy of the film. I highly appreciated the extra efforts they had to take in order to truly convey Kenya in it's fullest. I recognize areas in Kibera, as well as Nairobi. They could have done without some of the inappropriate scenes, but I guess they felt that's what they needed to do. This film kept you engaged as you tried to piece of the puzzle together regarding pharmaceutical lies. The filmmakers also followed a rule of courtesy when filming in Kibera, as they were strongly respectful to those who live there. Watch the extras- they are well worth it.

Having said that, it is VERY well-made, with beautiful photography and innovative directing and editing. The crisis of health care on the African continent has never been shown so clearly to a wide audience, and history will prove this to have been an important film. Ralph Fiennes is excellent as the stolid civil servant married to an energetic, outspoken woman. Rachel Weisz, seen entirely in flashback, is marvelous as the woman passionately committed to an important cause, willing to do ANYthing to further that cause. The supporting cast has tremendous depth, and the authentic African locations have an impact which is, at times, almost shattering to the viewer. Don't skip over the ending credits, by the way.

In this case the multinational was a pharmaceutical company in which the film did not shine a kind light upon. This could possibly due to the director being from Brazil, a country that has had much difficulty with pharmaceutical multinationals recently. Brazil has been creating "knockoff" AIDS medicine that has violated copyrights of some pharmaceutical businesses.

How this didn't win best picture is just astounding to me, where does it lack the credentials? And it's a visual feast to boot, juxtaposing vividly shot, color drenched scenes of beautiful, and sadly horrible Africa with a jiggling shoot on the run style that gives a canny realism you don't see enough of in films nowadays. Rachel Wiesz so melds into her character that you cant help but wish for her a different ending than the foreshadowing opening scenes dictate. The film best recalls "Marathon Man" in that it is superb combination of story, film technique, casting and directing, they both force the viewer to pay attention and beg subsequent viewing to fill in the gaps and answer the nagging questions which come on a day or so after the initial viewing. Subsequent viewings allow you to see subtleties and nuances which are naturally missed the first time around. Rare is the film that begs me for a second or third look and rarer still is a film which forces the viewer to confront their assumptions and values without resorting to preachiness or cheap cinematic ploys</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a superb movie, a must-see movie. I had heard great things, and now I know why.I am not going to cover the plot as that has been done elsewhere. What I want to say is: There are mind-boggling beautiful shots of Africa from a plane. There are intense, "you-are-there" scenes inside crowded, crazed African cities. You are immediately mystified, fascinated, repulsed, saddened, angered, incensed, awestruck and dumbstruck at the Africa you see in this film. The story of greed, murder, deceit, big business vs. valiant challenger -- all components of it are played out at just the sort of pacing that makes you feel, "I better not leave my seat for a moment or I might miss something." Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes were superb, both of them flawless. It is a wonder that they managed to keep their health and good looks during what appears to have been a grueling shooting schedule. But they do, and they both give riveting performances.My only complaint, which others feel made the film edgy or exciting, was the hand-held camera shots, especially when Rachel and Ralph were at home, having sex, talking about Rachel's pregnancy, bath time, etc. I got this slightly irritating home video feeling, which bothered me. The sex scene in particular was lit so bright that I thought -- okay, people might have sex during the day with the sun streaming in, but does it have to be in blazing florescent light? But that aside, I felt that the cinematography, the acting, and, most importantly, the brilliant screenplay combined to make an absolutely excellent film experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While watching this movie on DVD I was hoping that the story was not true. Imagine such things happening in Africa just because 'our' western companies sacrifice everything to their profits. It came as a relief that the movie was based on a novel. Nevertheless I realized that in poor Africa life in a food camp and raids by bandits are probably 'common' events.A novel --- but after the relief I thought stories like these could be true. Look how western governments don't count for lives when their financial and economical interests are at risk. It made me think about our way of life. I wonder, am I also guilty of what's happening there? I assume that Tessa (Rachel Weisz) has a point in her disapproval of the war-waging British government in the beginning of the film.Nevertheless, this is also a brilliant movie with convincing performances by Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz. The views of the African landscape are stunning and I also fear that the shots of the slums in Nairobi are true to life. In spite of the sad ending a feeling remained that justice might be done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely a film that makes you think.I actually thought it was a true story at first,until i saw the closing credits and saw that it was based on a novel by John Le Carre.It wasn't a film i had been dying to see,so i knew very little about it.I wasn't disappointed as it turned out to be a good thriller.The film starts off quite slow,it begins with Ralph Fiennes at a business meeting where he meets Rachel wiesz who is a very strong willed woman who isn't afraid to speak out against the government.They start a relationship and then they marry.He is a British diplomat and she has her campaigns, so they go to Africa,where Rachel Weisz {Tessa} uncovers a treacherous plot that will kill millions of people.She is then found murdered.Ralph Fiennes {Justin}soon begins to realise that she was on to a big conspiracy so he starts to investigate himself, he then becomes a target .He eventually finds where the root of the conspiracy lies and its bigger than he realised.The consequences are tragic,as he to is killed.The acting between the two stars is first rate especially from Rachel weisz who won an Oscar.The directing is also very good,and the scenery breathtaking.Also what i found really interesting was how Ralph Fiennes character Justin transformed from a rather dull, quite, unadventurous type of man into a much stronger,radical heroic type.He was really believable and convincing as he went through these motions,i have never seen this sort of portrayal of a character done better.A good film all round.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece of Colors, Contrasts, and Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mirelle's film "The Constant Gardener" is, in many ways, a brilliancy.The direction, cinematography, casting, scoring and acting are all superb, and no performance is less than masterful. Many moments of this film would stand by themselves as cinematographic essays: the flock of birds over Lake Turkhana in the beginning, the roadside debris in the end, the AIDS players in their costumes, the single Masai crunching across the dry Turkhana lake bed, the brilliantly-colored montages of African third-world shantytowns. Visually, this film is a feast.Likewise, the acting is virtually flawless. The film's characters are fleshy, three-dimensional, flawed human beings; Quayle's struggle to overcome his stifling diplomatic tact is portrayed against the backdrop of his wife's struggle to overcome her self-righteous temper. Similarly each of the movie's other characters suffers from fatal human flaws: cowardice, cunning, greed, callousness, rationalization...each time a flaw is presented so, too, are its victims.If the film itself has flaws one is that it has a subtlety that, as with the book, many might not comprehend. We discover Tessa Quayle's character as Justin discovers her, and like Justin we are unsure at the beginning or even by the middle of the movie whether we trust her or not. It is only after duplicating her journey that Justin completely knows and loves his wife and in so doing discovers himself. And it is only after witnessing their journey that we are allowed to know them both. Unlike with most American cinema, until that point arrives we are left guessing.Other flaws include a slight preoccupation with cinematography over plot development, and an occasional excess of preaching that threatens the film-making. This film is, however, in most respects a masterpiece, and many of its lyrical scenes will stay vivid in your mind long after the credits are gone. "The Constant Gardener" is a feast for those who are hungry for something more than typical cinematic monotone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story that makes you think, artistic camera-work and beautiful setting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Constant Gardener" is a movie to think about. The plot story is about medicine given to people in the Third World preventing and treating AIDS. Very sensitive of the pharmaceutic industries. At least this is what everyone is to believe. Truthfully the western world isn't as thoughtful as this. It's a cheap and non-risking way to test medicine and get rid of out-dated ones. Perfect, for this won't harm any "First World"-people.This controversial plot combined with very artistic camera-work and using real beautiful scenes and settings, altogether makes this movie a masterpiece. Not the hype of commercial and overpaid actors, not the everlasting happy-ends and romancing of the good work the western countries do but a thorough and critical look upon ourselves.Really worth your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE CONSTANT GARDENER fulfilled my expectations and I am glad to add it to my best of DVD collection. The story begins slowly but turns more and more interesting, intriguing and especially dramatic. I was shocked seeing what happens in the very poor Africa and that all is still depending on the very rich and industrialized countries. I recommend everybody to see it. Ralph Fiennes and Raquel Weisz delivered a great performance and the director packed all the needed elements as love, emotions, intrigue, drama and suspense into a very touching thriller. Raquel Weisz won the Oscar and the film was nominated for 3 other Oscars. My wife loved it and me too. Rating: 7/10. If you liked it I recommend also TEARS FOR THE SUN or HOTEL RWANDA.</fullReview>

I felt the casting was also done perfectly, everybody seemed to fit their roles perfectly.My only complain arises when a few shots are not shot that well, there were a few scenes that made me feel that they were shooting a home made video. But other than that, the movie's storyline was great. It kept me guessing till the very end. I was very satisfied.This movie was also great because it made me think and reflect back on what is really going on in Africa. I knew that Pharmaceutical companies make twenty to thirty times the cost to make those medicines, but I didn't know it was that blatant. Definitely a heads up to those companies.Definitely a must see, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I started watching the Constant Gardener I didn't quite expect it to be the movie it quite turned out. Instead of the odd, typical Ralph Fiennes movie, this one turned out to be entirely different. Normally all Ralph Fiennes movie accompanies with a flurry of extremely powerful dialogs. Unlike the Constant Gardener where Fiennes looks like a silent character. More expressive acting than his normal on screen performance. Rachel Weisz instead gave a stellar performance. I was doubtful, whether he deserved that award, but now in hindsight, i don't think any1 deserved it any more than her. Bill Nighy gives a small role as the negative character scheming the death of both the Quayles... This movie is about Africa and it opens our eyes about the poverty of the continent and the discrimination they face. The innocent people suffering from the throngs of deadly diseases such as AIDS and TB, are tested upon like guinea pigs by the Multi National Pharmaceutical Companies. This movie is bound to touch a soft spot in your heart. A great great movie. Too bad it wasn't among the fore runners in the academy awards...9/10!!!</fullReview>

I always like Ralph Fiennes' performances, he outdoes him self here. Weisz of course is good we all know. There is no doubt this is one of the best films of the year and a necessary film at that. What sticks in my mind is "Did she really cheat on him?" Did Tessa cheat on Justin? If so with who exactly? Besides the kiss she gave the friend in his office what did she do??? Was it with the black doctor? Justin always considers the facts before him and despite being faced with evidence that she has cheated, he still continued his journey for the truth. But it still bugs me...did she cheat? Is there evidence that she did or did not?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is based on a book written by John Le Carre with the cast of Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz. Both of the main cast have performed an outstanding role in the movie. Ralph Fiennes plays a British diplomat named Justin Quayle and Rachel Weisz plays his wife Tessa. Tessa is a fiery individual and she hates the War on Iraq. They meet each other in a confrontational mode where in she questions the war on Iraq supported by the British government. Justin is a quiet diplomat who lives in own world, enjoys gardening and not really willing to express his own opinion. The opposite poles attract each other and they fall in love and get married. Justin gets send to Kenya. Tessa being a fiery individual starts some work on her own that she keeps a secret from Justin. And she gets killed for her work. This transforms the quite gardener into a person with steely resolve to find out her work and bring her work to the end. This movie is based on big pharma companies who exploit the African people to conduct experiments on them treating them as human pigs.I enjoyed this movie a lot. This is not a movie for people who wants fun and laughter. This is a grim movie and the grimness is maintained till the end of the movie. This movie will bring a whole load of emotions to you. It will bring you some laughter, will pale you with the injustice and make you angry at your own helplessness. This movie will make you wonder if a difference exists between human and animals. A though provoking movie and i would advice everyone to see this movie. Definitely i will rate this movie to one of the best i have seen so far.I heard that this movie has been nominated for 4 Oscars. So enjoy watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oscar Oscar!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rachel Weisz has gone from pretty face (Mummy) to an Oscar-worthy performance in this adaption from the le Carre novel. In a series of jumps and flashbacks, The Constant Gardener is a love story/redemption story in the context of international conspiracy and intrigue. Justin Quayle (Fiennes) is a soft-spoken diplomat, content on tending to himself, his garden, and keeping those around him happy and at a distance. Confrontation is one thing Justin avoids at all costs, until he meets hot-headed young Tessa who challenges him at a lecture, and their accidental meeting turns into a more intimate affair. Falling for each other, Justin must move to Africa and Tessa asks, no demands, that he take her. They're off, married, and pregnant. Soon, we discover (in the first few minutes), that Tessa's been murdered, and the list of friends and foes are intertwined. Justin must confront his own suspicions and demons, both professional and personal, in order to finally understand his wife, her love, and his own soul.The cinematography is amazing, the colors lush, the music seductive. Weisz is mesmerizing. Solid performances by Danny Huston and Bill Nighy (quite a turn from his character in Love Actually).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film and I was blown away, overwhelmed, saddened, heartbroken and yet left with a sense of hope by it. I believe now that the purpose of a film should be its truth and not whether or not it will win any accolades. That said, Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz throw themselves into their characters as though their real lives depended on it. I do not know if anybody else noticed this but after Tessa (played by Weisz) meets her demise, Justin (played by Fiennes) sort of becomes her. He channels the very essence of everything that is Tessa and uses this to complete her most passionate yet unfinished work. The film encapsulates the very beauty and tragic aspects of the lives of the star-crossed couple yet the beauty and vulnerability of Kenya is not to be overlooked either. This film tells a tale of the ills of society, the evil that men do and how it lives after them. It's an honest and raw portrayal of what happens to the poor man if his fate is left to the rich man. Prepare yourself to see life through the eyes of the constant gardener.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It'll seem like a nonfiction account</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ralph Fiennes plays a reserved British diplomat (and gardener of the title) whose activist wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz) is murdered in deepest, darkest Africa. Who did it? Was it her driver and partner-in-outrage? Was it a group of bandits, common in the area? Was it a sinister government operative? Justin Quayle is haunted by the suspicion that his wife had been unfaithful in the months preceding her death. He knows that she had been working with local AIDS activists in Kenya, but after her death he decides to look into the matter a bit more carefully, deciding against leaving the matter in the hands of the British High Commission, for which he works. This laconic gardener tries desperately to understand what his wife was up to, and perhaps who or what caused her imminent demise.Fiennes is excellent as the quiet Justin, a man who's always been resigned to circumstances - as opposed to Tessa, who's always shaped her own circumstances. Fiennes has a very expressive face, saying so much with so few words, that one does get a fuller sense of what his character was going through - and what he was up against. But in this movie, he takes a backseat to the acting chops of Rachel Weisz - who knew? I mean, who could tell that the strong female sidekick of movies like The Mummy and Constantine, the requisite love interest, would outact Ralph Fiennes, who seems to be a perennial Oscar contender? The gripping story, adapted by Jeffrey Caine from John Le Carre's novel, takes the viewer through several areas of Africa and Europe, spectacularly filmed (particularly the final scenes). Sure, it's a Le Carre novel, but the beautiful cinematography and crisp editing - not to mention the timeliness of the plot, in a world full of conspiracies du jour - make all of the events seem chillingly plausible. The dual themes of love and betrayal are well represented here.Weisz was nominated for an Oscar, and the movie also received nods for best adapted screenplay, best original score, and best editing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr Qualye is an English ambassador in Kenya and life with his wife, which is an activist of human rights. When she appears killed in a hidden place in the desert, he decides to end the job his wife was doing and to discover the truth about a pharmaceutic company which makes research in Kenya. The story is very touching and moving, it results totally convincing and it is a voice of alarm about the things we are doing to our world. (please, everyone, take notice!). In addition the actors, specially Ralph Fiennes, make a great part, which makes this movie more interesting indeed. Unluckily, the action results too much slow, which can make it sometimes boring, a greater rhythm would have made it more interesting, so it could have sent its message to more people. However, this is a good film, recommended for all the people that love the protest-movies. This is one of the best of this genre.

		<shortDescription>Wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Constant Gardener is one of the years best films and I would even go far enough to say it's one of the best thrillers ever made. Thrillers are not the strongest genre around and have less masterpieces than almost any other but they too have a couple like The Constant Gardener and The Fugitive. To have a good thriller you need to have it be thrilling and suspenseful plus to make you think. Most thrillers don't get one of these two things right much less both. But The Constant Gardener really gets both right and it also really makes you care about the characters. The screenplay is wonderful really getting into the story with great dialogue and character development. You really care about everyone, even the dead people like Tess played by Rachel Weisz. I had thought it would be hard to really care about a dead person you only see in flashbacks. The performances could be part of it because they are nearly flawless. Ralph Fiennes in particular is wonderful as Justin. The scene where he gets the news about his wife's death is one of the most powerful scenes in years because of the performance. Rachel Weisz and Bill Nighy are both also very strong in there performances. The direction is on the other hand the strongest point of the movie. Fernando Meirelles is a wonderful director and this is his crowning film. A great and very entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far too Intellectual for it's own good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Constant Gardner disappointed me a little. I mean I don't know what I was expecting and being it has critics raving and rumors of Academy Award nominations I should have known it wouldn't be quite as action packed and mainstreamed as the DVD box cover would have me believe but I picked it up anyways and I have to say I think I believe firmly that The Constant Gardner is probably one of the most intellectual films I have ever watched. In what appears to be his first English film Brazillian director Fernando Meirelles makes a film that is controversial and interesting, with a conspiracy theory story line unlike anything else. For the real intellectual film goer, this one has to be absolute gold!! I don't mean to say it had no entertainment value, only that for the majority of the mainstream public they won't like it, which says more about their level of attention than the films (including me I think.) Ralph Fiennes is terrific, and captivating as UK Diplomat Justin Quayle whose wife is brutally tortured and murdered in a seemingly random attack. But as he digs deeper into his wife's life he discovers that she was onto something far bigger. She was desperately hunting down an enormous Pharmaceutical company that is testing a dangerous, even deadly, TB drug on African citizens who in their opinion are dispensable. At first it would appear that his wife was perhaps unfaithful, unmoral and involved with other men but as the story unfolds he discovers his wife's very deep love for him and for the African people and her desire to do the right thing. Fiennes does a very deep and emotional role as the haunted widower, and the investigator and he's interesting enough to watch. Apparently Rachel Weisz is getting all the love and hype playing Fiennes feisty wife Tessa. She is good, and Weisz has been good for a long time, her performances are always very well done, but I don't think Constant Gardner is her best work by a long stretch. Her performance is very good, very real and convincing and you really believe she is heart strong about her cause but she's only, at best, supporting Fiennes character, as her own character is killed off early in the film. The rest of the supporting cast performs their parts admirably but no one stands out quite as much as Fiennes and Weisz. Screenplay writer Jeffrey Caine does a terrific job as firmly establishing their relationship, how they met, their quick marriage and their love and respect for each other to truly understand Quayle's intense mission to finish his wife's wishes. Their chemistry together is very good, and their love story very passionate especially as it unfolds through him discovering possible infidelity to discovering that's not the case at all...he falls in love with her all over again.The story is where the intellectual part comes in. It's the kind of story that could have been done with Bruce Willis or Sly Stallone directed by Jerry Bruckheimer in an hour and a half with things blowing up everywhere but it's not done like that at all. Instead it's done with such shocking reality, and a twisted plot about a intricate conspiracy that unfolds each minute right up to the very last of the film. I found the last half of the movie far more interesting than the first but it still unfolds at a very slow speed and although beautifully filmed in Kenya the setting doesn't change much so it makes for a little less interesting. It all rests on Fiennes to keep things interesting and while he's very good at this role, it's not meant to be intensely entertaining but deliver a very real message. So if you want true artistic masterpiece with a real intellect to it you'll love The Constant Gardner and I am sure that it will bring home the awards or at the very least nominations. 7/10</fullReview>

There's a difference between being a noble martyr to a cause, and being a borderline sociopath who winds having things blow up in her face and taking everyone around with her. Her cause was very good, but somehow the execution was something else.No matter. You see the shady doings of Merck, Glaxo, etc here-Vioxx anyone?!-it's easy to make the leap from passive audience to suspending your disbelief and accepting the villainous roles here by 'KDH' and 3Bee's.I very much liked the location filming, the acting was great all around, plus the director's trademark flashy camera-work certainly sucks you in. Film might meander too much in places but it does always get you back to where you need to go. Bummer ending though.***1/2 outta ****, this with 'Hotel Rwanda' and 'Syriana' or 'Traffic' would make for a pretty strong film-fest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There will be no Best Film Oscar for The Constant Gardener, no Best Actor Oscar for Ralph Fiennes. The Academy likes a love story, not a political thriller. It is unfortunate, as The Constant Gardener is both in every sense of the word.Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz were superb! However, Fiennes may have to settle for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as Lord Voldemort in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. This is little consolation for someone who has distinguished himself in such films as Quiz Show, Schindler's List, and The English Patient, as well as this film.Weisz, who has already won a British Independent Film Award for her role, and is nominated for a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award also, has no real chance for an Oscar against Michelle Williams in Brokeback Mountain, but may take the Golden Globe Award.This film will leave you angry, as it should. Even those who stay on top of what is going on in the World will be touched. Those who live in a perpetual fog will be shocked. The lives of Africans have always been cheap, and their own people have always be ready to sell them out for some temporary pleasure. Jared Diamond showed us how things could be improved in Guns, Germs and Steel, but that would remove them as a testing ground, now, wouldn't it.I believe it was a comment Nigel made to Isabel in Bewitched, if I recall, that home is the place where you were the happiest. Justin found that in The Constant Gardener. He went home to Tessa. That's the love story in the adventure and it was beautiful. A film not to be missed.</fullReview>

It was so powerful and emotional. Although it is hard to change the facts in the film, at least we are aware of them and I think that, that is important in itself. The people of Africa are seen in a more graceful light, these people that we disregard are absolutely gorgeous.

		<shortDescription>Engrossing story.....excellent drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is deserving of recognition as one of the best movies of 2005. I expected a lot from the film and wasn't disappointed. It ventures over several countries of the world with filming locations, robust settings, scores of extras and people. Its real weight comes with its dramatic handling. Ralph Fiennes deserves recognition for some great acting. Rachel Weiz was also good as more of a supporting role. The photography is first rate and the storyline is dynamic not always moving linearly but rather in terms of his Justin's emotion and memory. I thought it kicked into a high gear with Fiennes trying to discover about himself and the mystery of his wife. The movie nicely sets up the lead character and keeps well on the path of his self-discovery and desire to know the truth rather than revenge or action. At its heart this movie works best as a drama with thrilling elements. Showing their relationship through his memory, naivety, and trust provides background and motivation for characters and a definite emotional link and impact to the lead. The ending might be overly dramatic, but is powerful and believable given what we've learned about the character Justin. Excellent - worth a purchase - definitely a rental.</fullReview>

I believe all the beauty of this movie is because it is saying something to people, so, of course in an artistic way, and if any one in this world that have seen this movie wants to criticize it as just some camera movements or perfect editing or any thing else, they actually haven't got the point. I believe the point of this movie is just to yell at us"WAKE UP!!!!!!!!!!" and see around what is going on. It is definitely a wake up call. Beautiful, Beautiful movie, But let's listen to it before watching it. We have seen City of God before from Fernando Meirelles. He is really a genius in making the space, the environment, and he does it with any thing he has in his hand. As all you could see the editing is just perfect, and each shut was perfectly chosen and set designed. Lighting is just great and Ralph Fiennes is the most perfect in close ups and lots of close ups.

		<fullReview>I'm going to be extremely brief about this one (how unlike me) ... it's one of the top 10 movies of 2005 and needs to be seen by anyone who can enjoy a film that's both gut-wrenching, heartfelt, moving and full of suspense. Pure, brilliant cinema! ... damn, I need to have 10 lines of text ... Well, I didn't care much for Ralph Fiennes in The English Patient (though I loved the movie) but in this film he hits all the right buttons. As for Rachel Weisz, somebody please save her from idiotic blockbusters such as The Mummy (I'll excuse her for Constantine because I happened to like that one ... sorry) and cast her in more of these parts. Because however small her role may be, she really does leave her mark on the film. Once again : fantastic movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This an old-fashioned thriller, filmed in a rather old-fashioned way. Mean people would call it 60s stuff, if it wasn't for the subject: Medicine companies who are testing their medicines on Africans, thereby saving millions. Of dollars and pounds, that is. Laboratories are expensive.Ralph Fiennes is doing a British diplomat, who doesn't care much, not even about his career. But his wife is killed and there is a reason for it, but not the reason he maybe thought of in the beginning.The problem with this movie is that it never really gets exciting. The plot holds together, like an old-fashioned thriller should, but the tempo is slow. You have thoughts about capitalism and Tony Blair when you leave, but you haven't really seen a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Constant Gardener" is an ambitious movie, attempting to be a combination of thriller, romance, and message film. Fortunately, it mostly succeeds. Though the film's action ranges across two continents and its plot deals with corporate scheming in the globalized world, it also has an intimate, human feel. This is achieved by focusing on two characters, mild- mannered diplomat Justin and his activist wife Tessa.Fernando Meirelles' flashy directing style may take a little getting used to, but he has a great visual flair?whether photographing the harsh beauty of arid African landscapes and teeming city slums, or the more conventional beauty of Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz. He has also prompted these actors into giving two wonderful performances. Weisz does not shy away from the task of portraying a heroine who does unlikable or foolish things; Fiennes gives a convincing depiction of Justin's political awakening. Though Justin and Tessa initially seem mismatched, their romance eventually becomes very real and moving. So many love stories are either cynical or sentimental; "The Constant Gardener," happily, is neither.My only problem with "The Constant Gardener" is its plot?usually the most satisfying part of a thriller, but the least satisfying part of this film. Certain sequences could be much more suspenseful (it feels like we learn what the bad guys are up to much too early), and other moments that are meant to be suspenseful just feel contrived (such as when nomads decide to raid an obscure African village at the very moment Justin goes there in search of information). Still, the message about corporate corruption is an important one, and the skilled actors and interesting direction make "The Constant Gardener" well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off. This is hardly "trivia": considering what I have just seen:"After filming, the Constant Gardener Trust was set-up to help the inhabitants of the slums near Nairobi where the crew had been filming."There is a film doing the rounds called "Charles Darwin's Nightmare". I have yet to see this movie but in summary its about the end of the human race, and focuses on Lake Victoria. Constant Gardener has managed to capture the deprivation of African peoples without ramming it down anyone's throat. Treats the subject of big pharma exploitation with sensitivity and in a word its an EXCELLENT film.I enjoyed the film for many reasons. I captures Le Carre's writing, it is moving, funny and and passed my test of " it felt real". I forgot who the actors were and sat there wrapped. An example might be the conversation on the food drop aircraft between Fiennes and the pilot. Easy to find reality there.Brilliant film.Bill</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is absolutely amazing! Reason being is that no matter how much the Left wants to accept it as a Liberal film and some of the Right want to reject it as liberal nonsense, the reality is that this movie is neither. This movie is simply an exercise in trying to open people's eyes.It does show drug companies as being somewhat greedy and allowing unstable drugs to be tested on the people of Africa who seem "disposable." But, the truth is the truth and sometimes it forces all of us to see what we don't want to.Politics aside, this movie is gripping in all aspects. Ralph Fiennes is on the highest marks as Justin Quayle ? he really makes you care about what his character is searching for. Rachel Weisz, though not given the biggest part, is great. The supporting cast, such as Bill Nighy, is also quite amazing. Not to mention how great the cinematography is.The scenes in Kenya are amazing ? the people, the life, and the natural beauty. The film is a full throttle thriller, but is also based in a very human story of how we need to realize some of the injustices that happen every day and do what we can to change it.Being of Kenyan descent, the movie moved me to tears. The seriousness to which the director shoots the scenes totally lets the audience get what he is trying to portray. Some of the scenes would appear cliché however I grew up in Kenya and could totally relate to the surroundings. Its a refreshing breath of fresh air to see a work of art come into the scene, I wish many more people would go and see this picture. It truly is a masterpiece. Well done to the directors and actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good adaptation of an excellent book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How do you translate 500 pages of dense plotting into 2 hours of screen time - you don't. You produce a very fine film with a few of the themes of the film picked out. While the book is equally detailed on the personal journey of Justin's self re-discovery and redemption on the one hand and a corporate political thriller about corruption on the other, the film sacrifices the detail of the thriller to allow luminous performances of Feinnes and Weitz to flourish. One cost is the virtual disappearance of Arnold, the black doctor, as a character ? he is confusingly referred to as the Belgian in the film, but the history of this appellation is never explained. Even more seriously Kenny is given a, totally out of character, crisis of conscience as a transparent plot device to cover many chapters of missing story where Justin painfully learns what to do next, rather than being told by his nemesis. Ghita's character is also marginalised ? is this a pattern that it is the non-white characters who disappear into the background In exchange we get brilliant cinematography (and if one of the film's Oscar's doesn't go to César Charlone ? there is no justice). The vibrant colour of the scenes in the Kenyan shanty townships, and particularly the image of the railway track through them, the oppressive muted tones of the London club and the rapid fire images from the Eurostar train are three of many that stand out. Bill Nighy does supercilious better than anyone else in the industry and does all that we expect of him, but Feinnes is a revelation doing far more than expected, subtly growing and changing through the film. Weitz also does very well, but her character changes less in the screenplay than it does in the book, where her perseverance is gripping ? in the film the evidence appears on a plate, not wrung out drop by drop from a corrupt and all-enveloping net of corporations and governments. My advice is to read the book, so you know the subtleties of the story; then do not miss this magnificent, if abridged screen version and enjoy the sounds and colours of Africa and Europe.This is Le Carre at his best, much darker than even the grimmest of his cold war thrillers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Constant Gardener is an ambitious film that tries hard but unfortunately falls a little short of being a terrific film. It does succeed in making its point that when money is concerned the little guy doesn't matter. That message it drives home well and that seems to be the purpose of the film.Although the story is complicated and told in flashbacks there are two main plots. A love story between Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz and a conspiracy thriller about her disappearance.I think the first 2/3rds of the film succeeds very well but the last section doesn't quite live up to what came before. Which is a shame because you want this movie with all its effort and fine acting to achieve greater things. But it just misses.Still, this is an excellent movie and well worth seeing. You'll come away saddened but with a lot to think about. The Africa that is portrayed is not pleasant but it will open your eyes.Director Fernando Meirelles, Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz and the movie will surely get Oscar nominations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Constant Gardenerreviewed by Sam Osborn -www.samseescinema.comrating: 4 out of 4Director: Fernando Meirelles Cast: Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Danny Huston, Daniele Harford, Hubert Kounde Screenplay: Jeffrey Caine (John Le Carre) MPAA Classification: R (language, some violent images and sexual content/nudity)While I was at the Telluride Film Festival, I spoke with Focus Feature's Director of National Publicity, Harlan Gulko about Fernando Meirelles' new film, which I hadn't seen at the time, The Constant Gardener. All Gulko could say about the project was, "Fernando Meirelles is a rock star." After thinking about that response, I suppose that's really the only way to describe such a director: a rock star. Meirelles' last film, City of God (Cidade de Deus), was the project that launched him into the American film scene, earning him a nomination for Best Director at the Academy Awards. The film was so affective and heartbreaking that it caused the President of Brazil to begin an effort to better the living status of Rio de Janeiro's suburbs. But as "message" oriented the film was, there was more story than moral. I think the same can be said of his latest outing, The Constant Gardener. The film exploits the evils of pharmaceutical corporations to great effect, but allows the core of the story to focus on a man's growing love for his wife after her murder. The film is based on acclaimed spy thriller novelist John le Carre's book of the same title. Having never read any of le Carre's writing, all I can say in terms of its adaptation is that it's gotta be a pretty damn good book to live up to what Meirelles has done with it. I can scarcely imagine a version without Meirelles' lush, mesmerizing visual style. It opens with a shot of a mangled jeep smoking in flames, ruined in the middle of the North African Desert. In a town in Nairobi, Sandy Woodrow (Danny Huston) enters Justine Quayle's (Ralph Fiennes) office at the British High Commission and informs him that the corpse of his wife, Tessa (Rachel Weisz) was just found mutilated in the desert, with her guide Arnold Bluhm (Hubert Kounde) missing from the scene. To tell you any more would give away secrets. Suffice to say that Justin begins to look further into the investigation and realizes there may be more to it than what the British High Commission tells him.Up against other conspiracy thrillers like The Interpreter, The Constant Gardener's holes don't really go too deep. The solution to the mystery is essentially revealed very early in the film, with the specifics being fleshed out later. The real story, and what the film primarily focuses upon, is Tessa. The identity of her killer is figured out easily, but what she was doing as she was killed is where the real conspiracy lies. Meirelles, as is common with non-western filmmakers, ends the film abruptly. This will simply leave some audiences choking in the dust of the credits (as it did to me), but give yourself some time to think it out and the complexity of Tessa's story will hopefully come together. But Tessa's story goes beyond her involvement with the pharmaceuticals, and most affectively lies in her love for Justin. In the opening act, their relationship seems mismatched; Justin being the quiet, diplomatic type that would rather push papers and policy than do grunt work on the streets, and Tessa being exactly the opposite: an Amnesty International activist spending most of her time on the streets of Nairobi with the citizens plagued by TB. But when Tessa dies, Justin seems to take on both roles. He learns what she was fighting for and falls further and further in love with her, making the story more and more tragic. The screenplay works this story arc with flashbacks to Justin and Tessa's relationship through the years, causing our emotions to parallel Justin's because of the non-linear storytelling Early on, Mike Newell (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) was considered for the film's director. Honestly, I don't believe The Constant Gardener would be half of what it is without Fernando Meirelles. His sense of visual style is so incredibly honed that with every shot he achieves the scene's tone before a single word is spoken. His cinematographer, Cesar Charlone's, hand-held work elevates scenes into a visceral, hyper-realistic version of reality. There are also some interesting motifs with colors that continue throughout the film. Different locales can be identified simply by their color palettes. Some will probably call Meirelles' style overbearing and distracting. But, in my opinion, his version of The Constant Gardener is elegant. For a storyline that focuses on exploits in poverty-stricken North Africa, Fernando's style is almost imperative for telling John le Carre's story with complete justice. -www.samseescinema.com</fullReview>

There is an Americanized ending to the movie that ties everything up in a nice neat bow but that can be forgiven under the glare of commercial demands.In particular, the performances of Ralph Fiennes and Rachael Wiesz are Oscar-worthy efforts.

		<fullReview>"The Constant Gardener" is a love story.Justin Quayle, played by Ralph Fiennes, is a diplomat, in the employ of the British Foreign Service. He is also a gardener. He is not a gardener in the sense that he applies his skills for other people for pay. He enjoys gardening as a way of escaping from the world. Gardening, growing flowers, and caring for plants is his avocation. Gardening requires patience and determination. It is a labor that demands his greatest attention, patience, and love.Near the beginning of the movie "The Constant Gardener" Justin meets Tessa. Tessa, played by Rachel Weisz, is a beautiful Woman full of courage and conviction. Where Justin is something of an introvert, Tessa is an extrovert.Justin and Tessa are ideological opposites. Justin is a certified member of the Establishment. Tessa is a rebel who challenges Establishment authority. In their first scene together, she challenges him as a representative of his diplomatic agency.Nonetheless, they become lovers and eventually marry. Still they remain estranged. Justin seems to have difficulty communicating. Later, he intercepts an email, intended for his wife that suggests that she may be having an affair. She is not, nor does she ever violate his trust in her, but he does not know this until the resolution of the movie.The movie itself is divided into two halves. In the first half Tessa is murdered, by persons unknown. This part of the movie presents us with the relationship between Justin and Tessa.The second half of the movie begins with Justin seeking the truth about his wife's death. In the course of his search he encounters corporate conspiracies and other forms of intrigue. Although he receives warnings to stop his investigation, he continues. It is in this respect that we understand that he is "The Constant Gardener". Always turning over earth. Always persevering. Just like a gardener.Eventually, Justin uncovers the nature of the conspiracy that killed his wife. And as he does, he also realizes that his discoveries, as they are observed by others, will mean his own death.The ending of this movie is a thing of beauty. Justin, estranged from his wife and seeking the cause of her death, finally understands her.This movie is a great love story, intertwined with modern themes of corporate and international intrigue.I recommend it highly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Constant Gardener (2005)Everyone in the business was wondering what Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles would pull out next, after his astonishing and difficult City of God. Well, almost as if to prove he isn't just a Brazilian director, and to broaden his chops in terms of style and pace, he moves into international corporate intrigue via the British diplomatic service in Africa.And it's a harrowing tale, deeply romantic and yet layered with that global intrigue that is disturbing and overwhelming for anyone in the middle of it. The lead in nearly every scene is Ralph Fiennes, and he gives a typically wry, warm, introverted performance (those seem like contradictory words, but that's part of what makes him interesting, if not always charismatic or breathtaking). In this sense, he defines the inner believability of what is admittedly a sensational plot. Not that the idea of pharma companies running illegal and lethals trials on the unwitting is so unbelievable, but it gets simplified here, and we depend on Fiennes's character, the middle level diplomat Justin Quayle, to hold us in there. The story has a richness to it, mixed with a vividly personal touch, that is the hallmark of novelist John Le Carre, whose book started this project.I say project, and it really was a sprawling undertaking, something along the lines of The English Patient, also starring Fiennes, covering continents inside and out, and seeing the story in both intimate and epic ways. It is worth saying that the rest of the cast is remarkably well chosen, and their roles, even that of Quayle's wife (Rachel Weisz), are brilliant if secondary (Weisz often appears as a silent memory). Furthermore, the camera-work and editing create an instability that is unaffected and very effective, a visual masterstroke, relentless and yet elegant, scene after scene. It's a movie you could study for its technical heights, or just absorb appreciatively.However, after all this unashamed praise, it must be said that the movie drags its heels a bit. I tried hard to see why, and I think it actually is because the main turns of the plot, dealing with the illegal drug trials and the interpersonal intrigues of love, are quite clear and simple once they arise. That is, all the extremes of acting and movie-making and changes of scenery and lighting, all the velocity implied by the presentation, proceeds in a narrative sense very sluggishly. The facts are interspersed at great distances. This is a weird realization, but it explains (for me) why the movie falls short of leaving you panting and dazed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is exciting but largely because Fernando Meirelles has overlaid it with so much pizazz. It's very difficult to chart one's way through the corporate and political chicanery. The dialogue is fast and perpetually sidelined by post-produced diving about. Occasionally this is effective. More often than not it's distracting.Fiennes is very good indeed. In most films he plays his end-of-empire stalwart but manages subtle but comprehensive mutations just beneath the skin which can make him tough, psychotic or, as here, wet but transformed by love. I believed him. I also believed Weiss (as did the Academy) who's charming. I didn't believe their relationship though, which is rushed by Meirelles. Further safe casting occurs with Huston (cad), Postlethwaite (earthy shaman) and Nighy (scheming).Africa - Kenya - is shot very nicely, using the vibrant indigenous palette and the locals are seamlessly incorporated in improvised sequences on location (as one might expect of the director of City of God). I just didn't buy it though. 5/10</fullReview>

While there is some suspense the focus seems to be more on political and social issues! The thriller aspects are fair but not as surprising as I wanted it to be! While the plot is important it is the actors that make it all happen! And I am not going to say that Weisz or Fiennes were the better actors,because the the whole cast was quite good! When Fiennes decides to solve the mystery we get to find out what the mystery is but more importantly we get more insight into the relationship of Fiennes and Weisz! Together with Fiennes we gradually find out what Weisz was about! This discovery is far more gratifying than the whole mystery plot which was impressive but not really original! A special mention I have to make is that the scenery is amazing! We see the usual images of Africa we know from the news! But we also get to see beautiful landscapes that aren't so familiar! I liked this movie but I can imagine that this movie won't be for everyone! The political content shows realism and offers no escapism! Not many people want to see serious issues like this in a movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Constant Gardener is an interesting case of strong direction and performances managing to paper over plot holes and some serious lapses in credibility. It's hard to imagine the two central characters ever finding themselves together anywhere but in a writer's wishful thinking, and the investigation into drugs' companies faking trials in Africa relies perhaps too heavily on slips of the tongue or the odd incriminating document or conversation, yet between the edgy but genuinely energetic direction, the better performances and the subject matter, it's surprisingly powerful and involving and definitely one of the best John Le Carre adaptations. Perfectly cast, Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz's limitations work for the roles for once: his awkward, half-apologetic shtick and her over-zealous head girl act are as right here as they are irritating in too many other films. Not all the casting or performances are as good, however, with Bill Nighy showing again why he's better in light comedy than in straight drama. Danny Huston shows some awkward beginnings before overcoming them and fully inhabiting his pathetic role as a spineless lovestruck embassy official ? the accent seems a little too affected at first before wearing in. Well worth investigating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating story and all too true, but a miss nevertheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ralph Fiennes is "The Constant Gardener," a 2005 film about a man trying to get to the bottom of his wife's death. Based on a John Le Carre novel, it concerns a woman (Rachel Weisz), who is a tremendous activist working in an African community. She becomes aware that a drug company is testing an experimental drug on the population there and that people are dying because of it. Then, suddenly, she dies in an accident...but it wasn't an accident.This is an extremely disturbing story with elements of the harsh truth. As someone who researched a book on Dr. Larry Mellon who ran a hospital in Haiti, I can say that he often received calls from drug companies wanting to test drugs on his population! Granted, I'm not sure the companies believed these peoples' lives were worthless - the drugs being tested were no doubt AIDS drugs and with so many people ill from the disease in Haiti, they had a built-in clinical study. The drug companies in this film are not depicted that way, nor should they be, as they merely want to save the cost of expensive clinical trials and cheat on the results to clear the drug with the FDA - something that is also done in the real world.Though the film stars two powerful actors in Fiennes and Weisz, it moves very slowly and is somewhat confusing particularly in the beginning. Weisz is such a refreshing actress, with her full body, natural beauty, and strong persona, she is always a pleasure to watch, particularly in a role like this, that of an angry woman who wants something done for the better good. Fiennes is great as a husband who first discourages her involvement and then is forced to become an activist himself, to avenge her death and finish her work.The rest of the acting is very strong as well, but I'm afraid that until the end, I was not as involved in "The Constant Gardener" as I should have been. Perhaps if I had been watching it under different circumstances, but unfortunately, the two people I was watching it with could not follow it AT ALL, and I had to keep explaining the plot and who was who. Well, that in itself says something.</fullReview>

It's sadly downhill from there, as we trudge through a ploughed field of stereotypes - the perfidious FCO man (who looks a bit like Gordon Brown - that was funny), Sandy, the naughty British businessmen who cant seem to say anything with more than 4 letters, the condescending portrayal of the Kenyans and the little infra-dig digs at 'racism'.....Instead of this rather weedy excuse for spending a lot of money, try watching 'Noi Albinoi'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depressing - but an excellent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been waiting to see The Constant Gardener for a long time - my DVD rental people managed to take about 8 months to send it! It is not the type of film I usually watch, I am not too keen on overly political films, but the reviews of it had been so good I thought it must be worth watching.I was not wrong. The film tells the story of Justin Quayle, a diplomat working in Africa, who's wife (a human rights activist) is found murdered. The story follows Justin's quest to find out the true reason for his wife's death. During this time he finds out a lot more about himself, his wife and their relationship than he ever knew before. This story is told around the topic of human rights abuses in Africa. Without this central theme it would be just another 'love' story that would have passed everyone by, it is this combination of the human and political stories that makes this a superb film.However, it is very heavy going and I found it incredibly depressing - seeing the state of the world and how we treat others sharing it. But that does not stop it being an excellent piece of cinema. Indeed, any film that helps bring this issues into the spotlight should be congratulated.The story is told through Justin's eyes and relies on flashbacks to fill in some gaps and reinforce previous comments without them quite becoming an annoyance.The acting is superb all round, I was particularly pleased to see Bill Nighy and Pete Postlethwaite putting in an appearance. Rachel Weisz again shows why she is one of the best and most diverse actresses of the time. And Ralph Fiennes is outstanding as the lead.All in all this film should be seen by all those with a serious interest in film or political issues. But, be warned, it is not an easy journey and is possibly not suited to those looked for a straight thriller/love story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Justin and Tessa Quayle are returning from the hospital, just hours after Tessa lost her unborn baby. Despite being overcome by tremendous grief, Tessa notices a young Kenyan boy named Kioko walking home from the hospital. He and his mother are cradling the newborn child of Wanza Kilulu, Kioko's sister, who succumbed to a combination of HIV and an unknown complication shortly after giving birth. Tessa, knowing that a 40 mile hike is ahead of the unfortunate family, pleads to Justin to give them a lift. Justin, thinking only of the wellbeing of his aggrieved wife, rejects her plea, affirming, "there are millions of people. They all need help." "These are three people we can help!" replies Tessa.Such a scene sits at the heart of "The Constant Gardener," an adaptation of the novel by the same name from John le Carré. In the opening minutes of the film, when she and her African driver are murdered by an unknown party near Kenya's Lake Turkana, Tessa Quayle (Rachel Weisz) had been investigating the shifty dealings of the prominent pharmaceuticals corporation, KDH. Her husband, Justin (Ralph Fiennes), of the British High Commission, is largely oblivious to Tessa's research, but her unexpected death incites him to follow her clues and uncover the truth. Meanwhile, enemies on all sides, and scattered all over the globe, threaten to silence him once and for all.An absorbing story of loyalty and corruption, with flashbacks and memories featuring prominently in the film's structure, "The Constant Gardener" is a solid political thriller. It is brilliantly directed by Fernando Meirelles, whose previous film "Cicade de Deus (City of God)," stands as one of the most highly-acclaimed films of the decade. The starkly beautiful African landscape provides a breathtaking backdrop for much of the film's action, and César Charlone's exquisite cinematography captures this perfectly.The first-class acting also contributes significantly to the film's power. Rachel Weisz ("The Mummy"), in a role that earned her an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, is very good. However, for me, Ralph Fienne's ("Schindler's List") compelling (but often-overlooked) performance as the confused but determined husband of the murdered women he loved so dearly steals the show. Fiennes and Weisz are backed up by a strong supporting cast. Hubert Koundé is Arnold Bluhm, Tessa's African colleague, and the man initially suspected of her murder, despite all evidence being against it. Danny Huston ("The Proposition") plays Sandy Woodrow, the British High Commissioner who no doubt played a part in Tessa's death. Pete Postlethwaite ("The Usual Suspects") is Dr. Lorbeer, a hardened pharmaceutical company employee who works in the field and witnesses the true horrors of the drug companies' schemes.Unlike some political thrillers of recent years, "The Constant Gardener" is never difficult to understand or bloated with too many characters or events to follow ("Syriana" is my prime example here, though it was also quite a good film). The beautiful, yet not-too-uplifting ending seems typical of le Carre's novels, and reminds us that, often, the greed and corruption of global big business is too overwhelming for the efforts of one or two dedicated individuals, no matter how strongly they believe in their cause. But, perhaps, just as Tessa expressed her desire to help the three unfortunate Africans by the roadside, the little differences one can make will ultimately prove to be just as significant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The plight of Africa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With no true register of deaths / births in Africa, this film details just how cheap African life is regarded by the big multi-national drug companies. The film also draws parallels between the arms traders and the big drug companies.It is not a feel happy / air head film, but if you want a deep meaning and thought provoking film, this is for you. It will make you realise that this sort of thing does indeed happen in the real world (gulf war syndrome? Lets experiment on our own soldiers). It also leaves you wanting to help ....On a par with Hotel Rowanda.For more details about TB and its world wide reach, visit http://www.tbalert.org</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A dislike against corporations is brewing in the film-making community, and this is another movie that hits out against the corporate threat and its high level political liaisons.Meirelles brings his trademark hand-held camera style to Kenya, making the viewer feel right in the middle of the conflict. Fine, nuanced performances from experienced actors led by Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz also help in engaging the spectator in this adaptation of John Le Carre's novel of the same name.The script is condensed to a level where it's sometimes difficult to understand the details of what is going on, but a few remarkable scenes (like the one between Fiennes and Bill Nighy in a restaurant) and an excellent ending make this movie a winner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Constant Gardener", kept me riveted throughout. This fictional thriller, based on John LeCarre's novel, could easily have been taken from real life.Rachel Weisz is the wife of a British diplomat (Ralph Fiennes) stationed in Kenya. While the diplomat keeps himself busy with the mundane government functions, his humanitarian wife uncovers a conspiracy of global proportions.When she threatens to blow the whistle on a large international drug firm for unethical practices on the Africans, she is assassinated by corporation thugs. Ultimately, the diplomat pieces together the puzzle of her death, and must confront both Governmental and corporate collusion in this believable conspiracy.Weisz and Fiennes are remarkable in this film, but kudos to John LeCarre for his story. The implications of biomedical experimentation carried out on a "disposable" population are IMMENSE, and should not be taken lightly! Both Weisz and Fiennes portrayed very intense, but different characters. Under the direction by Fernando Meirelles, these characters not only made a major political statement, but an enormous "wake-up call" to the possibility of what COULD be happening in Africa right now. No wonder it is Oscar material!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done movie; politically charged</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the tragedies of our times is the polarization that has swept our and other societies. This film, while well done, is a perfect example. Polarization leads otherwise intelligent people to buy into patently absurd propositions. Scapegoats are a common phenomena in history. Over the years, Jews have been the object of such attacks. The blood libel; control over media or business or otherwise. Polarization led to the Swift Boat attacks on John Kerry. It also has led to attacks on George W. Bush such as lack of honesty or intelligence which in non-polarized times would never see the light of day in reasoned debate.In "The Constant Gardener" the scapegoat is a drug company. The proposition put forth is that to make a profit, a drug company would resort to dealing in drugs which it knew would cause harm, as well as murder, mayhem; complete immorality. The polarization of our times leads intelligent people to accept such assertions as fact. In less charged times, this movie would be dismissed as absurd fiction. But not now. And that, it seems to me, is a sad commentary on our times.I admire the acting, cinematography and all aspects of the making of the movie. Its script and theme, however, are a product of a sickness in our society. One which we should be aware of and seek to avoid. It destroys civility in the discussion of issues and prevents compromise and progress. For that reason I am not a fan of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is delicious; you see all the poverty, the garbage around but can still fell absolutely attracted to the beauty. The characters are perfectly designed. I particularly enjoyed the music. It is great! Maybe it is because I am Latin-American, and the director is Brazilian, but I felt that he is really touched by the differences between rich and poor. I don't think someone who lives in London or NY can explain in the same strong way, the needs and hunger of a third world country. Fernado Meirelles has showed his compromise with the less privileged people. "Cidade de Deus" (City of God) is also a beautiful strong film. I have to say that it was surprising that the "big industry" is turning his head to people like Fernando. Well, maybe Bush didn't have control of all! TKS God! After The Tailor of Panama" in which John Le Carre frankly delivers a ridiculous story, in The Constant Gardener, we can see a well structures story, with a non expected end.Good for him.

		<shortDescription>Constant Reminder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1993, it was Provasic. In 2005 it's Dypraxa. Both are fictional "miracle" drugs with failing results covered up by profit-hungry drug companies. The ill effects of both drugs are exposed by men trying to solve their wives' murders. Harrison Ford?exonerating himself from his wife's murder along the way?exposes drug company Devlin-MacGregor's fraudulent wonder-drug Provasic in 1993's The Fugitive. Over a decade later, in 2005's The Constant Gardener, widower Ralph Fiennes's uncovers pharmaceutical giant KDH's immoral testing of tuberculosis wonder-drug Dypraxa on unknowing HIV-positive Africans. On their quest for the truth, both men's lives are threatened by murderous drug-company thugs. This skeleton is where the similarities between the two pictures end. The flesh of The Fugitive is a modern telling of Les Miserables, with the mano a mano Jean Valjean-Javert joust taking place between Ford's Dr. Richard Kimble and Tommy Lee Jones's Marshal Samuel Gerard. The Constant Gardener fleshes out its plot by immersing itself in the tragedy of Africa's HIV epidemic.The first half of Gardener (based on the novel by John le Carre) intertwines flashbacks with present action to establish the meeting of Fiennes's UK diplomat, Justin Quayle, and his wife, Tessa (Rachel Weisz); their mission to bring aid to HIV-infected Kenyans; and Tessa's suspicions about KDH's purported free tuberculosis testing. We know Tessa will die after seeing a flashback a few minutes into the film. What's left for us, along with Justin, to discover are the secrets Tessa kept from Justin; whether infidelity played any role in her information gathering; the identity of her murderer; and why she was killed. As these plot points tick away, Quayle transforms from pragmatic diplomat into idealistic avenger.Though we essentially have a murder-mystery moving us through the action, the film's ethos emphasizes the tragic plight of an AIDS-torn continent. Yes, we get the scathing attack on the pharmaceutical industry. But the film's heart beats loudest when showing hundreds of Africans waiting in line to receive AIDS medication from desensitized drug company employees, or when Tessa breast feeds the child of a dying, fifteen-year-old, HIV positive African girl. The film wants to engender discussions over issues such as the moral dilemma confronting a relief worker deciding to save an individual African while millions of others are left to die.Does the film possess the gravitas required to rightfully pose such philosophically vexing dilemmas? Absolutely. The outstanding performances alone of go-to epic film protagonist Fiennes and the stunning Weisz license the film to address these complex issues. Weiss will probably win a best supporting actress Oscar just for her opening polemic on the Iraq War. The film's verisimilitude places the audience directly among one of the world's most haunting crises.Overall, the film's pacing keeps the action moving, though I did check my watch a few times deep into the second hour. The film could easily replace two of the five 2005 best-picture nominations. Though I'm ambivalent about the film's Shakespearean ending, it doesn't detract from what is, overall, an exciting dramatic-thriller that importantly draws attention to a global crisis we must confront.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>competing visions of Africa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't think that John le Carré's novel worked all that well. He is the best English prose stylist of our generation and the first 100 pages or so, a wicked satire of life in a British embassy which he knows intimately, were worthy of Jane Austen. I also share his detestation for Tony Blair, for the dog-like attachment to Bush's imperialism, especially the Iraq war, and for his government's sell-out to the corporations. But The Constant Gardener unraveled when the story became an African adventure burdened with a detailed exposé of the pharmaceuticals industry's crimes. Le Carré can draw on his own experience as a bureaucratic insider or latter-day critic, but he remains an English writer with very limited knowledge of African lives to support his sympathy for their plight.I can understand why he was delighted by Fernando Meirelles' film of his novel. The Brazilian director shifted the focus of his story from the circumscribed world of English society in decline to Africa itself. This is today's Africa of city slums, AIDS and aid, luxury hotels and predatory elites. Only later are we exposed to the wide-open vistas and to Africans living on the land, where most perspectives on 'the dark continent' normally begin.One scene near the end was particularly striking. The inhabitants of a remote settlement in the Southern Sudan are visited by a UN aid relief plane and by marauding bandits at more or less the same time. Horsemen with guns terrorize the people, torch the huts and carry off children along with stolen food supplies. The only alternative to this kind of vulnerability is the imprisoned security of one of the huge refugee camps nearby. Allowing for the fact that this episode would be more plausibly set in Darfur than in the war zone across Kenya's border, it evokes centuries of slave-hunting in Africa, but also comparisons from not so long ago elsewhere: memories of America's Wild West, the Japan of Seven Samurai and Sao Paulo raiders who once enslaved the Guarani in the director's homeland.In contrast with the relentless pessimism of a film like Hubert Sauper's Darwin's Nightmare (2004), Meirelles's Africa is violent and violated, for sure, but its people are full of life and cultural resilience too. Brazil also has a brutal past and present, but Brazilians generate tremendous popular culture and optimism for the future. Perhaps before long Africa's cities will find ways of harnessing the vitality of their people to support more rewarding economic forms. The terms of world trade are changing and not in a direction favourable to Americans and Europeans. In the meantime we cling to the idea of a dying Africa reproduced in images like those of Sauper's nightmare.Both the British protagonists die alone as a result of their quixotic struggle against corporate power. The uncomfortable lesson of this film is that Africans themselves will have to take on western imperialism in their own land. Their sympathizers may come from anywhere, but Meirelles's vision has an energy that Le Carré's original lacked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite simply the best movie I've seen in quite some time. Having heard John Le Carre's own reading of the book on CD - an absolute gem in itself - I was eagerly awaiting this film. I was not disappointed in the least. As in the book, the movie deals with flashbacks - which can be hard to follow. There are many characters to deal with. My companion, who had not read the book, found it harder to follow the storyline. But the pluses overwhelmingly outweigh the minuses. The performances by Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz are truly outstanding - definitely Oscar-worthy. However, it is the cinematography which is the true star of this movie. The images of Africa will stay with you for weeks, if not months (it's about six months since I saw it and I can still see those images in my mind). I found the hand-held camera work (in the more intimate scenes of urban Nairobi) a little unsettling, but I'm sure that was intentional - and effective. A must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As thrilling as gardening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John le Carre is best known for his masterful cold war spy novels, packed with procedural detail and surprisingly light on politics, many featuring the character of George Smiley, a man who keeps his emotions to himself and who serves mainly as a mirror in whom others are reflected. Two of these were memorable dramatised by the BBC, with Alec Guinness playing Smiley with characteristic understated brilliance. But the cold war is over, and le Carre has had to find new subjects for his books. 'The Constant Gardener', an adaptation of one of his more recent novels, centres on the activities of pharmaceutical companies in Africa.Unfortunately, the film is not up to the standard of those BBC series, although the source material may be something to do with it. While I don't doubt that drug companies engage in some of the sorts of practices exposed here, one may ask if it is more useful to show a fictionalised account of their behaviour instead of the real story of their activities; while the extreme conclusion to the film is (hopefully) purely imaginative but may therefore lead audiences to miss the real political relevance of what has gone before. But it's also arguable that the film's sense of politics is anyway too explicit to be compatible with artistic success: le Carre's best books didn't waste time lecturing us about the iniquities of communism, they got on with the story and any wider message was implied in the background. But possibly I would not mind these choices if the film itself was better made.Ralph Fiennes and Rachael Wiesz play the central couple. He is a le Carre archetype: a reserved public schoolboy, and modest under-achiever. She is a passionate leftist activist and analyst and even richer than him. When she dies, he takes up her cause. But not only is there something frustratingly perfect about the couple, but the story is oddly constructed. To say that she dies is not to spoil the ending as this happens in the film's first scene: the story of their idyllic relationship, and the suspicious events leading up to her death, are then replayed for us, which is dull, as we already know where the story leads and the other details are all transparent clues for Fiennes' subsequent investigation. The film seems to labour under the delusion that it's characters are essentially interesting, and that we may enjoy this tedious romance. And when finally the story starts to move forward, it's only in directions we might have expected.The film also contains some moments that are almost cringe-worthy in their clichéd nature. Weisz displays a sexy feistiness that surely exists only in the movies, and proves she cares by displaying what in the real world would only be regarded as extreme professional incompetence and the simplistic world view of a fifteen-year old. When Fiennes discovers that the man he thought was seducing his wife is in fact gay, the person who tells him this is (inevitably) completely together, sorted, and fainly patronising (she could almost be a teacher, delivering a lesson on divergent sexualities to an audience of teenagers): qualities almost always assigned to characters with this sort of role. Fiennes spends the whole movie watching people die, but suddenly becomes obsessed with helping one particular child at the most melodramatic opportunity. Meanwhile, it is never clear either why those who help Fiennes discover the truth should do so, or why the bad guys (including the British civil service) have decided that killing their enemies is both necessary and likely to succeed. The ending also seems ridiculous.I love le Carre's early fiction, but the later stuff seems less fresh to me; and sadly there's little that's fresh about this film, a collection of African images and music draped over a tired and generic plot. A disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At last a film for adults, a haunting, thought-provoking masterpiece..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film about the corruption of Western pharmaceutical companies in Aids oppressed Africa does not sound very promising, but I'd urge readers to think again. 'The Constant Gardener' is a topical, subtle thriller and a convincing love story.The relationship between the two principals Rachel Weiss (Tessa) and Ralph Fiennes (Justin) is utterly convincing and as such they draw from each other their best performances to date. The plaudits must go to Weiss, who fully personifies her role and stays in the memory. While Ralph Fiennes may seem a little too reserved for some tastes, the fault is not with his acting, Justin Quayle is a typical le Carre male character. Similarly, the pace may seem to lag at times, but this is merely because we are being drawn slowly into an absorbing thriller.For me, the direction by Fernando Meirelles is pitch perfect, and is matched by a fine adaption by Jeffrey Caine from the John le Carre novel. The cinematography is stunning and well thought-out. When Justin Quyale, played by Fiennes, goes to Africa, the use of hand held cameras, and the semi-documentary style highlights the void between his comfortable London life and the poverty of those in the slums of Africa. Indeed, Africa becomes a character in its own right, but this is no tourist board advertisement. The sweeping vistas serve to draw the viewer into a world of beauty and horror. We are pulled along with Justin and see ourselves reflected in him. From a life of comfortable complacency, his wife Tessa (Weiss) draws him into a world of secrecy, fear, love, loss and revelation, until at the end we feel we have witnessed the journey of a man as transforming and epic as any in great literature. It has been months since I saw the film, and what stays with me are the emotions engendered by this piece - that hasn't happened since 'Schindler's List' and 'Ghandi' before it. I look forward to seeing 'The Constant Gardener' again, I shall welcome it like an old friend. It fully deserves to be as well known and as highly praised as it's more abstruse companion, 'The English Patient'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Moving Political Thriller About a Man Who Discovers His Conscience Late</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Constant Gardener, made from the John LeCarre novel, is excellent and moving. The closest analog to Gardener is this year's Syriana. Both are political thrillers based on the economic maneuverings of mega-corporations, in Syriana an oil company, in Gardener an international pharmaceutical firm. Both are set in the Third World, Syriana in Dubai and parts east, Gardener in Kenya. In Syriana, the good guys (who aren't so good after all) lose. In Gardener, there is partial victory. In both movies, the protagonist gains his conscience, or part of one, in the course of the movie. Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Wiesz star in this movie, both fine actors. The young Brazilian director, perhaps because he comes from a Third World country, has changed the focus of the movie from the British characters of the novels to Africa and its people, and it works stunningly. The DVD includes a short presentation of an African popular theater group delivering the message about HIV to a village audience. It's worth watching too.An intelligent and moving thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't pull its punches</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on John Le Carré's novel by the same name, The Constant Gardener is a love story told in flashbacks of the growing understanding between two very different people as well as a political thriller that exposes the collusion between a pharmaceutical company and the British government. Buoyed by outstanding performances by Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz, the film propels us into its intricate world of intrigue and corruption with a combustible energy that holds our attention from start to finish. Shot in "City of God" style by director Fernando Meirelles, the film uses jump cuts, saturated colors, and a variety of camera angles to capture the kinetic energy of contemporary Africa while not pulling any punches about its poverty and exploitation by multinational industries.The Constant Gardener opens in a remote area of Northern Kenya. Tessa (Rachel Weisz), the idealistic wife of Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes), a laid back mid-level British diplomat and gardener has been found murdered. At first believing that his wife was unfaithful to him and was killed by activist physician Arnold Bluhm (Hubert Koundé), he soon discovers a broader possibility. It seems that Tessa had been on the verge of disclosing a far-reaching conspiracy by government and industry involving the use of local patients as guinea pigs to test a new drug called Dypraxa that had dangerous side effects. The drug, though designed to test for HIV, was destined to become a big money maker in the West as an anti-tubercular drug if positive clinical trials could be obtained and fatalities suppressed. Rationalizing the cover-up of the deaths, Quayle's boss Sandy Woodrow (Danny Huston) who is acting Head of the High Commission, cynically proclaims that "we're not killing people who are not already dead".Tessa's death radicalizes the once staid diplomat and he sets out to complete her work, traveling to London and Berlin to follow leads. Quayle soon runs afoul of Sir Bernard Pellegrin (Bill Nighy), a Foreign Office careerist who is working with Woodrow. They enlist Tim Donahue (Donald Sumpter) to follow him and make sure that he does not publish any details of the English and Kenyan government's complicity with the pharmaceutical giant. As the suspense builds, Quayle is harassed by threats and beaten as a warning in a Berlin hotel room. He receives welcome assistance, however, from Ham (Richard McCabe), Tessa's cousin in London and his son who is a computer whiz and knows how to find critical information on the Internet.As he returns to Africa, he visits a village near the Sudanese border to track down the inventor of the drug, Dr. Marcus Lorbeer (Pete Postlethwaite) but must escape from an attack by a band of murderous tribesmen on horseback. As the process of discovery unfolds and his personal danger increases, Justin also realizes a deeper love for Tessa and appreciation of her high intelligence and commitment to making a difference. Though marred somewhat by distracting camera work and a too pat ending that deviates from the novel, The Constant Gardener succeeds not only by calling our attention to the exploitation of the world's poor, but by its depiction of a man's awakening to the discovery of his wife's faith in him and his own realization that he merits that faith.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE CONSTANT GARDNER is one of those films that sneaks up on you and bites you in the butt. Mislabeled as a "thriller", this movie packs a wallop of a punch, leading into the lives of a man tortured by the murder of his wife, yet showing us an intimate love story that unfolds after her death.The setting is present day Africa and the man is Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes, THE English PATIENT), a British diplomat who struggles with a strong-willed wife (Rachel Weisz, THE MUMMY) named Tessa. Tessa is throwing a wrench into the works of the multimillion dollar operations of the pharmaceutical industry that use African men and women as test subjects for new drugs. And one of these new medicines (which is poised to make billions of dollars) may be killing people.With too much money at stake, the drug company ? that happens to be backed by the British government ? takes its own action and kills Tessa.Now Justin is on the case, trying to uncover what it was his wife had discovered and who was behind her murder. As he travels this road, though, he battles within himself the thoughts that Tessa may have been unfaithful ...only to learn that her love for him knew no bounds.The direction of THE CONSTANT GARDNER by Fernando Meirelles is fascinating. His unorthodox use of scattered events and time allowed for some interesting aspects, most notably a character flow that grew backwards from the story ...for a while. About halfway through the movie the continual forward motion of time starts up, with no flashbacks, and allows the viewer to see a pleasant (if somewhat fatalistic) ending.There's no heavy-handed message that forces itself upon the viewer, either. Like immersing yourself in a steaming hot-tub, this film also gently lowers you into its waters, giving you a feel for what might lay ahead.It was also nice to see characters that were so multifaceted. Friends became enemies, enemies became friends, and acquaintances could very well help or kill any one of the movie's main characters.This is definitely a film that'll get a few Oscar nods in my estimation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Old Fashioned Thriller with a New Fashioned Approach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John le Carré's novel THE CONSTANT GARDENER is one of his finer suspense/spy/thriller stories and screenwriter Jeffrey Caine kept the story and the technique of telling it intact in this successful film. Director Fernando Meirelles was an excellent choice for director, bringing a fresh new look to Hollywood actions movies, a look that involves camera work, atmosphere, mirrors to society, and use of actors and vistas of Africa to drive the message behind this story home.Proper High Commissioner Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) serves his British government with the same diligence with which he tends his garden of potted plants. He is a constant diplomat and a constant gardener, never veering from his mission - until he meets mouthy smart rebellious Tessa (Rachel Weisz) in a classroom where he has literally 'read' a lecture for an absentee professor. Her rage at the Establishment is calmed by Justin's quiet manner and in no time they have bedded, courted and are on their way to an assignment in Kenya. Once in Africa Tessa's forthright manner embarrasses everyone connected with government, but the couple are happy and trusting, and the now- pregnant Tessa discovers a secret plot for the unmonitored testing of an anti-tuberculosis drug (a threat of a mutant form of TB that will annihilate much of the world's population is the justification) on unknowing people of Kenya. Tessa rails against the concept of human guinea pigs, finds a colleague in a Kenyan doctor Arnold (Hubert Koundé) and together they, undercover, investigate the connection between the drug company manufacturing the drug and the governments of England and Kenya.While proper Justin is keeping the peace with his confr?res Sandy (Danny Huston) and Sir Bernard Pellegrin (Bill Nighy) and nurturing Tessa after they lose their pregnancy. Tessa's rage is inflamed and while off on an assignment with Arnold she is brutally murdered (and Arnold is likewise brutally tortured and crucified). Justin's world is shaken and his constancy is reversed in taking up where Tessa left off - working to uncover the truth about the scandalous coups. From here the story speeds along with twists and turns and the ending is unexpected.Meirelles captures both the suffocating stifle of British politics and the breathtaking majesty and poverty of Kenya with uncanny skill. His lighting is all natural and the camera work is basically hand held, intensifying the credibility of the story of a few people against enormous odds - medically, socially, and in the seething corruption of the governments. He balances the tension by the use of flashbacks to moments when Justin and Tessa were courting and making love and living and laughing, and these non-linear techniques offer breathing space for the story's propulsive drive. The actors are superb: this is his finest role for Fiennes in years and for once Weisz is given a character into whom she can breathe all of her expertise as an actress.Yes, there are flaws in the story and some holes of information that could use patching, but in the final result this is a movie of power, of message, and of technical finesse that makes it one of the finer of the year. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, January 06</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uncomfortable viewing, but gripping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film tells the tale of British diplomat Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) who plays things by the book but is deeply in love with his wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz), a deeply passionate woman committed to doing what's right. When Tessa is killed in what appears to be a hit for digging too much into the business of a pharmaceutical company testing its products on Kenyan Aids sufferers, her husband Justin becomes determined to find out why she was killed, gain justice for her, and finish what she started by exposing the company. When he starts getting close, those involved become more desperate, and Quayle finds his own life in danger for digging too much, and it is revealed just how widespread (and high up) the corruption is.The Constant Gardener is a harrowing tale of corruption and people looking the other way when they may witness the unfortunate consequences of their actions (or inaction). The film makes gripping, if rather uncomfortable viewing, not least because it leaves a rather queasy feeling caused by a ring of truth in the narrative. How many times in history have the British government (or other national governments) been involved in policies of questionable morality and legality, but never actually gotten their hands dirty, and simply looked away while their associates conducted the unsavoury aspects of their business? The British attitude to Stalin during the Second World War is one of many historic examples that all too easily (and uncomfortably) spring to mind when considering this ? an ally who helps with their goal but also is allowed to commit atrocities of his own.Fernando Meirelles has produced a compelling slow-burning film. Meticulously paced and thought out, if a little slow with the set up, The Constant Gardener never really catches fire, but simply gradually heats up to reach uncomfortable temperatures. With corruption so widespread, Meirelles delights in Quayle's desperation at simply not knowing whom to trust.Unfortunately Meirelles' camera work relies on a shaky hand-held style and frequent use of extreme close-ups; all very arty looking, but irritating for the audience when trying to simply follow what is happening.Ralph Fiennes is superb as ever, although performances of this calibre now have come to be expected as standard from him. But at least most viewers of this film won't see him as Voldemort. Rachel Weisz delivers what could be a career-defining performance; she is simply outstanding as the relentless activist who refuses to observe either social niceties or warnings as she tries to expose the truth. Danny Huston is delightful as the slimy diplomat who obviously has a hidden agenda, and Bill Nighy plays a rather understated role as a top diplomat also possibly implicated as he continues to enjoy a career renaissance in the wake of Love Actually. Pete Postlethwaite however is criminally underused (although the same cannot be said for his rather bizarre Dutch/South African hybrid accent).A superb slow-burning mystery, gripping but uncomfortable viewing; not comfy Sunday afternoon viewing, and probably difficult to watch a second time. But definitely an early contender for the Oscars ? Rachel Weisz in particular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was the love story that made the film tragic and beautiful....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The marriage that was effectively over, too exhausted by Justin's mistrust and Tessa's all consuming drive to help Africa. Upon her death Justin could barely grieve properly. But the further he investigated, the further the mistrust was proved false, the more he began to understand what drove her and that she truly loved him. And it was in death that his feelings of true love for her came alive again. The scene that had him pinned against the window (the first time he actually breaks down after her death) and kept cutting back to the first time they slept together, was utterly spell binding. This was the film for me. Special credit to superb performances from Fiennes and Weisz. And the brilliant inematography and Meirelles direction.The plot involving the drug companies was so so. This I didn't find very "thrilling", it was obvious where the corruption lay early on. And the plight of Africa and it's mistreatment is a tragic but unfortunately well known story ( that I know needs to be told again and again) But overall it was an extremely good film, bettered only so far this year by Crash IMO</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meirelles Does It Again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this film with no preconceptions whatsoever. I only knew the title and the two leads. I left the cinema having watched the best film I have seen on the big screen all year. I didn't know what to expect of a film called The Constant Gardener; it obviously wouldn't be about gardening but I couldn't really guess what kind of material to expect. I suppose it helped that I was in a receptive mood, but the deep political and social criticisms that this film imparts on its viewers reached me without being overly emotive. And nor was the machinery of this message dry or slow in its delivery. Indeed, the themes of the film crept up on me unaware as I drifted off into the plot, which was brought to life effortlessly by Fiennes and Weisz.I cannot claim to have seen all of their films but I have never quite warmed to either of these actors. They often seem to play samey parts and I was hoping that this wouldn't be the case this time. I was pleasantly surprised because, although in some ways they assumed their usual typecast roles (the socially awkward character for Fiennes and the well-to-do, happy-go-lucky girl for Weisz), they both portrayed utterly convincing characters. And in a film such as this, it is incredibly important to develop the audience's empathy for the protagonists. This was achieved very effectively in the first full scene that two share together, as yet unacquainted, wherein Weisz's character, Tessa, launches a volley of prickly questions at Fienne's Justin after his lecture on international diplomacy.Tessa attacks Justin's lecture on the basis that our involvement in the Iraq war renders the diplomatic moral high-ground ? that he claimed the UK treads ? a veritable mire, an argument which he flusters to counter. Straightaway we learn the fundamental facets of these two characters' personalities. We anticipate the ensuing sexual encounter, that will define their relationship, even down to Justin's cringe-worthy surprise at such an attractive woman showing an interest in him. Job done ? we know what makes these characters tick. And that was achieved in the space of fifteen minutes. We cut to a favela in Nairobi where it is no surprise to see the proactive Tessa ? despite her heavy pregnancy ? lending her support to a young doctor, Arnold (Hubert Koundé), doing his rounds to promote AIDS testing. Justin is safely behind his desk, at the wheel of his Range Rover, or nurturing flowers in his garden.Jeffrey Caine's screenplay makes no bones about what John le Carré thinks about British involvement in foreign "diplomatic" matters. Justin and his cronies ? in their official capacity ? turn a blind eye to anything of actual importance, for fear of harming international relations. Tessa, on the other hand (now the wife of Justin) is forthright in her criticisms of the corruption she sees in the foreign medical "aid effort" in Kenya. Indeed, the fight against social injustice is her very raison d'?tre (in this way, her character echoes Cate Blanchett's Veronica Guerin in the film of the same name), something which Justin fails to realise until it is too late. Incidentally, I think it was a bad choice to show the pivotal point of the plot, Tessa's death, at the start of the film, a device which, in my opinion, has become too common in recent films.We are led to believe that Tessa is having an affair with Arnold; a deception that negates our affinity with her in the short-term but ultimately makes us greater appreciate her personal sacrifices. For me this was an excellent piece of character development; hinging not on Tessa but on Justin, for whom her death is a tragic event of very mixed emotions, which was deftly handled by Ralph Fiennes. At first he believes he has uncovered a litany of infidelity on her part ? in the face of which he arrests his grief ? only to discover that his distrust was unfounded; the upshot of which is immense heartache. The scenes where he imagines talking to Tessa, wishing she was by his side, are painfully touching and illustrative of his desire to pursue her cause.This film seems longer than just over two hours but that's not because it drags; rather because it fits so much in to that time frame. It commences as a romance and then evolves into a political drama before it morphs into a paranoid crime thriller (complete with pre-teen computer expert), and finally culminates in a mixture of all three. A lesser film would have failed in its ambition to deliver so much. The Constant Gardener, however, manages to be thought-provoking - without resorting to propaganda - in what is a very controversial area for debate (especially in light of the impending avian 'flu pandemic), and still maintains an outwardly entertaining backdrop for the themes it seeks to explore. Hence it works on two levels: it promotes social awareness whilst being an instantly gratifying diversion.In summary, this film has a lot to say and spans several genres but manages to compact it all into a coherent and compelling two hours. The cinematography is not ground-breaking; the panning is sometimes disorienting when it was probably intended to be jarring; and the political commentary is somewhat one-sided and idealistic. But the acting is superb across the board (look out for, Bill Nighy, Danny Huston, Gerard McSorely, and Pete Postlethwaite in particular); the sound track is reflective of the mood; and the locations feel genuine (as they did in City Of God). Fernando Meirelles is clearly not afraid to tackle contentious subjects, which is refreshing in a period of cinema which seems averse to discussing the world we live in at anything beyond a superficial level. A thoroughly enjoyable film ? 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply Sublime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having heard so much about City of God, I was eager to be able to see The Constant Gardener, which had the pedigree of a novel from the eminent John Le Carré, the acting talents of Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Wiesz and Bill Nighy and the director of City of God, Fernando Meirelles. I was sure that the film would be good. I wasn't disappointed. In fact, the film exceeded my expectations. It wasn't just good; it was great.The film's brilliance lies in so many areas. Firstly, there is Jeffery Caine's script, which deals with an intricate series of flashbacks in an expertly good style. It has a good plot, wonderfully fleshed out characters, suspense, thrills and a wonderful romance. The film is also shot wonderfully by César Charlone, who gives the film such a wonderful style and feel. The cinematography of the wonderful locations is stunningly beautiful. The editing is also brilliant, with the composition of shots in every scene skilfully done.The film is sublimely acted all round. It is undeniably Ralph Fiennes' film, as he delivers a wonderful and sensitive performance, as Justin Quayle, that genuinely moved me and the audience which I viewed the film with. He is supported very well, chiefly by Rachel Wiesz, who plays his wife, Tessa Quayle. She creates a wonderful sense of ambiguity in her character that is done with a wonderfully deft touch. Danny Huston is supremely slimy and as the creepy Sandy Woodrow and Bill Nighy is fantastic as the upper class Sir Bernard Pellegrin.But the film's greatness is owed almost entirely to its direction under the extremely skilled hands of Fernando Meirelles. His control of the film is absolute, his accomplishment undeniable and his genius unquestionable. It is a tour de force in film-making and is worthy of every piece of praise that comes its way.Superb, entertaining and brilliantly well-made, The Constant Gardener is a piece of cinematic genius and should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE CONSTANT GARDENER Is a Well Tended Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been nifty thrillers over the years with conspiracy attached, and many of them have been good like The Parallax View and JFK. Yet few of these have been able to rise above the visceral angst of suspense and intrigue to attain another level of human emotion. One good example is the recent adaptation of John Le Carre's novel, The Constant Gardener. Adapted by Jeffrey Caine and directed by Fernando Meirelles, this is a superior cinematic rendition of a good, moral suspense yarn told with methodical precision and emotional resonance.Tessa (Rachel Weisz) is a volunteer-activist who marries timid diplomat, Justin Qualye (Ralph Fiennes) and follows him to Kenya in Africa. When his wife goes missing, Justin decides to follow his wife's trail and find out what really happened and why. The clues lead to a pharmaceutical drug corporation that is testing tuberculosis drugs on the lower class population. What Justin finds is a shocking conspiracy of secrets and lies reaching up to the British government and a corporate entity that will stop at nothing to release its money making windfall. As Justin discovers the truth, he begins to understand the ruthless nature of conspirators even as he begins to uncover the truth about his marriage.This is a chilling mystery story that is at its heart a tale of romantic love between a man and a wife he really doesn't know. Although not perfect, it does endeavor to be many things, and it integrates the love story that forms the soul of the film with an elaborate detective story that touches upon morality, fear, hope, and redemption and achieves them quite well. It's like reading a long, complex novel. That a film could be filled with so many attributes is quite an achievement and a testament to the source material by Le Carre, a constant source of complex, filmic material ever since the breakout adaptation of his The Spy Who Came in From the Cold in the 1960's. It is also a tribute to director Meirelles who has a sure hand in every scene and edit while never losing track of his many themes and maintaining strong performances from his talented cast.At first Justin is oblivious to the insidious forces around him. The garden that he tends to is a metaphor of sorts to a basic, uncomplicated view of his world that is suddenly shaken. The backgrounds in many scenes show a rural countryside with poor people struggling to survive. Life is hard for the people in a harsh landscape. There are always incidental shots of children usually in the background as casual bystanders or observers; they are the innocent ones. This story and its people are distant cousins of the drug gangs in Meirelles' previous, breakthrough film, City of God. It is in this setting that Justin retraces Tessa's footsteps which lead to a dirty secret and a rediscovery of their love. Throughout it all, there is an almost inevitable, hopeless feeling, like a stacked deck against Justin. Then there is the question of trust. Who to trust? It seems everyone is either partly involved with the bad guys or reluctant to get involved. There are different levels of trust. There is the hint of marital infidelity and the questioning of loyalty. In this respect, The Constant Gardener reminds one of the underrated Under Fire. The narrative fluidly flashes back and forth at will to show the beginnings of Justin and Tessa's relationship amid the intrigue in Kenya. There's also lots of hand-held camera work (Cesar Charlone) that gives the film a semi documentary feel. While the look is raw and primitive, the editing (by Oliver Stone alumni Claire Simpson) is sophisticated and clever as various bits of associative imagery are connected to great emotional and informative effect. A great deal of thought and planning went into this story and its adaptation to connect the dots. Fiennes is excellent as the beleaguered husband who seeks the truth about his wife. He has a knack for playing tragic characters (Quiz Show, The English Patient), and he has never been better than in this role. You feel his confusion and pain as he goes against difficult odds. Rachel Weisz is terrific as the brave crusader of the African people who risks harm and her marriage by digging for the truth. You feel her passion in Tessa's character and the free spirit that dominates every scene she is in. You just know that Tessa's own hard-headed agenda will get her in trouble. It is a far cry from Weisz's days in action blockbusters like The Mummy, and it is her best role to date. The rest of the uniformly strong cast is excellent particularly Bill Nighy as the slimy Pellegrin. If you are a conspiracy buff, then this is your kind of film. Although it is a bit of a downer, ultimately it is a haunting fable with memorable imagery, and it is a film that stays with you long after it is over. It should stay with Oscar voters for the long term as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love Epic That Doesn't Quite...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Constant Gardener" is a remarkable achievement, a film that sets out to achieve some goals and ends up succeeding by meeting unexpected ones. It reminds its audience quite a bit of the extraordinary love affair between its leads, with similar dramatic characteristics, and by having one of its leads in common with "The English Patient". In fact, Ralph Fiennes is extraordinary in the movie; he gives the audience an in-depth portrayal of a rather ordinary man involved in quite an adventure.The most marvelous treat in the film is Rachel Weisz, a lovely and charismatic actress. She shines in her role of the strong and lovely activist. Every time she is on the screen, we are treated to one of the greatest acting achievements of the year. It doesn't hurt that she has fantastic chemistry with Ralph Fiennes, as her devoted husband. It is that portrayal of a unique relationship with Fiennes that helps us understand how specially difficult her role is. It's hard to imagine any other actress being able to pull it off.The main problem with the film is that it doesn't make up its mind. The intrigue and background could work beautifully in any other film. In here, they are superfluous. It'd be as if the political elements of "Hamlet" were to be overtake the dysfunctional elements of its main family members. Fiennes and Weisz are rather special in their relationship and wandering from that powerful bond clashes with the forces that drive the story. It's hard to explain, but one wishes at times, the film had been more intimate. "The Constant Gardener" works better when pain hits feels personal. Justin (Fiennes) grows and shines in those moments, where he shows his dedication and moral support for others, even strangers. Going into the labyrinthine details of the plot weakens the impact of the film. There are fantastic scenes, and yet, the whole film should film that way, but it doesn't quite get there. Also, the camera work is at times a bit too artsy and jumpy. I felt at times that I was in the middle of a very good Tony Scott film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine political thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the tradition of "Z," "All the President's Men" and "The Quiet American," "The Constant Gardener" is a political message movie that comes packaged as a taut, gripping whodunit. The "message" in this case is about how pharmaceutical companies often put profits ahead of patient safety and human life, especially in the Third World where many of the drugs are tested since the people there are often viewed as somehow more "dispensable" than people in the West.Ralph Fiennes plays Justin Quayle, a British diplomat sent to Kenya along with his new wife, Tessa, a human rights activist played by Oscar-winner Rachel Weisz. When Tessa suddenly turns up dead, Justin begins to wonder if perhaps his wife had found out a little bit more than she was supposed to know about regarding a huge drug company's dealings in that part of the world.Even though I have no clue as to whether or not this story is even remotely plausible (though I suspect it most likely is), "The Constant Gardener," nevertheless, works very well as both a nail biting political thriller and a complex human drama. Running along both tracks simultaneously, the film opens our eyes to the possibility that the people and institutions we trust with our lives and our futures may not, in actuality, have our best interests at heart. As Justin follows the clues to his wife's murder, a depressing picture of ignoble motives and corporate malfeasance slowly emerges.But it is as a human drama that "The Constant Gardener" truly excels. Justin is a man who, even though he has thrust himself onto the world's stage as a potentially major player, is actually little more than a bureaucratic cipher, content to go through life doing other people's bidding, causing no ripples and spending his time nurturing and cultivating the plants in his garden. Tessa, on the other hand, is a fervid activist, quick to speak her mind on issues of social injustice and unafraid of taking on the powers-that-be, even if that means upsetting the applecart and endangering her own life. Based on the John Le Carre novel, the Jeffrey Caine screenplay turns Tessa into an enigmatic figure who fascinates us with both her beauty and her air of mystery. Even Justin doesn't always know what to make of her, but we can certainly understand why he and most of the other men in the movie are hopelessly drawn to her. Weisz, who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for this performance, does a beautiful job capturing the many moods of the character, and Fiennes gives his usual outstanding performance as the naturally passive man ultimately jolted by circumstances into taking a proactive stand against injustice.As with any adaptation of a Le Carre work, "The Constant Gardener" may be a trifle too slick for its own good at times, but excellent writing and acting help to bring the message home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Constant Gardener was well worth watching. Lavishly shot in Kenya, the cinematography allows Africa to speak for itself quite eloquently. On a private level, the film deals with the problems of communication in a marriage, and at a public level touches on the use of Africans as human guinea pigs by large drug companies. As Tessa, Rachel Weisz is a strong woman, a passionate advocate of human rights who is unafraid to create public scandals in the interest of saving lives. Ralph Fiennes gives a sensitive performance as a cold British diplomat and distant husband who gradually thaws into a compassionate human being who loves the soul of Africa. Interesting contrasts in the use of color by the director balance the different worlds in conflict in this film. Cooler colors prevail in the well-ordered life of the British diplomat earlier in the film, where a more brilliant palette of vivid colors later in the film reflect the beauty and chaos of Africa.</fullReview>

The 'manufactured' attempts at tension building however do fall flat...possibly because the 'emotional' tie to the principal characters cannot occur due to the premise of the plotting referred to above.

The most amazing part of the film is it does not show the worst scene of Africa, the dying children the horrible living condition. The photographing sometimes are breathlessly beautiful, the faces of children are surprisingly happy. It is kinda ironical when you are unintentionally enjoying the amazing pictures, you find how naive yourself are. It's amazing. The sad beginning with the tearful music and flying birds. The sad ending with Justin lying beneath the purple sky. It's MUCH better than the pretentious self-cheating story Crash.

Rachel Weisz whole-heartedly deserved her Oscar, though I cant quite understand why it was for supporting actress rather than actress in a leading role. In fact the entire cast was phenomenal, with special nods going out to Bill Nighy and, of course, the always great Ralph Fiennes. The plot had me guessing until the very end, and while the final outcome was unavoidable, I was still somewhat surprised. A word of warning however: If you're like many people I know, and dismiss movies simply for being "boring", this is not for you. The majority of the film is talking and there is very little action. If that kind of film bothers you, leave this one on the shelf. Otherwise, I highly recommend it.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful, painful, perfect...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the Oscar-nominated City of God, Fernando Meirelles makes his English-language debut with The Constant Gardener. Now, I still haven't seen City of God, so I didn't exactly know what to expect from Meirelles (I only had enthusiastic reviews of both films in his favor), but I can say that The Constant Gardener is one of the best movies of 2005, and also the best thriller I've seen in the last couple of years.Actually, it's wrong to label it a simple thriller. Sure, there's a lot of suspense in this gripping adaptation of John Le Carré's bestseller, as we follow English diplomat Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) on his quest: to uncover the truth behind his wife's (Rachel Weisz) death. His colleagues (Danny Huston, Bill Nighy) think it has to do with her supposed infidelities, but Justin refuses to believe that and follows another lead, one which involves conspiracy, corruption and many human lives.The thriller element is constantly present, and cleverly used by Meirelles and screenwriter Jeffrey Caine to denounce the fowl events that take place in Africa, where ruthless people play with mankind's life as if it were an everyday object which can be sacrificed without second thoughts. However, the director also manages to keep it all undeniably personal, by showing us the tormented romance between Justin and a wife he never really knew. The love story is even made more dramatic by the fact that it's entirely told in flashback, as Tessa is killed off right at the beginning of the film, giving the romance an increasingly more painful feel. Fiennes and particularly Weisz (I sincerely hope she'll win the Best Supporting Actress Oscar) stand out as the two ill-fated lovers, with an intensity that breaks out of the screen. Just watch Fiennes burst in tears as he remembers their first night together: it's such a powerful scene and performance I almost cried myself, which usually happens only if I'm watching a really good film.Intimate and universal at the same time, The Constant Gardener is one of the best literary adaptations in recent history. Once it's grabbed your attention, it won't let you go, and the two hours spent watching it will feel absolutely rewarding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(There are Spoilers) Going on a fact finding trip to Loki Kenya with her fellow investigator Dr. Arnold Bluhm, Herbert Kounde, social activist Tessa Quayle,Rachel Weisz,says goodbye to her British diplomat husband Justin, Ralph Fiennes. Tessa doesn't realize that it's the last time that he'll ever see her alive. Tessa is later found gunned down with her African driver on the banks of Lake Turnaka with Arnold no where to be seen. Arnold, who's secretly gay, who was wrongfully reported to be having an affair with Tessa, was later found hanging upside down on a tree limb in the African bush viciously and savagely militated most likely by Tessa's killers. Justin now on a mission to find the cause of his wife's murder goes to Kenya and uncovers a scheme that was secretly worked out on three different continent's. to make a few people filthy rich at the expense of millions of Africans who put their lives and trust in them :the pharmaceutical industry. Notably KDH pharmaceuticals that make the anti-tuberculosis drug Dypraxa. A bit disjointed the movie "The Constant Gardener" jumps from the present to the past in a number of flashbacks that seem to come without warning. That's about the only thing that I can find wrong with the movie. It's basic story is about political and corporate corruption that's straight out of todays headlines. Tassa a long time whistle blower finds that KDH is pushing it's so-called wonder drug Dypraxa on unsuspecting Africans. These Africans are dying by the thousands because of it as well as from major TB epidemic that broke out in Africa and is threatening to engulf the entire world. Tessa gets the facts about Dypraxa from her and Justin's good friend and British diplomat Sandy Woodrow, Danny Huston, with the promise to Sandy that she'll keep quit about it, the secret report. Tessa instead is about to go public to the UN and spill the goods about KDH. That will postponed Dypraxa from coming on the open market for as long as three years if at all. It would also end up costing KDH's stockholders tens of millions of dollars. That's also something that KDH, as well as all the drug companies that have a stake in in the drug Dypraxa, can't well afford to let happen.Justin goes to Kenya to find what was really behind Tessa' death and becomes a marked man as he comes to the same conclusion that she did. The drug companies were using the people of Africa as human guinea pigs for their experimental drugs and that was resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of them. It was only when Justin went to see Tessa' friend and fellow activist Ghita Person, Archie Panjabi, in Holland that it, the brutal honest truth, finally sank in. Justin was beaten within an inch of his life by drug company goons who told him that this is his last warning to stop and desist from looking into and exposing their company's unsavory and criminal actions. Justin later finds out that his and Tessa' close friend, as well as her secret lover, Sandy Woodrow was the one, together with drug company doctor Lobeer(Pete Postlethwaite), who fingered Tessa's whereabouts to KDH. Woodrow also ratted her out to other major drug companies, government front man Sir Bernard Pellegrin. Bill Nighy, the day that she let for Kenya that resulted in her and Dr. Bluhm's murder.It has to be sad that both Sandy and Dr. Lobeer had no idea that what they told Pellegrin would lead to this terrible tragedy. They were only trying to keep their jobs in the medical and diplomatic world. They just thought that Tessa would be detained or thrown out of the country, Kenya, as an undesirable alien but never murdered. Justin now knowing what was really behind Tessa's death and not wanting to live without her decides to share the same fate that she did. Justin goes to Lake Turnaka, the site of Tessa's murder, and waits for the end to come and he doesn't have to wait long.The ending is a bit too optimistic for a down beat movie like "The Constant Gardener" with Sir. Pellegrin and his drug companies, that he fronted for, being exposed at a public form in London. Even that was a little too late with Justin now dead, and nobody willing to stand up and tell the truth. A gigantic epidemic of a deadly and unknown strain of Sub-Saharan African TB is going unreported and unchecked as the world now braces itself for a plague, of what can best be described, of literately biblical proportions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Fernando Meirelles' "The Constant Gardener" has planted itself constantly in many movie critics' "Top 10 films of 2005" lists. For a short while, it was hailed as one of the top "seeds" to win the Oscar for Best Picture. Unfortunately for Meirelles, it did not reach that Academy supremacy by not being nominated for the top prize; but it did manage to receive 4 other nominations. The great Ralph Fiennes stars as Justin Quayle, a member of the British High Commission who is on a persistent investigation of the murder of his wife Teresa; the luminous Rachel Weisz plays her with an admiring and irresistible force which has lauded various acting prizes already. Teresa's relentless activism for fair medical treatment of poverty and disease-stricken Africans is what eventually causes her mortal fate. Underneath this Garden, there is a pharmaceutical companies' greedy cover-up which uses the Africans as scapegoats for these pharm's financial assets. Similar to other politically-charged films of 2005, "The Constant Gardener" waters down real life global issues with controversy, objectivity, and freight. However, we should not go bezerk now and fight for these hidden claims because we cannot forget that it is a movie. Meirelles, who brought to the screen the jewel of a film "City of God", has to be commended for his gallantry direction. However, he should of grown more of that "City of God" cinematic creativity and unpredictability in "The Constant Gardener". Fiennes does a fine job and the supporting cast team of Danny Huston, Bill Nighy, Pete Postlethwaite, and Gerald McSorely do deserve merit. However, it was the feisty Weisz that kept "The Constant Gardener" alive! *** Average</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well acted but lacking suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was rather frustrated with this film because it nearly was very good. The performances were technically faultless, though personally I would have preferred a more demonstrative interpretation of his role than the one given by Fiennes. He just was not desperate enough in his search for the truth about his wife and was the polite diplomat throughout. For me it did not quite work, though there were moments of great tenderness, which he played very well. I would stress that I only question the interpretation of this particular role rather than the ability of Fiennes as an actor, which is obviously top drawer.The rest of the cast played their parts very well, but save from some isolated scenes there was insufficient suspense and several big chances were missed. This was quite some achievement by the Director as Fiennes was being followed for most of the film and was brutally attacked in his hotel bedroom. The only time I felt really worried was during a small scene outside a school when you felt something dreadful was going to happen to a young child, plus the decision to leave a little girl behind from the plane in the Sudan. Why Fiennes did not adopt her on the spot to save her life as a tribute to both the work and memory of his wife was an inexplicable weakness of the plot. That theme would have worked much better than the eventual ending.Where the film did score was to give emphasis to those who already perfectly well knew it and for others who do not pay attention to their modern history, that there is massive corruption at government level, especially in Africa and with any big business that link the two. The film correctly portrayed that there would be little hesitation in disposing of anybody "who knew too much," a factor that may make people at least think twice about some mysterious deaths in history and politics, when they are explained as suicide.I enjoyed the film but I shall not watch it again, which is a pity. The Constant Gardener was very well acted, interesting, while the scenery was both realistic and, at times, breathtaking. Ultimately, however, it was a film which never got into top gear and despite having countless opportunities failed to get me on the edge of my seat. Throughout the film I was just too comfortable when I should have been in a state of continued tension. A chance missed here and a film with definite potential for a superior re-make in about ten years.Michael Dixon, United Kingdom</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ethical violations in Big Pharma...who knew?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The revelation that Big Pharma may be wanting in the ethics department is about as surprising as finding bear poo in the woods. Price gouging, developing world access, and clinical trials have all been the focus of repeated real-world outcries. "The Constant Gardener," based on the John le Carr? novel, shines much needed light under these rocks of the pharmaceutical industry, but sustains itself more on the depth of its characters, for whom we become truly concerned.Director Fernando Mireilles brings here the same energy that surged through his "City of God." Mireilles is a master of injecting vibrance into scenes of human and urban decay; his crowds swarm with life, and colors shout out their presence. In that earlier film, our senses were heightened to expect violence at any moment. In "The Constant Gardener," though, nefarious goings-on are orchestrated through official channels of both industry and diplomacy, and Mireilles slows himself down enough to allow both his characters and story to unfold around us.Foppish British diplomat Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) is eking out a career as a functionary in Kenya. The mild-mannered Quayle is no professional superstar, but is liked by his peers and superiors, at least to the extent he's able to reign in his firebrand young wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz). Tessa to them seems swept away with the misguided idealism of youth. She brazenly interrogates industry allies at diplomatic functions, keeps company with a rabble-rousing African doctor/activist, and generally sticks her uppity bleeding heart where it is definitely not wanted. Her death early in the film, then, is not all that surprising. Pay attention to how Mireilles holds the camera on Quayle as he's given the news of Tessa's likely murder. A lesser actor might have turned on the histrionics, but Fiennes remains nearly impassive, betraying only the slightest facial tics that hint at a hidden emotional storm. When he finally does speak, it's to empathize with his colleague about the difficulty of delivering the bad news.Details emerge that point to corporate malfeasance in Tessa's death. It seems she had submitted a report to British officials documenting a series of haphazard clinical trials of a potential flagship TB drug by an international pharma giant. Never having much previously concerned himself with Tessa's causes, Quayle starts asking questions. It is quickly made clear that powerful interests would like him to stop.Fiennes is pitch-perfect here as a man who uses his milquetoast demeanor to his advantage. His adversaries first buddy up to him, assuming it will be no problem to convince such an unassuming type not to go biting powerful hands. Yet the more Quayle learns, the more it's clear not only that Tessa was onto something, but that many of his own suspicions about both her sincerity and marital fidelity were misguided. Quayle is no hostage-taking, marauding Charles Bronson-style avenging angel. He just keeps asking questions, in spite of the increasingly severe resistance. Weisz, too, seen mainly in flashback, gives us a three-dimensional character who lives for her crusades, but who truly loves her meek husband, perhaps more than he knows."The Constant Gardener" is convincing in its portrait of diplomatic life, in which functionaries speak blandly in broad platitudes, and no one loses sleep over inconsistencies and hypocrisies in the details. It's easy to ache for the poor masses who are the casualties of such callous officialdom, but hard to imagine the film's bleak ending turning out any other way. "The Constant Gardener," along with "Good Night and Good Luck," "Syriana," and "Munich," among others, is part of a recent chorus of progressive-minded political films. There can't be too many. Their combination of compelling characters and stories with courageous dissent makes for quality films and much needed activism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most touching pictures in modern history. I usually don't bother to comment on things I see or read because of laziness, but this one left no other option than to express my delightfulness. The performances by Rachel and Ralph are both to consider when it's time for the Oscars. Especially Rachel is so charismatic that I hardly can hold my tears back because of striking beauty and high performing acting. I get swept away by the almost documenting and authentic pictures of a country in desperate need. I suppose some of the pictures even are shot without any directions from the director. I'm thinking of the African kids running and playing. It feels like it though. And when I suspect the lack of directions that means of course that a masterpiece is about to be seen. Everybody knows that the continent is suffering and that we can make a different, but to see these people makes me want to volunteer. The capturing of exploitation is the main thing with this picture but it nevertheless includes intrigues and love on a personal basis. The love story between the two main characters is so much more than just a love story. The director succeeds to capture a lot of feelings and with the soundtrack it's a huge moving picture experience.</fullReview>

I don't cry at films but the horror of all that passed before my eyes was too much for me several days ago when I watched this marvelous film. The enormity of the evil laid before my eyes was too much for me. I knew that there was the potential for the breadth of wrong doing but to see it played out on an afternoon such as happened several days ago took me by surprise. I have read snippets of what I saw in the movie and others far worse but I did not expect to see it laid before me in a mainstream movie. The horror that Europeans and their offspring the Americans have forced on this continent is too much to consider.

		<shortDescription>Where conspiracies (don't) stop.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having shown the world life in Brazilian slums in "City of God", Fernando Meirelles looks at geopolitics, intrigue, and corporate greed in "The Constant Gardener". The movie has Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) trying to find out why his wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz) was murdered in Africa. In the process, he uncovers a conspiracy involving a drug company testing products on people but denying them treatment.A really good scene is early in the movie, when Justin is teaching a class and Tessa asks him about the invasion of Iraq. When he avoids answering the question directly, she tells the class: "This man is an apologist for the people invading Iraq for a little bit more oil." It's good to see that movies are already dealing with that. But then when it goes into the main plot, then it really gets good. As a man says at one point: "That is how the world f---s Africa." A really good movie.</fullReview>

Not to mention character heart. I was in tears outside the theater - can't even remember last time a film left such an emotional impact on me.

		<shortDescription>Surely one of the ones to beat for Best Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steering a fine line between being a very sophisticated entertainment, in equal parts love story and gripping thriller, and political-cum-problem picture, Fernando Meirelles' quite superb "The Constant Gardener" is already chalking up as one of the ones to beat for this year's Best Picture Oscar. With it's African setting, (stunning photography by Cesar Charlone) and Ralph Fiennes heading the cast, comparisons are already being made with "The English Patient", though the film's closest antecedents remain the films of Costa-Gavras, in particular "Missing" and "Z".Based on a John Le Carre novel, it's about the duplicity of big drug manufacturers and how they are prepared to kill countless millions in the Third World for huge profits. More particularly it deals with the constant gardener of the title, a mild-mannered diplomat in Africa, (Ralph Fiennes, quite magnificent), whose wife, a crusading Left Wing do-gooder, is murdered. Like Meirelles debut, "City of God", the film jumps back and forth in time, at least in the first half, building up the relationship between Fiennes and his wife Tessa, (an equally superb Rachel Weisz), and the events that lead to her death. The second half of the film concentrates on Fiennes' determination to find out who was responsible for his wife's death and moves out of Africa to London and Germany. We are, perhaps, in more conventional Le Carre territory here and typically the resolution matters less than the journey towards it.This is thrilling, gripping stuff; the kind of multiplex movie we seldom see, intelligently written, superbly directed and magnificently played, not only by Fiennes and Weisz but also by Danny Huston and Bill Nighy as corrupt officials and Pete Postlethwaite as a white doctor on the African front-line, trying to do his best for the people in his care and unsure where his loyalties lie. His performance here makes you realize why Spielberg thinks he is one of the finest actors in the world.</fullReview>

It successfully combines the elements of romance, thriller and social commentary, as well as conveying its serious message without being heavy handed.The stunning direction of Fernando Meirelles and the cinematography of Cesar Charlone make brilliant use of the various locations and Alberto Iglesias's haunting music complements it perfectly.

		<shortDescription>suggest reading the book- more subtle, more "shades of grey", characters fleshed out more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't say what the film was like for someone who didn't read the book. I"ve certainly been to movies where I can't keep track of who's who or understand the characters' motivations - so I can understand those who complain about confusion.I came knowing all the characters, I knew Tessa married a middle aged man to feel "safe" because she'd lost her parents. I knew who all the players were. I knew basically how it was going to unfold, so I was not concerned with the "suspense" element of the film.I think the movie did a good job of keeping the point of the book. I completely understand the need to weed out characters in order to fit 2 hours and not completely confuse people with too many characters. However I felt this detracted from the film. In the book - there's not 1 evil guy/1 evil company. Tessa's murder is much more of a case of what psychologists call "bystander apathy". Everyone did nothing, no one took any personal responsibility and so bad things happened. Sandy was a lustful idiotic creep only bent on promotion - never thought his actions would lead to her death. Pellegrin was just greedy. Justin was detached and had his head in the sand trusting his government was doing the right thing. The 3 doctors (2 female btw for the person who thought this film was anti-male) who came up with the drug were so focused on finding the cure they didn't realize at first about the complications or what the company was up to. One repents and goes to help people, one tries to stay with the company and fix things but is punished, one continues the questionable treatment. Kenny/CEO-3Bees is a nutcase but not really as involved as they make it seem and certainly never converts in a last minute attempt to explain a lot of plot left out. The British gov't is shown as just bureaucratic and myopically focused on what it thinks is best for Britain. The company is shown as just anxious to get the drug out to the market before competitors do so they allow exuberant scientists to rush and do shoddy testing. The African government is shown as a little corrupt but also more importantly (IMO) so overwhelmed that they do not know how to deal with these kinds of issues. (They're so concerned with the aid they get from the British and pharmaceutical companies that they focus on the people are being helped and let the already sick be used for guinea pigs.)So for those who found this film to be too black/white - read the book. I think it is much better (since there's the luxury of time) at showing the shades of grey.That said, I liked the film. I did not notice the shaky camera work that clearly disturbed others because I was so mesmerized by the beauty of the landscape and even the simultaneous experience of admiring the beautiful imagery in showing such poverty. I thought Raphael Fiennes and Rachel Wiesz did excellent jobs - and did not just rely on being "beautiful people". I thought that given the amount of subplots and stuff to cover the movie did a good job of giving the basic facts and themes of the book.*SPOILER* I can't decide which ending I liked best. In the book the truth doesn't really come out -it's all ruthlessly suppressed Ghita &amp; those who did the right thing are punished- Sanday/Pellegrin are rewarded. I feel this is more realistic, if sadder- but the fact that the govt/corporation can control absolutely everything/everyone seemed (hopefully!!!) a bit unrealistic. However the film's ending was way too "Hollywood" neat/quick wrap up even if it did seem more hopeful by showing that the truth would come out eventually.In summary, excellent film, but read the book to get the better picture of how ignorance, neglect, selfishness, apathy, greed, guilt, a focus on national-not global issues, refusal to challenge the status quo, racism, etc. (NOT just 1 dimensional "evil bad guy") all combine to bring about the sad state of Africa (and other parts of the world) today. We all contribute to this in small ways, it's not just Halliburton or Georgie Jr. Justin pulled his head out of the sand, now it's our turn.</fullReview>

The Constant Gardener is a very good movie that is about world's betrayal and constant screwing of Africa and its people; the medical companies doing all kind of legal and illegal experiments on ill Africans...Beside the obvious political agenda, this movie is also about love between a static, but good-hearted politician and a human-rights activist.I will not mention the plot, but I will just write that the politician is a person who, while working in Kenya, ignores poverty and misery by taking care of his plants.I would say that we all (in the West, at least) are constant gardeners, who do ignore and tolerate injustice in Africa - injustice done by Western powers, organisations and companies.Wonderful performances by Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes.

At one point I thought it was getting like Groundhog Day when some of the same footage was repeated.

		<fullReview>Africa is a continent to which the West turned its back, it's always been used as a waste basket and exposed to the most terrifying experiences. The Constant Gardener is a fine movie, sophisticated, but it turns a little bit confusing sometimes and a little bit obvious in others. Still the directing is great and so is the acting of Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz. It's not just another fiction, although it's based upon a romance by John Le Carré. It's a warning about what is happening to the poorest continent and how we are accomplices of the atrocities that take place under the Sahara desert. It also shows the result of the mess made by colonisation that mixed enemy tribes into the same country. You can conclude by this move that Africa is dying and we don't really know if it's possible to save it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I was a bit put off by the large-scale project of Tessa, it was still rather thrilling to see just how much one person could do (theoretically). What I enjoyed the most, however, was how they managed to keep the integrity of all the different cultures represented in the plot, and showed foils of all of the characters. I don't think there was one ethnic group or nationality not represented in both a good light and bad. Some films over-stereotype identities etc, but this was fabulous. I will definitely be seeing it again (if only for the gorgeous shots of African landscapes). It renewed my faith in some of the choices found in American theaters!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Not Completely Successful Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thinking back on "The Constant Gardener" the day or two after having seen it, I found much about the film to admire; however, my primary feeling while actually watching it was one of exasperation.This film is all rush, rush, rush from one scene to the next, barely giving the viewer time to catch his breath, let alone catch up to the plot. This is another one of those thrillers that thinks if it just moves fast enough, it will keep the audience members on the edges of their seats. It fails to realize that no amount of momentum can make a movie interesting if it doesn't make clear what everyone is rushing around for.Fernando Meirelles is certainly an intelligent director, and his earlier "City of God" is sensational and by far one of the best films of the decade so far. He employed a similar frenetic style to that film, but it felt more in tune with the subject matter. In "The Constant Gardener," that style too often merely distracts.But like I said at the beginning of my review, and despite all of the negatives I just summarized, there's much to admire here. The acting, for one, is top notch. Ralph Fiennes is always reliable and doesn't disappoint, but I was most impressed with Rachel Weisz; she in particular is so good that I wish she had been given more screen time. The relationship between their two characters is what sets this film apart from any other standard, run-of-the-mill political thriller, but at the same time it feels awkward. It's almost as if Meirelles has two different films going at the same time and isn't completely successful in merging them. The script, again, is intelligent, but more confusing than it needs to be. And the confusion factor isn't helped by Meirelles's jittery, busy camera, that at times induces headaches with its refusal to slow down.I can acknowledge that this film is good in many ways, but I still came away slightly disappointed with it, especially given all the hype it's received. I already feel like I need to see it again before I completely form my opinion, but only because I thought it was confusing and distracting the first time through, not because I feel like a second viewing will reveal it to be a richer film. I doubt a second viewing is going to improve my opinion of the film's clunky, preachy ending.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wanted to love this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great novel, a marvellous director and expertly cast. So why didn't I? Well, I had great expectations in the first few minutes. Ralph Fiennes (Justin) and Rachel Wiesz (Tessa) are just about perfect together, you really believe the instant attraction and are a little suspicious of Rachel's acceleration of the romantic process, which is all as it should be. But the whole plot ran completely out of steam and very, very quickly. For one, the movie couldn't decide what it wanted to be, a thriller, a great romance, a mystery, a travelogue. No sooner was I caught up in the emotions (and there are many such moments) than I was dumped into the evil pharmaceutical sub-plot. I felt manipulated very badly after Tessa gave birth in the hospital, it seemed like a cheap directorial trick, completely out of place in a movie of the attempted calibre of this one. All that said, I found the performances of the stars truly amazing, they rose above the material so magnificently. Fiennes gives a truly impressive performance, his tightly held emotions spill over in one scene that is truly heart-breaking. The supporting actors are also great, Danny Huston (looking more and more like his father John) is impeccable as the heartless cad and Pete Postlethwaite sinks into the role, as he always does, as if it were an old sofa. The scenes of Africa are enthralling and colourful and the music shines. But overall it just did not grab me and I found myself looking at the watch and wondering how long more.And then came the cavalry over the hill on their horses. I'm not kidding! I didn't know what movie I was at then. The ending signals from a long way away and there are far too many minutes of Justin and the deceased Tessa communicating. The 129 minutes it took felt more like 3 hours. 7 out of 10. There probably is an Oscar in there somewhere. Probably Ralph's. He did rise magnificently above the material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The relationship between Justin and Tess was beautifully and hauntingly portrayed by Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes. Fiennes' subtle but intense projection of Justin's unfolding understanding of his wife's love, loyalty and compassion was believable and heartfelt.The cinematography was sensitive and touching. The jerky images at the beginning were, I think, the director's way of expressing Justin's initial inadequate understanding (at best) of his wife's passion and character. In contrast, the beautiful cinema-graphic images of this country at the end of the film expressed Justin's understanding of his wife's heart.A great film...if it doesn't win some Oscars I'll be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wild colors of Africa amidst white lab coats. Scenes where less is said and more is learned. Lush gardens surrounding a deserted lover's apartment. These are just some of the reasons that I loved this movie.I enjoyed the characterizations which provided rich contrasts. From Justin Quayle's restrained elegance to Tessa Quayle's passion for the exploitation of global poverty, the characters of this movie all have that tenuous mix that allows the movie to stay on plot while providing opportunity for the audience to understand their motivations and their imperfections.Justin's journey to uncover his wife's death takes him to confront himself and his diplomatic paradigm, "We can't be involved ourselves in their lives". As Justin discovers the cause of his wife's death, he also discovers his own conflicts which the gardens of Nairobi give life to.I love movies like this that give me pause for concern, reasons for wonder and actors to admire in the unveiling of a story that keeps me on edge. Great storytelling and a visual feast, "The Constant Gardener" made my Labor Day Weekend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Constant Gardener has some good performances and Le Carre has written some great stories, but this one falls apart at the fundamental level. After some interesting plot twists and good suspenseful scenes, I was left with a hollow feeling at the end when the entire underpinning of the movie just falls apart.To really enjoy this movie, you have to believe that a multinational pharmaceutical company, upon discovering that a drug they are testing has a fatal flaw that can be corrected for a few million dollars, would decide instead to conceal the results and roll out the drug worldwide so they could expose themselves to billions of dollars in liability and probably destroy the company in the process. Ehhh? This doesn't compute.And the Fiennes character is a sickening wimp. It is completely unconvincing that the strong (albiet misguided) female character played by Weisz would be attracted to such a dud. I won't add the ultimate spoiler, but the way he resolves his emotional crisis in the end is sickening. He deserves worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most disturbing and brilliant films in years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite all the hype, I wasn't expecting much from this film. Boy, was I wrong! I wish I could say I "enjoyed" this movie, but that would only lessen the dimensions this film has. It is lush, enthralling, disturbing, and romantic. The characters are flawed and human, and played superbly by Weiss and Fiennes. Weiss is especially haunting, and well deserving of the accolades she has received to date for her work as Tessa, an obsessed woman with a heart for the underdog, seeking to right the wrongs against the people of Africa. Her charm and wit and passion are palpable. I can't remember a film that she has done I have been more impressed with. I hope she wins the Oscar. Fiennes is just as gripping, yet more understated. He performs as well as Weiss, yet his character seems less gripping than hers, although he has approximately twice the screen time. His character's redemption at the end of the film is unexpected, yet satisfying. One note on the "unspoken" character, namely the people of Africa. The most shocking part of this movie to me was the ability of the director to "take you there". The plight of these people is something westerners can only imagine in their worst nightmares, and yet we are left with not a sense of pity or loathing, but one of admiration for those portrayed in the film as pawns in a grand game they have no control over. The director clearly shares his love of them with the audience. All in all, one of the gratifying and troubling movies of 2005. One not to be missed.</fullReview>

It starts of Slow, but turns in to a story that by the end will have you wanting more.

		<shortDescription>Intelligent, mesmerizing, hauntingly painful and powerful....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Fernando Meirelles and starring Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz and adapted from the best-selling novel by John le Carre.This film positions itself in almost every single genre of movie-making, except probably space odysseys, yet never steps out of bounds or gets tangled in its complex storyline. Helmed by the Academy Award nominated director Mereilles (City of God), the film is meticulously constructed and coaxes career-best performances from Fiennes and Weisz. Set in Northern Kenya, Justin Quayle's (Fiennes) life is thrown into a guilt-ridden, remorseful, conspiracy infused, complicated mess, when he is informed of his wife's (Weisz) death. What ensues is an unrelenting pursuit of the truth in the belief of love; the stark brutality in the preservation of status quo, within a country torn by civil strife and poverty; a stinging commentary on corporate ethics; and unparalleled political intrigue. The film's central theme of finding oneself, is slowly and subtly revealed as we bear witness to the drama. Fiennes' performance is soulful, understated and heart-breaking. Weisz injects her role with dynamism, self-determinism and a big heart. Their love story smolders within the grandiose work of cinematographer Cesar Charlone, and the expert punctuated visual style of the director. Each scene is constructed to deliver a message through the use of flashbacks and interruptive frames which begin at one moment, then end later on in the film. The Constant Gardener is intelligent, mesmerizing, hauntingly painful and powerful film making. It is definitely one of the year's best films and should easily rank as one of the best political conspiracy thrillers ever featured on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is based on the novel by John Le Carre', adapted by Jeffrey Caine. Directed by Fernando Meirelles ( City of God) As an avid John Le Carre fan, I must admit I didn't think the movies based on his books would do much justice for his books. Boy was I wrong, especially about this one. Ralph Fiennes plays Justin Quayle, a British diplomat who plays sleuth as he tries to find out why his wife Tessa ( played by Rachel Weisz ) was murdered at an obscure outpost in Kenya.In the book every dialog scene was fragmented, you leave scenes just before the pivotal point emerges. In the movie, director Fernando Meirelles makes it fragmented as well, in a different way. Like in the movie 'Memento', except here Meirelles starts towards the middle and it leaves enough room for present action to be in the movie, and boy did I admire the direction here. The reason the picture works so well is because Meirelles is good at telling fragmented stories and finding definite ground. It pays off really well having the movie shot entirely in Kenya. Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes gave their BEST performances in this movie, stepping their skills up for their BRILLIANT director.I wanted to start another paragraph for Ralph Fiennes because his performance alone is a spectacle. Fiennes shows his range of emotion throughout this movie, yet on another level of his performance he is continually getting angrier at drug companies and on the final level of his performance he is falling more deeply in love with his wife, while forgiving her for any action she HAD to take in order to get what she wants. Any actor could find notes to hit in this character but I believe that Ralph Fiennes would have done the best job. His performance and character is so complex and Fiennes nails it. Count on an Oscar nomination for him.Another strong performance in this film is Rachel Weisz playing Tessa Quayle. What Weisz does is VERY strong, she embodies her characters' wit, charm and inner drive to bring down drug companies to make them stop doing what they are doing. She has a very keen sense in what she is doing and she will do ANYTHING to get what she wants and doesn't look back at what she has done.Meirelles directed himself another masterpiece. 10/10. It is also visually stunning with breathtaking shots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply stunning. Putting aside the breathtaking location shots and concentrating on the plot lines which kept me so enthralled - I wish I'd read the book before going to see it as everyone here is saying how it's better. I saw this last night on it's first night of general release in the UK and I have never heard an audience stay so quiet with concentration. I felt genuine compassion for all the characters, most particularly Ralph Fiennes exquisitely understated British Embassy official. Rachel Weisz certainly got into the spirit of things by being very obviously actually pregnant for much of the film! John Le Carre has done it again, the man's a genius anyway, but this just goes to prove it. It made me feel like jacking in the corporate rat race and donating everything to charity, moving to Africa and doing something about the bigger issues. Truly inspiring, educational, unbiased and bloody scary. Even the deaf old git in the row in front shut up after 20 minutes of asking his wife 'do we know what's happening?'. It shows how corruption can spread from just one bad egg, how greed controls the whole world if we're not careful about our morals and ethics and how love can drive one person to certain death in pursuit of the truth. I loved this film. I'm off to Africa to fight the drug companies single handed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Important and great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With his adaptation of John Le Carre's Book Fernando Meirelles made one of the most important movies in the last couple of years. Africa really seems to be the forgotten continent nowadays. And as Le Carre brought that back into minds of readers, Meirelles reminds moviegoers around the world. I'm much more hopeful that movies (and books) like this might change a thing than 10 Live Aid Concerts. But Meirelles not only narrates a relevant issue in a morally faultless way without being preachy, he also does it in an entertaining and most skillful cinematographic manner. An ever moving camera coupled with rough and discontinuity editing expresses the despair not only of the characters but also of the country. Many variations in colour add to this effect. With this movie one seems to get to know Africa and the Wests relation to it a little better. Acting is on Oscar-level as are direction, cinematography and editing. A clear 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fernando Mereilles, the Brazilian filmmaker behind 2002's breathtaking City of God, returns to theaters with a brilliant adaptation of John Le Carre's novel, The Constant Gardener. While not quite as powerful and engaging as its predecessor, Gardener nevertheless emerges as one of this year's very best films,Ralph Fiennes plays timid British diplomat Justin Quale, a man who spends his time tending his garden and delivering dull lectures, one of which is usurped by a lovely young spitfire named Tessa (Rachel Weisz). While Justin is content managing his own gardens, Tessa's concerns are far more global. Despite their clashing personalities, the two quickly fall for one another. With most movies, it would be a sin for a critic to inform the reader that the leading lady dies in the picture. However, the heroine's death in this particular film comes almost immediately, with much of the story then being told in smart, rapid flashbacks. We discover that prior to Tessa's untimely death, she and Justin traveled to Kenya on business, married, and conceived a child.Despite rumors that she was unfaithful, Justin becomes determined to learn the true nature of his wife's sudden passing. His devotion and curiosity propel him into an odyssey that involves corporate cover-ups, dangerous pharmaceuticals, and much more. Like City of God, Gardener brings global awareness to third-world suffering and ways of life that most of us can scarcely imagine. What begins as a simple romantic mystery becomes something much greater.Rating: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A superb treatment of a difficult novel to direct. The City of God director paces it perfectly, with finely crafted cinematography and never sensationalises or over-dramatises the material. Meirelles slings the tripod, his hand-held camera-work taking you on a rocky and paranoid ride through third world Africa. The camera regularly looks away from the action, hinting that there is a lingering menace and so much more going on than what we and the characters are aware of.Fiennes totally embodies the complex Justin Quayle, and his performance conveys the character's bold transformation as he gradually uncovers the truth and understands his wife's obsession. He is utterly convincing as both the ineffective and apathetic diplomat, and the man possessed that he gradually becomes. Strong support from Weisz and Huston ensure The Constant Gardener is both heartfelt and thoroughly convincing.In a Hollywood director's hands this would merely have been another Interpreter. Instead it is one of the most thought-provoking, gripping and convincing films of the year. Let's see more of Meirelles.For more film reviews go to www.swindondiary.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once again a movie that goes beyond years what should be said</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My husband and I ended our Saturday October 22, 2005 with the movie "The Constant Gardner" with Ray Fienes, and it made me very upset with what is happening in Africa and what our government is doing over there. It may be fictional but it had an element of truth in it. The movie paralleled a purest feeling of a singular populace, lone and colorful, heart-full and hopeful, a healthy psychology combated with a world bent on usage in the worst ways on a country beset with the worst injustice. Along side this beautiful portrayal of a nation was the landscape of devastation, not the Africa of "Out of Africa" but the one in existence today: of shanty towns built around refuge and illness, of desperation and fear, a systemic fear of waste and ever-increasing hopelessness. This movie is not romantic but realistic, and it spells disaster in the worst way upon what we have now, maybe not now but in the future. If you thought New Orleans was bad, look upon Africa. It burdens me when I see overweight kids on the U.S. who don't want to be that way but since we have a steady feed of hormone laced foods in our diets, we cannot avoid this, and then we see starving emaciated ones in 3rd world countries, what is going on? Greed, corporations, money. Money goes in the hands that can have it and it stays there, environments get spoiled and exploited, disease runs rampant, we are a sorry sort. It makes sense on our side, the side with money to overfeed and make us unhealthy along with stuff we don't' need in our diets, make us sick, make us overweight, make us dependent on drugs the rest of our natural lives and it makes sense to exterminate the already poor and non-productive sick, ill and indigent who can'tgo out and shop and spend money. I truly hate all the ads on TV, these days, I hate the damn shopping channels, I hate the car commercials. I hope in my day, before I die, I see hummers and SUV being crunched daily in the scrap yards. I hope I see a day when we return to using buses, bikes and trains, or even horses. I hope I see a return to a more natural existence with this planet so that the planet does not decide to take matters into it's own hands and rid itself of the disease of mankind. In this movie at the end it paints the one soul left and how in the world at large the one soul stands alone and triumphs. It is a beautiful film on on levels. It means we stand to benefit on doing our utmost to be true to ourselves and those around us.this is an insight-full film, based on courage and conviction, combating the easiness to slide into greed or unconcern. We would all do best to take note and learn from this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Constant Gardener director Fernando Meirelles is on the top of the world of cinema industry. He proves with this flick all his talent, originality and social conscience. He took a commercial screenplay and transformed it in a nervous and breathtaking trip through Africa. I had to see it twice (in a cinema in S?o Paulo, Brasil) to get all the informations and characters motivation to immerse into the history. The editing and cinematography are superb, the actors and actress are perfect. Rachel Weiz gives the best female performance I saw this year. She shines in every frames. The chemistry between she and Ralph Fiennes rules the movie. Fiennes is also very good.It's a love story, a thriller and a social comment about our world. Unfortunately money rules the world and the government is in their hands (just think about the USA and the war against Iraque, the petrol, the gas, the relations between Bush and the gas corporation. How many had to die for profits?). We can imagine that Le Carre and Meirelles are exaggerating but if we start think about what we read in magazines maybe they are not. It's an advice to the world: how we (the society, government and corporations) are treating (baddly) the people who lives in poor areas.

		<shortDescription>A damming indictment of multinational pharmaceuticals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fernando Meirelles's follow up to City of God is proof that that powerhouse chronicle of life in the favelas was no one of. Shot with an extravagant eye for detail and scented with a noble poignancy, The Constant Gardener (based on John Le Carre's acclaimed novel) follows Terry George's Hotel Rwanda as the next important document of the troubles and tragedies of Africa.Following the discovery of the body of his wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz) by the idyllic surroundings of northern Kenya's Lake Turkana, Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) sets out on a quest to understand the side of Tessa he never knew. As a British diplomat, his marriage to her modern day "revolutionary", seems at first glance a strange one, but the story elaborates on their relationship, shown through a series of flashbacks as Justin remembers the tender moments they shared and the great joy they obviously brought each other.The memories however, are underscored by unease as her humanitarian activities, in association with Hubert Kounde's Belgian doctor, create tension within the diplomatic service ranks. There is a suggestion that the two may have been engaged in an affair (Tessa's murder is even initially assumed to have been a crime of passion).As Justin digs further his own life is put in danger, as he realises his wife was trying to fight for a just cause. We learn that there is a sinister side to the British (Western) presence in Kenya and their relationship with giant multinational drug corporations who exploit poor Africans desperate for treatment. When I think about recent scandals involving large pharmaceutical companies and their reluctance to manufacture cheap retrovirals to supply third world countries, such a scenario seems frighteningly realistic. The film brings home the horrible reality of such dubious dealings as demonstrated by the appalling treatment of a sick young mother.Meirelles shoots this with a vibrancy and life that those familiar with City of God will be au fait with. The Kenyan slum is evinced as a place of sparkling colour (scenes in Kibera Africa's largest shantytown are full of bright oranges and reds sets against dark red earth and endless corrugated iron). The photography also encompasses staggering images of flocks of flamingos, bright blue lakes and flowing savannah as we leave the city.This is in stark contrast to the dark grey backdrop to the European locations. London seems very drab and rigid by comparison. There is perhaps an artistic point to this, as a growing darkness becomes more apparent in the story during the section where Justin travels back to London and on into Germany.Fiennes exudes graciousness and stoicism throughout, as he bravely tries to piece together the events. He manages to also convey Justin's gradual release of emotion, culminating in a heartbreaking moment of recollection of happier times (Meirelles cutting from a broken Justin to an image his beaming wife).His performance is strongly backed up by Weisz's contrasting turn. She vivacious and radical while he toes the line. However, the further Justin heads on his pursuit (always realistic and never taken over by any overblown heroics), the more impassioned Fiennes's performance. An important scene has him angrily questioning a South African doctor (Pete Postethwaite in a small but influential effort) all the while maintaining a dignified air, as chaos descends around them.The story welds together romance and intrigue in a potent formula. It contains the ingredients for an epic tale like the English Patient, but is concentrated more towards the machinations and movement of a fast paced thriller like the Bourne Identity. Each minute builds the sense of conniving on a grand scale and the plot is complex, but never impossible to fathom. Furthermore, a level of social conscience underscores it together with an understanding for the problems of Africa Bob Geldof could never hope to impart with his superficial ranting. The Constant Gardener is a triumph on every level.</fullReview>

Bush speaks about using the military to enforce a quarantine and about the development of a vaccine: "I've spent time with Tony Fauci on the subject.

		<shortDescription>Bad camera work, but an extraordinary film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was one of the more brilliant works of film I have seen in a very long time. And the fact that it is based on a book makes it even more brilliant because now that I've seen the movie, I'm going to be rushing to the library to read the book. It was a beautifully crafted piece of work, with the exception that the camera work was shaky as if they didn't use a tripod at all during the shooting. Its cast made me stay captivated nearly every minute of the film, anticipating the next scene, wondering what will happen. I loved the work of Ralph Fienes and Rachael Weiz, and of course Bill Nighy from the hit The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I can't wait for this movie to come out. (P.S.) If you don't like bumpy camera movement then stay away from this movie. Other then the camera, it was an OK film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>was OK. It had great acting but I was disappointed. I came into the theater expecting something of an action movie (I don't know why). But when I came out I was very disappointed. It was basically about making everyone who saw it feel bad. I know that Africa needs help. HIV and other diseases run rampant over there. But, it just seemed to me to be out of line to push a political idea on an audience thats all. It would have been better had they left all that garbage out. Then I would have liked it more. Rachel Weisz did an amazing job. And Ralph Fiennes did as possibly good as he could. I think that next time they make a political movie the trailer should show that. But it is worth seeing once. I would recommend renting it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meirelles with a bigger budget doesn't sell out, thank God.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meirelles adds a definite African feel to the book I read. A lot of the stripteases that are signature John Le Carré have been telescoped, but I think the movie got the anger of the book perfectly.There's a new scene involving a raid on the village which I thought was actually an improvement on the book. The scene's outcome certainly stresses this film was not made in Hollywood.There is this speech by the lawyer Ham that was a bit too much and spoils the film just a little bit.I love Rachel Weisz, who I find neither pretty nor sexy, but she's excellent here. I love the very low-key Ralph Fiennes. His role here will seem over-the-top and hysterical compared with his wonderful work in 'Spider'.Compared with his 'Cidade de Deus', which I think of as a string of firecrackers, this movie is a slow burn, in the end there isn't a real bang but you do feel outrage and heartbreak for the ill-fated lovers and the Kenya they love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Speaking as someone from Kenya, this movie provided a great visual, political and emotional picture. The director's jagged camera work, so potent in "City of God", was most suitable for this environment. Many remarks on this film say Tessa (Rachel Weisz' character) was in a small village in Kenya. Actually the work she and the doctor were doing was in the capital city of Nairobi, in a "shanty town", similar to the havelas in Rio. So all the chaos and filth exist not too far from the middle class homes, and, in fact, the president's State House. The vibrant colors of Africa contrasted beautifully with the cold grays and blues of Europe. The director gave equal camera-time to the native people and their true-to-life environments as he did to the sprawling, breathtaking landscape. Many movies that take place in Africa often focus on the scenery and wildlife, and leave the Africans on the periphery.I appreciated the gritty, human and revealing performances by all the cast, especially the two leads. Again, having lived in Kenya, I can't tell you how accurate the portrayals were (the diplomatic corps, the aid workers, the local politicians, the government employee looking for a death certificate..). I can't wait to read the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Constant Gardener the best film of 2005</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is perhaps the best movie of the year, yeah I know people have said with other lesser films but "The Constant Gardener" is the real deal. It punches you in the gut, presents realistic situations, questions our status in the world today and how much good or bad (War in Iraq, Aids in Africa, gluttony of the US and Brits flip/flop of support for the US) we're doing. This is definitely another movie that like "March of the Penguins" , "Roots", "Hotel Rwanda", "Roger and Me" that needs to be released to the masses and watched by many people to educate. Well who better to direct such a power film that the man himself Fernando Meirelles (from Brazil Amigos!!!!) this is the same great director who brought us the astonishing "City of God.", this man really needs more attention. I guess being from South America , the media neglects to put guys like this in the spotlight since he ain't American but come-on, he rules!!!It's billed as a thriller on IMDb but really it's more than that film fans, it's a political thriller/drama/ love story/ social commentary all rolled up into one beautifully written and poignant story.At it's core it's about what you believe to be right and fighting the good fight for a cause. Really that's in a nutshell. Some of us claim to want to do that, but others do it without procrastinating.This helps introduce the two protagonists, Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) and Tessa Quayle (Rachel Weisz) . My God, they are so good in this movie, and to think Rachel has beauty to go with her skill as well!!! Fiennes once again silences those snobby critics who still doubt he can deliver a good lead well he does and then some.Plotwise. the story concerns a journalist Tessa Quayle, involving herself into a corrupt medical company in Kenya with a terrible secret. More than that though Tessa, is a humanitarian who sees the suffering in Africa and wants to help the people. Eventually she learns of misdoings by the company there, and when she is about to break the story, she is murdered. Justin (Fiennes) is the conservative in the family, though he and Tessa disagreed on some topics, they love each other. Justin takes news of her death as bad you can imagine. Instead though of using his time to grief and feel sorry for himself, he uses his time to find out the truth, why did his loving wife find and why was she murdered? And more importantly is he next? Thus the mystery begins, Fiennes is on here from start to finish, really he's such a good actor, you can't look away a sec from him or Rachel. They dominate here, expanding their characters from simple people with simple goals in mind, to individuals whose emotions go in different directions.A bigger issue then that Constant Gardener address besides the poor dying people of Africa (a country decimated by Aids) is the issue of greed by the pharmaceutical drug companies and how they use their status as caring and loving to exploit poor people and desperate people for unproven studies with disastrous results. Of course the question that comes up is does this really happen? And the answer is yes, companies like Merck., PFizer have all been embroiled in drug scandals with dangerous drugs exposed by the FDA and news companies like 20/20 and 60 minutes. Of course the drug companies deny all wrongdoing but we as Americans are not fooled and thus we have this constant (no pun intended) conflict of interest with the drug companies over profit and safety.The Constant Gardener then is simply one of the best if not the best movie to come out in 2005. It was simply a delight to watch this movie, and moreover write a review about it. I really hope everyone goes to watch this movie, and better yet, people should go in groups to see this film because really it's an important film that everyone should watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's no such thing as a cheap life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Constant Gardener is a dizzyingly poetic socio-ethno-political thriller that tells a story of life, lives, and the ever present condition in modern life that has the health and lives of each and every one of us balanced against corporate bottom line on a daily basis until the day we cease to exist.As I began watching this film expand in front of me, my first thought was, "This was definitely not made by Americans." There is a palpable texture and humanity not only in the way this film looks, but more importantly in the narrative (not typical of American made films), which had me breathing hard and on the verge of tears far more than I'd admit to.In light of the subject matter, it seems superficial to even remark on the elements of the film itself. This film uses tools from the same backyard shed as Amores perros, throwing up a gritty pastiche of color and harsh texture juxtaposed with the sudden and profound romance between the lead characters.I'm not giving anything else away, and I would urge anyone who appreciates film, acting, life, and truth, to see this film. And make no mistake, while this is based on a fictional story, the underlying proposition that your life has a price tag is as sure as death itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Masterpiece from Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Constant Gardener is a flawless movie, an amazing thriller, a powerful story that shows how small a man can be in this world, or even better, how possible small can be ourselves, simple citizen against great corporations working in deep joint-venture with agencies of the government, in this case, a big pharmaceutical enterprise working under the protection of the United Kingdom government. Although the movie is based on the novel of the same name, you can feel like this story is really true, all because the excellent work of Mr. Fernando Meirelles, whose previous work is City of God, an instantaneous masterpiece in film history.Mr. Meirelles has an excellent skill to work with the camera and he is very keen with the use of the Shouter, and that give you the feeling that this could have been a true story, such is the acumen of Mr. Meirelles's camera. The result is a landscape so beautiful in reality that you almost feel yourself in the land of South Africa. Of course the movie, as well as the book, is a portrait to show the horrible and dreadful images of the poverty in which the Africans must live.The edition of Mr. Meirelles's movie works very similar to his previous film. He has such a control in his movies that he is able to find the juxtaposition-driven edition in the scenes, so that basically at the very begging of the movie the character played by Rachel Weisz is already death. Therefore, two acts of the movie are filled with flashbacks of the Ralph Fiennes's character.An those two characters are perfectly played by Mr. Fiennes and Ms. Weisz, and I think this is by far the best performance in her career. Mr. Fiennes delivers raw, angry, deception and shows his great love for his death wife so deep; that you almost feel this is happening to you. However, he has delivered another great performances in the past, mostly in The Schindler's List, Quiz Show and Spider, among others.The script is written without holes, is flawless, the three acts are just great. Even though the movie last more than two hours you never get tired of this astonishing story. Hence, the work of Jeffrey Caine is a hymn to humanity and to human beings lack of power and also is a song to the true love, which endure above all the terror and wicked things. Bring it on the Oscar's night; I'm sure The Constant Gardener is going to be a strong contender for the five main categories.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a movie landscape inhabited by over rated "stars" and over priced special effects, how wonderful to sit through a gripping drama, based in reality, and one that assumes that the audience has an attention span longer than a nanosecond. At the risk of sounding like a boring old fogey, I would say that The Constant Gardener is the best movie seen so far in 2005. Great script, great cinematography, solid performances (some of which were truly wonderful), genuinely moving and a plot to actually make you think. I'm hoping there are people out there still capable of thinking? The basic story line follows a minor British diplomat in Kenya who is trying to investigate the murder of his wife and her local doctor friend. They had been working to uncover corruption involving an international drug company's exploitative use of impoverished Kenyans in AIDS related drug testing. What he uncovers is the ultimate "can of worms".We took our teenage kids and they totally agreed with us about this film, so don't believe everything you hear about kids only wanting to watch, shoot-em-up, blow-em-up action movies. Make a good movie and people will go. It really is that simple. If there were more movies of this caliber showing on American screens, there would be no box office slump. Bill Nighy was outstanding as a slimy British diplomat, Ralph Fiennes was totally believable as the sweet but rather weak husband and Rachel Weisz was a revelation as his wife.</fullReview>

This adaptation of The Constant Gardener rivals The Russia House in terms of honesty to the novel, great performances, great locations, suspense, great direction, etc. This is truly a great movie that you will savor for a long while. The director is excellent and the cinematography and photography are creative. The lead performances will stay with you. You will see this movie at Oscar time.

The gorgeous people, their imagination and sense of color, their ability to make do with very little, the immense dignity of some and, as with all cultures, the petty mentality of others. The only weaknesses are that the secondary characters are not clearly delineated until late in the film and some of the editing is a bit too fast-cut for my taste.The full measure of the film will found by watching it at a good movie theater, where the photography and the sound can be best appreciated.

		<shortDescription>The key word here is "Disturbing"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not been so disturbed by a movie since I saw a massacre seen in the film "Ghandi" way back in 1983.It is hard to believe that this film is based on a book by John Le Carre. He used to write cold war novels full of espionage and intrigue. He would bring us into worlds that seemed real, yet were full of enough fictional intrigue and suspense that the books would feel like adventurous rides. His books were exhilarating.But not this work. Le Carre takes his writing talent to present day Africa. No cold war here. No Soviets or KGB. Instead, he portrays present day Africa with disturbing intensity even more than some documentaries have achieved.The film has a very centered premise. A British diplomat's wife is found dead alongside a road and he suspects foul play. She belonged to Amnesty International and he suspects that her work led to her demise. The film takes us on his journey to find out what really happened to her and why.But for me, the premise of the film serves as a tool to weave the movie together. The real focus of the movie for me is the current situation in Africa. The poverty. The corruption. The hiv/AIDS epidemic. The need for medications. And most of all, the West's seemingly endless policy of considering African lives to be of less value than those in the West.The film portrays the rule of anarchy in Africa not only by African tribespeople, but by African governments and Western governments.This film does not hold anything back when addressing Africa. I know I have used the word "disturbing" already, but I must use it again. This is a profoundly disturbing movie. In a sense, I am sorry for having gone to see it because it shook me up immensely. It also leaves me wondering what we could ever do to fix the problems that are in Africa.I ironically say ? If you go to see this movie, don't expect to enjoy it. It is definitely a rare gem, a 10 out of 10, a memorable film to stir up controversy and debate. But those with weak stomachs, or very sensitive nerves, just prepare yourselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A masterpiece in drama and one of the best, if not the best thriller of the summer, the "Constant Gardener" is a fantastic film that brings attention to some of Africa's current problems. Fernando Meirelles directs in a way that brings you into the film and allows you to share Justin Quayle's(Ralph Fiennes) confusion and emotion.Meirelles's editing in the movie, although confusing at times, leaves the audience in constant suspense, and the cinematography brings each and every scene to life whether they be in horror, shock, hatred or love.The story is gripping, but overall the movie is about Africa and how the rest of the world views it. As it is shot on location, each and every scene accurately bring Africa into the theatre. Thin houses with rusted roofs clump together with trash blowing about in the streets in the cities and clay huts with grass roofs dot the country side Justin Quayle searches for the truth. There are obvious problems, but few will do anything to help. Even the locals say, "That is just the way it is." The movie is about how hard it is to fight for change in a place where those with power do not care for those they have power over.The film achieves its purpose in educating its audience about the troubles of Africa. As it is the best drama I have seen this year, I would not doubt that the Academy will take note of this fantastic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Ugh, not another Ralph Fiennes movie with a stupid title? Wait ... it is directed by Fernando Meirelles (the powerful "City of God") and based on the novel by John LeCarre. Guess I will give it a shot. Thankfully, this decision making process lead me to this movie.No single label can be hung on the film - romantic, political conspiracy thriller with a powerful self-discovery journey is as close as I can come. Very few romances take flight after one's death, but this well meaning, non-linear storyline allows this to occur. It does seem as though the film tried to bite off a bit more than it could chew given the multitude of sub-plots.In the vein of "Silkwood", "The Insider" and "Erin Brockovich", director Meirelles takes us on an emotional ride of anger, giddiness, despair, helplessness and hope. The cinematography and photography are at times stark, other times breathtaking. The countryside is beautiful and the over-crowded towns and market and claustrophobic. The elitist Brits remind of American politicos and will disgust you every bit as much as any Michael Moore film.Never a big fan of Ralph Fiennes, I will say he definitely captures the quiet elegance and uncertainty of a British diplomat (referred to as a Labrador early in the movie) just wanting to survive his job and cultivate his garden. He then shows the necessary spirit and grit for the second act of the film to make it work. The big surprise of the film is that Rachel Weisz can ACT!! She is stunning as Tessa, who would change the world, one baby at a time. The depth she shows as this complicated lady immediately elevates her into an entirely new category of actress. I look forward to her roles over the next few years if she capitalizes on the opportunities that most assuredly await her.The supporting cast is excellent, lead by the creepy Danny Huston, eternally-Brit Bill Nighy and the always off-center Pete Postlethwaite. The score and music are hypnotic and a real asset to the film. Stay for the credits as that final two pieces are wonderful listening. One of the most interesting and ambitious films of the year so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has been getting some pretty good reviews. I actually can't think of someone who has given it a bad one. So, going into the movie, I thought, "I think I spent my money well." First, let me say I have not read the novel, and the novel usually does end up being better than the movie. That being said, I found this movie quite confusing and at times hard to follow. I did not like how in the beginning we kept going back and forth from flashback to present. The cinematography was poor to say the least. Camera movements were never really steady, and the feel of the photography did not seem like we were watching a movie. It was as if it was being filmed by an amateur with a camcorder (Although this may be Merielles' intent. If it was, I missed it.) Perhaps the best thing about this movie that sticks out is Rachael Weisz. This is probably the best role I have seen her in! Dare I say it's a little Oscar-worthy? The plot, although confusing, was nice &amp; dramatic. A good dramatic flow through the film kept the plot going despite the slight confusion. Although, this flow was disrupted by blatant political message, which can be a bit annoying needless to say. Overall, this was a good movie, but not as good as I had hoped. It's one of those movies you would want to see once (maybe twice just to clear things up) and never again.</fullReview>

I don't think of myself as a sophisticated viewer, and sometimes I get lost in the plot of a thriller, but in this movie, I saw the end coming about 35 minutes into the film. I fell asleep no less than 3 times, but each time I woke up, I found that I was following the plot just fine. I didn't care about any of the characters, mostly because they were not considered to be responsible for their actions, a la Mystic River. The film had a self-important feel to it, and its agenda kept stepping on the story until it was mashed almost beyond recognition. It was as self-indulgent as the worst of student films. In summary, I think this film has Oscar nominee written all over it... except that it was released too early in the year to be a serious contender.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE CONSTANT GARDENER follows mundane, green-thumbed, low level diplomat Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) from his move from Britain to Kenya. During a lecture in Britain, he encounters brash yet vulnerable Tessa (Rachel Weisz) who soon, after a suggestive intense yet short relationship, asks to accompany him to Kenya. Tessa is found dead, murdered during a surprise jaunt, her companion and suggested lover suspect and missing. In a dizzying set of flashbacks, we soon discover that Tessa had another life altogether, hidden from the day-to-day of Justin. Not only is she a do-gooder by day but Tessa is investigating the inner workings of a global conspiracy that affects the highest reaches of the British government and she's willing to sacrifice anything to uncover the details.The CONSTANT GARDENER succeeds because of it's methodical pacing, terrific acting, and an ability to help the characters while conveying a message of greed and deception. At times the movie seems to have come to a stop and luckily it's just a break between acts. Fiennes does a terrific job as the stiff upper lip Britainer. Weiscz is equally enchanting. The only weakness is the editing, which is a bit too spastic.</fullReview>

He stays close to the emotional heart of the story without getting bogged down in detail. Despite its relevance and timeliness, the political backdrop remains just that -- a backdrop for character development. Both leads morph perfectly into their roles -- Weisz as the beautiful young firebrand and Fiennes as the civilized, polite man who rises to the occasion when his humanity is threatened. Beautiful cinematography and a fine supporting cast round out the production. And of course, kudos to the studio for actually putting a real human crisis on screen rather than resorting to the usual suite of stock villains. Bravo to all involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie of the Year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is without a doubt the Best Movie, so far, of 2005.At one time I worked at the Kakuma Refugee Camp in the Turkana region of Kenya and this film captures the area and the people. Some viewers may be put off by the scenes of poverty and violence but that is the reality of Africa today. This is especially true when the action shifts to Southern Sudan and the viewer is brought face to face with the horrible war that has been raging for more than 20 years in that poor country.The acting is excellent throughout and is is the kind of picture that stays with you, not the typical film that leaves your mind about the same time the popcorn leaves your body.It also brings to a wide audience the tragedy that is modern Africa. It is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A refreshing relief from this summer's mediocrity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Constant Gardener is a refreshing relief from the mediocrity of this summer's offerings. It takes us on an intimate journey of romance, tragedy, and intrigue across 2 continents. Modifications and changes from John Le Carré's novel do nothing but help the filmmakers in successfully breathing life to this novel on screen. Ralph Fiennes is excellent at revealing a rawness and intensity to his latest character. Unlike his other characters of the past, this one is loving, simple and without any major complexities that are usually the backbone of such rawness and intensity. Yet out of this simple character emerges a dynamic one as audiences are once again, feeling the anguish and pain that only an actor as supremely talented as Fiennes can deliver. The Constant Gardener's distinct and contrasting mix of cinematography styles along with its superb acting are what make this film a relevant one to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps those who reviewed this film with a D or worse would have been better off in "The Wedding Crashers" or "The 40 Year Old Virgin." Those who found the movie "boring" may enjoy the crude humor and sex in the other movies better. This movie was stunning. Each shot was delicately shot giving a poetic effect. The subject is controversial, another reason some may not enjoy it. The truth of the matter is, it is an eye opener. Tears came streaming down my cheeks as I watched 2 and 3 year olds being murdered, corrupt companies choosing profits over life. If you lack a global perspective, an open mind and a love for quality films, you will see that this movie is truly worthy of a best picture Oscar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>According to the ratings in IMDb, this movie looks like a good one. I spent more than two hours watching it, and I definitely don't think it deserves an Oscar's nominee. It is cheap, does not deserve attention. I don't know why some movies are rated highly and some others are not. This is a boring movie that I was looking forward to end. I expected it to be more interesting towards the end but it never did. It got boring and boring continuously. I am disappointed. This movie is similar to Lord of War in one way. One takes arm dealers and the other one drug dealers. Both of them point to the problems that we have in Africa but I think Lord of War is a much better movie than this one. This movie is definitely boring. Stay away!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliant. Simply and utterly brilliant. The first truly great film of 2005. Which doesn't say a whole lot considering its the end of September. Most of the movies the Hollywood makes these days are crap. Pure crap. Depending on which you prefer.This movie had everything in it. It had wonderful acting. The actors didn't overact which is common in difficult scenes. This is an Oscar calibrated film from the first fade in to the final fade out. You simply don't get movies like this anymore. All you get nowadays are basically just sequels and remakes. All of which are pure crap. Why remake a classic? It's beyond me.Rachel and Ralph deserve Oscar nominations at the very least for their brave, stunning, and subtle performances. The director delivers a stunning sophomore attempt.Anyone who hasn't seen this film is missing out on a great afternoon outing. This film is worth more than the ten dollars that you'd pay for. You won't be disappointed in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than 'City of God'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this last night (opening day) and it completely blew me away. The way that it encompassed a political issue but came at it in a very personal way was amazing. The film used a lot of hand-held camera action which really connected the viewer into the action and made you feel as if you were a part of it. Also for the first half of the movie you saw Tessa as sort of a promiscuous slut especially in the scene where it cuts to her holding a black baby with Arnold and Justin right next to her made you think that she was carrying Arnolds baby the entire time. The end of the movie brings her back as a heroic figure. The movie is perfectly paced so that you feel as if you are inside Justins head. The narrative is expressed clearly through jolting camera action, quick cuts, and pacing. When Justin is just learning all the secrets about his wife's death there are tons of quick cuttings which make the viewer feel overwhelmed as Justin most certainly feels but then it slows again feeling almost as if Justin's found peace with his wife's death and suddenly has a clearer head. I could say much much more about this amazing film but it seems pointless because you really have to experience it for yourself. See this movie TWICE in the theaters. It won't be a waste of money guaranteed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From New Orleans to Kenya</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an incisive and disturbing political thriller that also makes an indirect commentary on the respective Bush debacles in Iraq and New Orleans. Just as the drug companies in The Constant Gardener make social policy in unfettered fashion, cruelly affecting the lives of millions, so too has Big Oil left the state of our democracy, as well its (in)ability to respond to real disasters such as Katrina, in tatters. It is worth thinking about that just as the poor of Kenya remain an expendable Third World commodity, so to do the poor of New Orleans achieve Third World status in Bush's Brave New World that favors wars for oil profits over funds for levee restoration and flood protection. I felt rage and sadness watching this cinematic masterpiece, but I could not stop thinking that the poor of Kenya shared a not dissimilar fate from the poor of Louisiana and Mississippi. Go see The Constant Gardener now, and take a hard look at those grade school assumptions about our American "democracy". And like the Rachel Weisz character in the movie, you might even be impelled to act...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good thriller, but with something to say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A marvelously photographed film that serves to remind us that there is more to that great continent of Africa than we tend to imagine, and this film (and the book it was based on) serves as a pointed critique of how we (the wealthy countries of the world) see and treat those of whom we know and care so little. But much of the intrigue is in the cloak and dagger narrative and the political machinations it describes and alludes to. What made this a superior film was how these issues were deftly handled and compellingly presented by a top notch cast and careful direction making large issues intimately meaningful so that you come away with lots to talk about, and caring about something you can seek to change. Sprawling sentences just to say: great film, great cast. Weisz and Fiennes have great chemistry. Weisz's rant when Fiennes' and her character first meet was brilliant.</fullReview>

Although a work of fiction, much of the movie's elements center on true-to-life themes that receive some, but perhaps not enough, press. The photography and on-location filming in Kenya and elsewhere is absolutely stunning in and of itself. The vivid color and boundless life and poverty of Kenyan slums to the many non-actor Africans were an extremely vivid touch and really added an element of thoughtfulness to the film.

		<fullReview>This is the worst movie I have seen in a long, long time. The Plot is a socialist manifesto that only those caught up in conspiracy theories could find believable and the only thing exciting about this movie is when you finally turn it off. I cannot believe it received a 7.7 rating. If the movie were a plea for more help for Africa and AIDs victims, or if it had as its objective making a statement that big drug companies are bad -criminally so - then it would be at least up-front about its purpose. But to call this movie "exciting" requires turning the English language upside down. This movie is boring, boring, boring. If it has any redeeming features, I missed them. The movie is also misnamed. They should have called it "Lost In Translation"; at least then bewildered viewers could leave the theater saying: "Well, at least it had an honest title."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Constant Gardener", a novel by John LeCarre dared to point a finger to what he saw as a big problem in the pharmaceutical industry with its experiments on humans by giving unsuspecting patients medicine that have not been proved effective and that could cause death.Fernando Mireilles picks up where Mr. LeCarre left off with the film version of the novel that was adapted by Jeffrey Caine. "The Constant Gardener" is a disturbing film about what goes on behind the scenes. Mr. Mereilles has directed a film that, while has its heart in the right place, as others have commented in this forum, can be seen as preachy, at best.The other aspect of the film makes a thriller out of it when Justin Quayle, the meek British working for the government and based in Africa sees his young wife and her assistant brutally killed and that is when he takes the matter into his hands.The film will satisfy most viewers because the action never stops and Mr. Mireilles has done wonders to get us involved in all he is showing on the screen.Ralph Fiennes makes Justin Quayle come alive. Rachel Weisz is also up to task with her take on Tessa. However, the big surprise is Dennis Huston who plays the duplicitous Sandy Woodrow with great style. The excellent Bill Nighy is seen only in a couple of key scenes. The rest of the cast does good work under the director's guidance."The Constant Gardener" is a film that makes one think about what happens to the poor people suffering from disease and are in effect guinea pigs in the process.</fullReview>

Ralph Fiennes is the title character who is an avid gardener. Rachel Weisz is the outspoken activist student Tessa who he meets at the university of London. Fiennes plays the reserved Briton Justin Quayle who is also a British diplomat sent to the high commission in Kenya. Until his wife is murdered, he is haunted by questions about her relationship with Dr Arnold Bluhm who traveled with her. His wife was murdered and he knew there was more. This film shows the mutual love affair between Justin and Tessa. The film has a great supporting cast and stunning views of Kenya. It also shows the real Kenya where AIDS is an epidemic and poor living conditions. This film is must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the white make a movie on the black especially in Africa, usually the story shows an white-man's travails in the insensitive circumstances created by the inhumane black people and how the saviour inside him makes him a messiah for some of the downtrodden . Of course there would be depiction of innocence, victimhood and helplessness, and mostly it would show the manipulative big corporates (read assholes) exploiting the ignorance and penury of the under-privileged. Did I sound too negative? Well, I never intended to. All in all, these movies would be great - laced with great performances, graphic visuals and thought-provoking direction. You would love these movies which would be favourite in many award nominations.Along side Blood Diamond, Hotel Rwanda and The Last king of Scotland, I would now stack 'The Constant Gardener'. It is a fantastic movie. Though the movie's backdrop is the exploitation of the poor African people by the big American pharmaceutical conglomerates, the movie focuses on the relentless search of one bereaved man to find the perpetrators of his outspoken wife's brutal murder. Great performances by Ralph Fiennes (I am a big, big fan now) and Rachel Weisz (wins an Oscar for her role). The 'City of God' director lives his name.One example where the movie is more enjoyable than the book ( Or is it I have lost interest in fictions?)A great watch.(originally posted @ weirdo-on-movies.blogspot.com)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>417th Review: Challenging and enlightening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Constant Gardener remains on the better films about corruption and what Eisenhower himself called the Industrial Complex: the ability of any pursuit based solely on profit to bend the rules to do so. He considered it was governments' new role to act as the police on those industries. Here, in Africa, we see the result unfold when instead of policing, governments decide to get into bed with those interested in profit over life.The plot is mainly linear and the two leads are excellent. Ralph Fiennes throughout embodies the very notion of decency: it is inculcated, as natural as breathing, he is decent, restrained, thoughtful, and diplomatic - we loved this characterisation - no braggadocio - but rather something immensely likable and rather important lies in his character. Rachel Weise impassioned Don Quixote, who not only sees what is wrong with world but tries to change it, is well done.The two meet in London when she challenges him at a briefing. They marry. He is posted to Africa. She starts uncovering pharmaceutical abuses and the story unfolds.All in all this has real romance, a firmly fixed moral compass, an interesting insight to both globalization, modern diplomacy as enablers, and on corruption. It is also a human story that has heart, vision, and stands as one of the few films to leave the viewer wishing for a better world.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intelligent thriller, one of the best I've seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A shy non-descript British diplomat holds a press conference in Africa. He gives standard answers to the journalists in attendance. Suddenly he finds himself answering hard questions from a woman standing near the back. She questions him mercilessly about why Britain should assist in the United States war in the Middle East. As she berates him with hard questions, the other journalists make their way to the door until it is only the woman and the diplomat alone together. They talk, they share a laugh, they go back to his place and find themselves making love. They get married and they get to know one another but this will be the great love of his life and it will only be after the death that he will really understand anything about her.The Constant Gardner is a drama that looks back over the events of several months and discovers the fate of that woman and how the man discovers the horrible truth about how and why she was murdered - I'm not giving anything away, the second scene shows him identifying the body. He is Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes), a shy man who perhaps less understanding of the political landscape just beneath his feet. She is Tessa (Rachel Weisz), a radiant beauty with a big mouth and a determination to put right what is wrong.The problem begins with questions about the methods used by drug companies working in African villages. Into those villages come drugs that are suppose to be used on AIDS patients, but there is some suspicion that this is a lie being used as a P.R. cover-up. Tessa suspects that the drug companies are using the sick natives as guinea pigs to test new drugs. Tessa begins asking questions, making inquiries, gathering information and ultimately she becomes a target, her burned body found at a crossroads along with her driver.The search for an answer becomes an eye-opener for Justin, who seemed to have been just a functionary - a diplomat with a good haircut and a shy manner who answered questions dutifully. His search for the truth isn't laid out for us at the beginning. Since The Constant Gardner comes from a novel by John La Carre, we expect that the story is told in fragments, through letters, emails, conversations and memories of things that were said in passing. Things come together in bits and pieces and only eventually form one large picture.The Constant Gardner was directed by Fernando Meirelles who made City of God - my favorite films of 2003 - and on the basis of these two films it becomes clear that he is a master of telling multiple stories that only converge in the end. He is a patient filmmaker and that's is clearly evident in this film which is one of the most intelligent thrillers that I've seen in a very long time. He has the patience and the intelligence to tell the story in a way that allows information that we've learned in part to make more sense later as it comes together. He trusts that we are smart enough to figure things out.That also comes from having smart actors at his disposal. Ralph Fiennes is excellent here as a man who seemed to have been only a functionary but only later understands that this situation isn't as clear cut as it had been before. Fiennes is a wonderful actor but here he plays a broken man who found the great love of his life but then had her taken away from him under circumstances that he doesn't understand. Rachel Weisz (who won an Oscar for her performance here) is a revelation. She is known to American audiences for her role as Evelyn Carnahan in The Mummy series, but here she reveals a lot of notes that I didn't know she had. She is gorgeous to be sure but she plays Tessa as a woman with a fiercely determined heart who doesn't know when to quit. Her story is seen in flashback and what we know of her in the beginning, through the flashbacks, is different from what we know of her at the end.That's what I love most about The Constant Gardner. It isn't the same story at the end that it was at the beginning. Our eyes, like Justin's, are open the realities of this African landscape and the cruelty going on there. This is not a movie of cheap surprises but surprises born out of the story, of revelations and elements. This is a thinking man's thriller and one of the best I've seen.**** (of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Constnat Garner review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It can surprise, question, and even challenge the viewer's ability to comprehend it overall goal of a plot. It is no doubt a spy thriller, although mastering the drama of its lead character, Justin Quayle (Fiennes) as he searches for the mystery revolving around his wife's death. His wife Tessa (Wise) plays a passionate, and fortunately non radical humanitarian, using the very perceptive nature of her beliefs to so much as start arguments with whom ever she believes holds answers to questions the whole world has asked. In the film's case, the questions revolve around Kenya Africa, as well the very so called contribution the fictional drug company "The Three Bees has been providing for its dying citizens, and at a much quicker expense. Tessa's own ambition and drive to help those in need take her into a journey that ultimately leads in her demise, and in thus brings Justin into looking for more than just the reason for her execution, but furthermore her in general. In their very moments together, Tessa's relationship with Justin was built on trust, compassion, and basically love, while leaving some mysteries to be unveiled. Some of these mysteries revolved around her very loyalty, so far to whether relationship with her humanitarian friend and fellow victim, Arnold, was more than believed to be. Upon the discovery of his homosexuality, the true reality of her nature is further learned as Justin himself asks questions, here and there, circling the globe from Kenya to Britain, and back. Justin's profession as a diplomat, and his collaborations with Britain's foreign and Commonwealth had at first placed him in a side where he could not stand by his wife, nor could he believe in the difference of any human being's actions. His initial response to his wife, "You are my responsibility", in spite of having the opportunity to help several unfortunate refugees, represented his very lack of the true significance of his wife's nature. Tessa was portrayed as truly strong hearted person, believing in the deception that plagued these people. Three Bees' initial test of Dypraxa, was meant for the purpose of curing Tuberculosis, despite the more required research. It's test subjects only proved to be useful, in the very belief these foreign officials had at their very expandability. The nasty side affects took lives constantly, piling bodies everywhere. Basically Tessa's discovery of this money driven conspiracy caused her death. Her pursuits, her tendency to challenge the word of these tainted men became clear, as their own confession is spilled in the moments of Justin's eulogy, bringing the justice, both Justin and Tessa gave their very lives for. I know what I said, that's right, our hero dies, (off screen), but with nothing but peace in his very last moments of life. You might even say his last glimpse before he could truly arrive at death's door was the sight of his wife, gazing upon her, now truly aware of how to understand her. "The Constant Gardner" goes beyond the thrill of a spy flick. It's protagonist's trauma and struggle for justice take him to not only teaching him more about his wife than he could learn through her survival, but in the very cost of her life, as well as his determination to find the truth of her demise did he ultimately comprehend the mystery that at sometimes plagued their love. Aside from the powerful element of love it shows, the film's message of the tragedy that strikes Africa is one that can truly strike a viewers heart, revealing the very devastation of its citizens. We see the violence, the loss of lives at the hands of money and corruption, and furthermore we witness their overall condition to be wasted like experiments rather than human beings. It brutal, it's believable, and furthermore it's inspiring, for this film itself brought to life the formation of the Constant Gardner Trust, bringing education to the many in need. The film's overall drama revolving around this horrific display of the results of such corruption, are further intensified by the groundbreaking performances of it's cast, Fiennes, Wise, Houston, and Nighy.Wise portrayal is both inspiring, and yet very incredible to watch, because it's the very determination of her character that moves her action, as well as her overall pursuit of justice. Her very first scene, when she first met Justin, and how she just unleashed her beliefs, questioning our ethics in the current war against Iraq, show just how idealistic she is towards helping others, seeing the truly horrific results of things like war, or even the quest for oil. "The Constant Gardner" is a truly excellent film using great performances, the trauma of loss, and furthermore giving viewers the message of the tragedy many citizens in Africa, not just Kenya are experiencing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't make sense, but still...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The whole premise of the film is very far fetched: A giant international pharmaceutical company is testing a new Tuberculosis drug that kills on African patients without their consent, then they fix the results and bury those who died in unmarked mass graves as a cheaper alternative to redesigning the drug which would cost them several millions....At the beginning you'll find yourself wondering what the company intends to do when the drug hits the markets? Will they go after people who die in Europe and the US and bury them in mass graves too? Then, by the end of the movie you get the answer; Pellegrin says in a letter that the main issue is deniability, and that if no one could prove they knew the medicine kills, then no one can hold them responsible. I'll accept that, but then why exactly did they beat up the husband and leave him alive instead of killing him? If you are a man who has no children, whose wife got raped then burned alive, and you can destroy those who killed her, would you quit because of a beating? And if the whole strategy of the company depended on "deniability", then a single word by anyone who claims that they know the drug kills would make this deniablility plan fall apart, because even if no one believes these claims now, after the drug is marketed and people die, media and authorities will recall those claims and no denial by the pharmaceutical company will find ears. Why didn't the woman in Germany go to the media? Why didn't Tessa find a CNN, a BBC, or a CFI reporter and drop the bomb? Why didn't the husband take the world's media to the location of the mass grave after it was shown to him? Don't you think any of that would have done the trick? Leaving the nonsense plot aside, this film is still a true joy to watch because of several other elements. Most of all Rachel Weisz who simply put a performance I'd rate up there with Nicole Kidman's best in "Dogville", or Jennifer Connelly's in "A Beautiful Mind" and "Requiem for a Dream". Flawless first class performance and a well deserved Oscar for her. She moves easily between the angry rebel who gets way over her head and the sensuous lover feeding her husband using her bare toes in a passionate moment. The love scenes and intimate flashbacks were inherent in the story and done gracefully and tastefully. Nothing like the hilarious puke inducing ones in "The Brave One" obviously targeting the box office. But this has always been a contrast between Hollywood crap and European cinema.The cinematography is so good you have to see it to believe it, and Of course the music needs no praise from myself as the score has already won several awards and was a perfect compliment to the beautiful scenery and the excellent performances by the entire cast. This is one of those rare movies where there is not a single so-so performance, Rachel was towering above all, but everyone else was simply top notch.A great movie, and would have been perfect had it not been for the plot. It is worth motioning that the book is different, it says that the drug is not bad but they just have not yet found the correct dose, and the fixing is to hide that and move quickly to next phase which is getting approvals in several countries while they find the correct dose by trial and error on those poor Africans. This of course is realistic and does make sense. Too bad the film was not faithful to the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aside from the occasionally quirky cinematography, this is a well-crafted and taut piece of film-making. The performances are crisp and intelligent, which in itself is getting to be a bit of a rarity nowadays. The overall production values are at least respectable.Another reviewer described the film as predictable, but what I find most predictable about it is the indignant response it provoked from the brownshirts of the far right, with their tough, swaggering, manly Limbaugh-isms ("liberal crap," "left-wing propaganda," "smelly hippie"). Hey, it's only a movie, right? All of us fair-minded, right-thinking folk down here in Dingley-Dangley Dell know that pharmaceutical companies aren't really this nasty, and that real government officials wouldn't dream of aiding and abetting such a nefarious scheme. Right? It's only a work of fiction, guys. And after all...if you don't like it, you don't have to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The horror in the heart of Africa told with a solid-structured drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not my favourite movie genre, mainly because I don't like the sometimes dangerous mix between documentary intention and fiction, which may lead the entertaining element prevail over the documentary one. However, I must admit that in this case the director, probably following the novel by John Le Carr?, which I did not read, never loses hold of the whole story, and makes it clear from the beginning that the denounce element will be at the core of the movie. It is a movie full of horror, I cannot say whether there is exaggeration, but even if a small part of what is said were true, it would be horrifying. The idea that drug companies use African people to experiment new drugs, and kill them as if they did not count as human beings is something the movie tells this horror, sadness, anger, and sense of powerlessness, using constant flashbacks, which keep all the pieces joined solidly together, and make the viewer deeply attached to the development of the story. The most emotionally engaging moments are those where the camera focuses on the faces and the eyes of the local people, above all children, it seems impossible to help them, because too many and because there are such powerful interests in exploiting them that we feel powerless spectators of a daily, terrifying injustice. The love story between Justin and Tessa is never dull and help to relieve the high tension running through the whole picture. Ralph Fiennes is, and I always perceive his acting as such, too weak, he should have put more pathos in his role, whereas Rachel Weisz is fully convincing in her role, and conveys that sense of rage and eagerness to do something that I, as a viewer, also felt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that as a film about a man driven almost obsessively to find the reasons for his wife's death, this works pretty well. We need to buy into the evil of the pharmaceutical companies that are at the center. I'm sure that some of this exists, especially in developing countries. Sometimes, however, I had to ask myself, can't one be a bit more subtle and by the book in confronting these people. The young woman is certainly asking for reprisal from an unsympathetic environment. She acted aggressively with the all the egalitarian diligence she could. She had to know that she was making herself terribly visible. While the acting is quite good and the characterizations of Kenya and other African settings striking, those, in themselves, don't carry this as they should have. Also, I get a little bit tired of the person who is simply willing to allow his own death because of his loss. If Fiennes has learned as much as he could, why not rally to the cause and continue the work. I realize that in some respects there is justice, but death is death.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, folks! The accusations against the drug companies were great, and necessary, but made in a very unreasonable, improbable way. After all, we saw a diplomat abandon all his resources to venture himself alone, in Africa! As if he couldn't make much more with his financial resources, access to the media, influential friends! The idea was excellent, but the script was way too naive. One last thing: do you really believe his wife would be happy with what he did at the end? That was awful!! He simply gave up fighting, and if it wasn't for his friend's boldness, the hole story would have been buried. I just didn't buy it. This story deserves a remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From yellow to blue to orange</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think people are missing the point of this film, which is really a love story shrouded in a political thriller shell. I will get on the boat and agree that it is fictional and inaccurate depiction of current African crisis's, but while films like 'Hotel Rwanda' shamelessly hid under the pretense of being a document, 'The Constant Gardener' feels almost lazy in it's grounding in reality. This is because the director was clearly more interested in his actors, and the plot involving greedy and ruthless pharmaceutical conglomerates acted almost as a Hitchcockian 'MacGuffin', and didn't weigh in on the emotional impact I felt for these two tragically linked characters.Essentially, The Constant Gardener is about a man, a rare kind of hero, played fantastically well by Ralph Fiennes (who strangely wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award while his co-star, who held almost nothing against his performance, ran away with the award). The film is about him, the way his character changes, and the idea that even if you don't get what you want it's the path you take and the choices you make to whatever conclusion fate has in store that makes this strife meaningful.The film is shot by Caesar Charlone, in a striking palette of yellows, oranges and muted blues. People complained about the hand-held photography, but these same people were champions of Meirelles's last film 'City of God', which was shot in a similar fashion. Either you can take the boat rocking or you can't, I suppose, but I can't stand many hand-held films simply because they aren't beautiful. This has a rich texture that stays with you long after it's over.. Just observe the shot where Fiennes is giving a speech before he meets Rachel Weisz. The speech ends, with little fanfare, and the electric blinds begin to rise slowly, giving us a spectacular view of the London skyline. Watch even closer and you'll see how much work went into this shot, to maintain exposure by adding extra light on Fiennes while seamlessly not blowing out the background. This, along with the placing of him and his briefcase against this backdrop is one of the greatest shots I've seen. I can't wait for Meirelles's next collaboration with Charlone, an adaptation of Jose Saramago's 'Blindness'. They are making some great films, and hopefully the quality will continue on this upward trend...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is a movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someday soon, in theaters, you won't notice anymore when the advertising clips switch to the main movie. The ads style is simply taking over and the worse part is that nobody seems to care. Well, I do. Maybe because I don't go to the movies to be told stories (a good book will be perfect for the purpose) but because I want to enter cinematic worlds with some kind of vision. Any coherent vision will do, from totally commercial ones (Pirates of the Carribeans) to wildly quirky/independent ones (Eraserhead) and in-betweens (Brazil, Children of men, Pulp Fiction..) as long as there is a world, a space for me to enter.No vision here. Only formulas. I couldn't care less of the story (interesting), substance (debatable) or acting (Weisz is really amazing here, folded/nested acting on par with Streep or Winslet!) of this kind of films, as long as what's in my face is this annoying neo-dogma, MTV-clip-like film-making.Instead of energy, we have a frenetic chaos (I admit it could work with some stories/topics but definitely not with this one). Instead of style, we have countless color/lens/stock shifts, countless amateurish-like close-ups (and yes, I know it's on purpose) and Parkinson-like hand-held cameras "? la Von Triers", (but why on earth was the steadycam developed in the first place? Am I the only one to get headaches from non-stop shaky cams?). Result: everything in the film-making distracts me from the movie itself. [*Very minor spoiler warning*] Oh and I remember this: when we follow Tessa in Africa, we are shown glimpses of some very intriguing African stage play, nice cinematic thing... then suddenly formulaic "african" music pops up in the score (so they think we don't know we're in Africa?) and we fall from genuine to artificial in a second.And the critics encourage this messy, fashion-victim way of making films. Appalling.</fullReview>

Their blissful love life is transferred to Kenya and an exotic world most of us have never and will never know. It is a fun love story for a portion, but then all this fun is disrupted by nasty British drug companies who make Africans sick so they can use them as guinea pigs for drug experimentation. This will enrich these nasty Englishmen and who cares about these nobody Africans anyway? Rachel Weisz does, thats who!

It's good that directors use the modern visual language to communicate their ideas.While it became a distraction at times I admire the effort. In all other aspects "The Constant Gardener" is solid and professionally put together.

		<shortDescription>The confusing story made this Oscar nominated film as boring as can be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Constant Gardener is about a mystery that reveals a wife who is unexpectedly murdered and an official of the British Intelligence named Justin Quayle's investigation for the murder of his wife, their relationship, and his own heart. This is Fernando Meirelles's second film after completing his masterpiece City of God more than three years ago and could be one of his last's that I could really enjoy. I might be 1 out of the 1 million people who did not enjoy the film and here are some plain reasons why I didn't. The film lacked a fulfilling story. Even though I am in to confusing stories such as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, I thought that "The Constant Gardener" did not explain much and made me thinking "What?!" at the end of the film. So I watched it a second time to get my thinking caps back on, but still didn't appeal to me and made me have the "What?!" feeling again. There were to many slow scenes and I found myself almost falling asleep in some parts of the film. I do realize that the film is a majority of dialogue in which I do fully respect, but it should of backed up those words and make some parts of the film entertaining. Although, I thought there were a lot of cons in the film, there were some pros. The acting was good, especially by the two main leads, the cinematography was excellent just like in City of God, the barely any scenes that had excitement were entertaining, and the score was pretty well played.Overall, the film, in my opinion, lacked the quality of art that I was expecting it to be. Most people think I'm wrong, but I didn't see it as a Oscar nominated film and was completely puzzled on what was happening in this 2 hour's that the director gave it. I hope Fernando Meirelles makes another film that has the quality opposite of "The Constant Gardener" and makes another masterpiece like City of God. Hedeen's Outlook: 5/10 *+ D+</fullReview>

I haven't read the John LeCarre book but am interested in finding it to see how it compares to the film but even if it is not true to the book, it stands alone nicely.

		<shortDescription>"Gardener" Moves at Same Pace as Flowers Grow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Constant Gardener" seems like an appropriate name for this film due to the speed at which it moves. Furthermore, it takes the patience of a gardener to try to sort out the story. The movie begins with the death of Tessa Quayle, the wife of a mild-mannered and very conventional English diplomat. The last time that the diplomat, Justin, saw his wife, she was flying to Kenya with a Kenyan doctor with whom she has developed a close professional (and possibly personal) relationship. However, when she is found, she is in the company of another man, not the doctor.We learn quickly that Tessa is both passionate and compulsive. Justin and her meet when she stands up during a press conference that he is giving and confronts him about the policies of the British government towards "third world" countries. Her behavior interestingly enough, has the opposite effect than that intended (perhaps because Justin finds her cute and spunky), and Justin and Tessa go straight from the press conference to her town house to get "closer." After Justin and Tessa are married, Tessa manages to convince Justin to take her with him on an official trip to Kenya, and once there, she witnesses the mysterious death of a young Kenyan woman. This motivates Tessa to try to learn more about AIDS drug trials in Africa.After Tessa's death, Justin decides to try to retrace Tessa steps in order to learn how she died, and uncovers a vast conspiracy involving a profitable drug company.Although the movie does succeed in being somewhat suspenseful at times, it takes too long to reach its conclusion, elements of which are foreseeable.</fullReview>

The flashback technique also seemed uneven in its necessity and diminished the dramatic flow and suspense of the movie. The movie seemed to incorporate too much flash and attempts to style imposed over the substance of the movie and the ending seemed too pat and too melodramatic. Unfortunately, I found the role of Ralph Fiennes, as both supposedly an important British diplomat who at the same time didn't appear to have much actual importance. While the plot line was decent, it's presentation was poorly executed, reducing the emotional intensity, power, the build-up and allowing the contents of the movie to splutter about in an unnecessary display of authentic realism mixed in with the more lavish, epic scene technique of the "English Patient" (1996). By attempting to do more with the movie it ended up being much less. Even Rachel Weisz' role in the movie while a major player still became more of a sympathetic, politically correct dramatic role that didn't have the fine nuances of say Charlize Theron in "North Country" or even Ziyi Zhang in "Memoirs of a Geisha." Surprisingly of a Le Carre based source, the movie failed to have the dense convoluted hidden tension and fear in its fine complexity as his other works brought to the major screen.

		<fullReview>Fernando Mereilles can mimic the poses of masterful filmmakers like Martin Scorsese or Quentin Tarantino or Francis Ford Coppolla, but he can't emulate them. There's something empty to his filmic style. It's like margarine inasmuch it looks like butter but tastes completely different. The hand-held camera, the disjointed angles, the close-ups, etc. are all recognizable tools used by terrific directors, but in Mereilles's hands it just seems false. What we have here is a rather interesting story in an interesting location. We have a thriller that moves at its own pace. There are no car chases, really, and the deaths take place off screen. If you're looking for James Bond, watch Diamonds Are Forever--this isn't that kind of movie. We also have some stellar performances and a believable lovestory. It should all add up to much much more. Yet Fernando Mereilles clutters this film with a style that is incongruous to the material. For a film about seeking the truth, Mereilles is more interested in wowing his audience with slanted angles and odd framing techniques, which, combined with his jaunty, hand-held/ verite style, become extremely grating and, ultimately, obscures the "truth" of the film's visuals. This isn't a bad movie, but Mereilles is a bad director. He has, as I said, copied from the masters without learning the basics. It's like certain artists that skip drawing and go directly to painting--or painters who never learned to capture a landscape, instead choosing to only create abstract canvasses. de Kooning could have never painted what he did without understanding figure, form, and color. Mereilles will never be a capable director without learning how to frame or move his camera conservatively. Watching his films, it's as if he knows only the "advanced" techniques and is incapable of using a steady mid-range shot of two people's faces.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately, no matter how beautifully The Constant Gardener was shot, I could not stop thinking about the film The Girl in the Café. Both of these films feature British diplomats who are serious, somewhat stodgy characters, attracted to and subsequently winning their conquests; both have radical heroines (in one case a lover, in the next, a wife); both diplomats end up having their careers greatly affected by the leftist activities of their partners; both feature Bill Nighy as a diplomat--in the primary role of in The Girl in the Café and in a supporting role in The Constant Gardener; both are about social injustice and extreme poverty; both are movies coming out of Britain at approximately the same time period (the British film industry does not create so great a number of films each year that the closeness in plot outline will go unnoticed.); both have gone on to be internationally acclaimed. I had to go to the IMDb to be sure that they both had not been made by the same director. For someone as me who values a movie partly because of its originality and good plot, I see The Constant Gardener as being too closely linked to The Girl in the Café to be truly interesting. A movie cannot win extra points simply for being a movie about a cause most people can agree on. Whether or not one agrees or disagrees with the precepts of a movie's message, one must be able to judge it objectively. It is a beautiful movie with a very straight-forward, if not predictable theme. Unfortunately, this theme has already been used.</fullReview>

To boot, its message of corporate greed and its questioning of the Pharma industry is both brave and completely on the mark.

		<fullReview>According to two leading newspapers here in Belgium this is the best movie of 2005, so I went to see it with high expectations. It's a very good film, but in my opinion not the best of this year. I enjoyed the visual flair that was also very prominent in Cidade de Deus. But essentially, this is a movie about good guys and bad guys. The good guys (and girls) are so terribly good, and the bad guys (no girls here) are so utterly bad, it's almost too good (or bad) to be true. It would have been more realistic if the good girl (Tessa) would have had something a little bit bad in her. But whenever this seems to be the case, it turns out we're fooled and she's absolutely perfectly honest and faithful and brave and so on... Another thing is that the film is too long. The episodes in Berlin and Sudan are unnecessary for the story (they could just as well have been set in London and Kenia) and seem to function only to show us even more beautifully filmed scenes. But nevertheless, this is a wonderful movie with a nice story and good acting. And it tries to tell us something. Given the fact that there are no uncomfortable scenes (even the people in the slums look beautiful) and no explicit sex, this should be instant Oscar stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a very average story which is saved by its great local setting in Africa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are three categories under which I judged this film.The first is as a thriller. Verdict: not too good. The plot is a rather threadbare old story of David and Goliath AKA the impassioned little conscientious nobody versus the exploitative corporation in bed with a government, the latter unholy liaison taking advantage of the chaos and corruption of an underdeveloped nation. Guess what happens to the little nobody. And guess what more, there is a final come-uppance to satisfy the cravings of our consciences. Actually of course this sort of stuff does all happen (although unfortunately Le Carre's specific imagined scenario in this case is absolutely unconvincing because it doesn't make sense)- but there's no real comment or analysis here other than "isn't it terrible, but we can win out in the end". Come on guys, you sound like a republican president.The next is as a romantic story. The characterization is nicely done by the actors, but by golly it didn't take the two leads long to get into the sack, and really the whole interpersonal setup is rather glib and formulaic. So not the best on that either.The third category is as a celebration of Africa, and in this case we seem to be getting somewhere. The landscape scenes are great and even more stunning are the local township scenes with lots of presumably local extras. They give a sense of stubborn joy and strength in the face of the great burden of poverty and disease (and of course the systematically neglectful attitudes of the world's wealthy nations) suffered by that continent. So basically Africa saves this film.Next time why not just make a doco?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fernando Meirelles annoys me. On the one hand he's an assured actors director - really squeezing out the performances from large casts of all ages; a director with a vice like grip on complex narratives which makes him a superb choice to adapt Le Carie's pharmaceutical conspiracy thriller. On the other hand, and bringing this up seems almost spiteful given how absorbed I was by The Constant Gardener, he's prone to conspicuous artistic flourishes which detract from, rather than polish the overall effect. The case in point is Fiennes globe trotting and the use of coloured filters in different locations. Its a technique that Soderbergh used in Traffic and it was a pain in the arse then too. It is really necessary for poor old Bill Nighy to be soaked in the colour of cats urine? Are Airports naturally blue places? Perhaps if your facing being tracked down and murdered by the government, yes but in a film that favours a naturalistic approach with a story drawn from the headlines it makes sense to keep the visuals as grounded as the tone. I know they used to tint these things back in the silent era but we have colour these days...and sound too! That isn't to say that The Constant Gardner isn't worthy of your attention, assuming you have any, because its an incremental exercise is maintaining and rewarding audience interest. The time-jumping narrative works very well and gives the earlier scenes an added edge as we know that Rachel Weisz is one of those people born to be murdered (I'm acquainted with a few of those). The technique also adds extra poignancy to the final scenes. Weisz's social conscience embodies the film's own message which could have been trite or preachy in the wrong hands but instead is presented authoritatively with more than a hint that the practises alluded to are not as much a part of Carie's imagination as we might like. The fair Rachel is the best you've seen her here and Fiennes' mild mannered diplomat who would rather tend his turf than 'get involved' makes an effective transformation from don't care to must care. By the time its all over you might just care a little bit yourself which would be no bad thing I'm sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captures the heart of Africa beautifully</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent, adaption of a the Le Carre book. Truly a wonderful film, fantastically cast. It captured Africa perfectly, i was almost brought to tears in many parts of it. Ralph Fiennes truly gave his best performance, it was complimented by an almost as good one from Racheal Wiez. Pete Postlethwaite gives a good performance except for his failed attempt at a south African accent, and Bill Nighy does his job fantastically as usual. Hubert Koundé gives a surprisingly good show too. this film is one of the best the best films to come out this decade and is recommended to any one who does not go to the cinemas just for a mindless action film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Constant Gardener</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even with no idea of the plot or story, for the stars and from BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Fernando Meirelles (City of God), I had to try it. Basically in Northern Kenya, British activist Tessa Quayle (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Rachel Weisz) is found brutally murdered, and through flashbacks you find out how she met her husband, Justin (BAFTA nominated Ralph Fiennes) in London. These flashbacks also reveal their involvement as the British High Commission in Nairobi, as they keep an eye on how the poverty-stricken nation are provided help. After his wife's death, Justin is back amongst the Africans, travelling across three continents, trying to find the truth behind her infidelities and obviously death, but also a conspiracy concerning the organisation meant to help people live. Also starring Danny Huston as Sandy Woodrow, Bill Nighy as Sir Bernard Pellegrin, Pete Postlethwaite as Dr. Lorbeer, Richard McCabe as Arthur "Ham" Hammond, Donald Sumpter as Tim Donohue, Juliet Aubrey as Gloria Woodrow, Hubert Koundé as Dr. Arnold Bluhm and Archie Panjabi as Ghita Pearson. Fiennes, and of course Weisz, are on fine form, and it is interesting to see the story set amongst the terrible conditions we see on things like Comic Relief, a worthwhile political thriller. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Editing, Best Music for Alberto Iglesias and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, it won the BAFTA for Best Editing, and it was nominated the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Cinematography, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Sound and the David Lean Award for Direction, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A pharmaceutical company pushes a new drug that not only doesn't work, it kills people. The company covers up the deaths so the medicine can get regulatory approval.The problem with this premise is what will happen when other people start dying. Yes, the company probably can reasonable hope to get away with killing poor Africans, but when people start dying in Europe, the lawyers will be circling for blood.Did the company have a secret plan? Was the CEO planning on taking his profits and running to Argentina before anybody found out? Something should have been said or done to explain this obvious problem with the plot.To the editors: A summary, like a message subject, is properly written in all caps. That is not shouting.

		<shortDescription>Meirelles' style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember "Cidade de Deus", Fernando Meirelles' film that got him a lot of recognition and made him the important director he is today. I remember the film because it was visually amazing, but also because it had a story to tell about reality and because Meirelles was never worried about how hard reality could get. My father said: "That movie is so violent", and I agreed.Now after a geniality of that kind, Meirelles needed to come with something at least good if he wanted to keep it going. "The Constant Gardener" came to him as something fresh and simple, in the waiting of an experienced hand to twist it and make it complicated. So Meirelles did the dirty work, and did it perfectly. I don't know if this film would have been as real and as violent in the hands of another director.Once more, the visuals and the sceneries are a main character; because this time Meirelles shot in Africa, and he took advantage of the view and exploited it brilliantly so we could enjoy it. The film has the addition of the music as another of the highlights in the film. Alberto Iglesias understood the environment of the locations and the mystique of the characters, providing the images a disturbing score.The story is also disturbing. Based on the novel by John Le Carré, Jeffrey Caine wrote a screenplay that asks a lot of questions and becomes interesting for the viewer. When I wrote about "Levity" the other day, I mentioned 'Gardener'?Caine's screenplay is well written, and it will make you wonder; but it's very simple in the end, not like Solomon's philosophic story about redemption."The Constant Gardener" is a slow film, and it could have been very boring if Meirelles hadn't thought of the right cast members. The two main players in the film are actors I love but never put in front of other I truly admire or consider my favorites. Ralph Fiennes is an exceptional actor: I first saw him in "Quiz Show" but his credits include wonderful performances in dramas like "Sunshine", thrillers like "Red Dragon" and silly comedies like "Maid in Manhattan". That he couldn't be a contender for his role in this film is a shame.I ask: Is Rachel Weisz the high point of Meirelles' film? I answer: I love her, andvshe won the SAG Award, the Golden Globe and the Oscar for best supporting actress; but her performance isn't really something to be astounded about. Even so, she achieves the most solid portrayal of the movie, as Fiennes' ambitious wife. The ever supporting actor Pete Postlethwaite scores another surprising performance in his 50's. He's been forgotten by people?But he's fantastic.Danny Huston and Bill Nighy also appear in supporting roles and do it just fine. But is Meirelles as a director the person we admire the most in the project?Because we know he did it all; and that's awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rips off a very popular movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched The Constant Gardener and a little over half way through I realized I was watching a re-imagining of the Harrison Ford movie, The Fugitive. Now I really liked the Fugitive and have seen it dozens of times so maybe it was easier for me to pick up on the similarities. But once it's been suggested to you, I think you should see them quite easily.Beyond that I didn't think the film was anything all that special either. It was very boring and obvious even before I came to the conclusion that it was a familiar plot and then once I did I had to strain to pay attention. I really like Ralph Fiennes and he did a good job, but it didn't matter because the movie didn't deserve his performance. I guess the real impact that most people are getting from it is if they don't realize that things like this happen in the world. If it's still shocking news that people are expendable in the quest for profits, then maybe this will do something for you.I really enjoyed City of God so I was expecting something really good if not great from Meirelles. And all I got was an overrated rip off. Oh well, that's what I get for believing the hype.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a case of bad casting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film so full of good intentions that one regrets to have to say bad things about it. It is at best a mediocre adaptation of a good novel. The novel is politically aware, balanced, suspenseful. A good political thriller in which Le Carré renews his inspiration. The main flaw of the film is, of course, a serious error of casting : Rachel Weisz is not at all the character of the book, a small-time activist with no charisma, a typical NGO militant. The role called for a real star or at least a star in becoming, which miss Weisz certainly is not. She shows her pregnancy in the slums of Naraibo (should I say the favellas)and is filmed in a pseudo-documentary style which I find totally unconvincing. The black French doctor (sorry, I forgot his name) is even less convincing than she is, as far as personality is concerned. We wanted a Denzel Washington of some sort for a film which is, though it tries to pretend the contrary, totally hollywoodian in its manicheism (the novel was much more subtle). Ralph Fiennes is tolerable in the main part and Danny Huston not bad all (but the twist in the end, the redemption of his character, lest his friend died for nothing, is totally unbelievable.)The only thing worth saving, really, is the aerial views of lake Turkana. And the flights of the flamingos. But maybe I'm biased there, it reminds me of a wonderful trip some 20 years ago in this forsaken land... jeep not plane though...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meirelles Takes on LeCarré With Vivid Style But Curtailed Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As evidenced by "City of God" and now with this feature, Brazilian filmmaker Fernando Meirelles may make the most visually arresting movies today and is certainly not afraid to take on seemingly untouchable subjects that are infused with life and death. This time he transposes the plot from his native Brazil to Africa where he captures the kinetic vibrancy of that world with equal élan. Similar to his previous film though, where I still feel he is lacking somewhat is developing a core heart around his characters that makes us care about their fates. This gap seems more pronounced this time since the plot is essentially a love story as much as a political thriller.The story focuses on Justin Quayle, a reserved, mid-level British diplomat based in Kenya, and Tessa Abbott, the politically obsessed woman who complicates his life immeasurably but of course, excites him to no end. The development of their romantic relationship is given short shrift for the sake of the movie's time-bouncing structure, but this is not due to the lead actors who are quite compelling. Ralph Fiennes captures the exterior cool and interior fire of Quayle that motivates his intense politicization toward his wife's causes, the primary one being the purported abuses by multinational pharmaceutical companies testing radical experimental drug on unsuspecting Africans who are willing to receive free treatments. Looking and acting uncannily like Kate Winslet, Rachel Weisz has less screen time as Tessa, though she makes her moments count as her character has to remain somewhat of a cipher to move the thriller aspects along effectively. The relationship between Justin and Tessa is unsurprisingly volatile, but Meirelles leaves the actors alone to convey whatever romanticism may be underneath.As is true with most John Le Carré stories, this one contains several characters who do not seem to be what the appear - Tessa's colleague Arnold Bluhm may or may not be having an affair with her; Quayle's boss Bernard Pellegrin may be in cahoots with the drug companies; and Quayle's best friend Sandy Woodrow may turn out to be a backstabber worthy of Shakespeare's Iago. Bill Nighy - most familiar to me as the comically aging rock star in "Love Actually" - certainly does an effective about-face as the malevolent Pellegrin, and Danny Huston (John's youngest son) does an adroit job in portraying a man who has been robbed of his conscience. A grizzled Pete Postlethwaite shows up late in the movie as a doctor who explains some of the loose plot threads and conveniently summarizes the situation with the Africans. Changing locations with dexterity from London to Berlin to Nairobi to remotest Kenya, Meirelles propels the storyline with fury and unique style aided immeasurably by César Charlone's vibrant cinematography and Alberto Iglesias' original, authentic-sounding music score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fiennes goes beyond Weisz' brilliant performance and brings us to tears...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John le Carr?'s novel, "The Constant Gardener", was a haunting epic of a read that put a true perspective on just how corrupt the world as a whole truly is, and the greed put into focus when money is involved.With Fernando Meirelles' brilliant Epic, "The Constant Gardener", comes a visual adaptation of possibly one of the greatest books in literary history.Ralph Fiennes, with yet another fantastic performance, portrays the diplomat-turned-freedom-fighter-on-the-run Justin Quayle, in a film that depicts two ends of the story revealing the true corruption of the pharmaceuticals industry in a similar fashion to "The English Patient".On the other hand, Rachel Weisz, in a career best performance, while she stays in the shadow of Fiennes' superior performance in the second half of the film after her acting is done, plays Tessa Quayle, the freedom fighter wife of Justin, bent on doing anything to expose the corruption in the "Three Bees" syndicate, a corporation built up by KDH Pharmaceuticals to test out newly developed, yet fatal, drugs on the African people, in particular, T.B. and AIDS affected African people, who are seen by these evil companies as "disposable".Worse yet, as the story plays out, a string of other atrocities committed by the greedy syndicates is revealed, and as the film begins with the viewer realizing that Tessa Quayle was murdered, corporate murder springs to mind... and Justin Quayle is forced to continue his wife's work, with life threatening consequences.The film as a whole is extremely moving, and while it certainly deserves the Best Picture Oscar, it's doubtful that it will pull through, considering the true height of controversy that will be brought from this movie. But the most effective part, without giving anything away, is the final act, in a crushing blow that will leave the viewer both satisfied and yet in tears, after having watched all that has happened throughout the course of the film, and yet adversely affected by the emotional performance of Ralph Fiennes that is certainly not in any way flawed and stays completely true to the character in the novel.In short, a masterpiece, superior to "City Of God", and the greatest "Controversial" film of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stylish mainstream film, perhaps not an ideal project for Meirelles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meireilles' chronicle of three decades of favela crime life in Rio, City of God/Cidade de Deus (2002), was a wonder of color and whirlwind action. Here he applies his bright brush to a post-cold war John Le Carré story about a mild and moral diplomat, Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) whose political firebrand wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz) gets assassinated in Kenya, leading him to go against the grain and offend his superiors by hunting down the medical cartel scandal that got her in harm's way. The contrast between the gentleness and focus of Fiennes's character and the turbulence and corruption all around him as he moves closer and closer to the same danger his wife faced is beautifully conveyed. The film is particularly notable for its endless fast succession of dazzling bright African images and its panoply of morally dubious secondary characters ably played by the likes of Bill Nighy, Danny Huston, Gerald McSorley, and Keith Pearson. But unfortunately Meirelles' hyperactive editing, which underscored the wild energy of the favela in Cidade de Deus, tends to overwhelm the story sometimes and isn't altogether appropriate to a writer whose métier was always conveying the gray world of self effacing bureaucrats. When it's all over all you may remember is Fiennes' sad face. He's fine, though, and so is Weisz and so are many of the others. It's not certain this was the ideal project for Meirelles, though he has produced a stylish mainstream film. 7.5-8/10</fullReview>

I don't recall reading the book. (the last Le Carre I remember reading was "The Spy Who came in from the Cold". Can anyone help me, or am I hallucinating. I recognized most all of the characters, even the doctor that Tessa was looking for. Maybe it was a TV movie? Overall, I liked the movie. I appreciated the great cinematography, Ralph Fiennes'acting, and the general tone of the movie. The romantic subplot seemed a little overdone, but it wasn't enough to drag the whole film down. The "character" parts presented credibly flawed people, some of which were remarkably well acted. On the negative side, some of the villains were a little "cardboardish". Though there are serious ethical issues related to "big pharma's" treatment of Africa, I'm not quite ready to see them as quite this absolutely evil.</fullReview>

I have been tremendously affected, first by Hotel Rwanda last year, and this year by The Constant Gardener, both about the ongoing political and economic tragedies in Africa. I would not be surprised to find that this second film is only a slight variation on the real situation. Both pictures are urgent calls to action for the Europeans and Americans to take note of what our governments and corporations are doing, and to change it. The ability of both of these masterworks to engage our hearts and minds in the beauty and drama of the real world, beggars our imagination, recovers our spirit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Constant Gardener - the best movie of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a beautiful movie to look at. Fernando Merielles has done again like what he has for city of god to show Africa as beautiful but hurt. I saw this movie the second day after it came out and i was excited for one i was a hug fan of city of god and Ferando Merielles brings to the screen his own style that isn't found with most directors out there today.But what makes this movie special is the tenderness and yearning for Justin (ralph finnes) to see the love he has for his wife. The beginning establishes her murder but the flashback into their first meeting, life in Africa, the anticipation for their child, and more are at the heart of the movie. Justin does not do this just for the cause but for his wife. He will finish up what she has started but he wont divulge himself in it because that is not his matter or concern.The movie involves a conspiracy tieing new drug experiments to Africans who live or die by the tests. Tessa, a activist whose points pose a threat to the British/Corperate, is not well receive even by her husband but he understands her concerns. But he doesn't understand her work rather him understanding her position on world issues.The movie is painted in a way for not a real conclusion but sadness. I do not want to give it away but to those expecting a swash buckling action packed movie that looks like the transporter 2, its not. What we see here is Fernando taking the essence of their love and construct in a way that we understand his love for her. The end is so sad but poignant because everything isn't finish but we feel a conclusion that is meaningful but unfullfiling.I loved this movie because its cinematography brings out the poverished Kenya to its fullest extend. London looks dark where cooperated evil is and Kenya is alive and bursting with color where there is still hope after all. Ralph Finnes and Rachel Wierz deserve Oscar nominations and this movie as well. I feel like its one of the top movies for the academy awards when they will come around. I urge you to see this movie because rediscovering love is as equal or greater than loving someone right now. This is the best movie of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusing and poorly done...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I struggled through this one, which seemed much longer than 2 hours. Many of the negative comments I've read about the film bash the "anti-corporate" theme of the story. I'm very anti-corporate and have no problem believing a corporation would put profits before people and a government would facilitate that action. My problems with the film come with script, acting, and directing.This was a horribly confusing script, compounded by the fact that half the actors mumbled their lines in heavy accents. I thought the filmmakers/writers were very dishonest in spending the first half of the film leading you to believe that Tessa was a sleazy tramp and the second half making you think she was a saint, when in fact she was just an opinionated rich girl who had strongly-held convictions about some things, but seemed to have only a vague concept of what she would do to address these issues.I've only seen Ralph Fiennes in one or two things and must say his appeal is utterly and completely lost on me - he seemed to be sleepwalking through the film, but not as an expression of character just as a lack of charisma and energy on the part of the actor.Rachel Weisz did a pretty good job playing an unlikable character, because I sure didn't like her. Stunned that she won an Oscar for this. The idea of their "great love" rang very false, especially if she couldn't even tell her husband that the Dr. she worked with was gay, or that she was very unhappy with a corporation named 3-B and that he shouldn't buy pesticide from them.The direction was way too artsy, too much camera shaking and swinging, and why, why, why do filmmakers think showing a computer screen on the film screen works? There were at least 3 scenes of computer screen activity, three too many in my view.Finally, I'm so tired of stories about the poor masses of Africa that really just focus on rich white people. The only black person that we vaguely got to know in the film was the doctor that was murdered, and he was Belgian. Why wasn't the family of the woman who died in the hospital the focus of this film instead? Let the rich, uptight Brits work out their first world guilt on their own time and give us a compelling story about real folks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!! I was disappointed by the film. I had heard all of the hype about Oscar nominations before the nominations were announced and will hear a lot more now, but the film just didn't hold together very well for me. The characters were all fairly one dimensional and the plot twists were predictable and uninspiring. The pacing was poor and the ending was weak.Justin (Ralph Fiennes), the weak-kneed diplomat encounters Tessa (Rachel Weisz) at a speech he is giving as a substitute for a superior. Tessa does her best outraged activist and rails on his boring speech to the point of driving out the rest of the audience. She then suffers pangs of remorse for the pathetic Justin and takes him home and sleeps with him.The next thing we know she is heading off with him to Africa as his wife and a minute later she is pregnant. We have no idea what is motivating either of them (other than a single sexual encounter). In Africa, Tessa continues to tic off the diplomatic corps and conspires with an African doctor ("just friends, sir") to expose a corrupt government that is neglecting an AIDS-riddled population for some quick cash from Western drug companies.Without warning Tessa and Justin are sitting in the hospital and Tessa is breast-feeding a baby, but not her own. What happened to her own baby? Oh, it died, but we wouldn't know it from Tessa because she has already moved on and is breast feeding the baby of an African woman who is dying of AIDS in the next bed. Do we get a chance to meet the dying mother or anyone associated with her before they become a critical part of the story? No, we do not. They are all faceless victims there seemingly for the only purpose of showing us what a noble character Tessa is.Finally, Tessa is murdered by the goons she is trying to expose (there's not really much of a mystery here because they are the only real suspects) and Justin must carry the torch to free the poor masses from the money-hungry multinationals by...confronting them in a public forum? No. Using his diplomatic connections to appeal to the government to arrest them? No, by flying to the same remote location where Tessa was murdered and waiting until the bad guys come and kill him and allowing Tessa's cousin (who we meet only at the very end of the movie) to read an incriminating letter at Justin's funeral. The ending was so cheesy I expected the movie to be sponsored by the American Dairy Association.I confess, I never read the novel. If I had, I think I might have liked the movie even less, although it's hard to believe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's a quiz: When do a great story, a good screenplay, and excellent acting add up to a mediocre movie? Answer: When the director gets in the way.The Constant Gardener is based on a John LeCarre book with a screenplay by Jeffrey Caine. It stars Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz, who are superb in their roles, as is nearly every other actor in the movie. The problem is that Brazillian director Fernando Meirelles, making his first English-language film, shoots almost the entire film in hand-held close-ups, often intentionally blurry.As a result, you are constantly reminded that you are watching a movie, which removes you from the thrilling experience this story is intended to evoke. It's like a 15-year-old future film student saying, "Hey I've got this new camera, and look at all the neat stuff I can do with it."This should have been one of the year's best movies. Instead, it is difficult (and sometimes nauseating) to watch. I truly hope this is not a new trend in film-making.</fullReview>

If Rachel Weisz is 24, then I'm a Mexican bandit with a moustache that is six feet in width, ten in length. What is her character (an outspoken, earth-mama activist) doing with Fiennes (a mild mannered, jobs-worth, puppet of the state bore)?

		<fullReview>I was somewhat disengaged while watching this film. The cast has actors I admire ? Ralph Fiennes, Pete Postlethwaite, Gerard McSorley; actors I admire and would also just like to know - Rachel Weisz (of course), Bill Nighy; but overall the film was lacking.Fernando Meirelles previous film ? City of God ? was as good an effort as any, so this was an additional disappointment as a filmgoing experience, since I expected at least a movie equal emotionally as well as intellectually.The film's focus is primarily on the nefarious activities of a major drug company and its testing in Kenya. But for me the real focus ? and any tension, or suspense there is ? is with the relationship between Justin and Tessa, the main protagonists of the story, whose relationship at times appears suspect. That being said however, the rest of the story falls short, with some of the actions taken by the characters defying logic. Moreover, the sound was terrible, the camera work jumpy, and the whole premise of a vicious, murdering pharmaceutical company is somewhat hard to swallow. All in all, I liked watching Ralph and Rachel, but it wasn't enough to rate this movie much more than average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another poorly filmed show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Constant Gardner got a 6 from me solely on the strength of the acting performances turned in by Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz. A John LeCarre novel is a difficult read, and I have yet to finish reading TCG, although I've started it several times. Fiennes and Weisz made their characters come alive and made the story very followable.Having said that, I now have to bitch loudly and long about the current trend of movies being filmed with hand-held cameras and not Steadicams. I'm really getting tired of laying out hard-earned money to watch a show that makes me want to barf because the lousy cinematography induces motion sickness. And it's not just me; a lot of folks in the audience were complaining about it.If you are susceptible to motion sickness, do NOT go to this movie. I knocked 4 points off the score because of this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A travelogue of the mind.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kenya is a problematic place for an introverted government official or a devoted gardener for that matter. Both of those are in the character of Ralph Fiennes' Justin (a just man), who marries Rachel Weisz's Tessa, an activist inviting the wrath of global businesses determined to profit from vulnerable natives. No surprise Hardy's Tess had the same doomed outrage and singleness of purpose.Director Fernando Meirelles' Constant Gardener is a travelogue for ideologues, a thriller that engages on two levels: Who are Tessa's enemies? How can a marriage survive the tumult of intrigue and temptation? The film demands attention to the details of both questions, for it makes it clear there are no easy answers when wickedly smart corporations are both helping the third world with needed drugs and endangering when they test and manipulate results to gain government approval (Vioxx anyone?). A character summarizes the foregone conclusion: "No drug company does something for nothing." What if the government is complicit? So much the worse, so much the more complicated. If the wife is careful to shield her government official husband from her idealistic entanglements, to the extent that he could easily think her unfaithful with her handsome black colleague, then the film courts appearance and reality, trust, and sacrifice.The acting in Constant Gardener is excellent, from the intelligent coupling of Fiennes and Weisz to the enigmatic friend and colleague, Sandy, played with cunning sweetness by Danny Huston, son of the great director. The hand-held camera and close-ups are too many and too distorting, albeit they achieve the effect of claustrophobic chaos (at the expense of revealing character).If it sounds like Graham Greene country, it should: fragmented story, spies, love, longing, regret, imperialism, exploitation?the list of Conradian jungle corruptions just goes on. But that is a tribute to the rich load of human entanglements that people modern Africa and post-modern cinema. Hotel Rwanda is tame by contrast.Conrad in his 19th century wisdom summed up the ambiguous world of colonialism and humanism and the dark talk of companies that save and savage: " . . . the talk of sordid buccaneers; it was reckless without hardihood, greedy without audacity, and cruel without courage; there was not an atom of foresight or of serious intention in the whole batch of them, and they did not seem aware these things are wanted in the work of the world." Halliburton comes to mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong and huge story, but too much style and not enough pace. Brilliant performance from Africa and Weisz.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Constant Gardener was a bit of a mystery for me, I had seen the trailer and some of the blurbs associated with it and it really did look like a great huge conspiracy thriller. I was expecting high talent and some edge of your seat. It's really pretty clear from the beginning of the movie that the pace was a lot slower than I was expecting, and there was bags of style as well as some superbly natural acting.There were four of us there, so before my review lets see what everyone else thought. Okay, they're on ten scales, I'm on five, but hey, you can double up!Girlfriend: 7/10 I didn't get a hotdog!Friend1: 7/10 Very thought provoking film. African scenery fantastic. Felt it was terrible to see big companies exploiting a poor nation.Friend2: 6/10 Quite good.Insightful into how powerful drug companies are.So that's what everyone else thought of the movie, but since this is my review, what did I think?From the opening there are some strong performances, and I was amazed at how natural the performances of Danny Huston and in particular Rachel Weisz. Weisz was stunning, from her delivery of lines, her facial expressions right through to the scene where she was drying herself from a bath. Her performance was mesmerising and utterly convincing, I've never seen her give such an amazingly strong performance.Interestingly, Ralph Fiennes was quite disappointing. His performance was stilted and withdrawn, and extremely hard for me to connect with. Even his scene of intense emotion where he begins to break down and cry seems false and forced. Perhaps part of it is that he needs to appear as a typical stiff upper lip Englishman, and yet Huston carries off his performance of such a character with much more believability.The story was very well written although it took a long time from the understanding of the conspiracy to any point of action around it, and ultimately to its resolution. This delay was a commonplace occurrence in the movie, there were a lot of lingering shots of scenery, holding on and stretching out moments. The scenery though was spectacular, beautifully rich shots of the African country as well as the people. That alone made the movie a feast for the eyes, yet the style heavily detracted from that.In an attempt, one can only assume, to make the movie feel more edgy and thriller like, much like a Bourne story, the camera shake was highly visible. Now by highly I don't just mean the kind of shake you see from hand-held, but severe overuse of the shake, as though the cameramen had been told to make it deliberately shake ridden. Quite frankly it was annoying, from start to finish.Another terribly annoying feature of the filming was the desire to place an out of focus object between the camera and every persons face you were looking at. I know that combined with the shaky camera is supposed to give you a feeling of reality and a slight voyeuristic feel as though you were in the room but not part of the group, but it was well overdone. Too much style can swamp a movie, and it definitely did here.The colouring and texture differences between the current time and past time of the movie were very nicely done. Hard grain for current and softer, standard film texture for the past memories. This fitted very well with the story and gave you the feeling of separate between the two without having the film makers spell it out to you.The end of the movie did have a sermon feel to it, as though the film makers abandoned the story to step in and tell you what was wrong with Africa. Yet there's quite a danger here, for the audience have no idea what the reality is. Sure we know that Africa is poor and is being taken advantage of by major corporations and countries, but to this degree? Is this story based on some semblance of fact? It's very difficult at the end to discern if the makers are telling us that this is actually happening, or it's a general tale of caution about what is being done to Africa as a whole. I found this aspect concerning, and to a slight degree, somewhat irresponsible.Overall though the story is very strong, and very big, with a massive ending. It has a huge agenda and tackles it very well with some strong performances. However, both the idea and the style could have been toned down slightly to make a better and more accessible movie. As well as increasing the pace throughout.</fullReview>

On the other side, there's this unnerving drama between two people that is completely unnecessary for the uncovering of the pharma-scandal (which is, to be honest, by far not the worst thing that is being done to these people by our industry...) Too much drama (a very unnecessary dramatic ending), too little facts and I didn't like the fact that the film starts with the death of the protagonist. As you know the end from the beginning there's no suspense in that part of the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Big Bad Corporate Entity Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While there is no shortage of corporate corruption in the world, there is also plenty of corporations doing great things. A story based on a drug company trying to push through a faulty drug to make billions should also have a built in sequel showing that 55 people out a 400 million users had heart attacks that could marginally be traced back to the drug usage, so the FDA required them to pull the drug, and the company was financially ruined. That's every bit as much a real scenario as the corporate conspiracy story this movie offers. Hollywood is so stuck on the this big bag corporation agenda (and the token gay byline agenda) that it diminishes the story. Its a downer movie that focuses on rich corporations as the key cause of Africa's problems, versus the deep corruption that is endemic in Africas government at all levels. A doubting-love story, mixed in with a ah-no-problem-because-he's-really-gay byline, mixed in with a stupid quasi-suicide-(where you could have been a lot more help to the situation if you had kept on living, you idiot)...plus a very irritating shaky camera style throughout much of the movie (like we are supposed to think it is more genuine, or something). Don't spend $9. Rent it if you want to see it.</fullReview>

The story is intriguing, the locations beautiful, but the eggshell-treading concern with political correctness and the predictable yet undeveloped antipathy towards multinational corporations work to sink this one. The second half features the hero hopping from country to country without rhyme or reason, a spy on crack. The final extinguishing of the political plot to be replaced by the romance plot was unforgivable. I'm a Le Caree fan but have not read this book; the adaptation did not have much Le Caree suspense to it. This movie will be forgotten in less than five years.</fullReview>

In fact it was simply a series of events which leads Ralph Fiennes to cry and be killed with nothing resolved or exposed. Typical British problem solving: Keep it quiet, discrete, don't rock the boat, deny the problem but know that it does exist and be ready to die for it: Don't live for it. It's a film to watch at least once so to know the exact reasons for avoiding it in the future. The cast is disappointing and too simple. There is no fire in this film and no inspiration. IF anything it says that should you discover and uncover a plot you'd better keep quiet about it. I give it a tumbs down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The One-Body Problem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my comment for "City of God" I remarked on the fine architecture of the thing. There were three stories, each with its own camera consciousness. The three battled it out for control of your mind, the struggle among three gods.This isn't a new idea, in fact Meirelles borrowed the notion from Kubrick's "2001" and the idea reborn in "Blue Velvet." But the camera personalities had to do with the personal blur of the hand-held, the rhythm of the hand holding it and moving with the action.Because it had these three consciousnesses, these three rhythms, it had both a local and global texture. It assured me that this was yet another of the fine Latin and Latin American filmmakers that have our imagination in their hands.That's why this movie is a huge disappointment. Oh, it has the same sense of place ? perhaps even better. And it has the same rhythm as one of the "God" cameras: theatrically after a hasty documentary style that seems intensely personal.It really is effective, especially in the part that runs between the flashforward of the overturned car at the beginning and where it appears in the story. That segment of the movie is all about setting us up for what we expect will be an intricate puzzle. So we study the blurs as we are swept along in that first part, just as the characters are.The very same technique was used in "The Good Thief" where the camera and editing was in snippets that were briefer and blurs that were faster than we could really process. But in "Thief" there really was a puzzle, some unusual twists, Some surprises.In this case, the story plods along. Did we ever doubt that the drug companies were the bad guys? Did we not expect the British government to be in cahoots? Were you unsure that the distressed husband would win and the designated villain suffer?Worse, Meirelles decided to abandon his engineering of rhythms. The thing is pretty much the same from beginning to end. Instead of the shooting, editing and eye, he chose to switch color filters instead. I suppose that is because the financiers wanted what they probably call "intelligent energy" to judge from their press material.And he has mixed in some really banal shots. Sweeping helicopter shots are common now, especially the smooth encirclings that pull out and show the players in a huge context. But those shots are from such a different cinematic consciousness as the rest it looks as if they were pasted on by the studio behind the director's back.But he has to take the blame for how the attack on the village is staged. By this time, the story is a grind. We have seen the beauty and grime. We have gotten the point about injustice and exploitation. We know precisely the trajectory of our hero. This is just the place where we should be surprised by some new cinematic trick, where the "energy" would get pumped up.I?árritu would have done this, God bless him. What we get here is straight out of a 1940s western. Injuns silhouetted against the sky as they come over the ridge. Galloping copied from "Magnificent 7" instead of even the original.From there, the movie enters a mode that is half Hollywood drek (the missing letter read at the funeral) and half manufactured intelligent doom, love manifested in death.I wish I could be as excited about this as I was with "City" and as I leaned into the first part of this.We needed more of Weisz (what a surprise!) of Meirelles and texture, and less of Le Carre and Fiennes.The two parts don't mix.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was an absolute waste of RF's talent. The underlying plot should have taken 29 minutes and not the verbose 129 - of which I could only tolerate 100. A thirty-second phone call to my cousin, who also viewed the same screening as I, was all it took to recap the foreseeable ending.For all those who get ill seeing very tight and jerky screen shots (ala Blair Witch), beware. The same nausea ran over me throughout the second hour, although a lot of those ill feelings were based simply on the unbelievable characters - like the "all-powerful government agent" stereotype, the "hapless and blind paramour stereotype," and the "goons who beat up the antagonist as a warning" stereotype.In light of his filmography, Mr. Fiennes deserves a pass for choosing so droll a script, and Rachel Weisz probably has a lot left in her career, but this was not the vehicle to get her over the top.1 star for the Emily Rose trailer that played before this disaster rolled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why the Oscar to Weisz?????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>in my opinion this film is only worth watching due to Ralph Fiennes who gives an outstanding performance as a betrayed, hurt and trapped man who gives everything for the woman he loves. He even risks his own life because of his wife and the mission she's carrying through. On the other hand Rachel Weisz's crocheter is somehow aversing to me because of the way she's dealing with her life and her husband's. She's really selfish even if she wants to help other people. Her own family life is totally messed up and what she does for it is try to solve other people's problems. If you can't deal with your own problems how can you deal with other people's???????? Apart form that, though i think that Wis's's performance was good but not too good for the Oscar. I guess Michelle Williams ( even though her role was smaller and more limited ) gave a performance worth for an award in Brokeback Mountain . On the other hand Ralph was really outstanding. thank you.</fullReview>

Ralph Fiennes' performance is poor, it gives you the impression that he knew from the very beginning what his fate would be and accepted it without any fight. You can't feel any suffering from Fiennes' acting, though I imagine his character suffers a great deal. Nor can you feel - let alone understand - the love between the two main characters or Sandy's love for Tessa. I couldn't understand why the title of the film had anything to do with a gardener. OK, I understand that was Justin's hobby, but it doesn't define his character in any way; it looks like his gardening is used more for lengthening (abolutely unnecessarily) the movie. A poor movie in all respects. I had expected much more from it, got nothing...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Drivel is not a word I frequently use, but I will be generous in it's application here. The word applies to the disappointing demagogic movie that stole two hours of my life, which I'll never get back. "Constant Gardner" is a half-hearted attempt at leftist propaganda; you walk away with the feeling that they're not even trying anymore. I expected a suspenseful, "gritty" (another word I don't like), violent British drama, replete with interesting multifaceted characters? something like Layer Cake or The Lime or something by Guy Ritchie. Instead this was a tepid diatribe against the EEEEEVVVVVIIIILL pharmaceutical companies. Apparently the filmmakers are shocked ? SHOCKED! ? to discover that drug companies intend to turn a profit. The evil in question in the film is about a drug company that has the audacity to test a TB drug in Africa while daring to insist that Africans actually pay for name brand drugs for AIDS. Apparently the moral course of action is to test the drugs on Europeans, and then *give* them away to the Africans, who are all portrayed as inept and dying, or corrupt and greedy. The film never addresses who will actually create new drugs when the pharma company that does this goes out of business, but hey that's someone else's problem. Besides being an unwitting example of a Randian "looter" philosophy put to film, Constant Gardner had the unintended consequence of reinforcing to me how horrid a place Africa is; apparently it is comprised exclusively (according to this film) of dying babies, AIDS-infested villagers, rampaging "tribesmen" (the film was made before the word Janjaweed joined our vocabulary), rich colonial oppressors replete with British accents and black servants, and all forms of gruesome death. While Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes give their usual excellent performances, their characters are shallow and one-dimensional and don't do the actors justice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say the "gardener" angle was hardly in the forefront. Who really cares that the British Diplomat enjoyed fiddling about with seeds and pulling weeds in his spare time? About the only time his gardening really became part of the plot was when he nearly carried pesticide from the wrong company into the house. Otherwise, I didn't even see a symbolic element to it. He wasn't really tending anything other than those plants. I didn't see "weeds" springing up in his wife's life out of his neglect, or anything like that. The fact that she didn't tell him things doesn't really have a good analogy to gardening. And the fact that some of the bad guys were the "Three Bees" corporation doesn't work at all--bees are needed for a garden. The company should have been the "Zillion Aphids" or "Eighty Potato Beetles" or the "Two Slugs." And the creepy best friend should have been named after a fungus instead of "Sandy Woodrow." Yes, "Sandy Woodrow" does conjure up images of sandy soil, which isn't fantastic except for things like potatoes, and woody vines in a nice even row, but that hardly befits the character.Granted, if the title is supposed to refer to his wife rather than the Diplomat, then we have a different situation... slightly. She was constant. She did tend to all her growing missions. But the names of things are still a problem. And rarely do the 'pests' in one's garden rise up and rape and slaughter you, making it look like 'bandits did it.' Despite my problems with the title, it was a good movie. They just should have called it something else, I think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ham-handed Propganda Meets Heartfelt Love Story: Both Lose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Constant Gardener" is two films in one.One "Constant Gardener" is a ham-handed propaganda flick that wants you to believe that Africa's biggest problem is Mafia-like pharmaceutical companies.To get you to watch that clunky agitprop, "The Constant Gardener" inserts film two, a poignant, star-crossed love story.The love story is believable and well acted. It may bring tears to your eyes. Ralph Fiennes plays Justin, a shy, plant-obsessed, by-the-book British diplomat in Africa.Rachel Weisz plays Tess, a human volcano of sexual passion and crusading righteousness. Tess seduces a grateful Justin, suggests that he marry her so that he can take her to Africa (buying her own plane ticket has not occurred to her?), and, in Africa, Tess shakes things up by speaking out against pharmaceutical industry abuses of Africans.Within the first few moments of the movie, Tess dies horribly; the rest of the movie tells Tess and Justin's love story in flashbacks. These flashbacks are interspersed with somewhat incoherent dramatizations of the evils pharmaceuticals are meant to be perpetrating on Africans.The political propaganda scenes are an embarrassment. Pharmaceutical companies are the least of Africa's problems. A movie that really wanted to talk about African pain could start with any number of real and pressing problems, from tribalism to misogyny to destruction of the natural environment to corruption...but talking about any of those very real issues would not divide the world neatly into evil white people and innocent, and powerless black people. Note that in this film that means to make a statement about white exploitation of Africa, the stars are all white and the blacks, mostly, just suffer silently.The love story is beautifully portrayed by Weisz and Fiennes. They strike real sparks. But, even as the movie shows you Weisz in all but full frontal nudity, you realize that this love story does not exist to honor two characters, rather, it exists as bait to get you in to buy they evil pharmaceutical conspiracy theory. And so it becomes obnoxious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Le Carre story, but suffers from an improbable conspiracy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Le Carre is one of my favour novelists. This movie tells a story much in the manner of many of his great novels (exotic places, interesting people, backstabbing etc.). Its no "The spy that came out of the cold", but as entertaining as "Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy" and as twisty as "A small town in Germany". The movie is somewhat hard to follow because of the flash backs, but worth the effort. I'm not sure I understand the title -- the constant gardener -- but I might need to read the book to get that little bit of trivia.What is unique here is that Le Carre has shifted his focus away from spys towards corporate corruption. And that is on the one hand the strength of the movie and its major weakness.In terms of strength its a refreshing for a change to hear about something other than international political intrigue. How many variations on the traitor spy can one have! And I suppose the collapse of the Soviets takes so much drama out of the international spy story genre.On the other hand I don't know if the drug companies really deserve to be the focus of such a film. On the special features, one gets the impression that Drug companies were chosen at random, because Le Carre felt that oil industry was old news. He had also heard rumours of unethical research.There is a huge logical flaw in the plot of the movie. If a drug company found out that their drug was not safe, they wouldn't market it... not just because of the law suits that would occur, but because their business would lose much more when the flaw in the drug became public knowledge, 2 or three years down the road. Bad press can do a lot of harm to a drug companies profit margin. Reseachers will on occasion falsify records. There is in fact a lot of pressure placed on researchers to find positive results (publish or perish). So the idea that tests in Africa (or anywhere for that matter -- the US as recently as the 1970s), may be conducted unethically (usualy as a result of ignorance of the consequences of the research risks rather than malicious intent), might falsify records, obtain consent that is not truly informed (the participants might not understand the nature of the test being conducted) etc. is plausible... So up to that point, the logic of the movie is fine. Le Carre, was a spy and when he writes about spy stories, they have the insight of an insider, looking out. He is not a drug researcher and it shows. The idea that the drug company would hide side effects and go ahead and market the drug anyway is just plain silly. In reality the drug would be discontinued and the drug recalled for further development. To actually plan to market the drug world wide without altering the chemistry would be financial suicide. For starters, human trials won't begin until animal models determine the toxicity of the drug. As such fatal side effects are very rare. Its mostly annoying but harmless side effects like drooling, dizziness, the runs, dry mouth, or more serious but unforeseen side effects such as taking up pathological gambling (Parkinson's disease medication) or a a slight increases a person's long term risk for heart diseases that get through to the level of human clinical trials. Side effects are evaluated by a comparison between treatment and placebo control.The film also ignores the very stringent regulations placed on the conduct of research in order for the research to be published (ethical reviews, informed consent, recording of side effects etc.). It can take more than 10 years of tests to get a drug on the market. A drug test that didn't meet those standards would not be accepted and the drug trials would have to be replicated before commercial distribution could occur. So while I suspect unethical research occurs (perhaps frequently in Africa), the idea that drug company would ignore its findings, quick lime the evidence, kill off anyone who knows, and go ahead with marketing (rather than going back to the lab and spending millions more on development) is just plain silly.There are many ways in which the world hurts African's. Drug testing may well be one of them. But the conspiracy as shown in this film is not one that makes sense.Other than flaws in the underlying conspiracy, the movie is a great Le Carre story!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get out of Africa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is apparently about post-colonial Africa, as if it's the first and last word about it. There have been many African commentators, in film and print, who understood the conflict between ethnic, political and tribal rivalries (AA Masrui), and the power of economic colonialism. Is any of this clear from the movie? No. It's as if this is the first 'thort' on the subject. So,(we're meant to think) hoorah for 'Somebody Doing Something'. So Hollywood moves in, sums it up, and ships out, which has to be an insult to African people, who have their own fight on their hands. Why does Hollywood arrogate to themselves the right to tell the African people's tale - because they have the technology and the distribution access to do so, and to make money out of it. The appropriation of the emotion of African people: their troubles served up to the West, hungry for emotion - to expiate our shame, to absolve our gluttony: is another shameful colonisation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits When his wife dies on a trip in Africa, Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) finds his life in turmoil. He finds new love in the shape of the feisty, idealistic Tessa (Rachel Weiz) but a desire to find out the reason his wife died drives him to travel out there and seek out the truth. He disocvers some shady goings-on involving the drugs companies and finds that the more he finds out, the bigger danger his life becomes in.I suppose The Constant Gardener could serve best of all as a piece of Scientology propaganda, promoting an evil side to the drugs companies.Fiennes is well cast in the lead role, his distinctive 'bloody-swine' English monotone working well in the role, and he has a good support cast including Weiz and Bill Nighy. Although the film benefits from a good story, the direction is a little sprawling. But it shouldn't detract from what is truly a great story and very well played through-out. Well worth seeing. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Supposedly this was a "political thriller"...yet there was precious little politics, and even fewer thrills. Diplomat-type marries anti-economic-imperialist crusader, she goes too far and is offed by an evil corporate giant in collusion with the British government, he wanders around vaguely looking for her killers, then, when he finds them, lets them kill him so he can "join her". The end. Really. Not much left out, because there wasn't much TOO leave out. Except for a eulogy near the end--and it rather boiler-plate--no great, original statements against obsessive/compulsive hyper-capitalists or collusive politicians, no intense nail-biting moments of threat to the fumbling hero, not even a good car chase (there is only one car chase at all that I can remember; if there were others, they were not memorable, which again is the problem). Even the little bit of "skin" is mitigated by advanced pregnancy. So...if your supreme focus in life is opposition to the myriad ills of legalized theft that is modern high-level corporatism, or are just a fan of Weisz and/or Fiennes, then by all means watch away. Otherwise, give it a bit of a miss, mate.</fullReview>

Without this element the whole thing falls flat.

In order to give the husband and the wife any credibility, we have to believe that they are obsessively in love. That necessary evidence of undying love and devotion just isn't there. As far as I'm concerned, the husband thought the sun shined out of his wife's arse and i honestly cant see why. She wasn't in tune with his needs at all. After a quick shag, she then wants to go to Africa - why, because she wants to do her work out there, nothing indicated to me that feelings for him was involved at all, and nothing ever did.Hence, unbelievable characters, they don't ring true, I'm not convinced, pretty rubbish all in all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What may seem such an original idea is in fact built on a former classic drama, where the pharmaceutical world is a big hungry machine, and some insider turning to his better wits. Rachel Weisz gives a good performance playing the wife and victim of the conspiracy, Ralph Fiennes playing the insider (The role which in The Fugitive was played by Harrison Ford).Even though I support the good performance by Rachel Weisz as a more refined, emotionally rich additive, I don't feel that Ralph Fiennes can add anything to the character, that Harrison Ford hasn't yet shown through his skilled ability to characterize a humble, loving and courageous man, going through terrible tests in attempt to reveal the truth.In fact Fernando Meirelles attempted to copy the ethical setup from a directors wet dream (which have already won its own Oscars) - through all the valuable scenes and characters in such a degree, that I even got the feeling, I had seen this movie before somewhere else.I completely respect an original idea, but stealing from a world-famous classic like "The Fugitive" is something, I have a hard time to forgive, unless Fernando Meirelles has something very new to add to the picture, which is unfortunately not the case here - Despite a great effort from the actors, I remain disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am the type of viewer who sticks it out to the end of a movie no matter how disinterested I am. If I were not such a person I would have tossed this one aside within the first hour. Luckily, the film did improve over the course of the concluding hour but that was barely enough to redeem it.I do not mind non-linear narratives. The problem in this case is that, right off the bat, we're presented with a scenario that should be meaningful but instead is absolutely meaningless because we know nothing of these characters and their situation yet. Thus, we spend an hour putting the puzzle together to the point that we begin to see some inkling of why this story is worth telling in the first place. Granted, the plot slowly gathers steam but you'll have to stay awake long enough for that to eventually pay dividends.The actors can't be faulted. I have liked Rachel Weisz for years, though I'm not convinced that her performance here was truly Oscar-worthy. Ralph Fiennes is likewise solid (as always), though unspectacular. None of the supporting cast really stood out for me as being particularly good or bad.One continual irritation for me throughout the film was the (ab)use of shaky camera-work. Note to directors: This technique only increases vertigo, not verisimilitude. If I wanted a documentary look I would have watched a documentary instead, which, by the way, would no doubt provide a more satisfying treatment of the underlying subject matter.Despite these gripes, though, the film was ultimately worth watching. So, by all means, give it a chance as long as you're not looking for a 'thrill a minute' political thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Constant gardener? More like constant boredom...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film with a very simple idea behind it: The United Kingdom (and, one supposes, the rest of the West) is using Africa as an unwilling testing ground for drugs. There is the usual collusion between governments, drug companies and other capitalistic baddies, who are willing and able to go to any extremes, including murder, in order to make a buck. Africans are all good (except for those in government, who being part of the establishment, are also baddies) and Westerners are all bad (except for Ralph Fiennes, who seems to have taken a page off Hugh Grant's style book, playing the usual shy, introverted, bumbling but basically charming public school Englishman, and his wife, a fiery activist cum fearless investigator, rather unbearably self-righteous). Africa is nothing but shantytowns and misery. Official London is a nest of vipers. And the movie is, sadly enough, nothing but a collection of one-sided clichés. It is reasonably well shot and made, but it feels like a partisan documentary trying too hard to sell an idea.I'm not saying that there is no truth in the accusations made in this film, but its obvious, heavy bias detracts from its possible message. No mention of the fact, for example, that African governments have dismissed on occasion the dangerous spread of AIDS as "a foreign invention" and in consequence are far from blameless. It's all black and white, with no shadings.And leaving aside the message, as entertainment it's also dubious: I've been a John le Carré fan for many years, but when I read this book, I concluded that he had lost the plot. Literally. And the film has not made me change my mind. It's a film that had not made up its mind about whether it wants to be a love story, a description of the dark works of governments and large companies or a socio-political documentary with a large ax to grind. It tries to be all three things and as a result, it's nothing much. Boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Constipated Gardener</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We have seen this before; take any of the dozens of tiresomely interchangeable films where the villain is an oil company, a media conglomerate, a nuclear energy company, an arms dealer or any other giant multinational behemoth, only insert instead the words "drug company" and there you are. It is the premise of (the poorly titled) THE CONSTANT GARDENER that its evil pharmaceutical company, and presumably all drug companies, exist solely to make as much money as possible and will causally kill as many people as possible to get their lifesaving drugs on the market. The film sees this as neither an irony nor a contradiction, only that the bad guys will either destroy or preserve life, depending on which is more profitable at the moment.Set in Africa, this geopolitical thriller follows, partly through flashbacks, the efforts of Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes), a stuffy British career diplomat, who is forced to investigate the murder of his wife, Tessa (Rachel Weisz). Tessa may have actually loved Justin, but, it seems, she married him primarily as a way of getting a ticket to Africa where she could feed her liberal guilt by ministering to the dying masses in Kenya. And, conveniently, she also gains access to high-ups in industry and government. Tessa's motives are always suspect. Anyway, somehow she figures out that some of the drugs being given to AIDS patients are actually killing them, because the evil drug company is using the unknowing patients as test cases for trying out new drugs.It is a thorny ethical question: should dying patients be given a drug that might kill them, even though it could also help heal them -- and perhaps millions more? A thoughtful and intelligent drama could have been fashioned from this moral paradox. But Tessa knows a murder when she sees one and quickly falls prey to an international conspiracy backed by the omnipotent corporation which apparently controls the evil capitalistic governments of the West and has hordes of hit men on hand to snuff out those who get in the way.Sans all the absurd international conspiracy claptrap, this could have been the basis for a compelling film. What is a fair price for scientific advancement and who should bare the risks? But THE CONSTANT GARDENER isn't about ethics or asking questions; it is about reducing complex moral and political issues into simplistic good-guy-bad-guy propaganda.The basic logic is spelled out in no uncertain terms: The bad guys are -- once again -- the rich, western, capitalistic white men and the victims are poor and black and female. Once presented its tissue paper thin, single-minded, politically correct bigotry, the viewer is expected to simply close down their thought processes and blindly accept all that follows. Conditioned by endless carbon copy film plots that promote this same overt stereotypical agenda, it apparently is not a major chore to do so.While any drug company no doubt is as prone as any other business to have some corruption and greed, common sense dictates that the advancement and proliferation of medical and pharmaceutical research have done as much, if not more to benefit the downtrodden masses on the African continent than all the smug self-satisfied white do-gooders (and filmmakers) who have come and gone over the years. Had the film portrayed its lame premise as an isolated case, it might have some credibility. But the implication is that the drug industry as a whole exhibits the same mercenary ruthlessness that is usually reserved for James Bond villains.Do drug companies want to make profits off their products? Well, duh! Of course they do. But they may also spend millions or billions over the years developing and testing those drugs. And they should no more be expected to do it for free than filmmakers making movies. And, I dare say, researchers who spend their lives seeking miracle drug cures are at least as noble as actors appearing in self-serving, condescending pseudo thrillers.Even brushing aside the muddy politics at its heart, GARDENER can't sustain itself as a thriller. Fiennes has this habit of underplaying to the point of being almost nonexistent on screen; he brings little weight to his role. And while we are supposed to be in awe as Weisz plays the saintly white angel, I found her to be an ends-justifies-the-means manipulator. Her tunnel vision endangers not just the careers, but the lives of others, including an unborn child she carries through the squalor of the slums. And are we supposed to be touched that she is willing to prostitute herself to gain access to information she wants? I never found Tessa to be particularly interesting or sympathetic and therefore could not have cared less about the details of her murder.Worse, there is an underlying racism that permeates this film and so many others. Here's a film set in Africa, dealing with African problems, and only one of the main characters is black (played by Hubert Koundé) and he gets killed off almost immediately. Once again, the black characters are portrayed as a sea of needy faces, desperately in need of salvation by a caring white. The film also ignores the well-documented reality that consistently the biggest road block in getting help to these impoverished individuals stems from corrupt local regimes that intercept much of the aid that is provided, largely by generous western governments and corporations.But, in movies like this, not only can't the heroes be black, neither can the villains; only the superior whites can cause the problems or cure them. The entire complex political, tribal, philosophical and medical milieu of the African world ends up being boiled down the simplistic level of western politics -- good white liberal verses bad white conservative. The film fuels its narrow vision of right and wrong (or left and right) with accusations of racism, when the film itself is a display of racism.</fullReview>

While loosely setting up as a mystery/suspense, there is little mystery involved in the plot and the suspense is fairly dry. The airy, disconnected progression sucks the life out of what little action or drama there is. The characters are all rather predictable and two dimensional and flashbacks steal most of the chemistry that might have been developed. As for the political message, it's the typical government-big biz out to destroy Africa. It never explores the ills Africans have delivered or allowed on themselves. Africa is again a helpless victim, and the white world is both their devil and angel. Of course, it's only a movie...and a very overrated one at that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This seems to be obvious for any activist: behind any complex situation there is a simple explanation. And this movie was probably made just for activists. Tessa Quayle is introduced in the beginning of the movie through a bad-structured speech about the Iraq war being motivated by oil companies interest. Strucked by the originality of this theory, Justin falls in love with her, the result being a sex scene that has nothing to do with the rest of the movie (well, if we don't consider the pregnant nudity and the gross toe-sucking-while-driving scenes). Taking a look at the whole pre-African story, nothing there seems to be at least a bit credible. The rest of the movie has some logic, but is undermined by the absence of non-stereotype characters. There is no place for shades of grey in any of them, and how comfortable is to meet again the perfect British gentleman, the expansive and food-loving Italian, the computer expert kid, and the whole cast from another thousand thrillers. If you are a conspiration theory person or an anti-bush activist, you may enjoy this movie for confirming all the things that you already knew.

It also contains what is, for me, the first totally unqualified great performance of Ralph Fiennes. He's always been very good, but nothing he's done before matches this. He does more with less here than anybody has in a very long time. See Fiennes in this and then just try to imagine any of today's box office champ "celebrities" in the same role.Fernando Meirelles and his screenwriter Jeffrey Caine do something remarkable here: they put the deep emotional responses of a serious reader of the novel on the screen. You have to bring your own emotion to Le Carre; he doesn't tell you how to feel. You have to get there yourself. Here the filmmakers quite literally fill in the emotional gaps in Le Carre's story and create an extraordinary work of art that operates on four or five levels at one time, building to a bitterly cynical and crushingly sad climax that is nevertheless beautiful to behold.One of the great achievements of cinema in this decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart, Stylish Thriller that Visualizes the Political Made Personal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Constant Gardener" is an intelligent thriller that demonstrates that stylish can also mean smart.The key is that it's not only a good story with a sharp political point (I haven't read the John Le Carré novel that is its basis-- and the lengthy credits include a disclaimer from him that it is not inspired by a specific case but by corporate behavior in general), but it is also a visual feast with emotional resonance.The surprising choice of Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles, of the gritty "City of God (Cidade de Deus)," may have been partly intended to give a third world imprimatur to prevent the usual mainstream Africa movie curse of condescendingly focusing on white heroes, and we do get a more realistic exposé of the naiveté of the main characters than most such ennobling ventures. But we also are swept into a maelstrom of feelings structurally, with warm flashbacks as an almost stream of consciousness memories, and through the colorful cinematography, with intense images of Africa as a crowded palette of brightly colored clothes, dark skin, parched land, bleached horizons contrasted with the lush British backyard gardens (an international symbol of imperial-era colonialism so the title is particularly layered). The constantly moving camera pulls back in almost every scene so we see the context and repeated scenes take on different interpretations as Ralph Fiennes' character learns more and more about his wife's activities, and we are challenged to suspect her motives, though the sharp editing is a bit manipulative in sidetracking us to make visual assumptions, but is effective at capturing his insecurity and paranoia. The plot may not make 100% sense, particularly about one crucial confusing character, but that is doubtless due to the necessity of script compaction from a novel. While it is amusing that the teen nephew leads Feinnes through his wife's quite sophisticated computer and videophone files and it does seem as if the crucial information is readily available unmysteriously online, the graphics are very good at communicating complex information quickly, balancing explication with keeping the story flowing, helped by the propulsive music (though surprisingly not that much African music). Rachel Weisz's character does seem an obsessive gadfly activist, including sacrificing the health of her unborn child to her politics, but the film is honest about crediting organizations who do work day in and day out with serious issues of health, particularly TB and AIDS, and aid in Africa, both in the story and in the credits. Certainly the pernicious persistence of local corruption is plainly shown as equal part of the problems along with capitalist greed. I particularly admired that the film does not let the characters - or the audience-- take the usual Western out of feeling good about helping individual adorable kids but keeps its eye on the wider, endemic issues. Fiennes' character demonstrably matures from an older, mild-mannered bureaucrat to topsy turvy by falling head over heels in love with a younger woman and then very gradually taking on her legacy. His emotional awakening keeps us off-center because it could just as well be "Body Heat" of a sexy charismatic vixen wrapping a guy around her anatomy that's going on as the political machinations of "The Manchurian Candidate." Notably, he does not become a super hero, but is an ordinary guy searching for the truth, no matter where it leads as he tries to fulfill why she chose to be with him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pharmaceutical companies ARE Murderers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been a guinea pig on many occasions here in Boston, I can tell you that Big Pharma is an unbridled murderer, set free by a corrupt Attorney General (the Torture Architect) and a politicized FDA. As a Test Engineer Lead for an instrumentation company, I witnessed a perfect formula for murder: Take a charming con artist, former travel agent, who pretends to be a test engineer, take a group of scientists who are naive about software and software testing at the margins, take an FDA who just want numbers (never mind their veracity), and you've got a rush to market that will kill several people at least.But of course, Big Pharma already knows that, and is willing to pay off the few million in suits it will cost in order to get the profits, as this movie shows. So use all of Africa as guinea pigs. Who cares? Well, one woman did and she exemplifies many around the world (Doctors without Borders is one group I can think of). Brave NGOs that sacrifice their people in dangerous places, trying to do good but unprotected by the forces that are there to plunder the land. Who cares about the poor? We the mightiest nation on earth, have already proved how little our government really cares with Katrina. But then, without the damage, without the sickness shown in this movie, you can't make the obscene profits, both in Africa and the U.S.John Le Carre has a great novel, but the movie is making it even more graphic as you see the hordes of people. And wonder why the woman isn't harmed....a question the book answers. In this day of lawlessness, however, that fact of her safety still remains a question. Coming from Alabama, I've known black people who see red when they see 'whitey', and for good reason. We the people bear the price for those at the top whom we allow to destroy what is ostensibly a good thing: medicine for illness.This only adds to Britain's reputation as a disreputable bully, in Africa as well as in Iraq, which they held for about 50 years until giving it back to the warlords in 1958. That the people are so poorly prepared for self-government is a minor point in this movie, as the Kenyans in power are as corrupt as the whites. In fact, the hero black, a Belgium citizen, is painted as a murderer himself.Some excellent twists in this movie, and the novel is a masterpiece itself painting the scenes in a different, but just as effective manner. The subtleties of Bill Nighly's infamy as the U.K.'s Master Criminal in charge (somewhat reminiscent of Blair) is intelligently drawn. He mixes in the courtesies of the hoch Brit with the deadly inquisatorial skills learned in G-15, just a hit man with upper class sensibilities and aura.See the movie. Don't by any means, think this is fiction. It's being done right here in the good old U.S.A. with careless trials, with 'excellent results' foretold and expected from many clinical 'trials'....which should lead to criminal trials. Nothing will be done to correct the situation case by case until the cost to settle the suits exceed the cost of performing well-engineered trials (i.e., trials that check out a higher percentage of the possible fatal effects). They still sell cigarettes, don't they? On another front, the FORD's Pinto is one of the best examples of this 'cost vs. harm benefits'. They finally quit making the gas tank in back of the Pinto, when the death suits exceeded the cost of correcting the KNOWN flaw. See the movie and wonder why more movies aren't being made about the corruption of the Bush junta.</fullReview>

It's kind of a English Patient kinda doomed romantic tragedy in Africa kind of a movie with a murder mystery subplot. It's not giving anything away to tell you that Rachel Weisz dies in the first scene, then the movie goes into Flash Forward - Flash Back mode.It took me a bit to figure out what was wrong with this movie. The flash forward part of the picture portrays this great love story, but the flash back shows a relationship that was deeply flawed, very poor communication, lack of trust, and I can't tell you any spoilers. But their relationship was not the stuff of legends.So if Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz in love is enough reason to catch it, go on ahead, otherwise eh, maybe skip The Constant Gardner.This is porcine radio KPYG 94.9 FMThis KYNS 1340 on the dial</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The structure of this film is enthralling. There is a mystery. The audience learns in a step by step process, just as the main character learns, what the mystery is, who is involved in the conspiracy, what is the real nature of the relationship between the Finnes character and the Weisz character. The plot is well constructed.This is not a fast paced thriller, however. It was not written by Le Carrie as such and should not be filmed as such. His novels unravel slowly as we come to understand the characters, their dilemma's, and their flaws.Mierelles seems to lack any understanding of Le Carrie. His direction uses the technique that film-goers saw in "The Borne Supremacy." It is a moving camera technique that contradicts the tone and mood of the La Carrie style. It is so disconcerting that during the film I found myself thinking about the directing style. I am of the opinion that a directing style that is so obvious and intrusive that is causes the viewer to think about it detracts significantly from the film.Ultimately, great script significantly diminished by the director.</fullReview>

The lingering shots of the Sudanese and of landscape did little to contribute to the story line. More time should have been spent on the political-intrigue element. Although Ralph Fiennes delivers another solid performance, there was little he could do, given the leaden, soporific script. In short: it was a long, endless Oxfam commercial.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irritated by subtext of masculine/feminine relations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I felt extremely irritated by this film's treatment of gender issues. There are no good, powerful men in the movie. Every woman in the movie is smart, tough, capable, and fighting for the right cause. Any man with real strength is portrayed as being morally tainted, if not laughable or despicable. Joseph Fiennes, the idealized male of the movie, is a WOMAN's ideal - a devoted, deferential husband enamored by his wife's feistiness to the degree where he is willing to condone all manner of condescending and bullying behavior from her. It seems that it is very difficult for us to conceive of power as both/and rather than either/or.This annoying subtext diminished for me the impact of the very serious message at the heart of the movie. There is a lot of terrible exploitation occurring at the hands of multinational companies, and much of this IS an expression of the shadow side of the masculine. Yet this is a collective phenomenon in which both men and women participate. Evil is not so dumb as to only work through one sex. As a man, I am frustrated by all the simplistic media messages that, in seeking to redress the past power dynamics between men and women, simply reverse the roles. In this movie, this simplistic subtext of male-female relations created a cartoon-like portrayal of evil that took away from its potential impact.</fullReview>

I would have to think the most commonly heard words on the the set of this production were "we'll go hand-held". Aside from the overuse of the hand-held camera, there were framing issues, focus issues, color issues and just plain bad shot and scene design. I'm sure the filmmaker would try to justify his choices by saying it was for "mood" or to create a sense of imbalance, but those are always cop-outs for an artist who has lost his way and doesn't really know what else to do.I'm amazing a filmmaker with the skills to make "City of God" could retrogress to the level of a film school student raised solely on MTV caliber material.In short, this film is a tragedy to experience and most of that is the fault of the director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not absolutely sure if there is a spoiler herein, but to be safe, please be warned, since this film is, on one level, a mystery drama. One the many wonderful aspects of this film is watching Justin (Fiennes) grow from a detached, kind-hearted, naif to a sad, wise person of the world. And in true LeCarre style, no one is what they seem to be, which adds to the suspense element. The director is also responsible for the remarkable and very hard-hitting "City of God". Now this film comes along and it makes me want to know more about him. He certainly is able to deliver a powerful social message along with a great story. Not many can do that without sounding like they're preaching. I don't want to reveal too much, so I urge you simply to walk into the theater and let this film catch you up in its frenetic, urgent and beautiful style.Ten stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We found the Constant Gardener to be a disappointment. Great cast, but poor script and directing made this movie a grade B flick. The directors use of blurry transitions and "cinema verite" jiggly wiggly camera work is the kind of cinema you see from the ranks of junior grade film schools students. The camera style was distracting and detracted from the film rather than add to the ambiance of the story. Fiennes was OK Weitz was good. But both were struggling to make their roles come alive. Fiennes was almost milkquetoast in his portrayal of a British agent who prefers backyard flower pots to intrigue. The book was better. The film has gotten fairly good reviews but these come from the politically correct or incorrect crowd (whichever your persuasion) who think the film has a message worth seeing. We think the film is ham handed and mawkish in delivering its message that the downtrodden of Africa are taken advantage of by western governments and multinational corporations. I have no argument with the premise. But I do expect a film to meet certain professional standards. This one was about as professional as Spike Lee's Bamboozled.

First, the main character was completely passive. Even when he was decisive it was basically "Okay, now I'll get beaten up." Yes, that'll teach 'em. Second, the first half of the movie was told in flashback. Gee, way to engage the audience. Third, the main character was told where the proof that he needed was. What did he do? Nothing.

		<fullReview>The Constant Gardener has ingredients that we have seen before but director Fernando Meirelles gives it a mix that gives this thriller a refreshing sheen. It is an adaptation of a John Le Carre novel.Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) is a mild mannered British diplomat in Kenya. His wife, Tessa (Rachel Weisz) is a social activist/lawyer involved in poverty and ethical issues. She gets involved as an activist in Kenya much to her husband's misgivings and turns up dead.The evidence points to a doctor that Tessa might have been involved with but Justin decides to dig deep and asks difficult questions to the wealthy and powerful in the region and discovers that his wife was compiling data against a multinational drug company using Africans as guinea pigs for drugs with serious side effects.With flashbacks we get a sense of man discovering who his wife really was, a woman he married more on impulse and were polar opposites. Its a subtle performance from Fiennes. Weisz on the other hand gets to give an earnest and a more showy performance which won her a best supporting actress Oscar.Its an ambitious and even cynical film. You kind of get a sense who the bad guys will be and they cared very little about Justin's plight, the man who was obsessed with his garden until he decided to lift his head out of the soil and see his corporate world-view shift.</fullReview>

I just thought it was too "gimmicky". Someone must have thought the story wouldn't stand on it's own, so they jazzed up the filming. Also, some of the movie was confusing because there was no obvious demarcation between past and present. By the time I had some of the scenes figured out-- the time frame had shifted.

		<fullReview>First of all, let it be said that I loved "City of God".This movie ain't "City of God". Whereas I was completely drawn in and consumed by "City of God", gaping holes in the plot of "Constant Gardener" kept throwing me out of the movie every time the acting and cinematography managed to draw me in.I can swallow that Kenya is a fairly corrupt place. I can believe that individuals in the foreign service can become corrupted. I'll concede that big pharma will cut corners at times.But I kept getting jerked out of the story by the utter irrationality of the underlying plot here. Even evil organisations operate rationally in order to further their interests. Why would a drug company continue to test a drug that is obviously killing people? What's the benefit? They can never bring it to market an make money out of it anyway. When a blockbuster drug takes over a billion dollars to get to market, why would they cavil at spending "millions" to fix a product that is worth nothing as it is but would be worth billions if it worked? The good guys in the movie were well done - characters were believable, well acted, and consistent with their universe. But the bad guys were stupid and irrational. Who would believe that Sandy would just hand over a letter that would destroy his career and allow Tessa to walk out with it when there was no need? Even Tim Donohue's turning from the dark side was shallow and convenient.The thing that annoys me most is that, had the writer *cared* a little, all of the plot holes could have been fixed quite easily, without substantially altering the story. (e.g. Evil pharma company skips a step to get a drug into mass trials quickly, kills a lot of people, then goes to great lengths to conceal the fact that the trial ever existed so they can fix the drug and start again. Tessa photographs the letter and Sandy somehow finds out. Donohue discovers something that he didn't know before, or gets betrayed by his masters and "turns".) Then maybe I could have enjoyed the movie for what it was, rather than having my suspension of disbelief bubble continually pricked by sharp inconsistencies in the movie's world.The love story worked. Tessa was wonderful. But the writing sucked, because the writer obviously didn't *care*. Not a bad movie for video, but I can't give it more than 5/10.</fullReview>

I feel thrillers draw me in more when I feel as if I am part of the plot. The great acting was wasted by a camera that made me feel sick, and not drawing me into the action. Much of Rachel Wiess' scenes were shot from so far away it was hard to get into her character. Then, on the other hand, the longest close-ups, of Ralph Fiennes' face, lingered so long and so pointlessly. OK, enough of the bad direction.

Even when he's acting happy he appears cold.By contrast, Rachel Weisz was acting herself in this film. No wonder she's getting lots of praise for the role as she has to do very little in terms of characterisation.There are so many of the "Two Weddings" crowd in this that the Brit section felt just like a downbeat version of any Richard Curtis flick. Like "21 Grams" it is colour-coded depending on the location - with England being grey, of course.I couldn't help wondering whether these two people would really ever be able to get that close to each other. One is a cold diplomat who can't see what is going on around him, and the other is a warm, caring, ebullient, passionate campaigner.In the end, I felt that I'd been manipulated yet again by a load of sentimental twaddle. Sorry Rachel - I still love you.Late edit: I forgot to add that this film takes hand-held camera-work to a new level. It's no longer artsy, it's now extremely irritating.

		<fullReview>Beautiful cinematography - and an interesting anthropological piece (technically a tour de force) about the West versus the Rest, in this case Africa. The last time I saw a railway line running through the middle of a crowded village was in a documentary (BBC-tv, I think) about Manila and the effects of Catholic doctrine on local population growth. It is a very powerful symbol of the juxtaposition of humanity and technology. I have to say I think LeCarre's story is a bit clunky -- anybody who remembers Harrison Ford on the same drugs-corporation-busting trail in "The Fugitive" will understand what I mean. Or perhaps I am not understanding that this was merely the spine on which the story of true love was hung. But in fact the story is entirely about death - of different kinds - "The one thing we can still do well is get you out of here", the British diplomat says. In the same evening I also saw 'Bombon Le Chien (el Perro)' (Carlos Sorin). the contrast was marked. In "Gardener" we have the story of innocent third world peoples being exploited by wicked Western corporations, ending in death for all concerned. In "Perro" we have people in a third world country dealing philosophically with the corporations, and getting on with their lives, and finding joy and happiness, and Life. I prefer the "Perro" approach !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fiennes is excellent, but film is poor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was disappointing. The cast and Director lead me to believe that this would be a good film, but there were some flaws that made it hard to enjoy. Firstly whether-or-not Weisz is any good her character is plain annoying, I know that she was doing a lot of good work etc but I was pleased when she was out of the film. When the film changes from a (supposed) love story to a Bourne Identity-esquire cat-and-mouse film it picks up but this is done at a bad time. The main reason for this is that you're thinking that she has cheated on him and therefore have little sympathy. Even when you realise that she hasn't it's too far down the line and I really couldn't care. Fiennes on the other hand is excellent. He plays the traditional English guy much like Hugh Grant but without all the umms &amp; ahhs. The Camera-work is also annoying and borrows a lot again from the Bourne Identity. All the shaky and out of focus stuff gets annoying and adds nothing to the film. This film wasn't a complete waste of time and is worth seeing for Fiennes performance alone but overall quite boring at the beginning and then a poor mans Bourne film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As someone who 1) admires the novels of John Le Carre and 2) is the owner of a healthy dose of cynicism I was slightly uneasy when I began to read reports that this was the 'best' adaptation of any Le Carre novel. Though it's a while since I've seen either I don't recall there being much wrong with The Spy Who Came In From The Cold or The Deadly Affair (an adaptation of Call For The Dead) and having now seen Gardener I still find it inferior to the other two. Unlike other posters I detected no special chemistry and/or 'magic' between the two leads; Ralph Fiennes seemed as anaemic as ever and though he is undoubtedly a fairly decent actor he always gives the appearance of being heavily sedated and there was very little reason that a typical LSE student would fall passionately in love with a dull minor diplomat. Having said that the expose aspect of drug companies being aided by Government officials to exploit widespread famine and illness is a subject that does need airing and the film is at its best in the 'cover-up' aspects as personified by Danny Houston and, at a much higher level, Bill Nighy. On balance this is more of a gentleman's C than a double first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Constantly un-absorbing, but still decent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the eponymous novel, "The Constant Gardener" is an anomaly among recent movies, a thriller that, for better and worse, primarily appeals to the intellect rather than emotions, which makes for an interesting but not absorbing film."The Constant Gardener" follows Justin and Tessa Quayle (Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz, both perfectly cast), a British couple working in Kenya, he as a botanically-inclined ambassador, she as an fiery activist. When she is killed (not much of a spoiler, that happens almost immediately), Justin spends the rest of the film trying to determine exactly who his wife was and what she was actually doing. Call it a one-way "Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith" without all of the...well, everything.For the first half of the movie, as Justin tries to determine her identity and drive, the audience's state of mind mirrors Justin's: neither has any idea what is happening. But this isn't a good state of mind for the viewer. It's not as an enjoyable confusion like "The Usual Suspects", nor is it as driving a confusion as "Signs". It frustrates like having half the pieces of an impossibly difficult puzzle. Whether or not you want to, you have no chance to solve the puzzle, which thus generates a disappointing amount of disinterest.The foundational reason for the apathy lies in the connection with Justin and Tessa. The problem is that their relationship is relatively unexplained, which is acceptable in itself, but in turn minimizes the emotional connection with the audience. As Justin traces the painfully twisted story behind his wife, I cared because I wanted to know what was happening, not because I cared about the characters. I know that some have made this emotional connection that I missed, but I failed to find it in part because I fulfilled the goal of the film, putting myself in Justin's shoes, although perhaps I overstepped the cinematic wall in imposing my own beliefs on him. Personally, I would never have married someone I didn't truly know, and therefore never have been in his precise situation. Those who have been in or can see themselves in like circumstances could make a strong connection. But while I understand the romance and Justin's motivation to unearth the truth, I never felt an emotional bond that could have elevated the film to greater heights.Even though not being pandered to with melodrama is a pleasant change of pace, the film swings the pendulum too far the other way. Due in part to the aforementioned detachment, it fails to generate even the drama of "The Interpreter", even though "Gardener" possesses a warmer style than the detached Syndey Pollack picture, thanks to a fervid blend of production values. The jittery cinematography is the highlight of Gardener, reminiscent of The Bourne Identity, but with a grittier feel more rural than urban, reflecting the African setting with a strong use of red and yellow hues. Cesar Charlone, who also framed City of God, produces a similar look here, and accomplishes an interesting feat by using lengthier shots yet remaining aggressive with them. Usually in your face refers to a flashy, quick-cutting Tony Scott-type picture (Top Gun). However with a vivid color scheme and a preponderance of hand-held cameras and tight shots, Charlone maintains an immediacy that enhances in the story-telling process, but can't carry the entire film.Maybe it's just me and my cold-hearted, isolationist self, but I struggled to empathize until the more intense and quicker paced end scenes, and therefore my interest was lukewarm for most of the film.Bottom Line: If this makes sense, "The Constant Gardener", with its high production values and just-awry story, was better than I liked it. 7 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Still wondering what was 'riveting' or 'thrilling' about the movie. Logic kept me from enjoying the story. *** SPOILER ALERT **** While I can believe that drug companies would do something like this, it didn't make sense that she didn't know they'd kill her. I mean if they were already killing test subjects how could she think she'd be any different? Then she kept asking the "friend" what he was going to do with her report. "You promised you'd help me". Was he the only option? She couldn't go on "vacation" and give copies of her evidence to someone with a crew and big budget? The title should have been "Death Wish in Africa". She was frequently being warned about things yet she kept trying to influence change by handling things quietly or embarrassing an official at a public gathering devoid of media. It also didn't make sense that she wouldn't tell her husband in order to "protect him" but did nothing to protect herself. Then you have the hubby running around after after numerous threats and having the u-know-what kicked out of him, yet he doesn't have any form of protection.Like others have mentioned, character development was minimal. They went from making love to married. Honorable subject but poorly executed. BTW, those reviewers who say Drug companies would never do anything like this should do some research. There are numerous drugs that have been pulled because of related health issues or deaths. However, I have not heard of any huge settlements just seen a lot of lawyer ads asking if you have had a heart attack, stroke, etc. after taking such n such. Paying off a few whiners after making huge profits probably isn't a big deal. I'm beginning to wonder if FDA approval is required to release a drug.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>worth seeing, but ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's certainly an intelligent film and worth seeing, but it has a few faults which I think reduce it from being a very good film to being only an average one.The plot is very complex, while this is usual for a thriller in book form, it doesn't translate very well to film. It resulted in the main point of the film (Justin discovering that African people are being used as guinea pigs) having less impact than it should have done.The flashback structure works well, except that none of the flashbacks are signalled clearly, so that for the first two or three, you could be halfway through the scene before you realised it was set in the past. Films used to use a wavering image to signal a flashback scene. This might be too old-fashioned and obvious a device now, but there needs to be something in its place so the audience isn't confused.Not enough attention is paid to developing the main characters, and especially Tessa. She ought to be the most sympathetic character in the film, but the dominant impression you get of her is that she is prepared to use her sexuality to manipulate men into getting what she wants (including the one she married.) This has an unpleasant feel to it, and it makes her character at least a little implausible. It's not the kind of dishonesty you'd normally find in a political activist who is in the game for purely ethical reasons and not to gain any personal power.As for this film being political... naturally it is! It has a plot that concerns politics (in the broadest sense).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful well conceived film, but not terribly thrilling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The one thing that The Constant Gardener had going for it was revealed far too early in the film. We kind of suspected what the plot line was, but we were still strung along for quite a while. I won't say TCG was a bad film, but it just didn't push the envelope in away the story could have.The problem, for me at least, was the direction. It seemed the whole anti-corporation romp became too heavy handed and it took over the real story between Ralph Fienes and Rachel Weisz. Of course, I'm not defending evil corporations, but I'm inquiring to the fact that the story seemed like an idealized rant against the system. Fienes and Weisz both had great performances, embodying the characters that seemed so oppositely polarized in the political spectrum. Fienes was especially good, making us forget the horrible acts of humanity known as Sunshine and The English Patient. Weisz also reminded us of what she can do when she has an over=idealized persona to work with. The Constant Gardener was an interesting film to watch, but don't expect any real surprises. Just watch it for the beauty of Africa and the appreciation of what we have and what they struggle to attain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What A Wasted Opportunity! If You Like Depressing Movies, You'll Love This One!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high hopes for The Constant Gardner! Sure the cinematography and soundtrack are magnificent, but if that's all I wanted to see I'd rent a documentary or a nature program.Medical research is an issue that's near and dear to my heart! I worked many years in the pharmaceutical industry recruiting subjects for 100's of medical studies. Most were fairly harmless, some of them risky, others were plain ridiculous. I even participated in a fairly risky study myself, (of course, it wasn't described that way), to atone for my sins - real or imagined! Even though I worked for my company for years, one of the doctors conducting the study told me a bald face lie in order to "convince" me to participate. His obvious deception did not stop me from participating in the trial, since money was not the motivating factor. As a result, I, along with many others, experienced temporary, but severe side effects. The study was eventually yanked, and thankfully that particular vaccine never saw the light of day! So one can only imagine the utter nonsense that goes on in Third World countries, or in poor communities, here, in the good-old U.S. of A. with regards to medical research. But I digress...While abusing folks to make money is nothing new to capitalism, this is the first time Hollywood tried to tackle the pharmaceutical industry, head-on. The problem with this movie, besides the disgusting scenes of violence and death, is the extremely pessimistic message: If you expose the pharmaceutical industry, or any other powerful transnational corporation, you can expect to be either murdered; tortured AND murdered, if you're really unlucky; or to essentially commit suicide because you're depressed from losing a loved one.The ending was also lousy for other reasons. Suggesting even if you blow the whistle rather dramatically in public, you will never know what happens to the bad guys in the end. It's left to your imagination! Other rotten messages are: Western governments are totally corrupt. You have no friends among your colleagues, when the chips are down. In order to be a successful activist, you must keep your spouse clueless of the dangers, ad nauseam! Wow! Who the hell, but a fool, would want to side with the poor and the downtrodden, if death and self-destruction is all you're going to get in return? Hollywood, you will sell a lot more tickets by by writing your fiction with a bit more hope. Good does triumph over evil, every now, and then, in the real world!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Constant Gardener" Suffers Greatly From the Cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"THE CONSTANT GARDNER"(2005) A social activist and the new wife of a British diplomat is murdered in a remote region of Africa. The diplomatic corps want to brush her murder under the rug, but her husband begins to investigate the strange circumstances surrounding her death.The other diplomats think that he will soon drop his investigation, but he won't. He pursues it like a bulldog and along the way he comes to love and admire his wife even more for the crusading soul for justice that she was. Many flashbacks illuminate the story of their all too brief life together.There is a good story here and the makings of a good movie, but both the story and the movie are very nearly destroyed by the "cinema verité" documentary style of film making with its emphasis on the jerky, almost visually disabling, use of a handicam. Credit or blame cinematographer César Charlone (and others) for this.This film also tries too hard to give us a laundry list of the litany of the ills that have befallen Africa over the centuries and continuing until the present day. From colonialism to corrupt corporations to equally corrupt penny ante dictators, this film has it all. Although filled with the usual suspects, the villain du jour in this piece is, conveniently and topically, a drug company testing a fatally flawed tuberculosis drug called Dipraxa on African AIDS patients who would have died anyway.This movie is elevated by a passionate performance by Rachel Weisz as Tessa, a social activist newly married to Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes), a low key career British diplomat stationed in Africa. Her passion is exterior while his is interior and beautifully nuanced throughout the film until it reaches a breaking point. Their love story and the fine supporting performances by Danny Huston, Hubert Koundé, Bill Nighy, Pete Postlethwaite and others round out an excellent cast.Grade: B, Recommended?

		<fullReview>What is it about a Ralph Fiennes movie that it gets great reviews but is so god awful boring that one needs a pot of coffee and No-Doz just to get through it.I felt NOTHINg where the characters of The Constant Gardener were concerned. Tessa Quayle, an annoying rabble-rouser with no real point other than to insult high level diplomats rather than actually doing something that might be helpful to whoever she is trying to help which we're just not quite sure of.Compound this with the fact that she is phony and a back-stabbing wife who was carrying on an affair behind her mild-mannered husband's back left me with no feeling for her whatsoever.Finnes comes off as a spineless wimp who now gushes all over his dead wife as though there is some sort of noble honor in trying to figure out who killed his wife.Throw in a homosexual doctor that is supposedly working on something with Tessa, that we never really can figure out nor can one figure out what he's doing with her from the start.But of course, this is one of those "really gets good at the end" sort of movies where boring the audience to death is justified trying to build up suspense for a story that I found no redeeming value to.All of this in the context of two hours of mind-numbing dialog that makes one want to poke one's eyes out with steak knives. Artsy-fartsy to the extreme and sure to be a huge hit with the Brie cheese and caviar club, nonetheless The Constant Gardener left this steak and potatoes man numb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A suspense movie that does not keep you in suspense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Waste of Two and a Half Hours. I'll tell you why. Don't read this if you're interested in seeing the "film".The very first scene tells you exactly what's going to happen in this movie. It's a scene of Ralph Fiennes escorting his wife, Rachel Weisz, across a runway to a waiting plane where she's going to take off. He is tense, she's dismissive of his concerns. Right away I'm like "Oh, she's going to die, and he's going to spend the next two hours unraveling her untimely demise."Yep.Movies done in flashbacks have to really hold your interest, because when you're not watching a story develop, and you're subconsciously putting the pieces together, it's got to be engaging. This movie is not. Way too much of the plot is way too obvious - you're supposed to be sitting there saying "What's going to happen next?!" not "I bet this happens next. Yep." It's also relatively dull - despite Weisz' performance being amazing and electric, Fiennes is a gray blob of blah. They have almost no chemistry together.You see how they meet (he's a British diplomat, she's an anti-whatever activist) and they bop, get married like ten seconds later, and all of a sudden she's pregnant and embarrassing him at diplomatic parties. Enter the boss. Immediately when he walks on screen, you're like "oh, Jeez. Whatever goes wrong in the movie, THIS guy is responsible." and he is. Bill Nighy is so completely menacing in a British way, that you know he's a total sh**. Here too, you start seeing how Fiennes' best friend is probably involved. He's smarmy and slimy and gross looking, and you just know he is all up in this piece. So the next two hours ram a political statement down your throat, how drug companies and the British government are conspiring to kill off the population of Africa with disease, and Rachel Weisz finds out too much, and they go and kill her. Later, Fiennes unravels a tangled web of lies with his buddy and his boss at the heart of it, and they send the troops to kill him at the site of his wife's murder. The end. If you're making a suspense/whodunit movie, the important thing is not Politically Correct plot agendas, nor dazzling cinematography, nor indie-alty actors. A suspense movie is supposed to KEEP YOU IN SUSPENSE. This movie fails miserably on that score. I give it a suck rating of 7.</fullReview>

The sound was poor, the color awful, and the jerkiness of the hand held camera nearly gave me a headache. There were dozens, if not hundreds of great thrillers and mysteries filmed in the 40s, 50s, and even 60s with crisp, clean sound, sharp focus, and good old stationary cameras. Why now is it cool to make your audience squint, strain, and reach for aspirin? It must be some nod to the generation reared on pop music videos. *spoilers* I didn't like the ending. If a gang of assassins comes after me and I have a gun, I'm going to be using it ala John Wayne. There were some good aspects. There was good tension between the lead characters.

		<shortDescription>A noble failure, yet still a failure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find myself becoming more and more jaded with critics. They have been heaping praise upon praise on "The Constant Gardener," and making it this year's first real critical darling. Yet, upon witnessing it, I found myself terribly disappointed by the entire endeavor. It certainly cannot be blamed on the plot, which many people have stated to be too complex and involved. However, more complex plots have been executed before to great success. It is not the plot so much as the execution of the entire film. First, I have a great deal of displeasure with Meirelles' direction. He seems to be rather content to throw his camera about at all moments, often robbing us of both a clear view of what we are seeing, and further mudding it up with his inappropriately close angles, which only heighten our detachment by not laying out a clear scene. True, he does capture some beautiful shots of Africa, but he hardly seems to understand that the camera is used to tell a story visually, instead of just showing us nice scenery or the actors emoting. He really needed to be reigned in and focus on the story, perhaps learn what a steady cam is as well. His detached style does not help matters further when trying to shoot an emotionally charged thriller such as this where we must be as involved as the characters with the feelings of jealousy, anger, and loss. I'm seeing this style popping up more and more, and frankly I'm starting to believe it is an excuse to get away with rushed, sub- par direction. Another failure is the inability to create a feeling. Our hero, Justin, is a rather docile man suddenly thrust into a vast conspiracy that he seeks to topple in the name of the woman that was taken from him. An intriguing premise, surely; a thriller that, underneath the surface, is really a romance. Yet, this subtly operatic premise is done in a rather bland and pedestrian way that fails to make us truly believe that Justin would be willing to go to such lengths for love. The conspiracy itself does not generate the feelings of insurmountable fear that should come from a single man against a violent confederation of greed. It feels less like the villains of society and more like some bullies and half-interesting characters. The worse of these is Pellegrin, who should be the symbol of greed and power that we'd imagine him to be, but comes across more as a sub-par cartoon Bond villain. It's sad to see what could have been such a promising plot crushed under the weight of mediocrity until it becomes nothing more than a soporific exercise in tedium. The ending itself is a sadly anti-climatic last gasp of social preachings before the credits roll. If I must be positive, I would have to say that Rachel Wiesz gives one of the best performances of her career. It really is the best I can say.</fullReview>

How could they have complete control of all government, utilities, airports, etc.? I also didn't feel the chemistry I should have between Fiennes and Weisz. Her acting seemed to consist largely of turning toward Fiennes and flashing her patented lip-curling, toothy smile. Fiennes seemed dull and dumb to a fault. I just didn't believe any of it. Sorry, but I didn't like The English Patient either.On the positive side, the photography and settings were nice (except for the jiggly hand-held camera-work that ruined some scenes).

Ralph Fiennes plays Justin Quayle, an English diplomat assigned to Kenya; whose wife, Tessa (Rachel Weisz), is on a mission. She is idealistic and wants to make a difference. The problem is she does not know what she is up against.Based on the best-selling John le Carré novel and directed by Fernando Meirelles (the Academy Award-nominated director of "City of God"), this movie is a strong drama of a woman's fight to make a difference in Africa. Because if she doesn't, who will? This movie really illustrates the harsh conditions of Northern Kenya and how cheap life really is in all of Africa. It demonstrates how with the right backing, large corporations can get away with almost anything. Almost anything.Both Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz are good in this movie. They really convince you that they care foe one another. While at the same time, they contend with their own struggles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Constant Gardener falls into the category of tired Hollywood fare on two accounts. First, like every "R" rated Hollywood movie in recent years, the married people never have sex. Sex only occurs (or is implied) when people are (1) practical strangers or (2) cheating on their spouses. Second, in typical Hollywood fashion, big corporations and people who run, work for or invest in them are painted as evil incarnate, willing to do deeds that stretch the movie-goers suspension of disbelief to the breaking point.While overall I walked out of the movie feeling that I had wasted two hours of my life, two nuggets were worthwhile. First, the scenes set in a Nairobi shantytown were notable for their incredible depiction of severe African poverty and deprivation. Second, the attack of Arab militias against a Sudanese village brought home the reality and horror of actual events taking place there right now. In the latter case though, it was disappointing that the dialogue during this intense scene did not explain the nature of these attacks (who and why) to the audience. To do so would have been a true act of courage on the movie-makers part, as it would have spread the word about the real evil in the world today, rather than the made-up Hollywood type.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A boring movie that was split between being a romance and a mystery.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was extremely boring with hardly any plot. It was hard to tell if it was a mystery or a romance of this guy trying to resurrect his wife. At least I think that might be what it was about, as it was so boring I found myself nodding off to sleep more than once. Every time it felt as though it would get interesting, it suddenly became really boring again. This guy's wife was some sort of reporter, or was she just something else... once again, difficult to determine. She uncovered that this company was illegally testing drugs in third world Africa on all sorts of people. The people who were given this experimental cure, who died, were buried in unmarked graves, left to be forgotten and never recorded so the company could have favorable results without having to spend the extra money to change the formula so it was not so deadly. The ads on television for this movie made it look like a good movie. Need I mention, there were only two people in the theater? Myself and my guest. That's all, on opening day in America.This movie was a waste of 2 hours and $20. Very disappointed with it and probably the worst movie I have ever seen. You'd be better off spending your money on something better, but if you feel like spending your money to go and nap in the theater, this is your movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Political thriller viewed through the lens of a romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films that are written as thrillers, suspense stories and romances all feature certain story elements that define the genre. How the elements are combined to tell a specific story is the measure of a story's success at convincing an audience of its worth. "The Constant Gardener" is a well-crafted story with many fine performances, starting with Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz, and including the many character actors who make this film feel viscerally real and true. In the tradition of films like "Silkwood", "Z" and" The Insider", the director of "City of God" takes the audience on a tense, suspenseful ride with characters who dare tell truth to power. The film viewing experience feels dangerous and worth-while. No doubt, "The Constant Gardener", like "City of God" will fuel discussion about the politics which is the basis of this film, and will also send more people to read John Le Carre's book, which is the basis of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw it at a screening recently and was drawn into this great film from the very opening shot. The director does a great job of telling a complex story in an interesting way. His pace and visual technique kept the film moving in a languid yet urgent way (I say this because I remember thinking that there were very few quick cuts in the film, yet I never felt the "drag" that is usually associated with bad pacing). The cast was first rate and the script gave them lots to work with. Mr. Fiennes will likely get an Oscar nod for his performance, it reminded me of his great work in "The English Patient". Rachel Weisz was great too, but I felt she didn't get enough screen time to truly show off her talents.I hope it reaches a wide audience.</fullReview>

I wasn't enthralled. I was was hardly captive. It was a good movie. Perhaps on the preachy side. Big western drug company taking advantage of the small people in Africa and of course someone is making money from it. Justin gets killed at the exact same spot where his wife was murdered. What a martyr! The guys been left with tons of cash and decides to leave himself wide open, despite numerous warnings that he will be killed if he were to continue. So what does he do? He stays with the course of course and stays in Kenya and gets himself killed! Oh ya, he has the pilot mail-off the incriminating evidence, before being let off at the same point where his wife was murdered to get murdered. Like I said, it was OK.Enough said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>British incoherence in Africa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many things were right about this movie--actors, plot, writing--it's hard to admit what a disappointment it was. The screenplay was utterly disjointed, lacking in cohesion, and, at times, sense. In part, this was due to the trendy hand-held camera work which jounced you up and down and all around, without really seeming to produce very much aside from a case of vertigo. What was the point of all those strange angles? But to a greater extent, the loss of sense was due to the fact that the film tried to be everything--a thriller, a tour of Africa, a love story, a political commentary (and rather heavy-handed at that). Sometimes it even bordered on National Geographic. (The short clip of street theater was very interesting, but not relevant.)Unfortunately, in trying to be everything, it was nothing. The emotional impact of the love story was lost because the relationship between the main characters, Justin and Tessa, remained almost entirely undeveloped. They meet, they inexplicably go to bed, they inexplicably get married (one assumes). Then presto! They are in Africa and she is working as part of an aid project (again one assumes). Then she's dead. There is no reason for us to care. There is also no reason for us to care about any of the personal betrayals--real or otherwise--that crop up in the film, because none of these relationships are developed either. As a thriller the film was also a failure, because you know practically from the start who the villains are. As a consequence, Justin's journey to final knowledge does not come as a revelation to the audience. (So where's the thrill in that?) The other hats this movie wears-- infomercial about Africa and AIDS (?), expose of pharmaceutical companies, political critique of government corruption-- are scattered, unfocused, shallow and just tend to gum up the works. In sum, this was a film which had great, but unrealized, potential. I'd say "better luck next time," except film makers don't get second chances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To put "constant Gardener" as an nominee is a new low for Oscar. It's a cross offspring of "the insider" and "the English patient". It's a marriage of convenience, and produces dead offspring.Tessa was annoying in the movie. I can't say that I was happy she's gone. But I didn't miss her a bit. The constant gardener's undying love (or dying love in the movie) was unrealistic and fake at best.Recently a few movie about African issues make sick. If AIS spreads in Africa, blame the big pharm not giving them free drugs. If genocide happens, blame the arm dealers who sold weapons to the warlords. If corruption in high official, blame the rich countries who give them free aids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the director, Fernando Meirelles really drops the ball with this movie. LeCarre is truly one of the great storytellers of our time, and he paints an unforgettable canvas in text replete with smell, Africa's brawling conflict and misery, the heat, the passion. Meirelles has the challenge of translating that to the big screen, and I really feel his injection of his own message weakens an already powerful message.He has two great actors to work with, and never during the movie was I convinced that Rachel Weisz was Tessa Quayle- I blame the director. This part is a hard one because Tessa is a modern-day female Christ figure- charismatic, gifted, sensual selfless Earth-mother who gives her life to improve that of the helpless and downtrodden of the world. So, even if Ralph Fiennes pulls off the much easier role of the loving disciple who follows Her, which he mostly does- I felt the Rachel Weisz character lacked the charisma and the dignity of that character. And I felt that Fiennes' transformation was not really developed effectively. The cinematic flashbacks weaken it, even if he has them in the novel as well. This is a man who changes within a few weeks from a wimp of a career diplomatic yes-man gardener to a man who will follow his Love to his own destruction, and freely chooses to. The director or screenwriter attempt to change the story to a more understandable and palatable version of a scandal at the end brought on by the purloined letter...and they change the character of Lorbeer to a different sort of Judas from the novel- failure, failure. This tells me they didn't understand the book's message from the start.Finally, the few little extra politicizing events the director tosses in on top of LeCarre's story: the commentary on Iraq and the Sudan raiders, are blatant, feeble attempts that weaken a powerful story.I would be curious to read what the author, John LeCarre felt about the movie version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>..this thriller didn't thrill..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About in the middle of "The Constand Gardener", I finally understood this movie had something to do with big pharmaceutical companies. Some of the "users" said "an African drug company". Is there one ? I think Fernando Meirellas didn't get his scenes laid-out properly or didn't understand Jeffrey Caine's script. The movie began pretty good....but, I couldn't understand why "Tessa" was murdered and if it were really she until "Justin" was told by the one who set her up, but professing to love her. Huh? We learn all of this in flash-backs, which really didn't work in the plot.Why couldn't we have seen a little more of it before we had to figure-out what was going-on? The main obstacle, to me, was that I could not understand what the cast was saying - one of those English films spoken in pure English, good for the natives there, but it's fame and money-making prospects were aimed directly at the USA. I didn't really understand the entire film until I had viewed all of the extras. Wonderful! that John la Carre' wrote a bestseller, and also contributed to the movie's script, but I want to be able to get involved with a movie without spending too much attention to complicated stories. Even if a plot is predictable, if it's told in an entertaining manner, who cares? Everything doesn't have to be delivered in a "switch", so long as the story is good.I saw Rachel Weisc on The Academy Awards and thought "what a classy lady". Now, I'm wondering why she won it. To tell the truth, the only actor I knew-of in the entire film was Ralph Fiennes, from "Schindler's List" and it was a stretch to recognize him. Like many "users", the scenes with the African slums in the background were my favorite - I'm still trying to figure-out that long scene with the guy riding the bicycle - a lot of it deleted - and what he did once he got where he was going.I've put a lot of effort into trying to like this movie - this is my third viewing. I enjoyed "The AIDS Play" as much as I did the main feature. I agree that pharmaceutical companies are much too powerful, and if you want to do some research, look into how they control our NIH. This is another example of how big business in our country have a death-grip on our government. So, if I'm going to look at a movie about that situation, I want more easily understood dialog about it.The cinematography about a continent we see too little of - unless it's about warring, etc. - was beautiful. I'm trying to recall how the score effected the story, but don't. The strongest statement I heard was "That's how it is here", when the U N pilot refused to allow the little girl to fly on his plane, after the goons assaulted them.I promise, I'm going to get a better grip on this movie - if I do, I'll come right back over here and change this comment. If you're familiar with some of of my other comments, you'll know that I want EVERY movie to be great - and I overlook a lot of stuff that keeps them from being so. "The Constant Gardener" did not thrill me......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If only good intentions = good movies....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's laudable to want to make a film depicting the depredations of big global corporations (in this case the drug companies, an especially tempting target) against hapless Third World people who, like Blanche DuBois, have "always depended on the kindness of strangers" and usually received far from same. I haven't read the John Le Carre novel upon which this is based but I noted in the closing credits his statement that the real hijinks of the drug companies and their political allies make his work of fiction seem tame, which I have no reason to doubt. But intention must be followed by execution to be effective; there's not much in "Constant Gardener" that makes sense, starting with the title. The British diplomat Justin Quayle played by Ralph Fiennes keeps a garden but then abandons it (along with everything else in his life) to go leaping down the dubious path left by his wife Tessa, who's murdered in the first few minutes of running time. Talk about "carrying a torch," this guy's a walking forest fire.I haven't been Fiennes' biggest fan but he's always watchable at the least, a kind of twitchy English answer to Kevin Costner. He's a master of the portentous delayed reaction, e.g. here in the scene where he meets his future wife when she delivers a geopolitical diatribe at a lecture he's given. Rachel Weisz as the wife has a kind of free pass here, playing not so much a person as a collection of idealized traits, rather like Costner's wife in "Dragonfly"; she also takes it upon herself to be the savior and avenging angel of downtrodden nonwhite people to the exclusion of all else. She's seen mostly in flashbacks that Justin's having, although some of her scenes don't have him as a character. In order for "Gardener" to work, we have to accept that (A) these memories rekindle such passion in him that he almost joyfully flings himself down the path to doom, and (B) the drug companies and their political allies are not only evil but really pretty stupid. If Tessa was becoming a pain in their butt with her probing and crusading, how hard would it have been to get her and her husband transferred elsewhere? Or why couldn't they get her arrested and detained somewhere, like Lori Berenson in South America? Or if they wanted to kill her, why not make it look like an accident or set up some enraged natives like Amy Biehl in South Africa? Or have her get run down by a bulldozer, like Rachel Corrie in Palestine? Then when Justin follows suit, why follow him over several continents delivering one "last warning" after another ("Okay, we really mean it this time!") before finally blasting him full of holes which would be bound to attract some attention? I mean gee whiz, Nancy Drew could've picked apart this evil conspiracy pretty handily. The director, F. Meirelles, did "City of God" a few years ago, Brazil's answer to Q. Tarantino; the jumpy camera trickery is at least less headache-inducing than the recent "Stay" but still calls attention away from the story in which we're supposed to be getting engrossed.Maybe I'm just a little grumpy in that flashy self-sacrifice really doesn't impress me much. It's hard to be much of a do-gooder when you're dead. Living means you keep your options open even if that entails (gasp!) making some compromises or re-thinking your approach or falling back to regroup. Some of the supporting characters like "Ghita" or "Birgit" or "Ham" strike me as more effective foot soldiers for "fighting the power." Martyrs may be great for starting a new religion but if the goal is to bring about just a smidgen of "heaven on earth," then we'll be wanting "all hands on deck."Favorite performances: the too-seldom-seen-by-me G. McSorley as an embittered businessman and the busy P. Postlethwaite adding to his collection of exotic accents. (Weisz' accent is a bit odd at times, as though remembering her character is supposed to be American or something.) Nice soundtrack. I enjoyed that little AIDS play near the beginning, in fact wished there'd been more "African stuff" in general. But this is a movie about white people and even with the best intentions and a Brazilian director, it's hard to exorcise that old "Tarzan" demon. Black people are still bit players on their own continent....Favorite line (to the pregnant Weisz): "If I were your husband I'd tie you to the bed." Yeah, seriously, ladies, we don't expect you (and Junior within) to be Wonder Woman up until the water breaks; please, stay home, rest up and we'll go buy the cigars. (There I go again being the politically incorrect Grinch in Who-ville....)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two plots that subtract from each other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One movie, two distinct plots. The first story is Weisz and Fiennes character's love and subsequent marriage. Tessa Qualye is so in love that she keeps more secrets than the Pentagon, all from her husband. I believe the love between Tessa and Dr. Joshua Ngaba more than the love between her and her husband. She certainly shares and flirts more with Ngaba. The other story is simpler and to me not a shocker - American Corporations are killing poor people in foreign countries to make money. This has been going on for so many decades, it is hard for me to perceive it as a revelation. For Corporate America human life has always taken a backseat to profit. This has been expounded so many times in novels and editorials over the last 200 years, it can hardly be "shocking news" now. If the stories had been told as separate movies I think I would have enjoyed them more, but they never seem to come together in "Gardener". I felt a little schizophrenic trying to bring together the two story lines. Also, what point was there in the husband killing himself (by his actions)just to reveal one of his wife's' many secrets? I think Paul Bowles might have pulled this off, but not the screenplay based on John le Carré's novel. I have read the many positive reviews, so I am assuming my take on the film is mine alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everybody thinks they know the secret to fixing Africa, including the makers of this movie. From the moment you see that the lady is getting on a plane, you're certain she's a gonner. Soon after, she beefs it in a car wreck... Unfortunately, like most films based on John Le Carre novels, this film has the pacing of your neighbor's unedited vacation videos. Further, the flashbacks (which is how the story is primarily told) that introduce you to the female (now dead)lead character, all make you wonder why anyone would marry such a rude, self-centered, irresponsible b****. She would be considered offensive in a free-wheeling Western context and seems to enjoy dishing out insults - the kind that get you disappeared - in far less-tolerant circles. Not a good plan for longevity. Suffice it to say her come-uppance is coming throughout the movie. She keeps acting like an arrogant whore. Her husband keeps acting like a British diplomat who is in well over his head. The bad-guy of the 90's Big Pharma, is responsible for all the deaths in the film. And in the wind-up they re-cast the rude-whore-girl as a lovely, faithful wife who was struggling against the "axis of evil" (yes, they said it) and is, in fact a heroine we can all admire and aspire to being. This is a film only an ardent activist could admire. A little too preachy and far-fetched for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was hoping for better before seeing this film but was left with a slightly weary feeling in my head after seeing it. I see this as a film appealing to lovers of Africa ( which is not my case ). If you want to see African landscapes, people, and everyday life, you will most surely enjoy this film which was shot for the most part in Kenya. I do like Ralph Fiennes as an actor but really found the story too confusing to be able to appreciate in one go. Thank God that some enlightened person has written on the IMDb message boards a full and detailed plot summary, which is probably better read just before seeing the film. I had the stupidity do to it after-wards but it did enlighten me on a few points but it still remained pretty obscure, partly due to the fact that it jumps around too much in time without giving due warning to the spectator and therefore wears out one's brain cells ! On the theme of "innocent-person-trying-to-uncover-a-huge-scandal", I preferred the film Erin Brockowitch which was far easier to follow but nevertheless maintained a certain suspense. In the Constant gardener, the story is so convoluted that the pleasure is lost.I can therefore only assume it was made for people with twisted brains who like this sort of stuff but that isn't my case ! But I would reiterate again the "African" element which will make the day of those who for one reason or another are attracted by that continent !</fullReview>

I loved Bourne Identity, but Bourne Supremacy, while good actors, nice plot and good action, you needed to take a motion sickness pill because the camera never stopped shaking! Constant Gardener felt like that as well. Just not quite the action. That directing is too abrasive and makes you feel like you have to be disturbed by what you are seeing simply based on how it is being presented to you. It is like you are supposed to know this moie is more serious than the average movie because of how it was directed. That doesn't mean it is more entertaining. It overshadows the acting and the story for me. Both of which I thought were good.So this was all to distracting to me. Though Gardener did not quite leave me as frustrated as Bourne Supremacy. Not familiar with the director here, but it will probably make me think twice now before I see a movie with his name attached.Such is the case with the next Bourne film. There has been mention on bringing back the director from Supremacy to do the next one as well. We'll see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Constant Gardener attempts to do it all. Thriller. Romance. Moral/Social Conscience. Unfortunately, it doesn't all add up to a satisfying movie.The film begins with a running start. Ralph Fiennes is Justin Quayle, a mid-level diplomat in Kenya, who discovers his wife, Tessa (Rachel Weisz), has been murdered. The questions of why? and who did it? are involving and the urgency to discover the answers contrasts perfectly to the withdrawn, inactive personality of Quayle. Tessa is fire and Justin is, well, dirt. For the first half, he just mopes, while we flash back in time to see how they meet and the events that lead up to the murder.The movie centers around both uncovering Tessa's killers and the wrongdoing in Africa by a major pharmaceutical company and is very uneven. On one hand, the movie attempts a raw look at corruption in Africa and the death and poverty that are associated with it. Meanwhile, the movie distracts us with the convoluted corruption within the British government that allows Tessa's death. Well, which one is more important? The death of the Africans or the death of Tessa? In a great movie, they would be symbolically linked, but not in this movie. Instead, the movie oddly throws out red herrings regarding Tessa's motives in the beginning , then lets the mystery fall down like a house of cards in the second half when man after man comes forward with vital exposition in comic-book banality. One man realizes he has cancer and so gives up information. Another man has two scenes before he returns to spill his guts in a car and then disappears again.Another flaw is if Tessa and her doctor friend can be disposed of so quickly, why is Justin not killed quicker and covered up as well? In fact, he manages to travel to the UK through parts of Europe and then back to Africa with only warnings. He gets two threatening notes and thugs beat him up. Huh? Why not just kill him? Other sloppy plot points include not one, but two incriminating letters, both which are found too easily and in the oddest places. (Spoiler: Uh, they take everything away that was hers and madly search the house but miss a box in the linens?) The dots are too easily connected making this a weak thriller.Why is this a problem? Because the film has a heart regarding abuse in Africa. Thus, the plot takes away from the emotion behind the tragedy. It's almost like the filmmakers didn't believe anyone would see a movie or a documentary on African abuse and needed to drape it under a thriller. The trouble occurs when there is scene after scene that are continually preachy. Characters make declarations about mistreating Africa. We are treated to multiple scenes of the dry, barren land, an obvious metaphor for the situation there. Children are murdered and kidnapped in two different points. The filmmakers did not trust that viewers would want to see a drama on African poverty, but also did not trust their intellect in understanding the direness of the situation.Thus, with a blah conspiracy theory that involves nearly every British man who comes onto the screen, a love story that isn't really fleshed out (she's inconsistent as a character and we're not really sure why he loves her or vice-versa), and the main thrust behind the story being hidden, the Constant Gardener doesn't quite work. The intent is there, but the story is not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few Gripes.....but overall better than Average</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose I will start out with the bad and work my way to the good aspects of this movie. There were 3 or 4 problems that I had with this movie. First of all, the plot. The plot was made to confuse the heck out of you!! For the first 1/2 hour (at least) the audience has pretty much no idea what was going on. The plot is muddled, and it's hard to follow. Don't get me wrong, I do like complex plots and movies but this movie was deliberately confusing. Second, it was too long, there was definitely room for cutting the film. Especially the ending-the funeral scene was so on, it was one of the best parts. I could totally see the movie ending with the African children running, but I felt it went on and on and unnecessarily showed her death and his-the audience already knew why, how, and when both of them died....if a character is going to tell the audience how a death happened, there is no need to show the audience, and if the death is shown, there is no need to talk about it. I also felt that certain parts of the movie were contrived. Tessa's motives for instance. The murderers and the drug companies motives and actions. I think what the film was trying to accomplish was how corrupt drug companies screw over many people at a time and tried to tie that to one or two individuals (Tessa and her husband), and it did not transfix well onto one or two people. And last but definitely not least, Rachel Weisz's face!! She is so ugly it is almost distracting, I can't believe they chose her for the role. Her nose is disgusting and so are her teeth. My friend thinks she's gorgeous...I most definitely do not, but she did grow on me after a while. Now for the good parts! The cinematography was amazing. Such amazing shots, it almost covered up the muddled plot!! And Ralph Fines acting was truly amazing, best I have ever seen him. I could totally see an Oscar nod this year-he totally deserves it-I couldn't even tell he was acting!! And as I said before, the ending was great. And even though the plot was muddled, there were interesting points about corruption and big businesses in general! (7 1/2/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambitious film comes across as a tad flat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been several films that I have thought of as disappointing after an initial viewing and then as time has gone by I have admittedly changed my vote (Bertolucci's 1900 comes to mind) and I'm going to predict that this film will probably end up the same way because my first reaction after seeing this is that it seems to be missing a few things to make it truly effective. With that, I am giving this a recommendation because anything that has a cast this good and is that ambitious deserves the credit it's due and should have people (like myself) telling others to judge it for themselves. Story takes place in Northern Kenya where the wife of a British diplomat and her companion are murdered on a secluded road and when her husband attempts to piece together the details of what happened everything points to a pharmaceutical company that uses the poor as guinea pigs.Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes) is a mild mannered and timid British government official who married Tessa (Rachel Weisz) who's a very outspoken activist and when she travels with her husband to Africa she unravels the secret of what the drug companies are up to. After Tessa's death Justin starts asking questions and checking her e-mails that include intricate details involving fellow government officials Sandy Woodrow (Danny Huston) and Sir Bernard Pellegrin (Bill Nighy) but when he arrives at medical station in a remote part of the country he meets Marcus Lorbeer (Pete Postlethwaite) who ends up giving him the final pieces as to why Tessa was killed.Fernando Meirelles gave everyone warning to his talents a few years ago when he made the exciting "City of God" and he seems easily destined to become one of the more interesting directors working today but I do have to admit that I think he stumbles somewhat in this his latest effort. First off, I think the good outweigh the bad and I am recommending this film because of the performances of both Fiennes and Weisz but also because of the whole scope of the story where one man seemingly dwarfed by both the politics of a third world country and the involvement of the drug companies still finds the resources in himself to get to the bottom of things. But, I'm definitely not giving this as high a praise as so many others have and I certainly don't think this is one of the years best films and a good part of the reason has to do with the overall look of the film. Meirelles has once again hired cinematographer Cesar Charlone and while their collaboration on "City of God" ended up with a film that was visually exciting to watch the same cannot be said here. The hand held camera work didn't bother me as much as it did many others but what I did notice was that the entire film lacked a crispness and clearness that is evident in very low budget films. I'm not sure if Meirelles and Charlone purposely used a low grade camera to shoot this film (hopefully the DVD will be more clear) because it's either lighter to carry in crowd scenes or maybe they were going for some artistic statement but the end result is a film that looks cheaply shot. Secondly, the story about the evil drug companies is something that we have all seen before (how many does it make now?) and if the script expect the audience to be shocked by these events than it fails on that level because most (if not all) viewers already know this long before they step into the theater. What does work is watching Fiennes character learn more about his wife than he did before her death and seemingly fall in love with her all over again. This is the base of the script and in conveying this Fiennes once again shows that he's one of the best actor's in the world. Like I said earlier, I am giving this a recommendation and I do hope people check out this film because it does have a lot to offer and instead of throwing away your money on some inane Hollywood nonsense one might want to view something a little more challenging.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The cinematography was excellent and succeeded in capturing the real Africa. Much of filming took places in parts of the continent I had never seen before. I found the movie did not flow emotionally and made the characters somewhat unrealistic. In other words there was a disconnect scene to scene which I found artificial. The plight of African nations can be horrible but because of the subject matter (hypothetical) it cast a doubt on what we were seeing was realistic. The woman character and her idealism brought a good contrast to the film. Overall it was a movie worth viewing and was thought provoking, though it could have better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to love this movie. I had seen the trailers a month before on TV and it was something I was looking forward to. The scenery was beautiful, it broadened my understanding of life in Africa. But the plot was hopelessly typical: Character uncovers massive plot. Character attempts to expose plot. Character is threatened (or worse). Movie ends with a "We showed them, didn't we?" feeling. We've all seen it before. Since we see the ending at the beginning of the movie, we already know how the story turns out (no surprise), so the emphasis must be on the journey getting there. Unfortunately, the journey was just as boring as the actors chosen to play the lead roles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading many positive reviews I came to the theater with the impression that I would be watching one of only worthwhile movies this year. Needless to say, I was for the most part, disappointed.Despite the heavy handed imagery and situations present in this movie (of which I usually fall for) I could not bring myself to actually feel any emotion. Maybe it was the often verbose dialog, maybe it was the ridiculously slow pacing. Whatever it was, I did not feel engaged in this movie.Is this movie thought provoking? I wouldn't know...I was yawning too much to care.That's not to say that there wasn't anything positive in this movie.The acting of Fiennes and Weisz are one of the many redeeming elements of this film. They both fit their respective roles perfectly, often delivering believable performances.Cinematography was excellent in my opinion. Most of this is attributed to the awe inspiring scenery shots of the African countryside and the shots of decrepit villages. I overheard several people after the movie commenting that the shaky camera work was nausea inducing. In my opinion, if you've ever driven a car this should not be a problem.Overall this is a unengaging film that is saved by worthwhile performances and superb camera shots.Note: The movies overwhelming agenda may please or anger viewers depending on which side of the political spectrum they lie on.</fullReview>

There was a stunned silence among the audience that left the theater. For that, the producers, director, writers should feel gratified.All this having been said, the execution of the movie was good but not great. I think the script tried too hard to keep us in the dark, and not hard enough to remind us these characters are plausible. I didn't buy some of the choices the characters made. I think changes in the lines of some of the scenes would have kept the mystery for us while making the characters more plausible. I didn't really buy Fein's acting the whole time. Maybe it's British stoicism. I don't know. Maybe I'm just conditioned to see Dirty Harry going nutty and blowing heads off. Great movie conceptually, but not one of the great movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meirelles missed the point and let the film just meander.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a rough edged film where (I suppose) the director let the cinematographer employ jerky camera movement as an effort to create tension where none really exists. The LeCarre story was always very slow moving, and not the stuff of adventureware. Like his earlier novel (and film) The Tailor of Panama, writer LeCarre was having a tough time inventing in a new motif.This was the first time out for LeCarre following the end of the cold war. My remembrance of the novel is not flattering, but there is a remembered poignancy about an inability of either of the Quayles to cope with the 'real world,' and so their characters found solace in their private rebellions. It was what attracted them to each other. The characters were an apt study on LeCarre's part of the juxtaposition of apathy and contention, each employed as a studied response to a world too much for mere banalities.Meirelles either didn't get it, or tried to reinvent LeCarre's story as if it were one of his previous pot boilers. The film is jarring from first to last. So jarring you can't really spend time getting to know, much less care about either Justin or Tessa. Meirelles jumps erratically back and forth between the two, missing the connective links between intention and action. I tried to get up and leave the theater on no fewer than three occasions, but forced myself to sit through it that I might have a new benchmark for failure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ralph Fiennes carries the movie. His interpretation of the role of a distracted foreign service officer linked up with a lovely woman who is obsessed with justice is perfect. Too bad no research was done on his obsession with gardening. Woody Allen would have been a great director for this movie because of his exquisite attention to detail. Remind me not to see the next film by Fernando Meirelles. Same for Rachel Weisz who is just a tad less manic than the screaming maniac Sandra Bullock. Especially in the scene at college where she meets Ralph. She is made to look a fool. Perhaps Fernando can't call a spade a spade. The message of the film is muddled. Are these FDA sponsored clinical studies? Are they being falsified? Does one person die out of 10 given the medicine, out of 1000, out of 10,000? Are the rest cured? If they are not FDA sponsored clinical studies, what are they? And was the drug supposed to be Xyprexa which allegedly killed my friend's son as well as others. Or perhaps its Viox. The photography is purposely jerky so we wont pay too much attention to the poverty of Kenya which kind of resembles New Orleans at the moment. I am glad I saw it. It held my attention.

		<fullReview>"The Constant Gardener" is one of the best directed films of the year.It is wonderful to look at. It is a kaleidescope of visuals. The colors range from ultra saturated to monochromatic. The camera is hyper-kinetic and always gives us something interesting to look at.Unfortunately, just about everything else about this film is mediocre.The film has a detached quality, which is not necessarily a good thing for a thriller. I never really cared about any of the characters and I did not feel passionate about the bad guys getting caught. The ending was anti-climatic to say the least. After 2 hours and 10 minutes, I expected more of a payoff.Ralph Fiennes is not and never will be a movie star. He simply cannot carry a film. Rachael Weisz gives the best performance of her career, but that's not saying much since she has built a career running from monsters in a wet t-shirt. Danny Huston is not a guy you love to hate. You just don't like him.The dialog and the story are pretty forgettable.If you love good photography and great directing, be sure to see "The Constant Gardener" on the big screen. If you wait for it to come out on DVD, you will probably end up falling asleep on the sofa.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been waiting for this film for ages, but 35 minutes into the film I had to leave because of the jerky, hand-held camera work, jump shots, etc. Why oh why did they have to do this? This kind of camera work is okay in certain situations -the Africa crowd scenes, etc., but to go on and on, even when it is unnecessary was very rough on my system. From what I saw of the film, however, I was very impressed with the performances by all, especially Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weiss. If I can find an older theater that has more than 30 rows I might be able to handle it, or just wait for the DVD. What a disappointment!!! So now I am working my way through the book. Directors, please be aware of how your cameras may affect the people who love films! Some of us just cannot handle that kind of motion. We aren't at sea, were in a movie theater!</fullReview>

With the Labor Day weekend, and the theater full like it was, I'm worried that the film will actually turn a profit. All those poor souls such as myself who saw the four-star rating and thought it would be a good film. It saddens me to see such good talents such as Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, and Bill Nighy wasted on the atrocity that was this movie. Some might comment on it's realism.

		<shortDescription>Fernando Meirelles saves "The Constant Gardener", and does all that he can for it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Constant Gardener" is not even one of the top 15 films of the year. Critics have raved about it, some even calling it one of the best of the year. Its flat and uninteresting story line, though, is what makes this film nothing special. In Northern Kenya, activist Tessa Quayle is brutally murdered. Her husband, Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes), digs deeper than anyone could have imagined into finding out why Tessa was murdered. Haunted by her death and with rumors of her infidelities, Justin soon finds himself in the middle of a conspiracy and in a life threatening game of cat and mouse.One of the most intriguing things about "The Constant Gardener" is the relationship between Tessa and Justin, or rather Justin's love for Tessa. After her death, the more Justin finds out and the more secrets he unlocks about Tessa, the more he begins to truly love her. We especially get a sense of this in the last third of the film?the best part of the whole movie. Everything before that feels like a Law and Order episode mixed with cliché. If there is one major highlight of "The Constant Gardener," it is the superb directing by Fernando Meirelles. Meirelles, who made the incredible "City of God," generates emotion and depth with his cinematography. Using a hand-held camera and an over-exposed lens, his films are gorgeous to look at. From heavenly light pouring out of windows to the quick cuts in an African market place, Meirelles signs his films with his distinct camera-work. It is unfortunate to have to watch "The Constant Gardener" and appreciate the technical aspects of it far more than anything else. Of course, Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz make a great pair, proving to be two very talented actors. Their performances, though, are nothing Oscar-worthy. If Fiennes was not nominated for his tour de force performance in Spider, then there is no reason why he should even be considered for his role in "Gardener."Overall, "The Constant Gardener" is just an average film. Like "Hotel Rwanda," it takes a personal story and adds universal meaning to it, but in such a flat and formulaic way. "The Constant Gardener" is one of the most overrated films of the year, but it is still worth watching, to see how originality can be felt through the camera-work of a talented director.</fullReview>

The Constant Gardener is not as good as The English Patient but almost as good. I suggest that anybody sees this who wants to know about how US Drug companies test their product out on the helpless Africans. That was so wrong and painful to watch.

		<fullReview>SPOILERS Differences between the West and Africa are hardly news. Whilst the West appears affluent and rich, Africa is forever shown to be starving and poverty stricken (often corrupt) place. Authors like John Le Carre talk of this in great details and stories appear showing the evils of capitalism and the cost of human life. Based around the health costs of the African people, "The Constant Gardener" is a powerful, albeit heavily biased story. Dominated by an outstanding performance by Ralph Fiennes, the film is bound to be an Oscar contender when the award season comes around, although it's probably not quite good enough to achieve anything other than multiple nominations.When his wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz) is murdered, apparently by her work mate, British Diplomat Justin Quayle (Fiennes) sets out to discover the truth. Discovering a dark and passionate side to his wife that he never knew, Justin begins to discover that those he thought he knew are now setting out to stop him uncovering the truth.Slow to start, by the time "The Constant Gardener" begins to get going, you find yourself instantly hooked. Wonderfully written and beautifully shot, it is a magnificent production and it is of little surprise that it is getting praise from press across the world.Led by a superb Fiennes, the acting across the board is sturdy and often perfect. One possible exception is a personal dislike for the work provided by Weisz. Whilst this is being touted as Weisz' finest role to date, she never feels to this reviewer like she ever gets to grips with the roles and definitely her love for Fiennes feels artificial and sketchy. The film feels superior when Weisz is off screen, but at the same time, her scenes are integral to the story and the culminating scenes involving her are pure beauty.Le Carre's book is also incredibly on the biased side. The story might be fictitious, but the situation in Africa is very real and by portraying the drugs industry in such negative light, it feels harsh to not at least offer them some form of defence. Whether there is a defence or not is irrelevant, but we should at least give them the chance to try. If people are going to complain about the bias of the fool Michael Moore, they should also think about films like this.Aside from the biased of the story, which is heavily convincing, it's worth admitting that the romantic angle of this film is beautiful. Fiennes hunt for the truth about his love's demise is powerful and poignant stuff and even the hardest soul is likely to shed a tear at some point or another. It just feels a shame that the story is ruined by such a heavy biased and another mediocre performance by Weisz.Come February 2006, "The Constant Gardener" is bound to be up for most of the major awards. Ralph Fiennes, just like Heath Ledger in "Brokeback Mountain" is a worthy candidate for the Best Actor award. In the actress category however, the film will probably undeservedly be nominated. As Fiennes love interest, Rachel Weisz is unconvincing and the film is better off when she is off-screen. Still, it's a powerful film, and biased aside, it's difficult not to get hooked on and definitely a film worth watching. Just don't make too many judgements without hearing both sides of an argument.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just want to say that this is one of worst films I have seen in a long time. The constant (no pun intended) African music (not sure what you call it) drives you batty. You must have it turned up to hear the dialog then the music comes on and blast you out. The story line just never seemed to completely unfold. You had to connect all the dots yourself. In my opinion, IF you weren't able to do that, you would be totally lost. The trouble is the dots make no sense or they are out of sequence the whole movie. Not sure if this is a spoiler or not, but I spent the whole movie not sure if the wife was a good person or bad. I could NOT seem to like her thus made me not care about her cause - IF I even figured out for sure what the cause was supposed to be.I will NEVER understand how this has been rated so highly on here. My husband went to bed after about half of the movie. I kept thinking it would get better and make sense, but it never did. Starting off ahead of where it eventually takes you was very confusing - I usually can keep up with plots (even with flashbacks and such). I DO NOT wish to ever see this movie again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I give this film high marks for is the story and character development. This is a very smart film, the type that critics and students of film croon over. However, its characterization via marketing will no doubt alienate many casual film-goers. This film is not a "thriller" so much as it is a love-story/mystery. It is not one bit "suspenseful" but is rather an entanglement of political and economic forces that is very...slowly...disentangled by our protagonist. Most of all, it is a love story and a morality play about trust and appearances, which ends depressingly. It is very moving at times, maybe too moving given the events of recent weeks. Prepare to be depressed - if you are not ready for that, do not expect to enjoy the film.To give viewers a "warning" if you will, here is what you can expect. Expect cinematography that is of the documentary/8mm-esque type, reminiscent of "28 Days Later" - you know, that "low-budget" digital video that is all the rage. Expect very thick British accents - you will expend great cognitive effort just to understand the dialogue. Expect a very non-linear and slow-moving story, one that takes you in one direction and yanks you 180 to the next. This is even more a study of relationships and how well you know someone, than it is a murder mystery.Again, very deep character development and a smart film...but enjoyable? Perhaps not so much.</fullReview>

Almost all of the reviews I read focused on the plot and acting -- the SF Chronicle's Mick LaSalle did say: "For the flashbacks, director Fernando Meirelles employs a hand-held camera, but subtly, not ostentatiously, as if to suggest subliminally the shaky and fragile nature of memory." Not subtle at all -- and if that was the only time that a hand-held camera was used, it might have been OK -- my guess is that at least 60% of the film was shot that way. Watching it on a big screen will make you dizzy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies where you should take the lower-digit votes seriously.There is precious little action, lots of conversation, and the newly-resuscitated stand-by message-movie formula of "Big Bad Corporation vs. helpless little people) that is certain to capture IMDb voting much like gay-themed films are an absolute certainty to grab Oscar nominations. The movie-makers caught on to audience gullibility quite awhile ago.The cinematography of expansive areas of Africa is indeed beautiful. However, this you can get from a nice IMAX film and probably twice as big.Ralph Fiennes (as Justin Quayle) plays Ralph Fiennes (i.e. himself) playing another ordinary, quiet academic who serves in the British High Commission, whatever that is. And Rachel Weitz shows she's a much better actress than she showed in the two "Mummy" movies. Yes, this isn't saying much. But she's sure to get votes for playing a strong feminist character raised in an affluent family. Or she'll get votes for being a playful pregnant nude in a gratuitous scene thrown in to show, I guess, that her marriage to the Fiennes character was a sexy one.The expository part of the film lasts ... well, the WHOLE FILM! As such, the ending is likely to disappoint. For a movie intended to be about values, one must question what the director and writer was thinking when they created(?) the ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>* spoilers *British diplomatic bureaucrat Justin Quail meets young vivacious feminine sexy but crybaby Tessa while he is lecturing to a group of students. Justin and Tessa have a one night stand, and run off to Africa together. Tessa becomes politically active with her big black hunk friend Arnold which makes Justin jealous. Tessa is working with Arnold to uncover some corruption in big pharma corruption in Kenya. Tessa is murdered. Justin follows the trail and find out just how empty his life is without Tessa.This movie was based all on true things that are happening in the world, more or less, but the characters are so blah, and they come to such a bad end that you hardly care, or you might want to look around the theater to see who is watching you and taking notes there is such paranoia in this thing.In fact, I wonder if this is the new brainwashing for people to become politically bored and apathetic. The message seems to be that you altruistic sort can get the bad guys but it will cost you your life, and is it really worth dying to save some nameless faceless African kids?No, of course not, stay home and leave politics to the businessmen like good little sheep.The movie is bloody awful, but it is bloody awful in a very sensitive and artful way that doesn't really hit you until after you have left the theater. Why do all the bad guys live these great lives in stately country clubs with solemn ceremonies, while the good guys are always scrambling and getting killed of and beaten up and threatened? These days when the good guys win it is usually a cartoon or something way over the top ... the word for cinema in our age is dark, gloomy, and viral, in other words the ideas and inspiration it gives people is bad or non-existent.The movie was cliché, even in death far worse things happen to the poor black Africans and the African actors. Blacks are treated like minorities even in African movies, oh and they all have AIDS and typhoid. Still, it would not be easy to sit through this movie if not for the actors, and the scenery.This movie is nothing exceptional in my book anyway, but it was fairly entertaining.</fullReview>

I can get better thrills watching the evening news - actually this was kind of like watching a long, drawn out, boring newscast.The characters were bland. There was no spark between them at all.The story was transparent - no surprises at all.The scenery was fine - kind of made me want to go visit Africa just to see some of these things.I'm sure in about 6 months you can ask anyone who saw this movie what they will remember about it and you will get a lot of puzzled looks. In 6 months time they probably won't even remember the movie....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually Astounding but Falls Flat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Constant Gardner has been given rave reviews during the past few weeks, with some critics claiming it to be the best picture of the year. Needless to say, that kind of feedback can create interest in even a movie-hater's mind. However, when leaving the film I found myself to be rather disappointed. I love a complex plot. There is nothing like a movie that makes you think. However, the story here is SO complex that it dilutes the importance of the drug in reference. In fact the conspiracy plot line is referenced in such a subtle method that I never cared on way or another if Ralph Fiennes went through with it. The only part of the script that I could identify with was the blind jealousy that haunts Fiennes for half of the movie. The other portion of the film that really turned me off was the beginning. The love story was so uneventful that I would rather have cut out the first half hour, opened the movie up with her funeral and moved forward from there. If there was need for some character information and development the scenes that were cut could have created very powerful flashbacks. I felt no need for the film to indulge in the pregnancy angle. The movie wasn't built around it and it didn't follow through to the end. Pointless. However, the saving graces of the film were the astounding performances and the stunning photography. While the love scenes themselves were dull and uninspired the performances of Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weiscz were incredible and were the only reasons why those scenes were watchable. Both performers main evented in this film. Finally the photography. Gorgeous use of color and composition. The camera here is used, not as a canvas to watch a film, but as a window into a reality that may reflect our own in the coming years. However, besides those two elements the movie falls flat. With a film containing such important content you would think the filmmakers could be more effective relaying that content back to its audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film with powerful performances but no real heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think in this day and age we sometimes go to the movies with this clandestine idea that some movies are good for us. Especially foreign films. If Alec Guiness proved anything by playing Obi-Wan Kenobi, a British accent can make any amount of bad dialog, and half hearted plot points sound like their Shakespeare. Monty Python made a career of making fart jokes seem ivy league. As an American I've always found British cultural to be a bit high brow. Fernando Meirelles new film THE CONSTANT GARDENER is a highbrow film that pretends to be good for you, but in the end is all together cheesy.Ralph Fiennes plays Justin Quayle a British diplomat who falls for Tessa (Rachel Weisz) a young student who becomes his wife. When she is found dead on the side of the road brutally murdered Justin uncovers a mystery that challenges his friendships, and threatens his life. What was Tessa involved in? Was she having an affair with a young doctor? Who's involved in her murder? Was it an accident? All these questions will be answered. But I didn't buy the story at all. So no amount of platitudes for the direction and acting could ever let me recommend it.Because the film is half baked. It's got brilliant performances, tight and interesting direction and editing, it's timely, and it has a polish and sheen of an Oscar caliber film. But I kept asking myself why? Why go through the trouble of crafting such an intricate mystery, only to bungle it with a half hearted and empty ending. The film does a great job of showing some of the horrors that are going on in Africa and then ends on this note of preachy self-righteousness.I could rave about the performances for a whole page. Fiennes and Weisz are fantastic. Their chemistry works so well, almost too well. Weisz is now becoming one of my most favorite actresses because she picks parts that have a lot of meat on them. She could probably do a bunch of romantic comedies and be the British answer to Julia Roberts but hopefully she will chose not too. Because there is an Academy Award waiting out there for her if she could just get the right part.As for Fiennes he always great. I wanted to watch him in this film. Had THE CONSTANT GARDENER been a movie more about the relationship and romance between Justin and Tessa I would have embraced it. I would have praised the film because this is the only thing the film gets right. But alas, the story gets in the way, and we're bogged down with content that supposed timely and important. We get a mystery that depends on so many people, the film has so many small characters we have to try and keep track of, and the conspiracy that is involved in the film is so convoluted and in the end it so mundane. That you're left wonder just what was the point? I left the theater saying to myself "Who cares?" If I wanted to be preached at about the horrors of corporations and how they're killing the third world, I'd go to a DNC Meeting or turn on Air America.A film can be timely. A film can build a mystery. A film can even attempt to showcase the horror in the world around us. In the case of THE CONSTANT GARDNER a focus on human passion and heart was sorely missed. Many people will like this film, they will praise it for what they perceive to be there. But at the end of the day this is a film with powerful performances but no real heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow, boring, predicable and preachy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie would never end. The plot is a thinly disguised disinformation piece about how westerners, and particularly large drug companies, are taking advantage of Africans out of greed. No anti-western and anti-business cliché is omitted, and they are trotted out in a monotonously predictable fashion. Though the movie takes for-e-ver to plod through its torpid paces, there is no mystery here about how it will come out, or why. There are no plot twists, no startling denouements, nothing even mildly surprising. Endless camera shots--closeup and wide angle--of African poverty is supposed to give this movie higher meaning, but that motif has been done so much more effectively--and realistically--in other movies, like Hotel Rwanda, where the suffering is palpable. Here it is just a vehicle for carrying the movie's anti-western message. The love story between Fiennes and Weisz is barely believable. Fiennes plods his way through another romance with all the spark of a Basset Hound, while Weisz plays the overwrought uber-vixen. These two people have nothing in common, as becomes pretty clearly early in the movie. Fortunately, she gets bumped off early but, unfortunately, insists on reappearing in flashbacks.The ending is pathetic and pointless. Surely a smart guy like the Fiennes character is supposed to be can find a better way of publicizing the story than going to the middle of nowhere to get butchered--like maybe faxing the secret letter to the London Times. These kind of plot-holes--or more accurately plod-holes--are typical for the movie as a whole which has builds one implausibility on top of another. Like why would a savvy politician Luke Pellegrin *write* a letter like that? And why would Woodrow leave Tessa with the letter and trust her to lock it up, if it was that critical to his career?The film's only redeeming feature is the gorgeous photography of scenery and wildlife, but that's been done before too, and need not be endured in a film that is so poorly constructed and hits you over the head with propaganda in almost every scene. The sad truth is that there is exploitation of Africa documented in this movie, and it consists of the people who use the scenery and poverty of Africa to make this sorry excuse of a movie--for their own fame and profit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I went into this movie expecting a thriller...oh was I mistaken. Does switching to and from different periods in time for the characters really count as action, for some movies yes, for this one NO! In this case, if the movie is not good enough to show straight through, then maybe it shouldn't be shown at all. The only "thrills" come far too late in the movie and involve a brief scene in a crosswalk and an attack in Kenya. Although the main characters do deliver a decent performance, they can not even bring much spice to this rather slow movie. Sure the scenery is nice, but that gets old.</fullReview>

Real original, especially the bad guy who looked so thin he could be dead or in Thinner. Escpically liked the parts where we saw the commercials for the drug company - if they wanted to make a point, the ads should have had more warm and fuzzy pictures in them, like families playing together, father and sons hugging, kittens, etc. Bad bad movie that could have been much more. From the reviews, it could have been good, but the shaky camera work was overdone, acting was actually very good, story was really weak, and the crap about Iraq in the beginning was not necessary.

		<fullReview>Aptly named, The Constant Gardener specializes in that staple of all ardent horticulturists, prime steer manure. Oliver Stoned would be proud. Gardener makes JFK looked like a legitimate documentary by comparison. With a plot so preposterous and convoluted that only the most obsessed devotee of limousine liberal preachiness could abide it, it depicts drug companies and their evil triplet cohorts, drug testing firms and African politicians, as premeditated murderers of innocents for profit. Nevermind that deliberately marketing a product that kills the user would be an instant recipe for bankruptcy, the writer feels compelled to manipulate the disenchantment and suspicions of his audience with this most obvious stereotypical absurdity. This film is a perfect example of why movie theater attendance is down 12% this summer. The cinematography is abhorrent; grainy, with color tones hybridized from Salvador Dali and leftovers from a food fight, and the now familiar tedious, trendy jerky camera movements of a palsy victim. The lead characters, played well by Weisz and Fiennes, take the Oscars for irritating repugnance and insipidity, respectively. Her early martyrdom comes as a welcome relief, while his futile finale is much too long in coming. When will screenwriters learn not to use entertainment as a megaphone for their pet political philosophies? The only thing that will save this one is a rototiller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too vague</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a huge fan of the Clive Owen/Angelina Jolie movie Beyond Borders, I expected and wanted to like The Constant Gardner, which is based on a quite similar premise. Unfortunately the latter movie almost completely failed to engage me in any way. Throughout the movie we are never told enough about what's going on to instill in us any kind of excitement, and the plot seemed propelled by lame hints about unfaithfulness. Then the black guy was oh-so-conveniently gay, and Rachel Weisz' character an unblemished angel after all. Dull, dull, super-dull!The plot about the evil pharmaceutical corporation likewise failed to convince. The movie had its heart in the right place, and as a liberal I was more than open to the apparent message, but every part of it was just too vague. Hurriedly, we are shown that the drug being tested is the only hope against a new TB epidemic that will kill a third of the world's population in the next century - well, if that's the case, wasn't it bloody well *worth* it to test it on a few innocent (oh, and by the way, deathly sick) people in order to save so much of the world later?? I don't know, because the movie never gets around to any kind of clarity about these things. It is apparently just about the emotional impact of what happens, whereas the facts and the explanations were downplayed. Bad move. Because now we effectively have no idea what the relevance of this plot to the real world is, if any.The acting, generally, was all right, but Ralph Fiennes' character was distant and naive and lacked resolve. Nor did he have any impression of what the status of his and Rachel Wiesz' character's marriage was like - he seemed like a blank slate with no personality.Funnily, the overall love theme of the movie completely mirrored the 5-minute H&amp;M commercial that preceded it. We had a woman crying about her dead lover and letting herself be killed so they could be together in death. Exactly as what ended up happening in the movie, only with the genders reversed. Maybe that's one more reason I find it difficult to take this movie seriously.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie both promising and disappointing.I regard all the comments about the excellent performances by Weisz and Fiennes ... and indeed the entire cast ... as being entirely accurate. The cinematography was excellent, the scenery intriguing.What overwhelmed all these fine features for me was the Conspiracy Motif blending with the human interest &amp; drama features in what was for me a very unworkable mix.I'm not against Conspiracy movies as such. The Manchurian Candidate and any number of action movies make wonderful and exemplary films in this genre. A really tight, action-filled thriller like some of Le Carre's other film adaptations would have worked perfectly well here.But this is a movie that on the one hand is slow and wistful and slyly intriguing in the way a good human drama story can be; and yet that story is simply overwhelmed by the Conspiracy ... and without faster pace and action really spoils the latter for me. Sort of like the worst of the Oliver Stone movies.In general, then, I say thumbs down. But if you go, you'll find the acting wonderful and the scenes wonderful and if you can ignore the plot, perhaps worth a few hours of your time.</fullReview>

Instead a concept, evil big business and its "handmaiden" big government is clumsily portrayed as bogeymen. In fact, even the positive characters are never developed. Plot twists are clumsily handled. Characters survive who would have effortlessly been murdered by the "bad guys." It strains credibility.

The movie would have been much better if Tessa and Justin never had a relationship beyond just friends, and certainly never got married so abruptly. The ending would have had to change drastically and instead of some poor sod giving up on life and essentially killing himself, we could have had a stronger Justin and an ending that gave some satisfaction of victory to the audience.The acting is lethargic and the ending is Small, disjointed and depressing.</fullReview>

In the first ten minutes of the film, the message was anti-Iraq, pro-UN, anti-administration. If I wanted all this, I could have stayed home and watched CNN. The political message had absolutely nothing to do with the plot (what plot?), but the filmmakers somehow felt compelled to get their message across. Inform us, entertain us, shock us, uplift us, but leave your political axes to our elected officials, The Washington Post, The New York Times and the major media. Have you ever bothered to look at which movies do well, and which ones are flops? Any critic that awarded this movie any more than one half of one star obviously does it because they agree with the political message, not with the quality of the film. My major regret, other than paying to see this atrocity, is that I didn't walk out after ten minutes. I have never before felt a need to submit a comment on a movie.

		<fullReview>I saw this movie at a Q&amp;A (with the director) screening Sunday night in Lincoln Center. I would say it was good movie but not a great one.It seemed to me that the film was trying to do and be too many things, so the emotional impact it had on me was far less than what I think it should have been, given the basic story and quality of the performances. I never read the book, so I can't compare the film to it.I think my major problems were these: 1.The way the story is told never enabled me to really feel the level of love that was supposed to exist between ""Justin" (Ralph Fiennes) and "Tessa" (Rachel Weisz), and it was this love that was supposed to enable "Justin" to change and choose the course of action that is the center of the story- the protagonist's "quest".2.While the scenes of the conditions the Kenyans and Sudanese (I believe that a later scene was shot in Sudan) live under made me feel sympathy (and to some degree, guilt), there wasn't one main character who was a native of this environment- they were nameless faces who were supposed to symbolize the results of the exploitation and corruption that victimize Africa and her people. (I don't think the doctor who "Tessa" worked with was native to that area.) So, while I felt bad in the same way I would if I were watching the nightly news, it's not the same level of connection I would feel if there had been some well-defined characters- even one- who could have defined "who," as opposed to "what" "Tessa" was fighting for.Because the movie has a mystery element to it, "Tessa's" full motives, by virtue of both the narrative form and needs, retains a degree of mystery, and to me, this made her character seem somewhat aloof, underdeveloped and one-note, although I have no problem with Rachel's portrayal of her. She is quite an engaging actress; reminds me a lot of Kate Winslet .The most successful part of the film to me, despite the roadblocks I mentioned, was Ralph Fienne's beautiful performance. His work here is very internal, subtle and understated, and I found it quietly moving and powerful. Although "the too much going on" I referred to causes a competition of sorts among the elements for what the focus of the film should be- a murder mystery? A love story? An exploration and indictment of government and corporate greed being able to flourish unnoticed in Africa because nobody cares? The director's formidable skill in using flashback, visuals and sound to create auras of haunting memories, mystery, and suspense?- it is Fienne's moving portrayal of an English gentleman who experiences his emotions quietly as he pieces together what has happened that emerges from all of these vying elements as the center of this film.</fullReview>

In order for a political story to be told as a story and not a documentary, (such as Michael Moore's "Bowling For Columbine" or "Farenheit 9/11")it must have inheritally in it a massive metaphor or other literary device in order for the story to be interesting for the viewer. Such as Orwell's "Animal Farm" or "1984" which used literary devices to tell political stories, or Stanley Kubrick's "Dr Strangelove" or even "Spartacus", you could go even far as George Romero's "Living Dead" series. All of which offered up political themes but yet weren't so straight forward as to become boring or repetitive as this story was. If you would like to do a story like this so politically themed than please don not be so straight forward about it and use some literary devise in order to bring some good beautiful storytelling, because after all we go to the movies to see beautiful stories not hippies on soap boxes barking out what we should think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Politics of Guilt and Pity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My "Summary" is the title of a 1970 book by a reformed Theonomist: Rousas John Rushdoony, wherein he tackles politics from a post-millennial perspective. It was providential that I found this book in our church library the weekend I saw this movie. It is a post-modernist classic. I quote: "The roots of guilt are personal and racial; the consequences are social as well"..... Did LeCarre' read Rushdoony? I trow not; the book's themes are Biblical and therefore universal, like some of the themes explored superficially in "Gardener". The movie picks easy targets for pity and guilt and exploits them shamelessly. How were the African extras paid and treated in "Gardener"? Interesting, too, (incidentally) that "City of God" is the title of a book written about 1800 years ago by Augustine, one of the "Church Fathers" embraced by the reformed. I felt manipulated by the novelist, the director, screenwriter and the characters in ways which disturbed me like the "City of God" did. I felt that "City of God" had the same problems in pacing, editing, acting and special effects, now magnified out of proportion in "Gardener". Meirelles owes Spielberg, Tarantino and Stone: Big Time. I founds his gratuitous violence and nudity offensive. Rachel Weisz, like Nicole Kidman, has gone too far and overexposed her charms and secrets. Maybe she took a clue from other strippers-cum-actresses - like that star of "Catwoman"? Will a nude scene and a rubber belly get her an Oscar nod? By careless exploitation of minorities and the oppressed, Meirelles hopes to attain cinematic immortality. I pray not; but in this post-Christian era, he will probably be lauded to the skies by a growing audience of guilty, pitying souls....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely overrated typical Hollywood crap SPOILER ALERT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Africans in this film are simply used as cloying, manipulative emotional devices. Once again, the White People are the only ones who can save them, no African can do it. Only a young determined white woman living in the lap of luxury in a third-world country has the heart and mind to help these poor chattel who cannot help themselves. With her loyal sidekick Token Educated African Man, she sets out to single-handedly help the helpless, befriend the friendless, and defeat the feetless. The more I thought about this film the angrier it made me. There is only one African character in this film that is not either a corrupt official taking money from the rich white people, or an AIDS-ridden peasant.Unlike the previous reviewer I could not see why the featured couple in this film would be in love in the first place, especially she with him. It wasn't a painful film to watch, but it did not bear a second viewing. The now-growing-tired use of different color palettes and different film stock for different scenes was distracting, not helpful. Shooting all the Africa scenes hand-held, so that you feel you are part of the crowded teeming masses, to get that documentary feel, made me think they should have shot a documentary. This director could have benefited by watching a couple David Lean movies. This film shot with the eye of a Lawrence would have been much better. The story is the same tired conspiracy story that has been told over and over and over in every John Grisham, John Le Carre, Michael Crichton, name your hack author-based film. Oh, but wait, they filmed sequences out of chronological order. Please send your check to the William Faulkner estate, or to Quentin Tarantino (Can you say Pulp Fiction or English Patient?)Surely anyone who sees the trailer knows that the drug company is evil. How soon after the snooty, arrogant government characters are introduced does it take to figure out they are all in on the thing. The fact that it is an unconquerable conspiracy makes the infuriatingly acquiescent ending possible (We're not dead! We're all meeting in heaven, yay!), yet reading one letter at a funeral is supposed to solve everything, and everyone present is supposed to know how damaging it is, enough for a politician to make it very obvious how important it is by fleeing. This was ridiculous, unbelievable and completely contrived Hollywood ending crap. If George W. Bush can deny lying about all the things he lied about over and over and over in debates, appearances, and press conferences, to get us into Iraq and have us stay there, it makes scenes like the end of this movie, the "dramatic comeuppance scene" all the more laughable. Politicians are liars by trade, such a simple little confrontation would be easily damage-controlled and covered up or simply denied. Unless the news media regularly cover the funerals of minor British diplomats serving in Africa. Like the rest of the film, not bloody likely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This incredibly slow paced and never go anywhere movie was one of those unpalatable, get-me-out-of-this-theater-I'm-falling-asleep productions that my wife drags me to every now and then. Ralph Fieness' over-the-top portrayal of the ridiculously tolerant poor sole dominated husband with a nauseating "Yes Dear" attitude, ridiculous over and over again teeth flashing smile shots (a la Tom Cruise's constant big fake white paint teeth shots) of euphoria towards his loving (?) (i.e. over dominating)wife in nearly every scene and the incessant running his hands through his hair feigning perplexity is sooooo old hat now. Incredibly boring and can only appeal to the most naive female audience. In general this movie put me on the edge of my seat - not with intrigue but in readiness to beat the crowds of women dragging their own bored spouses to the exit when it was finally mercifully over! It may appeal to the woman audience who fantasize about a puppy dog mate to trample over but - get real! The movie should be renamed "The Constantly Boring".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a terrible movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie The Constant Gardener is truly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The only reason I did not walk out in the middle, is that I believed the reviews it got. I kept thinking it was going to get better. I did not believe in either of the main characters. Tess seemed like a very unlovable person, in fact this character came off as a very selfish individual, despite the fact that the audience was constantly told what a great and lovable person she was. We were also bombarded with the notion that she was incredibly sexy, well if a naked 9 months pregnant woman does it for you then more power to you. Her husband, played by Ralph Fiennes, should have been called doormat. The shaky camera effect was nauseating at times and I literally had to look away. In addition there were gratuitous violent scenes, apparently to spice up the film. The lady next to me was nodding off, and my partner and I yawning. It obviously didn't work! I must say I felt duped. If you want to see a movie about real love - then I would suggest "Mrs. Brown" with Mel Gibson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's face it....these politically motivated movie directors waste good talent trying to score points with a microscopic segment of society, abandoning hope of appealing to the remainder (those that might actually fork over some money to see the film).This is one of those movies. Fiction -- with a stab at everyone not living a dirt poor existence in Africa. A pretty girl is supposed to be involved in sexual trysts. Suggestions abound, but nothing sexy to lead the viewer to believe it. Rumors -- in a movie -- are worse than rumors in the lobby. Good try, no cigar -- save your money, wait for it to make the cable rotation. There, it will stay awhile.Grade: C</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm getting tired of movies like this that I'm "supposed to like." This movie is BORING!!!!! It's also shot in a style where the characters show little emotion, the plot's way too involved and, frankly, not very interesting. I suppose if I watched 20 movies a week, as the national movie critics do, I might find this interesting because it's different. But I don't watch 20 movies a week, and when I go to the theater I like to be entertained. It's time to rebel against pieces of crap like this. I did my part and walked out of the theater. I wish I could have done even more and never spent my money on this garbage. As it is, all I can do is warn others about this snoozefest.</fullReview>

Both of my friends fell asleep and during one of the thirteen million times I decided to look around the theater because I was so bored, I noticed everyone pretty much felt the same way.Just when the plot starts to build and you think something exciting is going to happen, it doesn't. You're left feeling empty every time and it's painful because you don't know how much more you can take.All in all, the acting was good, the direction was interesting, but the plot and pace killed it.

		<shortDescription>Boring mess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years I have come to think of Peter Travers as the most clueless movie critic in the media. When I see a rave review by him, I am forewarned. He raved about this movie. I was forewarned. I went anyway. Foolish me. This movie was bad on almost every level. Maybe every level. It was shot in a cinema verite way that was trying to be artistic but only succeeded in being annoying. It was long, boring and had such a fizzle of a payoff that I would have felt cheated if I hadn't given up hope for this mess long before the ending. The message part of the movie was slathered on with a trowel and akin to those World Help ads that you see on Sundays on TV. The movie handled it's delivery so poorly that I was on the side of the evil drug companies and beginning to think that maybe Mugabe has a point. As opposed to the English Patient which had the more discerning in the audience screaming at Feinnes, "Die already", this movie had me wanting to scream, "Kill him already." And I won't spoil it by telling you if they did or not. It's spoiled long, long before you find out one way or another anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak mystery/thriller with mediocre direction by the man who made City of God</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disappointing followup to the exhilarating City of God. I can appreciate some of what The Constant Gardener tries to do. It wants to put a spotlight on the way the West exploits Africa. But it gets too bogged down in an overcomplicated and only moderately interesting mystery-thriller. I'm not too big on mysteries or thrillers myself, and I often find movies with this much plot entirely boring. And I was fairly bored during most of The Constant Gardener. It's just too busy moving. Yes, it is good once in a while when it concentrates on the protagonist's character, but those moments are few and far between. Ralph Fiennes is a remarkable actor, but his talents have not been used to their full since The English Patient. He brings as much to the lead as he can between all the shaky camera-work. And even when I said above that I like what it is trying to do with Africa, I kind of lied. Well, I do like what it is attempting to do, but it is mostly unsuccessful. The film still depicts the Africans as less important than the Europeans, I think. Every time Ralph Fiennes lands in a new African country, Meirelles has to have the natives dance and sing for the whites. Anyway, the film is not entirely worthless, but it isn't very good, either. What it certainly is is forgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>plot flaws mar beautiful production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, the production is wonderful. Really special.However, there are a few basic plot elements that are so stupid that they detract from the film. Specifically, the supposedly mysterious deed that is slowly uncovered doesn't hold water, and also was so easily guessed that I was waiting for there to be more. Additionally the main character's decision to end up where he ended up seemed unrealistic to me, especially given the issues that still need to be addressed regarding the "mystery" in the plot. I don't know the book so that I don't know if these plot elements were in the book itself, or if the screen play left things out. It is hard to believe that Le Carre would do so badly in plot construction.I strongly recommend "City of God" to see a much better (true) story done by the same director and photographer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Constantly Boring Gardener</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's my capsule review of "The Constant Gardener" "The Bourne Identity Goes to Africa and Leaves Behind All the Chase/Fight Scenes and A-Level Scriptwriters" I went to this movie based on its 78% Tomatometer rating (http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/constant_gardener/) and quickly realized that it was a combination of political grandstanding and Oscar-grubbing at the expense of entertainment.If you're still interested in watching this movie, be warned: It is not a "thriller" by any means. It's definitely "Oscar caliber" but that doesn't make it good. It's pretty much your standard evil-corporation conspiracy movie, except the scriptwriters took care to calibrate it perfectly in the sights of the Academy and strip away anything that might distract the Academy voters like action or comedy or plot exposition. You could almost see the checklists going through the head: 1) British actors. Can't have those vulgar colonials messing up our movies. British people sound smarter than the rest of us, which rubs off on your movie.2) Relevant news issue "fictionalized" for our consumption. (See The Interpreter). Who needs an ad campaign or scriptwriters when you've got stuff happening in the real world 3) Complete Absence of Action or Comedy. Oscar-winning movies transcend entertainment.4) Steadicams and Crazy Camera Angles. Motion sickness means good movies.5) Obligatory Anti-Bush Screed. In the first 20 minutes of the film. Remember, the war in Iraq is bad and the UN is good. THE WAR IN IRAQ WAS WRONG AND THE UN IS GOOD. END OF STORY.Fernando Meirelles could have made a thriller with emotion - Paul Greengrass did it with Bourne Supremacy and Doug Liman did it with Mr. And Mrs. Smith. Instead, he chose to push the "Liberal Guilt" button until it broke. How many more movies do we need to see about evil white people ravaging non-white countries for their own benefit? Hasn't this been done before? Why does it take 2 hours and 10 minutes of our time for us to uncover what is clear as day? We all know who the bad guy is. There's no mystery after the first 30 minutes of the film. After that, I found myself looking at my watch. I fond that too much time had gone by without anything to break the monotony, which is a VERY BAD THING in a movie that is billed as a "thriller". There's nothing thrilling about a movie that has no action. It's even less thrilling to endure 2 hours and 10 minutes of plot being advanced slowly and lugubriously by people talking.I don't pay $9.00 to watch people talking to one another. I can get that at home for free. I pay for spectacle and I was getting a travelogue narrated by people I didn't particularly care for because they didn't do anything at all! I haven't even touched on the lack of realism in this film. Basically it's about an evil drug company that's somehow got the British Government on its side, leaving dead bodies all over Africa. Probably the most offensive part about Fernando Meirelles' story is that it portrays corporations and intelligence agencies as one-dimensional omniscient/omnipotent killers. Here's news for you, chump - You are not Rev. Pat Robertson. Having people killed is harder than it looks on Mission: Impossible. Naturally all the people important to the plot survive, despite the apparent ease which the villain dispatches its enemies. In fact, the hero gets captured by henchmen who rough him up as some sort of warning to keep his mouth shut, despite the obvious conflict between leaving someone alive and expecting them to be quiet.Bottom line: I would be pleasantly surprised if a portion of this film's profits went to a good cause, because only a true Hollywood executive can appropriate a "good cause" in the name of his shareholders.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What movie did I watch?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm trying to figure this movie out. So far, all I've heard are high praise and rave reviews, and then when I sit down to watch it, it has no redeeming qualities at all! It's like everyone else saw a different version than me or something! Am I wrong? All of seven people were in the theater with me on the night after the movie opened, and four of them fell asleep. The movie is just over two hours long but feels like three or four.Don't get me wrong--this movie had potential. Had more been done with some of the elements it could have been okay. But in the end everything about it seemed hollow. The writer seems to have just piled some bad romance novels into a pot full of human suffering and cooked this sad stew for about an hour.The last hour or so is like a scavenger hunt. Guy goes to place A, talks to person B, learns that he should in fact be in place C. Goes to place C, talks with person D, learns that he needs to head to place E. Rinse and repeat.What is the climax of the movie? Does it even have one? Just because it's political doesn't mean it can skip the necessary elements of a story. This movie was probably envisioned as a joke--the writer probably wrote the worst story he could imagine, tacked on a bunch of starving faces, and went to the publisher. Geez, these critics would give any movie an incredible review if it has a scene of an African village full of starving people.Overall, this movie is simply not what the reviews are calling it. There's a banner on the right of my screen right now that says it's a thriller. There is not one thrill in the whole movie aside from the moment when the credits roll and you can leave.Don't see it unless you need a $9.50 sedative.</fullReview>

But let's not paint with such a broad brush.The acting is atrocious. Fiennes is supposed to be a career diplomat; yet, for the first half of the movie, he acts like an moron who can only deal with plants: goofy grins, mugging, etc. Weisz is the most annoying actress on the planet, next to Sandra Bullock.

		<shortDescription>The Constant Gardener</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Constant Gardener, is based on the novel of the same name by John Le Carre. The film is about Justin Quayle, a member of the British High Commission finds out that his wife Tessa, has been found dead while in Northern Kenya, and her driver had escaped the scene. To find out what really happened to her Justin, goes to Kenya to find out but a plot involving a new medicine and a lot of secrets gets in the way and may lead to the answer to her death. The Constant Gardener, is boring and I didn't care about any of the characters, the film has a really bad pace which starts off really slow and tries to build up steam near the end but it never really works, the film often felt flat and like it had no emotions, the direction is blurry and muddled, the film is also confusing and frustrating and the movie runs on for way too long. I was very bored with this movie and it did not keep my curiosity or interest at all. After awhile I just wanted this movie to end so I could leave the theater. This is an instantly forgettable movie and a pretty big flop and I do not see why some critics like this movie as much as they did. Perhaps they saw a different movie than I did because what I saw wasn't good at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tried to watch The Constant Gardener in a preview show tonight. I say try, because the camera work was so jumpy. Even in a scene in an apartment with two people talking to each other, the focus went in and out and you got distracted by watching the door-frame go from the top of the screen to six or seven inches below. As if this was not enough, it then proceeded to go from side to side. The scene of the train sped from station, to bridge, to tunnel, to trestle, to bridge to trestle, to tunnel, enough to make my cast-iron stomach do flip flops. Add this to the flashbacks that kept occurring with no rhyme or reason or explanation. It could have been a great movie. Hiding somewhere in the middle of all this jumping around is a great story. What a shame it was so poorly produced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate movies that shove their "point of view" in your face without any subtlety at all. This offering is blatantly in this category. This piece of agitprop is so thinly disguised as a love story that only the most pseudo of intellectuals could take it seriously. Rachel Weisz, whose performance is outstanding, plays a younger anti-war protester to Ralph Feinnes' British diplomat. She disrupts a speech he is giving in defense of British involvement in Iraq. She is so charming as she interrupts his speech that he knows he must marry her and take her to Africa. The film unfolds backwards from her death. The focus of her march to death revolves around the evil pharmaceutical conglomerates who are pushing lethal drugs on hapless Africans. The drug companies have no choice but to put out a contract on her. As Justin sifts through the clues, he comes to the conclusion that he must carry on and finish her work. The film is visually stunning, but the constant moralizing detracts from this. A religious film, uttering the unbearably didactic nonsense that these two characters engage in would be rounded on quickly and firmly. There is no anti-American stone left that is not picked up by Director Meirelles and hurled into the ether. In one of the film's more unintentionally funny moments, Weisz demands to know why Britain thwarted the peaceful progress of the U.N. in Iraq. Feinnes should have come back with: How many UN resolutions did Saddam ignore? How about 47. And to hold up the UN as a bastion of reason and competence is ridiculous. The UN will not confront African dictators like Robert Mugabe who will steal and let die their own people. Feinnes has no comeback to any of Weisz's verbal harangues, making one wonder what his qualifications for his job really were. He later opines that big pharmaceuticals are the real "axis of evil." Au Contraire! The plot holes are numerous: Why doesn't Weisz send her incriminating evidence to The New York Times, CBS, CNN, who will jump on any anti-Bush wagon they can get on? While the film focuses on evil drug companies testing for TB and AIDS in countries with large portions of populations infected with these diseases,the truth is something else. Large progressive organizations have argued just the opposite, that large drug companies have not been testing drugs in these countries. Two years ago The Guardian published reports protesting the unfair treatment of African test subjects who are forced to wait until a drug is approved by their government before they continue taking it. The Guardian also complained that many of these people received a placebo instead of the trial drug after non-human tests showed the drug to be effective. So which is it? Are the drug companies evil for giving Third World patients developmental drugs, or for withholding them? Also offensive is the snide, but undeveloped theme that the problems in Africa are the US's fault, and give African dictatorships like Robert Mugabe a free ride. The slaughter of thousands of innocent Rwandans was not the fault of the US; relief workers extorting sex from children as young as four wasn't the fault of the US; Mugabe's blocking of aid and stealing from his people was not the fault of the US. See Hotel Rwanda for a more accurate picture of what happened and leave this turkey alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the director and the script were a bad match.The dynamic shooting style that he so brilliantly applied to City of God feels inappropriate in service of this rather conventional, overlong, dialogue-driven international thriller.Extreme camera angles and moves are favored over acting and interpersonal drama. These are great actors, but they've been better in other movies. I don't think the director is quite up to the task of directing a mature, "adult" film.And the script is a bit of a mess as well. Too much preachy, naive &amp; on-the-nose dialogue. And the dialogue is doing too much of the dramatic heavy lifting: too much of the crucial action is off-screen or merely referred to in dialogue instead of SHOWN On screen! It felt like a rough draft of what could have been a much better script.Fiennes' character is not very well defined, so when the movie shifts from being her story to his, we're not attached enough to him to care.And there is no real suspense or mystery to his journey: we already pretty much know everything there is to reveal.This leads to an insufferably boring and overlong second half.So much talent here, but mismatches and an underdeveloped script sink it.Don't buy the self-important ads, this one doesn't deliver.</fullReview>
