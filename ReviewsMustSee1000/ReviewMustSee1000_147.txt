		<shortDescription>A Beautiful, Bloody Ghost Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The year is 1939. The Spanish Civil War is nearing its bloody end. Ten year old Carlos, the orphaned son of a slain Republican, is left by his tutor at an isolated orphanage for boys. The school is destitute, barely able to provide enough food for the children, but headmistress Carmen and Dr. Casares do the best they can. Carlos accepts his fate bravely, but there are still school bullies to contend with, an unexploded bomb sitting in the courtyard as a constant reminder of the war which still rages, and an abusive caretaker named Jacinto who has his own secret agenda. As if that were not enough, a ghost begins stalking Carlos, the ghost of a boy named Santi whose demise is shrouded in mystery and who solemnly warns Carlos that many will soon die. As the war begins closing in on the orphanage, violence erupts within and Santi's prediction comes sadly true. But the worst has not yet happened. The abandoned boys must band together if they hope to survive, and the dead will aid their cause if they are to be avenged.This is a beautiful movie, absolutely gorgeous from start to finish. The dusty, isolated landscape is a ghost itself and the constant threat of violence - from the war, to the bullies and, of course, from the traitorous Jacinto - gives this film an unrelenting atmosphere of tension and dread. The acting is superb, from the children as well as the adults. Federico Luppi as Dr. Casares is superb, providing us with a true hero, a gentleman of class and compassion. Eduardo Noriega is perfectly cast as the despicable Jacinto, making you despise him more and more as the film progresses. This is not just a ghost story, though the figure of Santi is central and key to everything that happens. It is a tale of love and honor as well as horror and ruin. It is a coming of age story and an adult drama. It also manages to be scary as hell when it wants to be.Guillermo del Toro has made a masterpiece with "The Devils Backbone." Ten stars for this hauntingly lovely epic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than American Horror Films...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE is a Spanish language supernatural thriller. It consists of a haunted school for orphaned boys. Now, in an American film that would be all you get, a ghost running around scaring the young inhabitants of the gloomy building. That's it, and it would not be scary at all. It is to the credit that the makers of THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE present the actual ghost as the least frightening aspect of the film; he becomes, in fact, the moral center of a deeply complex story.In Spain, the year is 1939 and Franco's army is advancing towards the small village where the most notable landmark is an impotent bomb jutting out of the ground in the center of the town. A child, Carlos (Fernando Tielve), his father's life taken in the bloody civil war, finds refuge with the Leftist caretakers of the school. Not a good place to be around at that time. He finds himself under the wing of Prof. Casares (Fererico Luppi), a strange intellectual who fears the oncoming dirge of Franco's forces. There is also some intrigue involving the caretaker Jacinto (Edvardo Noriega) and the revolution's small supply of gold. Oh, right and there is a troubled spirit of one of the dead children creeping through the bowls of the school, uttering ominous warnings to young Carlos ("Many of you will die.")...It is one of the strongest elements of THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE that it does not become distracted by the ghost story, I mean what is one ghost compared to the very real fears of war, death, greed, abandonment, political persecution, abuse at the hands of adults, lust, and acceptance. A spirit cannot hurt us, it does not exist on the same plain of the living. His life has ended and he can no longer be troubled by the reality the characters face. A bullet or explosion wil not penetrate his flesh, he no longer feels pain. The boys who survive him are those who have to struggle for their small place on this earth.The film paints in detailed strokes and does not cut corners when it comes to the emotions involved in the plot. The characters are not pawns to be startled periodically by cats or loud noises, they just happen to occupy the same space with a sad and restless dead boy.The director, Guillermo Del Toro (CRONOS, MIMIC, the better-than-the-original-but-that-ain't-saying-much BLADE 2), handles the material very well, never losing sight of the story he has set out to tell. The metaphors he uses (the bomb, the pool, the contents of the jars) are rich and creative. Del Toro, along with his crew and actors, create moments of intense fear and unsettling action; the musical score, by Javier Navarette, is particularly effective. The film is dark and gloomy (perhaps overly so at times), but never succumbs to the easy answers in the shadows. As for the American films it will be compared to: THE OTHERS-not scary, THE RING-not scary, DARKNESS FALLS-not scary...THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE is scary, complex and ultimately memorable.8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterful Spanish ghost story - an instant classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE (El Espinazo del Diablo) Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound format: Dolby DigitalDuring the Spanish Civil War, a young orphan boy (Fernando Tielve) is sent to an isolated boarding school where he encounters the ghost of a murdered child (Junio Valverde) who warns him of impending disaster...A masterpiece. Filmed in Spain by writer-director Guillermo del Toro following his unhappy Hollywood debut (MIMIC), this spellbinding melodrama works both as an examination of the political turmoil which characterized the Spanish Civil War, and as a simple ghost story in which a tragic spirit seeks vengeance for a terrible crime. Employing restless camera-work and atmospheric set designs to their best advantage, del Toro visualizes his own script (co-written with Antonio Trashorras and David Mu?oz) as the story of a vulnerable child cast adrift in a strange new world, where he must contend not only with everyday problems (such as the school bully, Ínigo Garcés, whose motives are rather more complex than they first appear), but also his frequent encounters with the unhappy ghost, some of which are genuinely unsettling (watch out for the heart-stopping sequence in which Tielve is besieged in a closet by the enraged phantom).Production values are first-class throughout, ranging from César Macarrón's evocative art direction and Salvador Mayolas' ultra-creepy sound design, through to Luis de la Madrid's crisp editing skills and Javier Navarrete's unforgettable music score. Visual effects and makeup designs are also superb, though deliberately underplayed for maximum emotional effect. The cast is toplined by Spanish movie veterans Marisa Paredes (a favorite of Pedro Almodóvar) and Federico Luppi (CRONOS), and there are impressive turns by Irene Visedo as a young woman whose loyalties are divided by circumstances, and rising star Eduardo Noriega (the Spanish equivalent of Brad Pitt) as Visedo's boyfriend, an orphan-turned-caretaker whose volatile nature leads to a dramatic conclusion, with appalling consequences for everyone around him. Tielve is magnificent as the wide-eyed innocent at the center of the narrative, and Garcés is every bit his equal as the bully who reclaims his dignity during a climactic showdown with the forces of evil. Released around the same time as THE OTHERS (2001) - another Spanish ghost story, filmed in English as a vehicle for Nicole Kidman - THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE was consigned to Art-house distribution by virtue of its status as a subtitled movie and suffered a comparative loss at the US box-office, though del Toro's magical fever dream is unquestionably the better of the two films.(Spanish dialogue)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poetry on screen - A classic Ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people think horror is about busty teens and young rebels being picked off by mysterious killers or lots of gore from a made up creature. Well this film has neither so stay away.What you do have is a stunning film with great actors playing real people with real issues. Three or four stories are interwoven perfectly, set off with great imagery...all set around the Spanish civil war and the haunting corridors of an orphanage for abandoned children.While the film does contain a ghost -the murdered child, Santi- the real horror of the film comes from the greed of certain adults who occupy the orphanage with the children.This film is intelligent poetry on screen -mortality, love, hate, jealousy, greed and redemption are all explored.This film puts many films to shame just for having a great story at it's core.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>among the best work I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great care has been taken with the art direction. You are immediately transported to 1939, with Franco's army about to descend on the Spanish countryside. Even the crumbling buildings of the boys' school the characters inhabit play a role. The actors are superb, and the child actors give award-worthy performances.This story is only incidentally a ghost story. It's a story about love and betrayal and the miseries of war visited on a people. It has a lot to teach about the depths of human cruelty, and the grace of sacrifice. It left me weeping. I don't want to label it Del Toro's masterpiece so early in his career, but it will stand through the years with his best work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dramatic, creepy and excellent overall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the impressive rating on IMDb and being intrigued by its appearance at my local video store, I finally rented this film. I'm glad that I did."Blade 2" and "Hellboy" were my only other del Toro film's to date. Obviously, the man has an eye for style and even, occasionally, atmosphere. I was particularly impressed with "Hellboy": not nearly as good as the source material, but the best comic adaptation to film in many years, including the Marvel disasters. "The Devil's Backbone" is well acted and surprisingly effective in style and atmosphere. Not quite a horror movie...but with its creepy moments nonetheless. The script is also quite good: the characters are realistic and well portrayed, and there are a lot of great plot elements (i.e. the defused bomb) that give the story layers on top of layers.My only complaint is that del Toro makes the mistake that many directors in the horror genre make: showing the monster/creature in too great a definition, and, in this case, far too early in the movie. Many directors should take a page from Ridley Scott's book: "Alien" is so scary because what you don't see of the creature, not because the little we do see of it. Still, del Toro's supernatural character is well-designed and has several haunting appearances.All in all this was a great film that works as a mystery and as a drama: the writing, direction and performances are that strong. del Toro seems to do his best work while working with his own material, let's hope he does so more in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great ghost story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a massive fan of the horror genre, but I don't like ghost stories. To me, ghost stories are a poor manifestation of the genre. It's not the idea of ghosts that's the problem, it's the way the stories are presented; often dull, slow moving and uninteresting, and those are things that do not make a good movie. However, there is an exception to every rule; and this film is the case with that one. The Devil's Backbone is a mesmerising and inventive addition to the ghost story tradition. The film moves slowly, but that is a definite advantage to it. The slow pace allows us to get to know, and even care for the characters before the horror starts, and this makes the horror all the more potent when it does start. The Devil's Backbone has been touted as 'the Spanish Sixth Sense', and although this is unfair as this is hardly a bad film; I can see where that notion is coming from. The main difference between the two, however, and the reason why this film works and Shyamalan's doesn't is that the parts between the horror here aren't boring, are well acted and serve a purpose in that they allow us to get to know the characters; Shyamalan got too caught up in trying to make his twist work and the drama in-between caught the brunt of that, rendering the film boring.The film can't really be accurately described as a 'horror film', it's more of a drama come character study with horror elements. The horror elements are pronounced, as the ghost is the centrepiece of the story, but the film doesn't focus on them enough for it to be considered horror. Entwined within it's plot is a coming of age tale, a story of revenge and a nice little section on 'what is a ghost'. I like it when a film delves into it's subject material and attempts to give something of an explanation; Return of the Living Dead did it for zombies (albeit comically), and The Devil's Backbone does it here for ghosts. The coming of age side of the story is brought to life brilliantly by some sublime acting courtesy of the young cast. Entwined within the story are themes of the kids being thrust into a situation that requires them to grow up fast, and it also sees them dealing with themes of death and revenge. One thing you will instantly notice about this film is the fantastic cinematography. The film has a gritty style, but despite this it manages to come off looking crisp and clean. There are some shots that are incredibly beautiful. All shots with the ghost, which is one of the best crafted ever, come to mind immediately but also of note are the underwater sequences, the special effects and the capture of the location. The film is set in an orphanage somewhere the Spanish desert, and this location serves the movie magnificently. The fact that it's a day's walk away from the nearest town makes the film very isolated, which allows the horror more potency. Guillermo Del Toro is an obviously talented director. He has this film under his belt, along with Cronos (which I haven't yet seen, but have heard great things), but after that it's hit and miss. Blade 2 was a good film, and a refreshing one after the lackluster first part; but Mimic wasn't very good on the whole, despite some good moments. More recently he's gone on to direct Hellboy, which again I haven't seen but it looks like another fun film. I hope Del Toro makes a return to art soon, he has the talent and it would be a shame to lose him to 'decent' films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What is a ghost?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"... As the road struck into the sierra we branched off to the right and climbed a narrow mule-track that wound round the mountain-side. The hills in that part of Spain are of a queer formation, horseshoe-shaped with flattish tops and very steep sides running down into immense ravines. On the higher slopes nothing grows except stunted shrubs and heath, with the white bones of the limestone sticking out everywhere. ..." - George Orwell, Homage to Catalonia, Chapter 2 It is unlikely that Mexican-director, Guillermo del Toro, will ever top this film, it is his greatest-achievement. While certainly a horror-film, it so-much-more, an allegory of the betrayals that led-to the rise-of-fascism in Spain. Most small-arms came-from Mexico, and Del Toro has said in-interviews that he lived-in a neighborhood populated by Republicans who had fled after-1939. Some have commented that the film takes-place after the fall of Republican Spain(the 1939 fall of Catalonia), but this is incorrect. The fall hasn't come-yet, and this free-fall state is the universe that the film inhabits. Taking-place in a Republican Orphanage for fallen-anarchists, Leftists, and Republican-politicians, the film is always in a state of anticipation and a kind-of limbo. All the Republican-caretakers can do is wait for the fall, and the repression that was surely-to-follow. Betrayed by the Catholic Church, the Soviet Union under-Stalin, political-infighting, and even the Western Democracies, Franco was given a blank-check to slaughter legitimate, democratic-forces by-1939. 2,000 Americans joined the "Abraham Lincoln Brigade" to fight Franco's forces, and a "United Front" of Leftists and Unionists from throughout-the-world had went to Spain to "fight the good-fight". Meanwhile, the Roosevelt-administration banned all-sales of war-material (most-particularly, aircraft-engines and ammunition) to Republican-forces. Franco had many-allies, and would remain-in-power until his timely-death in November, 1975...Spain has been-celebrating ever-since. And-so, "The Devil's Backbone" can only be-about the ghosts of this period, particularly those Spaniards who were betrayed by politicians who shared so-much with Franco. The title, incidentally, comes-from a range-of-mountains where Republican-forces were bogged-down, then-defeated; it is referred-to as the Sierra de Alcubierre. Even George Orwell was there, and he wrote a book on his experiences fighting to save Republican Spain. If "Devil's Backbone" says-anything, it is that "these were times that showed what people then were made-of." Dr. Cásares and Carmen represent the weakened-Republic, with her leg-missing, and he being-impotent. Then, there is Jacinto, once an orphan, now a caretaker of the orphanage--a betrayer, a criminal, and a murderer. Even-worse, though, is that amidst-the-chaos of the Civil War, the orphanage is haunted by the ghost of a former child-resident who may-have been murdered. The orphanage IS Spain, with its' fascist-bomb, unexploded in-the-courtyard, a direct-reference to the bombing of the Spanish-town, Guernica. Guernica was the first-incident of the bombing-of-civilians in modern-history, and was immortalized in a painting by-Pablo Picasso The deformed-fetus in the jar is the Spain-that-never-was, still-born, unnaturally. Dr. Cásares, then, is the legacy of Spanish Republicanism, a good-legacy that literally aids the living in the finale of the film. However, if I tell you anything-else this character, the film will be ruined! You can figure-out the rest, most audiences aren't given enough-credit. Stand-and-be-counted, these are "times that try men's souls". History never ends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What is a ghost? A tragedy condemned to repeat itself time and again? ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...An instant of pain, perhaps. Something dead which still seems to be alive. An emotion suspended in time. Like a blurred photograph. Like an insect trapped in amber." Often compared to "The Sixth Sense (1999)" and "The Others (2001)", "The Devil's Backbone" is even a better film, the ultimate ghost story that goes beyond the genre and very successfully mixes horror, suspense, and coming of age during the war time story. Written and directed by Guillermo del Toro, the film takes place during the Spanish Civil War in an isolated boarding school for the orphans of the War where a new boy, Carlos encounters the ghost of a murdered child Santi whose body was never found and who warns Carlos that "Many of you will die". How did Santi die? Why does not he leave the school's courtyard, what is the tragedy he is trying to prevent? It is up to Carlos to find the answers to these and many more questions as well as to stand up to the school's bully, Jaime and to find out what is behind the violent hostility of the orphanage's nasty caretaker, Jacinto who himself was and orphan and had been a pupil in the school as a child. The movie is not just beautifully directed ? it is very well written and provides the deep insight into each character, including school headmistress named Carmen (Marisa Paredes), kind and brave Professor Casares, vicious bully Jaime who would turn a lonely and scared boy and even the embodiment of evil, Jacinto with his own heartbreaking story. Along with "The Spirit of the Beehive", "Devil's Backbone" is a harrowing exploration of the war and its affect on childhood. It also brings to mind such classic as Bunuel's "Los Olvidados" ? and this is the best praise I have for any movie. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not just an incredibly effective ghost story, but a cinematic masterpiece. Like his "Cronos," Del Toro has created a rich horror fable that is driven by 3-dimensional characters involved in a fascinating plot that leads to a wholly satisfying ending. With many developments along the way that shock, move, and thrill. And of course the political allegory and reality of the film, the Spanish Civil War, all the orphan boys of noble Loyalist fighters fighting their own war against a truly horrifying fascist villain, the young and handsome Jacinto, who is not without a sad ghost in his own past that feeds his destructiveness.Del Toro is one of the most intelligent and humane directors working today, not something usually said about auteur in the horror genre. I have not seen "Hellboy" but think less of his US endeavors than these two Spanish masterworks...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During the Spanish Civil War, the twelve year-old boy Carlos (Fernando Tielve) is left behind by his family in an orphanage in the middle of nowhere. Dr. Casares (Federico Luppi) and his wife Carmen (Marisa Paredes) run the orphanage and the former orphan Jacinto (Eduardo Noriega), who lives with the teacher Conchita (Irene Visedo), is responsible to take care and for the maintenance of the place. Jacinto is an ambitious and violent man and has a love affair with Carmen trying to steal the key of the safe where Dr. Casares and his wife hide the gold that is used to support the Republican forces. Carlos is bullied by the strong boy Jaime (Í?igo Garcés), who is the leader of the other boys. One day, Carlos feels the presence of a ghost and soon he learns that he is the orphan Santi (Junio Valverde) that is missing. Carlos sees Santi several times and one day he learns the dark secret of his disappearance."El espinazo del diablo" is a sad and creepy ghost story in a dramatic environment. Having the background of the Spanish Civil War, Guillermo del Toro discloses the melancholic story of a boy abandoned by his family and his difficulties to adapt to his new life. The greedy Jacinto represents the worst that exists in the mankind, a cold and despicable man moved by ambition only. The performances are outstanding and the conclusion is heartbreaking since the boys are left with no perspectives in life. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "A Espinha do Diabo" ("The Devil's Backbone")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'El Espinazo Del Diablo' is set in an orphanage (that beautifully symolizes Spain during the civil war) just before the fall of Catalonia. It works both as a gripping political drama and an engaging ghost story. Del Toro brings cleverly brings the elements of both genres together to tell the story, something he also accomplished in his more recent 'El Fauno del Laberinto' (where he amazingly combines fantasy horror with political drama).Just like with 'El Fauno del Laberinto', Del Toro has taken care that this film isn't neglected in the aspects of film-making. The cinematography stands out. The yellowish tint stresses on the stifling heat and adds to the deserted isolation of the orphanage. The use of symbolism and riddles is remarkable. The details, e.g. flies buzzing around corpses, dusty atmosphere etc are given considerable attention. Visuals are just as impressive e.g. bloody flying in the air like a part of the wing. Del Toro extracts fine performance from all the actors. Seasoned actors like Federico Luppi, Marisa Paredes and Eduardo Noriega (in a menacing role) are superb to say the least but the child actors too hold their own.The characters in 'El Espinazo Del Diablo' represent very distinct qualities that make a human nature. For example, Jacinto as the greedy one and Carmen's object of lust, Carlos as the innocent but determined one and Casares as the wise and silent one. In addition to that, the film itself is very poetic and metaphorical. There's a beautiful scene where Casares tells Carlos what a ghost is. Well, I won't say what was told but that was a very powerful scene.In a nutshell, 'El Espinazo Del Diablo' is a horrifying, tragic but beautiful film. It will provide you with more than what you expect...as long as you don't know what to expect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dull ghost story with half-hearted commentary on the Spanish Civil War. The whole thing seems to exist to prop up a few nifty special effects and a vague sense of atmosphere. I struggled to maintain interest... the characters are bland, the scares entirely absent (unless you have a weak stomach for mildly gory bits), the story feels slapped together from fragments of ideas. There's a reveal that I suppose is meant to be a surprise twist, but it's pretty obvious from the first act. It's just really hard to care about what's going on, and there's not much going on anyway. Carlos approaches the ghost and then gets scared and runs away. Creepy Eli Roth-looking dude does something nasty. Repeat, repeat, repeat. While the craftsmanship is somewhat impressive, it's an empty experience, free of passion, wisdom or thrills.</fullReview>

No need for a twist ending or Hollywood shocks here, this is intelligent, thoughtful, imaginative film-making at its best. Guillermo del Toro is one of the most talented directors working today and this is the best film he's made so far. Seeing this movie makes The Others and The Sixth Sense look gimmicky and weak. Set during an orphanage during the Spanish Civil War we are treated to wonderful performances by the kids and adults, a very cool and creepy ghost (who always appears to be underwater), and a nice dash of action. All and all this is horror film-making at it's best, del Toro is truly a master as evidenced by this and his debut film Cronos.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huge disapointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the writer-director of HELLBOY and MIMIC, what else can I say?ATTENTION SPOILERS ****** I don´t care if The Devil's Backbone has received much critical acclaim, celebrated as an intelligent and subtle ghost story. This film is another huge disappointment. The critics' applause tells us less about the film and more about how desperate are some professional critics for any film that makes even a pretense to intelligence. The opening promises much more than the film delivers, as neither the plot nor the apparently complex set of questions and symbols hold the viewer's attention.Despite the quite different settings and plots, Backbone is another reminiscent of The Sixth Sense. Both films have kids who see "dead people" and there is another similarity between Backbone and Sixth Sense that all critics have predictably failed to notice. Both films introduce religious themes and symbols only to let them drop entirely from the plot.The appearance of the ghost is more absurdly comic than frightening. And the symbols, which emerge early and often in the film, remain undeveloped and entirely on the surface. This is especially true of the religious symbols. The name and life story of the ghost suggest a sort of holy innocent. The theme of the devil's backbone suggests an evil curse infecting nature and preying upon the weak. And the daily meals in the orphanage suggest a eucharistic theme. But none of these symbols or themes is adequately developed. One might be tempted to think that del Toro is here trying to imitate the surrealism of the famous Spanish director Bunuel, for whom religious symbols constitute one of many, arbitrary codes of meaning. But, unlike Bunuel, del Toro wants to tell a coherent story and he resorts to rather traditional narrative structure in the end. So we are left unsatisfied, wondering about the point of all the symbols.The film is too long and far too pretentious a journey to a simplistic, Hobbesian conclusion about mankind in a state of nature. Why the pretense to complex symbolism? That reveals more about the sad state of contemporary film - and narrative generally - that wants desperately to free itself from a religious framework but has found nothing to replace the most powerful and most dramatic set of symbols available to the human race.As much as I try to like The Devil's Backbone, it left me cold, since its most unique aspects seemed also to be its most frustrating ones. I appreciate its attempts to elevate the ghost story from a simple fright-fest, but the director seems to want to badly too scare us to make it wholly effective as a political allegory. 2 OUT of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Old-Fashioned Ghost Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Devil's Backbone is only a ghost story, and this is all it needs to be. What Guillermo del Toro seeks here is simply to spin a supernatural yarn, to establish a milieu then infect it with a sense of the macabre. He achieves his creepy effects in ways both subtle and otherwise. He has a talent for investing objects with an air of menacing strangeness - rusty scissors hanging in a kitchen; an unexploded bomb planted like a flower bulb in a courtyard; a giant glass jug containing a deformed fetus - and a further talent for using high-tech effects to call forth a sense of otherworldly chill. Water is the main medium here for transmitting the supernatural; a murdered child's spirit comes surrounded by phantasmal fluid, his blood still leaking from his wounded skull (his dead skin looks like cracked porcelain), still clouding the paranormal liquid in which he drifts. This lingering on water stands in mysterious contrast to the film's arid, sun-baked physical reality; fluid acts not as a life-giver but a preservative of that which is already dead (the ghost floats in water like the fetus in its bath of alcohol).The story is set in an isolated orphanage at the tail-end of the Spanish Civil War. The folks who run the orphanage, an old doctor (Federico Luppi) and a one-legged headmistress (Marisa Paredes), are Communists; they take in young boys who've lost their parents to the war, and keep in their safe a stash of gold ingots to be used by the cause. Young Carlos (Fernando Tielve) is dropped off here by his tutor, a soldier, and finds himself immediately embroiled in various melodramas, the worst of which involves the apparent spirit of a kid named Santi (Junio Valverde), who has disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Carlos endures a short hazing period, after which he wins over his mischievous but basically sweet-natured mates, including the sullen Jaime (Inigo Garces), who knows more than he's letting on about Santi's disappearance, and the activities of the orphanage's resident stud, Jacinto (Eduardo Noriega), who is actually a member of Franco's army, and covets the hidden gold ingots.Del Toro, besides being a master of the weird (his Mimic was an under-appreciated exercise in bug-fetishism), is also a keen observer of childhood, the competitive tensions running through boyhood relationships. The best thing about The Devil's Backbone is how natural the child actors are, how accurately del Toro reproduces the vulgar, testing rapport of adolescents. It's easy to get the tone of these scenes all wrong, to make the kids too obnoxious, or too clever, or not clever enough, but del Toro finds just the right balance of meanness, innocence and budding courage to make it work. Kids have the clear-headed sense of justice that makes sense in a ghost-story; adults tend to complicate things with morality, but kids can appreciate how a murdered comrade of theirs deserves revenge against the jerk who did him in. This tit-for-tat approach would seem hopelessly Old Testament in a movie about grown-ups (the way Stephen King's quaint-minded moral tales always do), but with kids involved it comes across as simple logic. The corruption, greed and sexual complications of adult life seem absurd when measured against the logic of the schoolyard, the morality of the playground. The simplicity of a ghost-tale clears away all the muddiness and relativism of modern life, leaving us with nothing to ponder. A--holes who murder kids deserve to be skewered like boars, then tossed into murky pools where vengeful spirits wait.A movie like The Devil's Backbone is an escape, a portal into a more primitivistic, pre-modern way of thinking. Del Toro could care less about the complications of modern morality; his characters are not overly complex, are designed to fill their niches in the mystery without leaking any unnecessary nuance. Del Toro is a purveyor of the supernatural, a weaver of creepy fairy tales, and in this capacity he is a successful director. His sense of scary imagery is understated compared to a lot of directors; he doesn't get off on cheap shock-effects (although he's not above the occasional sudden noise). What makes del Toro a solid horror maven is his sense of the superstitious underpinnings of horror, how horror takes us out of our modern lives and puts us back in touch with the days before rationalism dispelled our sense of the otherworldly. Del Toro understands the power of objects, of substances to stir up irrational dread. To him there's nothing creepier than a pool of muddy water; to visualize the ghost itself is almost superfluous (one wonders why he bothered, other than the opportunity presented by current technology to render a phantom in a new, detailed way). This director seems closer to childhood than most, and closer to what in a child's mind allows it not only to believe in ghosts, but to side with them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Devild Backbone Review - A poor Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Devils Backbone is in my opinion a very dull and boring movie and is not scary enough to be classed as horror. The story did nothing for me and was very bland, just the simple ghost who died a tragic death wanting revenge on the one(s) responsible. However there are many questions that the film leaves unanswered such as "What is a ghost?" and a suggested answer "a tragedy doomed to repeat itself?" These can leave interesting thoughts and can keep you watching the film in order to come up with an answer.The Devils Backbone likes to play around the theme and idea of people and/or things being trapped in time hence the bomb stuck in the ground sounding as if it were alive. I think that Guillermo del Toro wanted to take a different approach to a horror than most however I think that this had a negative effect because the film is too predictable and you see the ghost far too early on in the film and this takes away much of the mystery behind the film.The film also has very vague characters as you do not learn enough about them. I did not find myself caring for any of the characters and this is a bad sign because it means you have not learnt enough about them. You don't get much of an idea of their personality etc. The film also includes information on the Spanish Civil war however I think that it does not go into enough detail on it and that it is also very biased towards one side.The Devils Backbone has almost no scares because almost every scene with the ghost in is too slow. The scariest part of the movie is the eye looking through the key hole and even this was not that scary because it was far to predictable.Overall The Devils Backbone is a bland film with very few scares (if any at all), vague characters and a basic and very predictable story line. I think that it was an interesting take on a horror but yet a very boring one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>on the way to Pan's Labyrith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It looks like Guillermo del Toro will be one of the busiest directors around in the coming few years. IMDb tells us that he has one film in post-production and other five booked in different preparation phases, and all this until 2011. This is more than all films he has done until now, and certainly much of this busy schedule is due to his so very different film 'Pan's Labyrinth'.It is from this perspective that it's interesting to see 'El Espinazo del Diablo'. It does happen in the same period - ravaged Spain at the end of the Civil war, it shows the same world of kids and teenagers trying to cope with the brutality of the world around. In this film however the principal character does not have the strength or the imagination of creating his own fantasy world, but he is subject to the invasion of evil both in the real and in the super-natural world.The tools used by del Toro here are the mainly the ones of the phantom horror movies. The combination works well, is efficient although it does not reach the visual complexity of the later film. As in Labyrinth the real world is the one which is more schematic and less credible. This is one step in a career of a director whose busy schedule will hopefully result in one or more of these great movies everybody feels wait from beyond the corner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When a Ghost Story is not a Ghost Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At its most basic this is a ghost story set in a remote school/orphanage for boys during the Spanish Civil War.But this is also a film written, directed and produced by Guillermo del Toro who would go on later to write, direct and produce Pan's Labyrinth with which there are some obvious similarities. To begin with both films are set in Spain during the Civil War and both feature a child as the protagonist. Where Pan's Labyrinth was del Toro's spin on the Fantasy Genre with some very dark elements The Devil's Backbone is his spin on the Horror Genre or more specifically a Ghost Story but its not all thrills and chills. The film spends a lot of time developing various characters and also slowly unraveling the story behind the appearance of the ghost of the young boy who haunts the orphanage.According to del Toro in his DVD commentary he was very much influenced by the Gothic Romance genre and that is how he would categorize the film, he also indicated there are numerous autobiographical elements in the film based upon his childhood in Mexico and particularly those things that frightened him as a child. These influences contribute to the obvious and deliberate style which is a hallmark of his films and also give us a fascinating tale of horror that doesn't need gore to be effective.The film features very good overall performances from the cast, it looks great and very effectively creates the appropriate atmosphere but despite all this I did not find it as engrossing or as rewarding an experience as was Pan's Labyrinth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not much of a horror or fantasy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was rather disappointed, expected something the likes of "The Others" or "Les Rivieres Pourpres" but nothing in this movie was very horrific, or fantastic for that matter. The story seemed very promising at the beginning, but was a let-down in the end because it gave hopes for a much better unveiling and disclosure. Not quite sure about the title either, or the coincidence of the bomb that never went off. I guess the worst thing about "El Espinazo Del Diablo" is that it has no idea of its potential. SO many intriguing things, the lady with the missing leg, the mute kid, the gold, the actual children with deformed, so called "devil's" spines, the doctor seeing ghosts (a rather disturbing scene where he drinks a glass of liquid that's used to preserve the deformed-spine children), so much stuff going on yet NOTHING is executed to the end. Weird, the dying Casares, the old wise doctor, says the exact same thing, about never finishing something to the end. He doesn't even die properly, he sticks around as a ghost.Don't really like(read-appreciate) the director, I think. He made a big unforgivable mess of the second "Blade" and after seeing this movie I think he has issues with wrapping up things. "hellboy" looks promising though...Recommendations: not really sure, for quickly satisfied seekers of thrillers 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Was so Great About this Average Film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to certainly ask myself what the other people saw in this film. To me, this film suffers from a lack of interesting plot, laughable interaction amongst the characters and a mediocre and conventional approach to a ghost story. To me, there was absolutely nothing interesting or "frightening" about the ghost and the 'ambiance' was typical fare. The story concerns a child who is left at an orphanage in the middle of the desert in Spain during the Spanish Civil War and instead of analyzing his soul, which one would hope would happen, considering this is a foreign movie, we are merely given cliched storylines like "the ghost is here for a reason," or "there's a ghost in this building," and its really all empty. Nowhere do we get to understand the nature of the inner dimensions of the characters. There is the typical mean kid bully, the nice teacher and then the sexual young man who is having sex with the older matriarch in one of the most brainless events in the film. Most of the effects were done with a computer and that takes away any imagination. The war planes flying above, the explosion in the rectory and even the ghost itself were "enhanced" with digital imaging and it further ruins this attempt at life so we are basically left with a modicum of interest. What is lacking is something inherently interesting, or movable, so there is a ghost, so what? What does he mean to us? By the end, we are numbed by the excessive and irrelevant use of violence from one of the characters. It all fails in the end when this becomes just another good vs bad soap opera in the world film. The only commendable part was the beginning and the end, where the teacher is contemplating the nature of what a ghost is, other than that, this is blantantly unintelligent. Grade D-</fullReview>

Do not expect anything you did not see in previously seen horrors. Its not even a horror, its some kind of a tale, but well, there is not even 5 % of this spectacular "shining" in it, shining that some horrors carry inside. There is no action, no twist, you watch it and you yawn, nothing more. Plus there is some leftist propaganda. Thanks God much much less than in Pan's Labyrinth but still...

There were a few sequences that I enjoyed for their sheer beauty and originality, but I had also enjoyed them in the previews, and again in the first five minutes of the film, leaving me not much left to soak in besides the transparent plot, shoddy dialogue(which I hope was simply poor translation), and excessive foreshadowing, with poorly timed musical cues to let you know when you should begin to feel scared.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not his best work...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, Guillermo Del Toro's film The Devil's Backbone was a disappointment. After watching his previous film Pan's Labyrinth, I looked forward to watching The Devil's Backbone, however, for a Gothic-horror film I thought it wasn't up to his standard. The narrative of the story was actually good, but for a horror film there needed to be more to it. It felt a bit dull. In the first few scenes of the film you see the ghost Santi, but in good horror film, fear of the unknown is a key part of the horror. In The Devil's Backbone there wasn't that fear. Although the makeup and costume of Santi was very well done, I feel the audience don't fear him as much as Del Toro wished. I did however enjoyed the relationship between Carlos, the protagonist, and Jaime (the school bully). I liked the way they put their differences aside to fight a common enemy, and how they became the two leaders of the boys in the orphanage when fighting Jacinto. I also liked the mise-en-scene of the film, including its isolated location. The typical traits of a horror film including this are in the film, but it's not enough with just the traits. There needs to be something extra that keeps you on the edge of your seat. I did however like the dangerous scenery and props, for example the unexploded bomb in the middle of the courtyard. I wouldn't recommend this for the people who watch films for the scare, because it would probably be a waste of your time. However, if you are interested in a good plot in the Gothic genre without any scares then this would be a good film for you to watch, mainly because of the interesting relationships between many of the characters in the film, represented in many different ways. An example of this is the children being represented as vulnerable, backed up by the scene that they get captured by Jacinto. Overall I give this a 4/10 mainly because of the fact that I think this is barely a horror film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pan's Labyrinth 's Younger Brother</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first I wasn't sure how this would compare to the newer Pan's Labyrinth but I soon realised I needn't have worried as this too is an excellent film.This film takes place in a remote orphanage in the Spanish desert towards the end of their civil war. The film opens with a new boy arriving at the orphanage, he soon starts to see the ghost of a boy who used to be there who mysteriously vanished the night a bomb fell into the courtyard. The bomb didn't explode but stuck in the ground and remains there ominously throughout the film. The people running the orphanage are backers of the losing Republican (leftist) side and most of the boys there are children of republican fighters. As with Pan's Labyrinth it isn't the supernatural that presents the greatest danger but people, in this case a caretaker who was raised in the orphanage and wants to steal the gold kept hidden in a large safe.As one would expect from one of Guillermo Del Toro the direction is spot on and it has a beautiful colour palette, in this case warm sandy tones rather than the blues and green's of Pan's Labyrinth. The acting was believable although I had to rely on the subtitles as I don't speak Spanish. The film is gripping throughout and in some places quite shocking.If you enjoyed Pan's Labyrinth and have yet to see this film I'd strongly recommend you watch it if you have a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy, but flawed ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While staying at an orphanage during the Spanish Revolution, a young boy learns the truth behind the place's ghostly history and tries to stop the ghost that haunts the place from hurting him and his friends.This happens to be a grossly overrated film, mainly because there's a decided lack of any actual ghost happenings on-screen for the majority of the film and the film instead dealing with the rather banal relationships between the boys during the time makes for just utterly slow-going and irritating scenes that go on far too long and have no real element of a horror film involved in them. That we're also forced through numerous other plot elements that serve no purpose for being here, such as the cheating wife, the relationship between the worker and the daughter and the seemingly-endless Revolutionary speeches, all of which serve to take up time for the ghost which is the best part of the film because it's so different from the usual nonsense going on around it. Those generate some pretty nice scenes, including the initial discovery down in the catacombs where the dark, ever-present sound of falling water and ghostly presence create a pretty enjoyable sequence that has an eerie air about it, as well as the finale in the house where it finally gets some action going as it terrorizes the family. All-in-all, though, this was a really, really disappointing effort.Rated R: Graphic Language, Graphic Violence, violence-against-children and children-in-jeopardy.</fullReview>

When watching a conventional ( IE an American assembly line supernatural thriller) it is easy to see where the story is going and the same of the characters, but with a movie of this caliber it drags you willingly around every nook and cranny in the film, dimly shedding light on what has to be one of the most emotional ghost stories ever. The Backdrop of the Spanish Civil war, the corruption of human nature, greed, lust and weakness.I thought the essence of the movie lingered with me like an old book that was passed down from generation to generation.

		<shortDescription>Thematic Overview of Devil's Backbone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Devil's Backbone originally titled in Spanish as El Espinazo Del Diablo is a Mexican film written and directed by Guillermo del Toro released in 2001. It is currently known as the prequel to Pan's Labyrinth, another of Guillermo's wonderfully haunting and visually imaginative films. The Devil's Backbone is both a ghost story and a political allegory. Set in 1939, when the Spanish Civil War is coming to its end, a ghost appears to the young protagonist, Carlos and warns him of the deaths to come. The cast is located at an all boys orphanage in Spain, destitute and forsaken by the inequity of their ruling government. Many themes and motifs seem to casually run through the film where average moviegoers could mistake for methods of storytelling. This can be concluded from unresolved fractions in the plot such as the unexploded bomb. The bomb is a character in itself, which if not viewed thematically charged can leave viewers in puzzlement and discontent for its static presence. It was placed to allegorically mark the orphanage as a site of inevitable death and destruction. The impotence of the bomb is a direct parallel to the idea of suspension in the film, which can be easily mistaken by incapacity. Is it mere coincidence that everything around the bomb exploded in destruction and not the bomb itself? This is where happenstance reigns over circumstance further emphasizing the motif driven conventions of the film. Duality circles through the film as well posing as shadows to events taking place where they would normally be seen unfit. Such as the well, a common purification metaphor and source of life, where in the film is depicted as a site of the horrific murder and death of Santi, the ghost which haunts and alerts Carlos of the events to come. Other thematic vices include that of the barrier, agenda and the secret. Carlos frequently finds refuge from Santi behind closed doors, which in reality holds a semi-permeable resolution due to the ghost's trans-dimensional appearances invading spaces normally deemed secure. The barrier motif is primarily a peripheral extension of the agenda of the character. Jacinto, the terrorist and main oppressor of the plot is separated from the gold he desires as well as keeping his love affair with Carmen a secret. The melodrama of the movie starts to reveal itself when these barriers and secrets are broken. Such as when Caesar walks in on a conversation Jacinto and Carmen were having concerning their secret love affair. This event broke the psychological barrier between secret and agenda, which inevitably led to the downward spiral of conflict. Jacinto's mentality of selfish individualism mirrors that of its political context of the behavior of the masses where animalistic desires surface due to the absence of judgment. Thematically Jacinto is seen as the governmental oppressor, which subdues the rest of the cast into his mal-intention. The political parallel of the film is not only framed by the current situation of the Spanish Civil War but by the metaphorical characteristics of the characters themselves. Dr. Casares and Carmen, the stoical old leftists that guard the orphanage symbolically suggest the weakness of the republic by their metaphorical baggage. Dr. Casaeres's chronic impotence and Carmen's wooden leg emphasize the weakness of the republic unable to defend themselves against Jacinto, the embodiment of the fascist revolution encircling their republican agenda. Another political reference is that of the penultimate scene of the boys banding together to overthrow Jacinto with hand carved spears. One child remarks that Jacinto, their oppressor, is "bigger than us" but Carlos then remarks "there are more of us". This is very popular among American western movies where the united can never be defeated. Coincidentally the last shot of the movie perfectly mirrors that of the famous last shot of "The Searchers" where the bewildered orphan boys emerge out into the desolate sunlight of the Spanish plain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another over-rated horror-flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the worst movies I've come across. It was dreary and unrelentingly bleak which I could forgive if there was any actual horror or scares etc but there wasn't. Nothing happened until the very end when all of a sudden lots of people died, but not because of anything supernatural. It was more a tale about bullies than anything else. So if you're interested in watching a very sad depressing, slow-moving moralistic story about sad kids in an orphanage and the consequences of greed then go ahead and watch this. If you're looking for a scary, creepy horror story then look elsewhere. Some reasonable acting especially by the youngster who plays the lead role and some lovely cinematography, plus interesting settings is not enough to make this a film worth watching. Another one I fast-forwarded through. A hint: if you do get stuck watching this, stay with it for about half an hour then either fast forward to the last 20 mins or go do something useful around the house for a while and come back to it. The middle section is excruciatingly boring. The ending at least has a bit of blood and guts and explosions so it wasn't a complete loss. I won't bother watching any others by this director. This is the second film of his I've tried to watch and nearly fallen asleep to.</fullReview>

A young man having sex with an old woman missing one leg. School bullying. Adultery. Betrayal. Poverty. A general feeling of loneliness and forlornness...Also, the movie doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. A ghost story? A menage-a-trois drama? A boys' school story? A movie about how the Spanish civil war affected the civilians? The different story-lines do not keep together.Also, a ghost story is such a special kind of genre, that one somehow expects the ghost to be the center of the story. This is not the case here; there are a lot of side stories that have nothing to do with the ghost - and that seems odd. I mean: if it is to be an adult movie about relations, adultery, sex, betrayal, war etc. - the ghost seems very out of place in it...Still, I must give the movie credit for the most scary-looking ghost I have ever seen in a movie..! This fact, and the very good actor who plays the old Doctor, is why I give the movie three stars instead of just one or two.</fullReview>

He hasn't been told that his father was killed on the frontlines. Dr. Casares sells his spiced rum "limbo water" to the villagers from a glass jar containing a baby with an exposed spine or the Devil's Backbone. Carlos encounters the ghost of Santi, a boy who disappeared when a giant bomb landed in the middle of the courtyard. The bomb is suppose to have been defused. Carlos is bullied by Jaime and the other boys. Carlos rescues Jaime from drowning and they become friends. Angry groundskeeper Jacinto was once one of the orphans being cared for and Conchita is the beautiful teacher.Carlos has a childhood innocence and this is an intriguing childhood ghost story from Guillermo del Toro. This is not scary but it has the tension of the Spanish Civil War like his later masterpiece "Pan's Labyrinth". It has a mood of dread and feel of wonder. The characters are all compelling. It would be nice to have Carlos and Jaime battle it out a little longer. It's all very well made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to make a ghost story that makes sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read the glowing reviews before deciding to see this film and was disappointed. While technically and cinematically well made, with many long close-up of faces and expressions under yellowish tint throughout the orphanage, and while it offers the occasional humor, the plot is thin - a boy murdered by the villain the caretaker because he accidentally discovered the villain was trying to steal gold, turned into a ghost and finally got his revenge. Yes it is not meant to scare but make you sympathize with the ghost. But so what? The movie has too many characters to delineate and they are delineated very slowly - the always stressed headmaster and her doctor/husband, the unbelievably brave 12-year-old hero, his rival the older orphan, the villain, the villain's girlfriend, etc. It tries to cover too many characters but ends up leaving each undeveloped or illogical. Why is the hero so brave and inquisitive having been suddenly abandoned in an orphanage? Are the headmistress and her husband in it for money, kindness, political correctness? Why would a worker whom we hardly met and then the headmistress be so silly to run towards the burning and exploding cans of gasoline to just be killed? Why was the villain's girlfriend so enamored by him and was going to marry him and suddenly became a martyr to die just to defy him? Are the boys happy and adjusted as it seems all they cared about was pranks and nobody seemed to care about the missing Santi boy who was rumored to become a ghost. Without character development, one never really identifies with the characters and get too involved with their curiosity, fear, cruelty, and agony. And the movie feels long. The director should be congratulated for not using artificial devices to just scare you, until that one sudden gunshot, which was louder than a canon!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Although some good parts, I don't approve this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good reception of this movie? Really? People only overrated it because it's Guilherme Del Toro's. For me it's mild ghost story that reminds me "Goosebumps". I don't consider it a horror, but actually a drama, which is most of Del Toro's line.It's an OK movie, you should not expect much, otherwise you will be disappointed. It's a Pan's Labyrinth, but instead of a faun, there's a ghost in the movie. But in my opinion Pan's Labyrinth is far way better.I have no idea why the movie's title is "The Devil's Backbone", I searched for it on the internet and found no explanation, there's no devil not even a backbone, these words are only said once, but no meaning elaborated, also the role of the bomb in the middle of that yard remains unknown. Things don't add up.It's the kind of poetic movie that goes for a abstracted intelligence approach which make the movie boring and annoying. I hate when the movie ends and a lot of unexplained facts has no explanation. I'm rating it 4 out of 10, because it's not a total waste. But this movie has not increased anything to me, I could have live without watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not even a ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Devil's Backbone is a film you should be able to say you have saw it. To say most of the actors am under the age of 15 the acting is very believable and the special effects are pretty good. Guillermo Del Toro picked the setting very well with the setting being in the middle of no where which creates big impact on the film. Santi's (The ghost) make up and editing was awful though and thats what kicked the horror genre out the window in the film. The biggest thing that let the film down for me was the last scene when Jacinto dies there wasn't really a climax ending and was pretty rubbish and how the boys leave without a real challenge ruins the whole film and there isn't really nothing to do with ghost's just Santi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is a ghost? A tragedy condemned to repeat itself time and again? An instant of pain, perhaps. Something dead which still seems to be alive.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A steady diet of the usual horror flicks might lead one to think that all horror must have copious amounts of blood and bared breasts. To see a master craftsman at work like Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth, Cronos) is a real treat.Like Pan's Labyrinth, this film is set during the Spanish Civil War, during the last days when Franco's invading army was about to defeat the defenders of democracy and freedom.In a small orphanage run by Marisa Paredes (The Flower of My Secret) and Federico Luppi (Pan's Labyrinth, Cronos), the children of the left are cared for. Left there after the death of his father is Carlos (Fernando Tielve), who sees the ghost of a dead boy in the cellar.Eduardo Noriega plays the gardener, who thinks there is gold hidden in the orphanage and is screwing the headmistress to find the key.Carlos is slowing learning to trust/accept the ghost and eventually learns the truth of it's death, and it's need for revenge to rest.The film is beautifully shot, and a slowly developing tale of pain. Not only the pain of the ghost, but the pain of Spain as it is dying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately, nobody is a prophet in his own land. This movie is a poor adaptation of the excellent mexican horror movie "Hasta el viento tiene miedo" (even the wind has fear). But for those people who never saw this old Mexican horror movie may will spend a good time seeing the new one. The actors (including the boys) did their best effort to make this movie less worse. Maybe the new generation will replace the old movie for the new movie as a favorite but "El espinazo del diablo" needs time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shameless, if artsy, travesty of recent Spanish History.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of orphans of the Spanish Civil war--late 1930s--are collected and sheltered by a wealthy lady and her doctor friend in some estate in the countryside. As the war winds down they are forced to leave, as they are republican sympathizers, which will give occasion for a tragedy that will engulf them all. That's the plot.Now, under the pretext of a story occurring during that war we are offered here once more that old, tested, Hollywood fare of a slow build up towards a horrifying orgy of violence in which people, mostly kids, are burned alive, stabbed, beaten to death; where buildings and vehicles will be blown up, to end it all with the multiple impaling of the culprit. Because see, all this violence has nothing to do with the war itself, it isn't a consequence of it, but instead the deeds of a single bad guy, a lone villain--and if we risk missing the point the regular close ups of his mug giving us his best possible evil stare, should be enough to convince the greatest disbeliever.A million people died in that conflict; with many, perhaps the majority, not dying in combat but in mass executions and other atrocities. Nothing of that is seen here. Now, I have no problem with filmmakers portraying that sordid page of Spanish History as the murderous rampage it was, but if they are not capable of doing with a minimum of intellectual integrity they shouldn't bother. This movie is nothing but a shameless travesty of History. Maybe Almodavar &amp; Del Toro felt intimidated by the touchy subject that war is still in their country but by tackling the subject while subverting it they didn't do any favor to the truth. The war is here nothing but a distant echo; but that is not the problem. They could have still treated the subject with class and historic accuracy--which they did for almost 60 min. The problem is that after that we are offered scenes of gore &amp; violence that, while fitting for a war flick, are not here a consequence of the ongoing conflict but the acts of an evil man. This means we'll be spared images of war mayhem, but not of the killings, the violence, in a rather indirect, even hypocritical way. So, no battles, no executions--save for the very convenient one of Franco loyalists, by foreigners!--as if most of the killing had not been the product of Spaniards killing each other but of a few asocial men or the acts of meddlesome strangers (Can you say Misplaced Xenophobia?).But this is not a putrid flick all along; in fact it is a rather decent one during the first hour. Then suddenly turns into standard Hollywood lore. The serious drama turns into the typical Die Hard gore fest. Until then we're shown the story of a school or something that has been turned into an orphanage for kids victims of war. Apart from the said older couple there is also the help, amongst them the bad guy, and a ghost who wanders the premises at night. Very little is shown of the war itself, I said, the orphanage being shown as a self contained world, with all the action taking place there, except for the scene of the execution of Franco sympathizers. The plot is rather static, nothing much happens in that hour, and characters are rather formulaic, even cliché, but the acting, the pacing, and the cinematography make up for it. One plot weakness is that all adults look mostly disconnected from each other as there's no real background given. The characterization of the bad guy is so subtle, the only thing missing is the big written sign over his head. From the fire on, everything looks contrived, melodramatic?exs., people dying while hearing poetry or bad guys mistreating children. The worst part of it all is when we're shown "the human side" of the baddie, I don't understand why?anyway, at this point everything goes for the manipulation of the viewer's emotions.As for plot holes there are few big ones; most concern Dr. Casares. How such a smart man, one capable of tricking the urchins into denouncing themselves is incapable of noticing they are being mistreated, even knife cut, by the baddie? Why is he unable to understand that this last--after being humiliated in front of everyone, hit by a woman and expelled from the place--just won't swallow his pill and go away but that, instead, he would come back for revenge? This is crucial, as the final hecatomb rests on that sole oversight. And why anybody would risk their lives extinguishing a fire when they are leaving the place for good? And why a ghost would need to unlock a door?.In all, I'll give it a 2 only for the first 62 min. But don't make any mistake: after that the flick is pure Hollywood-style crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only good thing there is to say about this film is that it has a nice nostalgic look - the scenery is OK.Other than that it is just a great big yaaaaaawn of a film, from beginning to end. It has nothing driving the story forward whatsoever. I understand (from the IMDb rating) that people like hearing stories from the old days, but, give me a break. The story is just lame, childish and predictable and not worth hearing for adults. I never quit in the middle of a movie, but this time I had to give in. Life's too short! Really - see something else. And by that I mean, see something else from a different director, 'cause his other film, Pans Lab, was almost equally lame. Almost. This guy's at the moment directing The hobbit... Stay clear is my advice. I will!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 21st Century Horror Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I started watching The Devil's Backbone, I had no clue of how great the movie would prove to be. The story of the film is that a young boy Carlos, whose father has recently died in Spanish Civil War in 1939, is brought in an orphanage and school run by a kind old lady Carmen who has a love interest on a school doctor named Dr. Casarus. Moreover, there is a sadistic caretaker of the school named Jacinto who was a former student of in the orphanage and has a fiancé Conchita. Soon after arriving in, Carlos meets the school bully Jamie and other friends and also the school ghost. He sees that there is a bomb in the courtyard of the school intact which was diffused a day after it fell during which according to many children in the orphanage a boy named Santi disappeared. Now there are further events set to occur in the orphanage in the coming days that may change all the boys and teachers' lives forever.I found the first half of the film to be very gripping, entertaining and quite spooky, thanks to the excellent direction, cinematography, editing, performances and musical score. I became curious to know what will happen next as the story is extremely unpredictable! This made the film brilliant.I was absorbed into the film in the very first half. By the beginning of the second half, the film became very intense and more than a mere supernatural horror flick and I found myself connected to all the characters, a quality which a perfect movie must possess. By this time, I didn't care about the technical aspects of the film as I was deeply connected with the characters and their interactions with the situation they have fallen in. I cheered for the characters as they underwent a development. This whole part including the climax and the ending made the film a masterpiece.The film works on various levels from a potential ghost story to political aspects to psychological depth of the characters to the effects of war on children.Overall, the film is a 21st Century Horror, wait not Horror, a Supernatural Political War Drama Masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is what European cinema is all about. Great movie, great story. Hardly a horror movie. There are some appearances of a child ghost but nothing too scarry. The atmosphere is luxuriant and almost dream like, with surreal elements. The only problem for me was Jacinto who became almost overnight a maniac killer and killed without remorse the children and his girlfriend. There was no building up to this moment. Maybe they should have shown something from his previous life at the orphanage so you could understand what drives him to do it, as the desire for gold was not enough in my opinion, there should have been something more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dr. Casares: "You know what? Of all the orphans, you were always the saddest. The lost one. A prince without a kingdom.."Presenting The Devil's Backbone (also known as El Espinazo Del Diablo) Guillermo Del Toro showed once again what he's capable of. Once again the Fantasy and Gothic aspects are present, just like in many of his other projects. The stylish yet spooky fairy tale, with various subplots, is rich in both character and story. As a result that I found easy as a viewer to connect with the vulnerable but brave protagonists. That being said, I'd also have to applaud the superb acting by the entire cast. The movie will make you uncomfortable, but probably in a different way than you initially thought. The story's setting takes place in a, fairly isolated, orphanage in Catalonia (Spain) that has fallen as a result of the Spanish Ciliv War.Even though it's being labeled as a Horror movie, I can confirm, while it remains mainly a ghost story, that the movie is clearly a War Drama. Guillermo Del Toro successfully shows off his creative skills by combining the different genres in a subtle manner. In all honesty, this is one of the best pieces of cinema I've come across. At least, that's my opinion. convincing even one person to watch this movie would be so satisfying because it's truly worthy of your time. Even Del Toro himself considers it to be his most personal film. The Devil's Backbone is a sad ride but a tense experience that will cause shivers down your spine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ghost story which serves as an allegory for the Spanish Civil War !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Devil's Backbone' is a film co-written and directed by the critically acclaimed Mexican director Guillermo del Toro. It is set in Civil War era Spain. The film starts when a young boy named Carlos after losing his father arrives at Santa Lucia School which was being secretively used as a shelter for the orphans of Republican soldiers and politicians. There he comes across new characters like the strict headmistress Carmen, the generous professor Dr. Casares and the hot- headed caretaker Jacinto. He also meets the other orphans, one of whom named Jaime seemed to be a bully. Along with the people, Carlos also starts to sense some supernatural presence in the school.Del Toro is one of those directors whose work can justifiably be called the work of an auteur. Whenever you come across a film made by him, you can clearly see his stamp on it. 'The Devil's Backbone' has all the Del Toro-esque elements that one expects from his films. It has his signature visual flair. The cinematography by Guillermo Navarro and the general look of the film is astonishing. The rich and vibrant colours that ornament almost every scene is impossible to not get bowled over by. Not only the special effects, but also the scenes on location in natural surroundings get enriched by Del Toro's vibrant style and look beautiful. In a way this can be called a precursor to 'Pan's Labyrinth'. Like 'Labyrinth', this film is also at the basic level a fairy tale which doesn't necessarily follow the conventional rules followed by fairy tales in general. There is some graphic violence, there is blood, there are disturbing visuals. But still, the innocence of the young characters in the film shine through.Other than the visual style and the cinematography, another admirable aspect of the film is the ambitious nature of the screenplay. The whole setting of the script is meant to serve as an allegory for the Spanish Civil War as well as what caused it. The Santa Lucia School is meant to represent Spain itself during the ongoing Civil War. Headmistress Carmen and Dr. Cesares represent the older generation who remained naive and oblivious to the intentions of the dictatorial factions and allowed them to invade the country. The ghost represents the spirit, the emotions and the memories of Spain during happier pre-Civil War days. The adults in the school premises refuse to acknowledge its presence, but the young newcomer Carlos senses the same. Jacinto in a way represents the power hungry General Franco. The underlying theme of the film is of hope and optimism. Del Toro shows the new generation with the guidance of the elders has the capacity to usher in an era of peace by defeating the perpetrators of violence, which makes the film's theme universal and timeless.But for me, although the film has great positives, it still contains some flaws primarily in terms of the script and the character development. Although the screenplay works well as a thematic allegory for the Civil War and has the Guillermo-esque Gothic creepiness, I think when it comes to writing of the characters, it is a bit weak. I found myself astonished by how extreme the writing regarding the character of Jacinto was. Although he is supposed to represent Franco and his vicious acts are supposed to mirror those of Franco's, but in the context of the film itself, it felt rushed and underdeveloped. Considering the background and the circumstances, I found it difficult to believe that Jacinto would do the things that he is made to do in the screenplay.The acting is good from everyone. A special mention should be given to Federico Luppi who plays Dr. Cesares. In a nutshell, the film is certainly worth watching due to Del Toro's artistic vision and visual flair. The thematic backdrop and allegory of the screenplay is also admirable. But the film fails to make the transition from good to great due to the problematic, rushed and underdeveloped nature of character development.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a lot like "What Lies Beneath" and "The Orphanage." It's a bit of a mystery, mixed with drama of the war and its effects on a poor orphanage for young boys. One in particular whom we follow, Carlos, is new and begins to suspect that the orphanage is haunted. There isn't a lot to criticize here, yes it may be predictable and dry at times, but it's well put together with an eerie setting. Personally, as a horror fan, I'm a bit disappointed in the movie. But as del Toro fan, and a cinematic fan in general, I was well satisfied with the movie. Its harsh reality and ghost theme helps set the somber mood, and no complaints about the actors either, everybody did a convincing job in their roles. Great movie, go see it if you like mystery, drama, and yeah, even horror, why not.</fullReview>

To make a film though with that one quality is extremely difficult and there is just a few people out there that can pull it off, Guillermo Del Torro is one of them. There are really no scare scenes, high profile actors or even special effects. The only horror element it really has is a little ghost boy that appears periodically throughout the movie. What it lacks in is what makes the movie great because it makes the film realistic and sucks the viewer into its setting. There are so many moving components to the movie, it's something that the viewer has to really pay attention to or watch several times. It seemed I was always wondering how certain aspects of the film were going to pop back in. Del Torro with this movie proves he is a horror film-making genius and it should be on the top of everyone's top foreign horror lists.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guillermo del Toro notably focused on Franco's Spain in "Pan's Labyrinth", but he also did so in "El espinazo del diablo" ("The Devil's Backbone" in English). A question that the movie brought to my mind is how much anyone knows about any house or building. "Poltergeist" is probably the most famous movie about a structure with a hidden history. For all that I know, my residence could be sitting on top of a dinosaur skeleton.As for the movie itself, it also comes across as a link between two different types of movies to come from Spain. Pedro Almodóvar produced it, and it focuses on the sorts of things on which he focuses (especially "Bad Education"). But there's also the horror movies that have emerged from the Iberian country since the '60s. Paul Naschy played a werewolf in a series of movies, and the 21st century has seen a number of ghost-themed movies come from Spain. What an oeuvre for the country that's suffered probably second most - behind Greece - under Europe's economic mess.Anyway, it's a really good movie. So far I've liked every Guillermo del Toro movie that I've seen. I wonder what the result would've been had Almodóvar ever cast Naschy in a movie. Probably a story of a werewolf in a damaged relationship.</fullReview>

The cinema is just perfect as the sights, colors and sounds at times just overwhelm you. My hat is off to Guillermo del Toro, Almodovar and all the actors/actresses in this movie. The movie is compared to "Sixth Sense" and "The Others" and certainly deserves the honor. It's a chilling, captivating story until the end. Certainly not as shocking as the "Sixth Sense" but equally deserving of a viewing. If you're in the mood to view a sub-titled movie, I would highly recommend "Devil's Backbone".

		<fullReview>Yes, we do get a little ghost story, but this film isn't trying to scare you. If you're looking to get frightened by evil ghosts, this is the wrong movie for you. If you're looking for a solid, sometimes violent drama spiced with a little fantasy, then by all means give this one a shot."Devil's backbone" has many similarities to "Pan's labyrinth", and they are indeed like siblings. "Pan's labyrinth" is the more fantastical older sister while this one is the more down-to-earth little brother. Neither is a sequel or a prequel to one another, and both are entirely separate stories.I really liked the drama here. There's a shadow of war over people who struggle with love, regret, fear, abandonment, anger and greed, each and every one imperfect by him-/herself. Even Director Del Toro himself said he wanted to focus on the theme of imperfection, and it worked. I believed every single character, and that is a compliment when about half of the cast consists of children. Standout adult performances from Eduardo Noriega and Federico Luppi really drive the intensity of the story.This is a movie with many young children in it (the film mainly takes place in an orphanage) but it's not a movie for young children. There are some heavy scenes with explicit violence. "Devil's backbone" doesn't dwell on gore, being a drama, but it shows the ugly results of violence and cruelty.Some special effects are very cool and makes you wonder how they did them. Del Toro knows his stuff when presenting fantastical elements, no doubt about it.Why am I giving this only an 8, since I have thus far given only compliments? I don't know. Perhaps I watched this at a wrong time or I was too tired, but I wasn't too overwhelmed with what I saw. It certainly is a quality story with good acting, well-written characters, good cinematography and many nice touches, but I didn't get that feeling I get when I've seen something that is a masterpiece for me. Perhaps one day I'll watch it again, who knows how hard it might hit me.Oh yeah, and guess where Fallout 3 got a certain idea from? If you've played the game and see this movie, you'll know what I mean.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made and stylish, but pretty dull to be honest with you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Credit IMDb) After Carlos, a 12-year-old whose father has died in the Spanish Civil War arrives at an ominous boy's orphanage he discovers the school is haunted and has many dark secrets that he must uncover.It's odd. Usually films you don't like when you are younger, you tend to appreciate them a bit more as you get older. This movie went backwards. I adored this movie when I was younger and I probably didn't even understand it as much as I do now. I was honestly very bored with this movie. I love slow build-up's, and well crafted story telling, but this movie moved way too slowly for me. It relies a lot on style, and old fashioned atmosphere. While, it does both of those things very well, it doesn't necessarily make the story all that interesting. Believe it or not, this movie had the potential to be exactly what I pined for. I prefer my ghost stories to be thoughtful, in lieu of the constant boo scares for the teenage crowd. My problem with Devil's Backbone was that the story was average, and I had difficulty warming up to it. It has some great visuals, the story set in 1939 had all the potential in the world to be riveting, but it wasn't. I will give credit to some of the atmosphere, especially the night scenes. The acting is pretty solid. Fernando Tielve is excellent as Carolos. He is our hero, and the story relies on him heavily. He did extremely well, it's just too bad the dull story let him down. Eduardo Noriega is OK as the main villain. Federico Luppi is great as Dr. Casares. His wily show was fun to watch. The rest of the cast are good. Overall: It's worth a watch. I just found it to be a bit boring. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't say this film is all that original, but it blends many well-done aspects of both horror films and tragedies. It's actually not as much of a horror film than what I expected and instead it uses a ghost story to tell of more human evils, in this case the despicable Jacinto (who sometimes boarders on cartoonish villainy). Still, this is very well shot and scored, with a haunting, Gothic tone to it. The kid characters are all well-established in their own right and the mystery, while simple, is really effective and is used as a backdrop. I definitely expected something different, but one can see where the ideas in Pans Labyrinth came from.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A steady diet of the usual horror flicks might lead one to think that all horror must have copious amounts of blood and bared breasts. To see a master craftsman at work like Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth, Cronos) is a real treat. Like Pan's Labyrinth, this film is set during the Spanish Civil War, during the last days when Franco's invading army was about to defeat the defenders of democracy and freedom. In a small orphanage run by Marisa Paredes (The Flower of My Secret) and Federico Luppi (Pan's Labyrinth, Cronos), the children of the left are cared for. Left there after the death of his father is Carlos (Fernando Tielve), who sees the ghost of a dead boy in the cellar. Eduardo Noriega plays the gardener, who thinks there is gold hidden in the orphanage and is screwing the headmistress to find the key. Carlos is slowing learning to trust/accept the ghost and eventually learns the truth of it's death, and it's need for revenge to rest. The film is beautifully shot, and a slowly developing tale of pain. Not only the pain of the ghost, but the pain of Spain as it is dying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a amazing piece of work by Del Toro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is excellent from start to finish and the film is a must watch, you will be glued to your screens for the whole story because it's so insightful and if you take your eyes of the screen you'll miss a moment of madness. Normally, i do not really like horror genre films because i think there quite boring and have no mean to the film, but in this case i really enjoyed this Gothic horror because it made me feel different about the whole perspective of horror films from start to the end of the film. The reason, it's such a good story is because of the characters and how there feelings enrol on the following film, and del Toro puts these effects by the use of cinematography and sound/editing, without these elements the film would not be as good, the elements of horror which have been by these micro-elements. people who might enjoy the film are any one who is aged above 15 to any one above because if people are to young they might not get the brilliance of dell Toro's techniques nor his skills. Devil's backbone uses great representation of the film by the setting of the film which is in spain in the civil war we gather that because of the costume the orphanage kids are wearing, and the period setting is shown by the clothes/costume being worn and the whole building and scenery of the orphanage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good and interesting watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I my opinion I think that this film is a good watch, the young protagonist 'Carlos' from the beginning is shown to be different from all the other characters, so us as the audience are unable not to show sympathy towards him. The director Guillermo Del Toro cleverly created a great narrative, at the beginning starting off with the line 'What is a ghost?', because of this throughout the film we are questioning this and deciding what a ghost really is.I think that sound is a key feature in this film, in times of suspense and tension Del Toro uses eerie music and when something surprising happens he uses a drop in pitch to cause the audience to feel anxious and afraid of what happened.This film is suitable for most people, mainly teens and above, as younger ages may not be able to understand the narrative and understand the concept of ghosts and death. The younger generation may enjoy the horror concepts of the film and the elderly may enjoy the historical context of the films backdrop. the acting by the adults and the children in the film is very good and enjoyable also. This film is very similar to Del Toro's 'Pan's labyrinth', so if you enjoyed that film, then I recommend that you should watch this.From this film we can understand about other countries history (this being the Spanish civil war), and understand other peoples cultures and lifestyles, which I found very interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a very interesting piece of work by Del Toro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is excellent from beginning to end and is a must watch. every minute is of the film is marvelous and exciting. del Toro has done a magnificent job with this film almost as good as his pans labyrinth, the way he puts across the film is very cleaver and the twists and riddles that are shown are very good and make you want to watch on and try to work out.The thing that made it a good story is the characters for me. they are very good at there role and without them i don't think the film would have been as successful as it is and most definitely wouldn't of been one of my popular films. also the narrative of this film with the ghost Santi and the background story about Jacinto and the civil war well its like a kid in a candy store lots to choose from and to pick from so the film never gets boring.I enjoyed the range of camera shots that where used without the great cinematography skills this film also again wouldn't be as good as it is. the sound is this film is also very good as it is creepy but at the same time quite tense and scary which will pull you in and frighten you in a good way that you will want to watch on. i think this film is mainly for young adults and adults as it can be quite confusing at times but also a bit to scary for younger children. also young adults/adults should enjoy it more.

		<fullReview>"The Devil's Backbone" is a powerful experience, one of the most effective ghost stories to ever be made. It's rich in atmosphere, and verbal and visual poetry; it's a breathtakingly beautiful film in every scene. It's got a strong political edge as well as a very human quality, with well rounded characters all around, even the villain of the piece. It's deliberately paced yet compelling, and is also sufficiently gory, so it can satisfy horror fans of various kinds. In other words, it's one of those films that this viewer appreciates for being intelligent and visceral at the same time.Set during the Spanish Civil War, it tells of 12-year-old Carlos (Fernando Tielve), whose father has died fighting the war and who is sent to a very rural orphanage. In a very striking touch, an undetonated bomb is stuck in the earth outside. The place has a notably sad history as Carlos will find out; one boy had vanished under mysterious circumstances, and Carlos begins to be visited by apparitions.Many a horror filmmaker could learn lessons from co-writer / director Guillermo del Toro, who doesn't rush through this story or get fancy with the editing. He takes his time to completely draw his viewers in, and even though the mystery to be solved isn't that much of a mystery, del Toro still keeps you eagerly watching through each revelation as it occurs. He's assisted by such talents as cinematographer Guillermo Navarro and composer Javier Navarrete, whose score is haunting and lovely.The performances are wonderful; the child actors such as Tielve and Inigo Garces, who plays Jaime, are believable. And the adults, especially Federico Luppi as wise old Dr. Casares, are a delight. Eduardo Noriega is memorable as greedy Jacinto, determined to get his hands on a stash of gold.With Del Toros' masterful combination of mood, suspense, graphic violence, tragedy, and political backdrop, it just goes to show that a well thought out horror film can have something for everybody.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and haunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guillermo del Toro is perhaps more known for his English language movies, like Mimic, Blade II, Hellboy and Pacific Rim, but creatively, artistically and qualitatively they don't even begin to compare to his Spanish language movies, this one and Pan's Labyrinth being his masterpieces.Set against the Spanish civil war, this is a ghost story set in a secluded boy's orphanage, with a dud missile planted in the middle of its courtyard. While it is the ghost story that immediately catches your attention, and is the driving force in the story, the true story of the movie is much more complex, dealing with the difficulties of surviving during the civil war, what it means to be an orphan and the many complexities of human nature. The story is haunting in more than one sense of the word, not to mention touching and heartbreaking. There is too much in the movie open for discovery, to be put into a review. It has to be experienced.The movie also has a lot more to offer than a great story. Its cinematography is absolutely breathtaking in its beautiful photography and attention to details and historic accuracy. While not quite unparalleled in cinema history, it is certainly one of the most visually stunning movies I've ever laid eyes on.But what really caught my attention on this watching, my fourth of the movie, was the acting. After a good while I suddenly realized that none of the actors had really caught my attention, neither for good or for bad. All of my attention was focused on the characters they portray. What better testament of a good acting performance is there than that? It is especially impressive considering that 90% of the cast are kids. There are very few movies dealing with such a large cast of kids that are able to reach such a level of quality and consistency in their collective performances. Every single character is perfectly cast, and every actor in the movie plays their character to perfection, without any sort of over or under acting, or traits of a bad performance. Their characters seem human and multi layered, and hauntingly realistic. In lack of another word, it's simply perfect. Del Toro truly shows his ability to extract excellent performances from his cast, and especially from his younger actors. In his later, thematically very much related movie, Pan's Labyrinth, he shows it again in the stunning performance by Ivana Baquero, who through his direction carries the whole movie on her 11 year old shoulders.If I'm going to critique the movie on anything I'll say that it is a bit on the slow side. While not a big problem - the beautiful photography and exploration of the characters will mostly hold your attention - there are a couple of moments where the scenes seems a tad stretched out. But really, that's nitpicking. Overall this is a masterpiece of a movie,and one that I highly recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best from Guillermo Del Toro but certainly worth a look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guillermo Del Toro is definitely one of the best directors of modern cinema, at least in my opinion. I have enjoyed all of his work from Pan's Labyrinth (a masterpiece) to Mimic (which was... underwhelming). To this day I have seen all of his work except for his short movies made before Cronos. Here is what I think of The Devil's Backbone.The plot is that in the middle of The Spanish Civil War a kid named Carlos is taken to an orphanage (because his father is a soldier who died). As he makes friends with the other orphans he also starts to notice a ghost of a kid named Santi who all the people running the place thought ran away.First of all the acting is definitely some of the best I have seen in a horror movie for a long time. The Kids especially. Eduardo Noriega does play a good villain and Frederico Luppi also does a good job.If you like Del Toro then I would suggest you pick this up and watch it. It isn't as good as his others (except the fact it is so much better than Mimic) but it is certainly worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than an expertly done ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12-year-old Carlos(Tielve, who you can relate to, he's smart but not snobby, brave, not stupid... and the kid can act(and the relationships between them, and the character writing in general is credible)! So can all of them in this, not only the adults are talented here) has lost his father to the Spanish civil war(the opening of this heaps tragedies upon the viewer... that is but one of them), and so he is placed at a boy's orphanage, and learns that it may be haunted. This is not as scary as other horror(and do note that it's also part drama) out of the region - I doubt it's supposed to be. The way the spirit is used(if the concept of it is very nicely done) doesn't terrify as it could(which is not to say, not at all), and as Del Toro is a master of the genre, this is intentional(you'll find out why over the course of it). The build-up is gradual over the length of this(until the third act arrives, and you won't doubt for a second that it has once it does... it may very well leave its mark on you), with the atmosphere being the main source of frights. This creates and maintains tension highly skillfully. An utterly convincing period piece(the production design is phenomenal!), the unfailing realism helps the supernatural aspects feel more convincing. This is beautifully filmed, and the FX(that are not a fallback at any point in this) are great and thoroughly believable. The surprises keep things interesting, without muddling the plenty of plot in confusion - rather, you'll look back and wonder how you didn't see it coming, without feeling cheated. There is some bloody violence(hardly any of it graphic), disturbing content, strong language(I am again relying on the Parents Guide) and a little sexuality in this. I recommend this to any fan of the director. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Spanish: mysterious, but a bit slow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone has secrets, but sometimes they are dangerous or unbearable... The presence of a distant castle and years of war form a good precondition for a spooky story. Half of the characters are (pre)teen parentless boys, creating more confusion, as we have no case of a child or family movie here. At times, boys think and act more seriously than adults, but their fate is far from being happy.Directing and background are great, colors and music complement the plot in a gifted way, but several scenes are lengthy and repeating, making the freshness disappear. A decent European movie, not suitable for everyone - but definitely for those fond of Spanish style and touch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film, horrible situation, but not a horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very good movie, one of those Latin films that are slow and filled with emotion and colour and make one viscerally understand the characters. It does have ghosts in it, too, and it describes terrible events during horrible times, but this is not a horror film in the sense that you get to see monsters or scared teens killed one by one. Instead, it is akin to Empire of the Sun, describing through subterfuge and the perspective of children the horror of what we do to ourselves during war and loneliness and despair.Guillermo del Toro again teams up with Federico Luppi to make this amber hued film about the terror of being human. Most people quote the words of Casares about a ghost being a tragedy condemned to repeat itself, and of course, this refers to the war and atrocities people are capable of, but let's not forget the reason the film is named "El espinazo del diablo" when Casares explains how spina bifida was called "the devil's spine" and thought to have causes in the supernatural, but it was only the result of hunger and disease. Very appropriate name for a movie about what those two things can make people do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hauntingly beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guillermo del Toro's third film is one of his most beautiful and most intelligent films. It begins with a young boy named Carlos arriving at an orphanage in the desert in order to escape from the horrors of the Spanish civil war. This orphanage, however, has much more to it than meets the eye. There is the ghost of a child who wanders the hallways at night, and his origins aren't entirely known. However, what Carlos and the other orphans quickly learn is that this ghost is not the danger. It is the living that will always be more dangerous than the dead.The Devil's Backbone is not at all like you would expect. It's equal parts drama and horror, and the horror element plays out in a much different way than normal. The film takes the ghost motif and does something highly original with it, and turns the idea of a haunted location upside down, flipping it around to make it something new and incredibly intriguing. I wouldn't want to spoil anything so I'm going to have to be vague about what really makes The Devil's Backbone a mysteriously brilliant work of art. All I will say is that it is not what you would expect.This film is one that you have to give a lot of time figuring out what the catch of the whole story is. It drags on for a while, seeming more silly than scary, but when you realize what the film is truly about you're opinion should hopefully change. It's an incredibly smart film, even if it doesn't seem like it at first. You have to give it a chance and it pays off. It's not explosively engaging or frighteningly awesome. Instead it goes much deeper, even if it takes a while to get around to it. It's a fantastic film that you have to give a chance. It's another beautiful film from Guillermo del Toro that will wow your imagination in ways you never thought possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicely filmed ghost story with some depth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like one of the definitions given here for what a ghost is, "Something dead which still seems to be alive." When this definition is realized as a haunting presence, as Hamlet's father in Shakespeare's play, I find it effective. But in this story the ghost is a concretized central character that exists outside the personal experiences of the character it plagues. That character is Carlos who has been brought to a remote orphanage and school for children who have lost parents in the Spanish Civil War. When Carlos arrives at the school he sees the ghost. This I had a problem with, since at that point the ghost had nothing to do with Carlos or his past.In spite of the fact that I am not keen on this type of ghost story, there was enough here for me to appreciate the film. The story is artfully presented. There are only a couple of scenes dealing directly with the war, but the war hangs over the proceedings at all times--this is brought home by there being a huge unexploded bomb in the courtyard of the orphanage. While the war is not addressed directly it is allegorically played out within the confines of the orphanage, which is run by Dr. Casares and a woman named Carmen. Casares and Carmen are compassionate leftists while Jacinto, the caretaker, is a greedy authoritarian. Casares likes to spout poetry and his impotency with Carmen betokens his impotency in being able to confront Jacinto and the fascist takeover of the country. The allegory is extended by having the children unite in defiance of Jacinto, saying that there are many of them but only one of him.I had a visceral reaction to some of the realistic violence.The actors, including the children, are all up to the task. I was particularly taken with the cinematography--scenes are beautifully composed and lighted. This is the first movie I have seen by del Toro and it is enough to convince me that he is a director to take note of. I recognize the quality of this film while at the same time not being able to fully engage with the story. I feel I would have liked it better without the ghost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not frightening but creative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't one of those traditional ghost/horror movies that most American audiences are use to. But goes in a more character driven direction without the constant jump scares and has some drama that actually works. Yeah, it may lack the tension but it has other good elements to back it up. In fact this is a ghost movie that maybe even the whole family can watch. No, it isn't kid friendly and childish and is far from being a children's movie. But it's deep without being too complex. But if you want to be frightened by seeing ghosts on screen you might be disappointed in that aspect. The ghost in this doesn't make much of an appearance but plays a important part in this story. The actors and actresses in this is spot on most of the time, even the children in this. The actor that stood out though is Federico Luppi who plays the doctor and head guy at the Spanish orphanage, he reminded me of another actor Christopher Lee in a lot of ways. The acting style and demeanor is just very similar. While I liked "The Orphanage" another ghost movie better than this one. Although the style is different but that one was a bit more scary. This is still a solid movie that is worth a watch if you like creative ghost stories. Where the human motives and decisions are actually intriguing. Sometimes a ghost doesn't have to be frightening to be a good ghost movie that is also not kid friendly. Showing that men/women are more evil and scary than ghosts when a lot of people fear dead spirits over people. It's not saying don't trust people necessarily but that men/women are capable of a lot of evil. This is a ghost story that takes place during the Spanish civil war so in a way it's kinda like a companion piece to Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth but this has less special effects. Overall I didn't think this was a amazing movie because of the entertainment factor but it's still a good one that is enjoyable. It might not be for everyone. But recommended for those that submit themselves to movies, rather than submit movies to themselves. Or you may really dislike this one.7.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Del Toro pre Pans Labyrinth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guillermo del Toro directed Pan's Labyrinth in 2006, which is one of my favorite films, and on my top ten list. The Spanish Civil War is also the backdrop with a kid leading the cast, as in Pan's except it is a boy instead of a girl this time. Carlos arrives at an orphanage, waiting for his father's return from the war. The first thing he sees is a bomb in the middle of the courtyard, stuck halfway in the ground. Next, he spots the ghost of a boy near the kitchen who disappears quickly. He shares his comic books with Galvez and Owl, and they become friends. An older orphan namer Jaime steals one of the comics and they fight. Carlo's driver and tutor drive away and an administrator, Cesares, feels sorry for him because his father has died, and he doesn't realize that he will be staying for a long time. A water pitcher is knocked over and the boys believe that a ghost is responsible, so Carlos and Jaime dare each other to go to the kitchen and refill it. Carlos walks down a staircase and hears a voice saying, many will die. Carlos saves Jaime from drowning but is cut by Jacinta, a former orphan. They hear a sigh, and someone explains that it is Santi, a boy who vanished the night the bomb was dropped. Some gold is hidden in a safe which is found by Jacinta, who it turns out, may have killed Santi. A shoot out follows, with Jacinta battling everyone at the orphanage. The orphans organize and fight back. Del toro ends with some poetic justice, and he obviously learned well from this outing, as a good warm up to Pan's Labyrinth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a sad allegorical ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a monster in this film. A monster who wears a human's face and has a man's name. Like all the greatest movie monsters he has in him equal parts evil and sadness. Despite the heinous acts he commits, we feel sympathy for him because he is a product of his circumstances and driven by unmanageable obsessions and desires. This movie is set in Spain in the year 1939 very near the end of the Spanish Civil War. Most of the action takes place in a forsaken boarding school in the middle of nowhere where the sons of dead fathers are cared for by the wife of a dead husband. A newly arrived boy by the name of Carlos (Fernando Tielve) serves as the audience's window into this isolated world where ghosts and secrets lurk everywhere. Through young Carlos we meet the trio of men who are our main characters.Jacinto (Eduardo Noriega) is a young man who grew up in the boarding school where he now serves as caretaker. Jacinto cannot see his own blessings. Even though he has a pretty young wife and a safe harbor from the horrors of the war around him, Jacinto remains unsatisfied. He wants more. Jancito is convinced that if he can just get to the communist gold that the school's headmistress is hiding, he will be able to buy a new life and wipe away the shame he feels. In the meantime, he scowls his way across the school's yard and terrorizes the young boys who must be a daily reminder of his own lonely path. Jacinto occasionally employs young Jaime (Í?igo Garcés) to help him in his various tasks. Jaime is the largest, and perhaps the oldest, of all the boys at the school. He's sullen, profane, and given to bullying those around him, especially Carlos. Despite the bullying, Jaime never comes off as a bad kid. He seems rather to be frustrated and afraid. He has dreams of being an artist and a secret yearning for Chonchita (Irene Visedo), Jacinto's young wife. But he seems all too aware of the war and situation it places him in. Maybe it's not the war. Jaime definitely has secrets of his own. He knows something about the missing boy, Santi, and the sighing ghost that seems to have taken a particular interest in Carlos. Is it sadness or guilt or fear that dictates Jaime's behavior? Is it all three at once?If Jaime is a young reflection of Jacinto, then Dr. Casares (Federico Luppi) serves as the caretaker's foil. Casares is an old man and even the woman he loves, Carmen (Marisa Paredes), the school's headmistress, refers to him as meek. He is meek, but he is also loyal, kind, and smart. He watches over the boys of the school keeping them in line and keeping them healthy, but his true motivation for staying is his unrequited love. He recites poetry to his mirror while he dresses, knowing that Carmen can hear him on the other side of the wall. In a sad way, his poise and manners evokes the nobility of Spain before the war. These three men serve to show the effect of the war on Spain itself. How it is killing Spain's glorious past, warping its young men into monsters, and depriving its children of a future. The conflict between these three men is just a metaphor for the struggle taking place in the world outside their school. The ending gives hope for the younger generation, but a dire hope that comes at a great cost.I realize I've spent this whole review talking about the movie's characters and have barely mentioned the ghost that haunts the school. This is what marks the film as so unique. The ghost is frightening and evocative. He seems to threaten the other boys, but may also just be trying to warn them. He's genuinely creepy, even when the camera is pointed right at him (which can't be said of a lot of movie ghosts). He serves an important function in the story, but is not the central figure in the movie. The mystery of his death and continued existence serves the greater plot, not the other way down. How many movie's have you seen where the supernatural elements are neither extraneous nor do they take center stage at the expense of the story? Not many. That's why movie's like this should be treasured when they do come along.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The devils backbone is a great story and it will keep you on the end of your seat through out the film the storyline will keep you wondering what is going to happen next through the beginning of the film when Carlos gets dropped of at the orphanage too when Carlos meets the ghost of Santi for the first time, even towards the end when Santi and Jaime finally get there revenge. The best actors in this seem too be the children because they seem like they are actually there and it is happening too them. The music in the film builds good tension and most importantly at the right moments too let us knows something is to happen.This is one of Guillermo Del Toro's best pieces, it shows the themes which are easily recognisable such as revenge, love, friendship, secrets and lies, superstition and even who holds the power between the characters. The location of the orphanage in the middle of no where is a great place for the tale of superstition and revenge, The wording the director choose was quite good showing what the actors were all thinking and what each one felt. Overall I thought this was a great film and I would defiantly recommend it to others a, I would give it 8 out of 10 due too it being a little predictable and at some points and the poor acting at some points.</fullReview>

I like the fact that this film isn't scary, but it's the kind of film anyone could be interested in with all of the different themes, secrets and lies, power and control, superstition and beliefs, and revenge, you might not think you would like to watch this film, but there's so much to think about when you watch it, its enough to keep anyone interested. Overall I think this is a film that has been well made and a good film story line, but it could be a lot better if it had more money spent on it. apart from that its quite good tho, its just cheep 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing special for a ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Devil's Backbone is an average film because their was not much going on in it and to be honest we already know what it is coming when we see the ghost at the start and then he was going to help the children out defeat Jacinto when we find out how he kills the boy Santi(the ghost). The cinematography was good it shows a good understanding of how people would live like during the civil war. It has a good use of the theme superstition because you see the ghost a lot and the use of camera-work shows suspense and him.There good use of orchestra music builds up good. Its stupid how that a new boy in the orphanage doesn't even get scared of the ghost after he has encountered him once and then finds out why he is here. The plot didn't have much twists and turns and for me was predictable. Del Toro(director) did a decent job on the film but the cast did OK for unknown stars but its typical children acting.It was low budget and the use of reading subtitles for a Spanish film helped me understand the film more at least and you need it for a Spanish film. Overall it was an average film and could have been better with suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A splendid film, if you're Spanish !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film features excellent acting, from both the children and the adults, brilliant special effects, good use of camera angles and a interesting, original plot, however there is one big setback, its in Spanish. Although it contains English subtitles, it is hard to watch what is happening on the screen while reading the subtitles, making the film quite confusing in some places.Guillermo Del Toro directed the film well and the orphanage looked very realistic, apart from the unexploded bomb in the playground, which wasn't really related to the storyline and I doubt the orphanage would have kept going with the constant threat of a bomb exploding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Devils Backbone was a slow very film. I'm not a big fan of having to read subtitles but after a while I got over it. I was not impressed with how predictable it was, I knew early on who killed Santi. But there was also some really good acting and I liked the effect of having Santi bleeding from the head in a creepy way. The setting, an orphanage in the middle of nowhere was great and created a lot of suspense, especially because its the only setting in the whole movie (expect one scene in the town) The film worked great with themes like superstition and Belief though I don't think the history side of the film fitted with the ghost story side of the film. Guillermo del Toro did well with the directing although wont be watching it again soon, but I didn't hate it. Overall average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ghostly arrival...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the year of 1939, a Spanish Civil War was drawing to an end. An orphanage in the middle of nowhere is left proving great difficulty for owners Carmen and Dr. Caesares, the reason for this being the caretaker Jacinto's revenge on the place. Jacinto's plans to take over the orphanage go very well for him. With new arrival Carlos, a ten year old with a curious mind, discovers the truth behind the death of Santi. I personally felt this film had a tense and griping story line, with brilliant acting from the children as well as the adults.Guillermo del Toro has done a brilliant job here, by including tense and dramatic music that draws you into the film. Isolated setting, ghostly special effects, low key lighting causing a eerie surrounding. Linking to themes such as superstition, revenge, power and control, and secrecy and lies. This film is Spainish so I had to read the subtitles but there wasn't that much to read. Overall I think this was a fantastic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Devils Backbone was a disappointment because i think they had a good story line but they spoilt it with the actors because most of the actors were little children who were to young to know how to act and the adult actors i thought were terrible because they didn't show any emotion when they were acting. The music they used in the film was good because the type of music they used built up tension and horror. I think the cinematography was quite shocking because the setting i thought was a strange one and they didn't use much camera shots they just used standard ones. The themes that they used were superseding,beliefs,revenge,power control all of them was used in the film. Guillermo Del Toro i thought made The Devils Backbone a disappointing film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film with rubbish effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The subtitles go to fast for me to read and they switch be scenes too fast. Also the dialogue is bad and it not the quality as the film should be. The film covers themes like superstition and beliefs, revenge, secrecy and lies and power and control and these themes are covered well. The performance of the actors was bad but the children where better than the adults and the film was a low budget film and was OK for that. The music was good at times building up tension when needed but sometimes music came on when not needed and was silly. The film is really about a boy called Carlos that goes to a orphanage by his tutor and meets a ghost called Santi and he is trying to tell people the secret about Jacinto who killed Santi and through the journey Carlos meets new people and finds things out about other characters. The setting of the film is god for the orphanage because it looks good for the time of year and the bomb in the middle of the orphanage is good because it shows that all the film is a ticking time bomb and everything is ready to set off. The camera work in this film is good at time as the camera shots are well positioned and come on at the right times. The director of this film Guillermo del Toro is a good director but he has made a bad film and this is not up to his standards as he has made some better films than this.This film is a bad ghost story with effects that are awful and the acting is so poor. The story is so predictable and is not a good film and is done cheaply as the ghost Santi does not look real and the acting is poor from the adults.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Devil's backbone was a great film by Guillermo del Toro. Set in the Spanish civil war in a orphanage in the middle of nowhere surrounded by miles of sand and a days walk to the nearest town.A great Spanish film full of revenge, superstition, power and control and secrecy and lies. The performance of the younger actors was a lot better than the older actors which was surprising since most of the were quite young. The music was used well to build up the tension at certain parts in the film. The plot of a young boy named Carlos left at the orphanage by his tutor who soon gets wound up in whats going on inside the orphanage as soon as he find out about the ghost named Santi. The film was very good but not as scary as your average ghost story but still a good film and worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deepens cleverly from familiar beginnings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Devil's Backbone' did not at first impress me: its story of kids, abandoned in a remote orphanage during the final years of the Spanish civil war, seemed a little too trite and familiar. The hierarchies and bullying among the children, the eccentric older staff (with a pretty young woman also in the mix), even (and especially having previously seen 'Pan's Labyrynth', another of the same director's efforts) the supernatural element to the story, initially left me cold. But the film deepens (and darkens) as it progresses; and explores an increasingly messy (but believable) tale of human beings under pressure, and the sadly anticlimactic ways in which life and be ended. It's still not perfect: at times the film seems to be trying a little too hard to tell you of its own importance, instead of letting you draw your own conclusions, and the principal villain is perhaps a fraction mono-dimensional. But it's a rare film in which the best looking actor plays the least morally redeemable character, while the ending is nicely executed, linking together a number of earlier plot devices, and wider themes, into a clever conclusion. So stick with this film through it's early scenes: it rewards in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the connection between WAR and being an orphan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the solid Spaniard director Guillermo del Toro: his first feature Cronos (1993) was a brilliant essay in body horror in which a mechanical vampire transforms an antique dealer (Luppi once more) into a rabid zombie. And Mimic (1997) in which Mira Sorvino fights off giant cockroaches in the New York subway. Now he returns with great form with EL ESPINAZO DEL DIABLO(The Devil's Backbone) a Gothic/historical thriller set in a orphanage haunted by the ghost of a young boy and as background is the disastrous Spanish civil war. The most interesting aspect of this great film is the connection between WAR and being `an orphan':the protagonist(mostly teen-aged boys) live in an isolated place,this doesn't means that they are not away from danger even the ghost child Santi whispers a presage `'many of you will die.'To me war is a factory of ghosts;widows and ORPHANS.The great Argentine/Uruguayan actor Federico Luppi plays a charismatic Doctor who enjoys listen Tango music and to recite poems.I didn't forget that one of the most talented poets of SPAIN was FEDERICO GARCÍA LORCA,who was killed during the Civil War too.This film has one of the most incredible beginnings that got to do with a symbol of War:a bomb(unexploded stands in the centre of the children's playground).Also kudos to the special effects_especially the make up(The digital swirl of dust and flies around ghost child Santi is executed with panache.)Notice one particular scene worthy of Hitchcock : where the boys fetch water in the dead of night, the appearances of the ghost is nerve -racking. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actually, I was very fond of this movie. I thought it made good use of it's non verbal actions. I.e.: It was set during the Spanish War, and you saw the Orphanage Matron &amp; Headmaster taking down the loosing parties banners etc.. And putting up things that the new government approved of in hopes that if the Military arrived they'd see how loyal they are and leave them be. Another thing you got to see was good character interaction. The unrequited love of the Headmaster for the Orphanage Matron. It had some characters that were cliché, the bully (who was fantastic, for being a first time actor), the lover (who was terribly handsome and will leave many thinking Antonio who?). But at least they were treated in a different way than they would have been in a Hollywood movie, they weren't all sunshine happy characters that really meant well, but were having bad hair days. The villain truly was a pain in the devils backbone, that no one was rooting for by the end of the film. For not having a huge Hollywood budget, I thought the director used some interesting choices of lighting, and camera angles. There weren't millions of special effects, but the ones he used were put to good use. It's not a slasher/gore/horror flick. It's got more of a Revolution Western Ghost Story sort of twist. It's worth the rental fee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Close Encounter With "The One Who Sighs"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Devil's Backbone (TDB, for short) has got to be one of the most unexpectedly subdued and unhurried ghost stories that I have ever seen. And that, of course, isn't necessarily a bad thing.Considering, today, how utterly grotesque and over-the-top most movies in this particular sub-genre are, at first I found TDB's very restrained pace to be somewhat puzzling and, yes, even challenging to adjust to.Being so used to your standard horror movie of today (especially regarding "a haunting"), I was fully expecting director Guillermo Del Toro to literally clobber me over the head with an onslaught of unbridled gore, accompanied by plenty of ear-shattering sound effects.But, on the contrary, Del Toro took the matter of an authentic haunting surprisingly calm &amp; easy. In fact, for a good part of the story the ghost was all but forgotten due to all of the personal dramas that came into play amongst the primary characters.Yes. In the long run, TDB certainly could've used a bit more of a profound supernatural-punch to its story, but, with that said, I found its overall eeriness, as well as its unique setting, its fine camera-work and its competent cast delivering convincing performances, basically left me far from feeling let-down or dissatisfied with the final product.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever wondered why coming-of- age AKA teenage films are somehow depressing these days? Too much sunshine, too much corniness, too much happiness. Oh my eyes, they are being hurt so badly from even seeing the poster of those movies!If you are like me, you like evil, thrilling and quirky things, you will love The Devil's Backbone. :DOK, I was kinda wrong, this movie is not a ordinary thriller teenage movie at all, don't let that first impression make you underestimate this amazing piece of work. This movie is even dark and evil for adults!The truth is, prepare yourself for everything you always wish you could have seen more when you were a teenager. We have fierce orphans ( young, naive but very tough! ), a super handsome but evil schemer, a sad and sweet love story ( OK, more than 1 :p ), some heartfelt moments of the affection strangers show to our boys aka little heroes. And most of all, a very very dark secret and a spooky ghost. :3There is no real slashing or over brutal scene ( remember there are kids in the movie! ) but still it can give you goosebumps. The theme is a dark color, with the tense of the civil war surrounds everyone, when the children can't stay innocent because no one would know if they are dead and their parent's lives are unknown. It's tough and not many films can portrait it beautifully, so more credit to this film.Now, I've said too much, you would probably hate me for spoiling things. So if you want something different, harsh yet so beautiful, seek out for this film and enjoy!Score: 4.5/5 ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An original ghost-story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've taken an interest in Spanish films lately, especially those written and directed by Guillermo del Toro. I find something unique about them. "The Devil's Backbone" isn't an exception.Before watching this, I thought it was going to be a pure horror/thriller movie, but actually this is more of a drama film with some horror-elements. Don't get me wrong, because this is a really good movie. The story is intriguing, and you really care about Carlos, the 12-year old boy, who's trying to fit in at the boy's orphanage. But the best aspect of the movie is the mood. It's dark and full of emotions. It's not hard to see that this was written and directed by the same man who made "Pan's Labyrinth", because they share a lot of the same qualities. If you enjoyed that one, I'm sure you'll like "The Devil's Backbone". I liked "Pan's Labyrinth" a little bit more, but this one is well worth watching. Just don't expect a classic horror movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Devils Backbone is defiantly worth watching, even though at times its hard to read the subtitles while watching what's going on. The themes raised in the film are interesting and a revealed slowly throughout the film, this is helped by quality of the actors especially the young actors who play as the orphans. The music builds suspense effectively during the film when the ghost appears (Santi). And the setting is perfect for the story the old dusty building in the middle of no where, in the film it says the town is a days walk which plays a major role in the film. This is the first film I have seen by Guillermo del Toro and I don't intend it to be my last due to the quality of this film, it may have been far fetched at times like how the bomb landed right in the middle of the playground and didn't explode and how did they end up with the gold in the first place, despite these minor faults I enjoyed the film and would defiantly recommend it to anyone who likes supernatural films</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a great film!...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the second review in my mini 'del Toro Fest', if you missed the first one, you'll find it here. I have heard many good things about 'The Devil's Backbone' over the years, but this is my first viewing. I must say I'm impressed with what I saw, despite the subtitles; it's quite an engaging tale. I'll tell you more after this brief summary.Set during the Spanish civil war, the story surrounds the goings on at a remote orphanage. Carlos has been left there after his father is killed at the front and, under the care of the people who run the orphanage, principally Dr. Casares and Carmen; he is assigned a bed and introduced to the other boys. Other people at the orphanage include the surly Jacinto, and the young maid, Conchita. One of the boys, Jaime, is slightly bigger than Carlos and, at first bullies him a bit, but they eventually become friends. On his first night, Carlos hears a noise that turns out to the ghost of a boy who was murdered at the orphanage. This boy, Santi, knows a secret, the place where they are hiding some gold. Unfortunately, Jacinto also knows the secret and is already looking for a way to get it. I'll leave it there or the Spoiler Police will be putting me in that water-filled pit in the basement again.This is, again, a beautifully made film, filled with the little nuances I've found del Toro puts in many of his films. It's very much a character-driven piece and they are, for the most part interesting and well rounded. As usual, it's quite hard to judge performances in a foreign language, but I could find no fault with any of them. Marisa Paredes did a great job as Carmen, as did Eduardo Noriega as Jacinto and Federico Luppi, who bears a striking resemblance to Christopher Lee, as Dr. Casares. Fernando Tielve was great as Carlos, as was Í?igo Garcés as Jaime. Finally, I thought Irene Visedo was good as Conchita, although I thought her character was a little under used.As I've already said, this is very much a character-driven piece, where the interrelationships between the various characters are very much to the fore. Some are quite surprising and, at times shocking. Quite a complicated plot, but well worth sticking with as it all ties up in the end quite neatly. It did, unfortunately fall a little flat in the middle, but I feel further viewings will probably iron out any problems I found there. Over all, though, a rather excellent drama with a great visual style that, at times, can be quite subtle. I really enjoyed it!... Recommended.My Score: 8.4/10.IMDb Score: 7.6/10 (based on 20,256 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 91/100 (based on 103 reviews counted at the time of going to press).FAVOURITE QUOTE: Casares: What is a ghost? A tragedy condemned to repeat itself time and again? An instant of pain, perhaps. Something dead which still seems to be alive. An emotion suspended in time. Like a blurred photograph. Like an insect trapped in amber.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I watched Guillermo Del Toro's the Devil's Backbone released in 2001, so was it good well yeah. Del Toro has an incredible artistic side, which I love. I even enjoyed the Hellboy movies, especially the second one because he creates such beautiful creatures, and imaginary worlds. He has a very distinct visual nature like say Tim Burton. This movie was not one of those movies, it had a creepy little ghost kid in it, but otherwise was just a straightforward good old fashioned ghost story without a lot of special effects. The story takes place in Spain during the revolution at an orphanage, and has mysteries set up in the opening sequence which are slowly solved over the course of the movie. It has complicated characters, and a really chilling feel to it without having any spill your popcorn surprise moments. It is simple, well acted, well written, and very interesting. I think of his films I would rank this second after Pan's Labyrinth. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shining moment for Del Toro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, I must warn you that this isn't your typical scare fest of a movie. Del Toro tends to pull the most out of his actors, pushing them to give the best performance and with Backbone he succeeds. Geniusly, he uses the location of the orphanage (in the middle of nowhere) as a means to create feelings of isolation, helplessness and, believe it or not, even claustrophobia. The movie is methodical in building the plot, allowing the tension to simmer and boil as it slowly gnaws away at us, the viewers. Guillermo del Toro directs with patience, employing the use of effective atmosphere rather than overwhelming us with CGI. His ghost story is a subplot, designed to further the real meaning of the movie but never does it truly take a backseat. Instead, the story lines all become a richly woven tapestry where one loose thread would unravel the next, all being necessary to create the image as a whole. Del Toro allows us moments throughout the film to contemplate and to make the allegorical comparisons between art and reality. And it is here that the movie becomes so much more than simply a ghost story. It almost becomes a narrative on life, greed, passion, war...and the overall, sometimes explosive effects these things can have on people, but more so on our children. While I wouldn't recommend this movie to those of you who only enjoy slasher films, hack n stacks or supreme gore fests, I must say that for any fan of the horror genre this is a must see. Del Toro sufficiently uses the most basic elements to create a sense of haunting and dread, though perhaps not fear itself. These feelings linger long after the credits roll and the movie is complete. The best type of film to compare this to is perhaps The Others or Session 9, although neither of those are quite accurate. If you get the chance, see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget Cronos</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly never liked Cronos at all and was very disappointed that such a film did not live to its enormous hype and potential. Don't let this however prejudicate you against seeing The Devil's Backbone, which in my case Guillermo del Toro had the last laugh.Guillermo del Toro is a director with a lot of potential, Cronos aside, which is quite evident from this film. One of the most iconic personal scenes for me of all cinematic history is Dr. Casares (played by the brilliant Federico Luppi I might add) waiting with a crazed look on his face sitting on a chair with a shotgun in his hands near the end of the film. Just classic. This film almost has a fantasy element to it and don't make the big mistake of judging it as a horror film. Without giving away any of the main plot The Devil's Backbone is one of those must-see films and it is also quite similar to Pan's Labyrinth ,which of course came out later (although I recommend seeing The Devil's Backbone first). This can never be a bad thing but I must say that Pan's Labyrinth is on a league on its own.In conclusion this is one of those films that will have a lasting impression on you. Just see the film to judge for yourself, didn't you give Pan's Labyrinth a chance?. Trust me man, this isn't another Cronos.</fullReview>

The cinematography , Direction, Screenplay are excellent. The story is very entertaining and genuine. All the spirit and ghost themes makes you believe. The story is not the strongest part of the movie and it could have been better (IMO) but I won't criticize because the screenplay is written wisely.The Performance by the entire cast is fine and the violence sequence are pretty genuine. Special effects (though there are few) are realistic. Plus the score is also very fine.Overall, The Devil's Backbone is a pretty amazing movie and compelling not only for adults but children.

		<fullReview>Like the better-received PAN'S LABYRINTH that came later, THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE is a beautifully shot and extremely atmospheric ghost story with an innocent, imaginative child who retreats from the cruel world of adults at its core. There the similarities end. Where Pan's Labyrinth focused heavily on the fantastical, this film is instead subtle and traditional, featuring a vengeful spirit who appears almost secondary to the main thrust of the plot, involving the machinations of various characters in a remote boy's school during the Spanish civil war.Del Toro hooks us from the very beginning with some outrageously good performances from the mostly child cast. I can't imagine a more layered, affecting turn other than the one given by Fernando Tielve, the boy who plays the protagonist Carlos; he's not alone however, as the rest of the actors playing the boarding school kids are exceptional. It's a distinctly visual movie, and it's clear that del Toro put painstaking effort into every composition, every sequence that occurs. The plot is original, the haunting itself refreshingly low key (little CGI on display here) and the film achieves its effect by allowing the story to develop naturally from the characters. Like The Orphanage, this Spanish ghost story puts most efforts from other cultures to shame.</fullReview>

I thought I was in for a real horror thrill myself - but I was far from disappointed after all.There are some horror elements in the movie, even a couple of scares, but it would do this film injustice to call it a horror movie. Without spoiling things, it intensifies towards the end, but not in means of horror. So fear not; the interest comes from something completely different.The beginning is a bit slow, and that's what took 1 star off my rating (I wouldn't give 10 to anything less than something life changing anyway), but give it a chance, and you won't regret it.</fullReview>

For those who don't speak Spanish and do not like to read English subtitles, then this movie would not be for you. But I guarantee if you like a classic ghost story with some suspense, this will be it. This film lets you get to know the characters and care what happens to them.

'What is a ghost?' or so asks the narrator, images of people long dead?, a memory?, an eternal repetition?, or your basic supernatural being. The Devil's Backbone gives us one of each. It is a story which is surrounded by the presence of death. First of all, The Spanish civil war is a foot, and the country is dying at its own hand. A young boy is sent to an orphanage temporarily while his father fights in the war. Of course what is an orphan but one whose parents have passed hence more death. Shortly after his arrival, he finds some friends and some enemies and something in between, a ghost (the spirit of a boy who was killed not too long ago, and has yet to be at piece until justice is done). This of course means more death, as he asks our new arrival to help him take revenge, on the one who did him wrong (I'm not giving any names).Sounds pretty moody huh, well not as much as you'd think. The Devil's Backbone has a fair amount of heart to it. It is also a story about friendship, and the importance of teamwork/coming together. the film is open ended, but it concludes with a note of relative optimism.Though virtually unheard of today, Guillermo del Toro used a similar scenario for Pan Labyrinth. In some ways, The Devil's Backbone is even more potent, and qualifies as a unique addition to the arsenal of Ghost stories, definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young boy is sent to live at a remote boarding school during the worst of the Spanish Civil War. He encounters the ghost of a boy who wants his help in seeking revenge against the person who killed him. Meanwhile, the war rages all around the school, and no one can escape the consequences. A fascinating movie that is both a powerful war story and a surprisingly effective ghost tale. The CGI used for the ghost is simply amazing, and the film boasts a first-rate cast. Unfortunately, it is in Spanish but there are English subtitles. I suspect it was shot for the cost of the food on a typical American movie, but it is rich in production design and camera work. Definitely not for the squeamish or faint of heart, however.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not easy to love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not going to be anyones favorite film. I can't imagine 10 years from now people talking about this. Why? The most likable characters are the young boys in an orphanage out in the middle of nowhere.The adults who own the school have some strange quirks that aren't really explained much. Much was left to question there. It is in the 1930's and there isn't much money to run this large orphanage and the owner's seem irritated to have to take yet another boy. So much for a warm welcome.This is a ghost story and the ghost in question is a young boy that lived at the orphanage. The special effects for the ghost are very good. The make-up is very good as well. However, it isn't all that interesting. It seems trite at times. Even the revenge scene is anti-climactic. The acting is good and it is well shot but that's about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An above average Ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this tale of a young boy being sent to an orphanage during one of the world war's. Although foremost a Ghost story of sorts this movie had far more to it the appearance of a Ghostly apparition. The main plot centres around the backstabbing over a treasure hidden in a vault &amp; the lengths that people will go to obtain it.The acting was decent considering most of the actors were under the age of ten and the setting was perfect, the orphanage is surrounded by mountains and desert which gave you the impression that the children really had no where else to go (Although it was mentioned that the walk to town could be done in a day)The where parts of the story that I thought could of done with more explaining 1) The man that was spotted by the Doctor being executed obviously scared him into trying to get all the occupants of the orphanage to leave but why?2) The unexploded bomb sitting in the middle of the grounds that had no significance to the plot (Although it could of been a sign that the orphanage was marked for death)I also find the back story of the little boy who was haunting the orphanage a little too predictable but on the whole the dialogue, setting, character development and the subtleness of the film proved that this film offered a bit more then your average Ghost story.A high end 6 out of ten</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not a horror film; this is a ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They're different. As they should be. Most ghost stories (most real ones at any rate, rather than the ones conjured by Hollywood to manipulate us) are not frightening. They can be unnerving, but mostly they are sad; their actors are trapped by their times, by the constraints placed on them and their unwillingness to accept them, and then, in the cruelest of ironies, forced to live beyond that time, their lives undone, their tasks unfinished.The Devil's Backbone is about such a ghost. The movie charts the events, domestic and historical, that led to his entrapment and unrest. We learn the dark history of the orphanage in which he lived, we watch as that history implodes into a vicious domestic spiral that winds toward seemingly inevitable catastrophe, fired by the surrounding nightmare of war. Like all good ghost stories, this one has a twist ending but (spoiler) this one is more understated than those of other recent supernatural blockbusters, and its full impact could very well be missed at first viewing. What it ultimately reveals is that the "star" ghost of "The Devil's Backbone" is not the ghost whose story this movie tells.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What is a ghost?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>~Spoiler~The Devil's Backbone is one of those films I've been waiting to see for a long time but never had the money to buy. Well, a friend of mine was kind enough to let me borrow it and I found it to be...a bit disappointing. Were my expectations too high? Probably. Guillermo del Toro is a fantastic director. He's proved to me that he can do big budget action/horror (Blade II) and "small", quiet horror (Cronos). But The Devil's Backbone was not the creepy ghost film I had heard it to be. It's not a horror film. It has a ghost, yes, but it's more about the evils of men who are still alive. That being said, it was a great dramatic story set in war-torn Spain. It's about the effects of war on the innocent, it's a coming of age story, it's a tale of betrayal...it's not a scary movie though. The ghost mainly provides an ending for the tale (a terrific ending I might add). I urge folks not to dismiss this movie, but be warned it's not a masterpiece of horror by any means.</fullReview>

The orphanage features an unexploded bomb in the courtyard, a wooden legged head mistress, and possibly a ghost or two.Prett...(read more)y quickly into the movie though, you realize the Ghost story aspect of the film is one of the least important things happening. Like "Pans Labyrinth", a childhood perspective of supernatural events is played against the grim realities of fascism, greed, and survival. However Pan's had more fantasy than this has scares. What's left however is a harrowing story of survival against horrible odds with realistic and well constructed and performed characters. It's not what you think going in, but it's packs an incredible emotional intensity into a thin plot and premise. If you liked "Pan's Labyrinth", this is a conceptual cousin, check it out</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Del turo is becoming my favorite director,masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The devil's backbone is a absolute pitch perfect horror film. At the same time it is a perfect historical melo-drama. Set against the back drop of the ending Spanish civil war the devil's backbone maintains all the tension of horror films while throwing delicately written moments of drama and even political subtext. Had not this film been in the hands of a brilliant Director like Del Toro well let's face it ?it would never have happened.Del Toro is a hidden talent on the verge of being noticed for the genius that he is. I knew it watching Blade 2 seeing that under all the studio/silly blade stuff was a stylish director who has a amazing sense of visual style. Del Toro look weird but beautiful at the same time. His style is what Clive barker calls grotesque glamour. I respect the fact that he can also make blockbusting ass kickers like Blade 2 and Hellboy and come down to earth and make fantastic works of art like Cronos and the Devil's backbone.If your still wondering if you should rent this film read no further you should. The acting is amazing and even the children command a screen presence. While Del Toro directs action, effects he shows that he understands actors and knows how reflect real life. The story is neat and with out giving out to many details it has several layers. Without a huge excess of over done dialogue the story is told in gothic imagines. All that being said if you are not into subtitled films or are looking for a horror that is over the top with gore or action stay away. In this not a movie, It is cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie which touches on a number of genres, pulling them together, storytelling, horror and suspense, with ease. The storyline is simple but changes as the different genres are encountered. The directing is slow and unassuming, with a soundtrack full of the sadness and emotion of the film. Eduardo Noreiga provides a good performance in his limited role, but all the adults are out acted by the children. Without over acting or being too childlike, they come across as real children thrown into an adult life, and they perform brilliantly. This film is steeped with emotion, from fear to sadness, with the good storyline and some great visuals, it makes for compelling viewing. It's only weakness may be in its short feel, where major developments and scenes occur all too briefly, mixed with the character development just makes the story seem shorter than the actual time it takes to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a collaboration between Spain and Mexico. The story was set in an orphanage during the Spanish civil war. This story is a ghost story, it is very thrilling. It created a lot of suspense without using violence or blood.(possible spoilers) The film says that the orphanage is haunted. There is a ghost that would often groan at night. The children were scared. One of the boys in the orphanage, Carlos, saw the ghost. It was a little boy with a wound on the left side of his forehead. The ghost was surrounded by water, and there were blood flowing out from his wound. The ghost said repeatedly to Carlos, "Many of you will die". Of course Carlos was very scared.At that time, I thought the ghost wanted to harm the children, because of what the ghost said. However, it turned out that the ghost was trying to help the children by warning them about a staff in the orphanage. That staff set fire to many cases of kerosene, and the orphanage exploded. Many children and staff died. The rest were severely injured. Carlos had a second encounter with the ghost after that. The ghost was actually one of the boys living in the orphanage in the past, and he wanted revenge because the staff that set fire killed him. Therefore, Carlos and his friends used themselves as bait to attract the arsonist to the place where the ghost was killed. The ghost got his revenge.I find this film very good. Firstly, the story ending was unexpected. I never imagined that the staff was the person who wanted to kill the children. Secondly, the visual effects were superb. The makeup of the actor playing the ghost part was very good. The water that surrounded him was magically created. I don't know how they did it! There were some bubbles and some gentle distortion of objects behind the "water". There was no real water, but the effect is that it makes you think that the ghost was surrounded by water. Thirdly, the blood that came out from the ghost was very real too. The blood flowed as if the blood was in water, drifting and dispersing slowly. Fourthly, the film showed the wounded people and dead bodies completely, without worrying that it would disturb the viewers. There were burnt bodies after the explosion, and other children were badly hurt. The injuries looked very real. The makeup was outstanding in this film. To sum up, I think this film is worth watching! It is quite unfortunate that the film is not more popular than it should be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Through it's grim visuals, "El Espinazo del Diablo" (The Devil's Backbone) tells a hopefull tail in the midst of a post-Spanish civil war. The premise centers around a ten year old boy, who's father died previously in the war. Now, he is being sent to a remote orphanage to live. As the story unfolds, the boy never really settles with his environment.Throughout the film, each character displays themselves very well. Although, small, these characters are remarkably dynamic and serve as great propositions to the climax. I was surprised at this movies depth, due to the director behind it, Gullimero Del Toro. I say this because after seeing Blade II, I didn't think too highly of him.This film utilizes it's environments with great photography, special effects and editing. It endorses it's story with dynamic characters and good acting, without taking away it's visual complexity.All in all, this is a brilliantly gritty film, with great acting by the cast and all of the children. Beside being a bit predictable, this was one of the better films to come out in 2001!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A well constructed ghost story along the lines of Sixth Sense.. beautifully shot, acted, and directed.. The characters all seem relatively fleshed out.. but what really gets me going is the poetic nature of how it's constructed.. The film is literally a poem, every image thoughtfully put together, every moment within it.. It's not just about being a 'ghost' story, it's about the characters, the situation, the interactions. It's more than a mere superficiality, it's about life, about living in the world of being abandoned at an orphanage, with war happening all around and no where to really go to escape that fact.. it's about strange occurences, mixed with reaction and wonder.This is proof of Guillermo's talent... Someone needs to hit him over the head, abduct him, and put him to work on every Lovecraft adaption he can get his hands on. I'll stay off Lovecraft for now (you can read my Dagon review for that), but regardless of your feelings on this film, it is beautifully shot and designed. It may not be everybody's cup of tea, but for aspiring filmmakers, there's most definitely a few lessons to be had here.I was kind of indifferent to it at first viewing.. but listening to the director's commentary and the making of featurette helped to warm me up to it.. good features on the dvd.. including cool storyboard comparison with live action scenes area.Guillermo Del Toro, the guy most known right now for Blade 2 and Mimic... I liked Blade 2, not as much as the first, though.. thought Mimic was OK, nothing truely spectacular.. hokey ending.. Devil's Backbone would have to be a show off for his potential.. he obviously has a good knack for working with his actors (which you'll hear about in commentary and making of featurette).. just bought this a couple weeks ago with my new 19" moniter and Dark Crystal SE..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taking place in an orphanage in the middle of a war, an empathic viewer is already assaulted with pain and solitude. As this film progresses, the normal cruelties that children can inflict on each other fade away as things more important take precedence. I found this film to be excellently done, and the young actors were tremendous. I found myself looking around, trying to see if I'm alone, and, upon finding I was, being both thankful and worried at the same time. The cinematography didn't seem anything except solid, dependable and good. The few special effects this film boasts were very well done (not overdone, like most American films) but there are several places where light and color stand out like gunshot. Overall, I think this film is an excellent one, and one that is dependent more upon exceptional acting, writing and staging, than upon flashy special effects or cliche storylines. The last lines of the movie will stay with me for quite a while, and send chills down my spine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**** CONTAINS SPOILERS ****Thank God for artful video box covers. For as many people that will be turned off by the spanish language film, some may be tricked due to the horroresque DVD cover and pick up Guillermo del Toro's El Espinazo del Diablo (The Devil's Backbone) in hopes of a good scareThese people are in for a real treat. Although the film may be filed away under the 'horror' section of your local video store, the story is an intriguing good yarn about a ghost seeking revenge.The movie takes place in 1939 Spain and opens with the doors of an overhead bomber unloading a torpedo like bomb towards the earth. The bomb lands in the middle of an orphanage, but does not explode. Instead, the bomb lays in the middle of the courtyard and is the focal point to where all other events unfold.It is soon after that we are introduced to Carlos, a young boy abandoned by men who leave to fight the good fight. Carlos is the new kid on the block, and the kids know it. They tease and beat up on Carlos, and on one fatful night, they lure him to the cellar and leave him there to make his own way back in the middle of the night.It is here that Carlos first sees the Ghost, known to the orphanage as 'the one who sighs'. The Ghost follows Carlos throughout the first half of the movie, never threatening, but always stretching as if to communicate.We learn later that the Ghost is actually Santi, who was killed by the local handyman and thrown into the cellar waters, never to be found. Santi seeks revenge on his killer and looks to Carlos for help.The story, beautifully filmed by Guillermo Navarro, really begins to unfold around various subplots including a one legged teacher and her two loves and bars of gold in the safe which are the affection of the handiman.I will leave the details of the story to the 'plot summary'page, but will instead turn the focus to the wonderful photographed and well paced story brought to us by Director Guillermo del Toro (more widely known as the Director of Blade II). He has taken a ghost story and used special effects only where necessary to ensure that the gore would not get in the way of the various character studies he so elequently put together. There are stabbings, people get shot and poked with spears, however, the most frightening character is not Santi the ghost, but rather Jacinto, the handiman, played by Eduardo Noriega (II). Jacinto is revealed to us slowly throughout the movie and he truly is the monster haunting the orphanage. Jacinto sleeps with the headmaster for purposes of stealing the key to the safe, and both kills his girlfriend at knifepoint and takes the lives of countless children in a makeshift bomb set off for revenge. He is truly the 'diablo'.A high recommendation. This movie is simply good storytelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fascinating movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a horror flick fan, but this was not horror. It wasn't even thriller really because of the story line that goes with it. After reading several of the reviews, I found that people were concentrating too much on the 'ghost' part of the story - leaving them to feel empty, when really, all you needed to do was watch the movie without reservations.Since I am not a reviewer that feels the need to spill the story, I will leave you with one final comment.Many times movies are made and they are over produced, containing too much special effects (obviously ruining the realism of the movie). This film does not do any of that. The characters are developed, the story is engrossing, and it leaves you with one word at the end.Wow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mark my words and check out "The Devil's Backbone"--a wickedly clever little Spanish ghost story that takes place at a haunted orphanage during the Spanish Civil War. Like the best horror films, the horrors (in this case, the ghosts) serve as metaphors for the torn fabrics of human relationships. It's directed by that fat jolly Mexican Gulliermo Del Toro, who first delighted us with that weird vampire flick, "Cronos" which premiered at the Philadelphia Film Festival some years ago and then grossed us out with the Mira Sorvino chasing mutated cockroaches through the New York City sewers flick, "Mimic" and recently sold out to do "Blade II." He's a real talent (and along with that Spanish guy who directed "The Others" could teach over bloated American suspense directors like M. Night Shyamalan a thing or two), and this melodrama/horror film has the long clean lines of a genre classic. It's shockingly deep for a horror movie and has a lot to say about politics, history, and human nature. Should've at least gotten an Oscar nod for best foreign language film. This deserves to become a cult classic on DVD. See it and spread the word.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A stylish, atmospheric ghost story which, unlike so many recent examples of the genre, does not rely on any climactic twist for its punch. The chills and thrills are happily much more old-fashioned here, and quite a bit more bloodthirsty. The performances are universally excellent, and the music, cinematography, direction and visual effects are all first rate (the ghostly rendering of Santi ? the "one who sighs" ? is exceptionally good). Writer/director Guillermo Del Toro's screenplay is in an entirely different league to his 'Cronos' and 'Mimic'. Sure, it has a similar level of tension and fascination, but there's a much stronger thematic vein at work here. Viewers familiar with the history and politics of the Spanish Civil War will find it particularly rewarding, appreciating the story on a deeper metaphorical level. Others will just admire and enjoy this film for what it superficially is: a slick, good-looking and remarkably unsettling piece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ending of a movie can sometimes kill the whole thing. This is definitely NOT the case with "El Espinazo del Diablo." Walking out of the theater, I remember a sense of eerie closure that most movies simply can't provide.There is a certain level of consistency--seemingly unrelated pieces of the story flow seamlessly from one to another, and many of the characters' traits are consistent throughout. Del Toro's method is to expose us to new information about a character slowly, letting us mull over what we just saw before casting a judgement on him or her.Del Toro also is a master of analogy. He is constantly comparing and contrasting all of his characters--sometimes two will seem to be a perfect pair, then the next scene will make one think that those two are actually exact opposites and that a different two make a perfect pair.This movie is more complicated than you average flick. Definitely more complicated than your average horror flick. If I could think of something I didn't like about it, I'd say it. This movie is on a slightly more elevated plane than I am. If I were an expert filmmaker, maybe I could better analyze it for strengths and weaknesses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall I still haven't come to a final conclusion regarding 'The Devil's Backbone'. I guess this somewhat defeats the object of writing a review about it but I (strongly) feel that I will be able to come back to this at a later stage and add more closure.There is a touching sort of appeal to the film; with themes of childhood fear and anxiety. To add strength to this the film happens to be set in a remote orphanage during the Spanish Civil War. It is a remarkably and stylishly well-shot film: - the ribbons draping from the 'UXB' and the scenes that are shot in the basement of the orphange, for example. Like Soderbergh's 'Traffic' there is a realistic ambience here contributed (heavily) from the 'solar-wash' that graces the screen. The audience can almost literally feel the stifling heat radiating from the screen itself. The acting, considering that the cast comprises mostly of children, is satisfactory (and, at times, heartfelt). There are even minor comic moments.The only criticism that I can really think of is that there were too many stones that were left unturned, so to speak. Director Guillermo del Toro seems to add twists and tangents to the films narrative but some of them seem rather 'thin' at best. It would seem that these were merely included in order to make the film appear more than a simple ghost-story. What is achieved though is a supernatural tale interwoven with a few minor and underdeveloped twists. Perhaps the supernatural element could have been elaborated on more; it's not overly 'scary'. Like 'The 6th Sense' the film relies more upon that which we don't see..and after-all, isn't this where we become most frightened?To conclude, 'The Devil's Backbone' is an enjoyable and moderately 'chilling' film. It certainly has a slight degree of uniqueness about itself. What I found initially (and still do) is that there is just something unfulfilling about it; I still cannot place my finger on this. However, it seems to have made a lasting impression and I would definitely like to see it again. Try and see del Toro's 'Cronos' (1993) this is one of his better films. '6'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing, Satisfying little Ghost Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankly, the most amazing thing about this movie is that the director also made "Mimic" (which granted, wasn't awful- but it wasn't brilliant either). Really enjoyed the story- very well structured and appropriately paced- and all the performances, down to the bit parts. Very few big scares but a general ambiance of genuine creepiness and desloateness which is actually much harder to produce- old school gothic in nature instead of today's more common hack and slash shock fests. Much more subtle than "The Others" and infinitely more complete in its explorations of themes and characters. It's unflinching portrayal of the horror of physical violence- without ever being exploitive- was also commendable. Ghosts are scary, but the people in this movie are much scarrier, and the horror rises not out of the supernatural, but out of the natural's surprising ability to become exceedingly unnatural. Overall, a well made and enjoyable film, if perhaps a little unsettling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Literary Ghost Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For my money, a good horror film is never really about what it shows on the surface. Frankenstein is not about some horrifying monster lumbering about, frightening villagers. It is about man's quest to become god. Dracula is not about some blood-sucking fiend terrorizing young ladies. It is about the utter seductiveness of a dark evil that lives inside of us. The Devil's Backbone falls squarely within this gothic, literary tradition. The atmosphere created by the director is wonderfully thick with a slow-moving tension. The performances are more than convincing, they show a cast totally committed to the story they are telling. The story itself is a darkly magical look at the way memories and our past actions have ways of haunting us. And it contains one "action" sequence that stands up to the best of any produced by Hollywood.If you only like horror movies that thrill or have "twisty-turning" endings, you probably won't like this film. And if you're the type of movie-goer who insists on films falling into easily recognizable categories, this one will most likely confuse you (it's a gothic drama, NOT straight-out horror). But if you enjoy challenging movies, a movie that will captivate and haunt you afterwards, a well-made film that will touch your heart and leave you a bit melancholy but satisfied, give yourself over to The Devil's Backbone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The devil´s backbone is a great movie that speaks for itself, so I won´t talk about the plot nor acting, nor direction, which is absolutely great. I will answer to all the people that dont appreciate this movie for what it is... a magnificent work of art. To the people that are sayin stupid and pointless stuff about this movie to be a mexican copy of the sixth sense, let me tell U... y´all are damn wrong. The sixth sense is a great movie, In fact one of my favorites... but there is no point of comparison between these two films, TDB is a movie which centers itself as a drama, and not as horror, TSS is a movie with surprises, and TDB is not, you know everythin´ from the beginning, which for me leads to a higher Lasting Appeal.TDB is NOT a horror film, as many critics and IMDB members have said, it is a gothic drama with a splendorous touch of suspense that Del Toro sure knows how to give. It is not a movie about ghosts, but it is a movie WITH ghosts just like Del Toro has said over and over and that is something that I could notice right away... it is not the classic ghost movies (so forget about it being a copy of the mexican movie "Hasta el viento tiene miedo" because all they have in common is the school) where there are the usual ghosts giving scares and what not, but it is a movie that deals with many ghosts, but in a very unique way...GO and WATCH IT!!!! don´t see it... WATCH IT, OBSERVE IT!!! YOU´LL LOVE IT !!!I want to thank all the american people that could see in this movie a very good piece of art. MEXICAN FILMZ RULEZ !!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got back from a showing of Del Toro's new film "The Devil's Backbone." Before viewing this motion picture, I had really no idea what this movie would deliver. I read some reviews and most of them didn't explain any of the plot at all... If you are into Classic Ghost Stories (the original "The Haunting", "Lady in White"), this movie is right down your alley. This movie is great, and if it comes to St. Louis during its regular run, I will pay 7.50 again. This movie really centers around a young boy, whose father is killed on the front of the Spanish Civil War. He is brought to an orphanage and starts a fight with a boy named Jamie. I really don't want to give that much away however. This movie has Laughs, Scares, and character development. This film is awesome! I wish America could dish out horror movies like this. Then again I wouldn't call it horror. It has really gory parts for the gorefreaks. This is a wonderful movie, even my girlfriend (who isn't a fan of subtitles) liked this movie. This movie will be in DVD collection when it comes out. If this motion picture stops by your local Film Festival, see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fierce, violent film, the Devil's Backbone packs a serious punch. Del Toro's direction is superb. The tension and suspense are paced perfectly. Unlike most American horror films, the situations never seem forced or too over the top. The story is also great. The setting allows for many war references, as we see the internal struggle of the orphanage juxtaposed with the war is Spain raging beyond its gates. The symbol of the large, disabled bomb that stuck into the ground in the middle of the orphanage's court yard, becomes a center piece of the action, and also foreshadows the violent sequences that are to take place in the films stunning climax. All this is supported by a near perfect cast, especially the two lead boys who both deliver great performances. No character seems to be incomplete, they are all well written and each important to the story.This film was getting compared to "the Sixth Sense", but frankly, it blows it away. This film is much scarier and much more polished for an adult audience. One of the best horror films I have seen in along time. Believe me, there are plenty of times to wince and throw your hands over your eyes. This film is worth hunting for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Define a ghost...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is a ghost, is what this film first asks...Well, a ghost is something that remains as timeless as time itself, something that is repeated over and over until the end of time, an object that reminds an event that happened in the past, a promise that someone will accomplish someday, a whisper that some will hear...then this film is a ghost by definition.But at the same time, is as real as the feelings you experience once the lights go out and the film starts. This is not only a fright-scare apparition-thing film, is so much more. It is a mixture of loneliness, and the feeling that is left when we lack our past, at the same time of what it feels when you lose everything but the hope. A film that makes us believe in bad and good souls that keep their promises even after death.Guillermo del Toro once again (yes, I loved Mimic and so what?!) surprises the critics and audience with this new vision, showing his auterism all around, mainly at the pond where we can see the snails crawling around I guess as a signature from him (Del Toro is fixated with bugs, so you know). The atmosphere is not just stranded between fear and desperation but also even in tenderness and on the opposite on extreme evil (hence the devil´s backbone). By the end of the film I left with a feeling of melancholy, sadness but also a certain feeling of peace.For me, this will be a film that I could watch more than once and remain in my collection throughout time, a film that symbolizes something for me, a film that will be a ghost by definition for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The outstanding director Guillermo del Toro take us to his own universe of childhood fears where no one is really who's supposed, and nothing really seems to be as it should. Centered in an orphan in the middle of the Spanish Civil War, the movie focuses in the life of the people (teachers and children) who have to keep hidden there from a war they've lost and from the people who'd like to kill them. But inside this orphan a mistery father more interesting than all this is about to being unvailed... Someone else, out of this world, lives there, and he wont let them go on living there without really paying for what they've done. Gothic, horror, drama and terrific performances is what you find in this pic. Federico Luppi (Cronos) is superb in his performance, aswell as Marisa Paredes (Life is beautiful) or Eduardo Noriega (Open your eyes). The three of them gives us the performances of their lives in a movie you must die to see it. Honestly, this is one of the movies of the decade. In the line of "The Silence of the lambs" or any of the best from David Fincher or Tim Burton.Go and enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At last, a different flavor for those who are fed up with the Hollywood-infested 7th art. At last, a remarkable and a gripping film with no overdose of violence and gore while offering a feast of a combination of superb acting, superb photography,screen shots and a pace that never lets you down right from start.One thing to note: this is not a plain ghost story. On the contrary, not content with a mere show of fright caused by the phantom of a death children, the film succeeds quite well in bringing together various elements such as cruelties of the civil war, school-hood bullying, deception, greed and finally the feeling of hidden lust.The filming locations gives the impression of a mixture of Sergio Leone and David Lean films such as Spagetti Westerns of the former or Lawrence of Arabia of the latter . Outside, one can feel the same bright and scorching sun with some occasional gusts of wind rolling over pieces of shrubs in the Spanish desert. Inside the destitute Hacienda-alike, the young and ambitious and wicked caretaker Jacinto is planning to rob the gold, the only savings left for supporting the orphans and... the revolution. The schoolmaster Casares is torn by the anxiety of anticipation of what will happen to him and to the people around if the Franco's approaching forces take over the village. He is also a Sui Generis type of character who has a penchant for the weird sides of science. For example, he believes that the liquid from jars containing human fetuses may cure his sexual impotence. This latter seems particularly important for him because of his desire for the headmistress (Carmen) and he is quite right:despite her physical inability-to be revealed one morning- she is still an attractive women.As for the central theme of the plot, it is a ghost. The orphanage is holding a secret, namely, the haunting presence of a dead boy (Santi) and several time he appears to harass the new coming boy, Carlos. Could it be that - essentially not so bully- Jaime and other boys do know the mystery behind his death? Was the school maid Conchita going to tell something after her break up from boyfriend Jacinto over discovering what he was up to? A good word for the director: thanks to del Toro's Spanish creativity ? la Bunuel or Dali, we see impressive symbols scattered all over the screen shots such as an unexploded bomb in the court and the illuminated pool in the cellar in the depths of which is lurking Santi.Other ghost films such particularly the one starring Patrick Schwayze and Demi Moore are no match for Espinoza Del Diablo; this is truly an epic film.Kudos to del Toro and to all performers !</fullReview>

The story is a very classic ghost story with the back drop of the Spanish civil war and there are a lot of great themes involved.

		<fullReview>First and foremost, I need to point out that this is NOT a horror story for kids or teens. I know that both versions of The Ring ("Ringu") and The Grudge ("Ju-On") are popular with teens these days, but the level of violence (particuarly at the end) and sexuality in this Spanish movie make it a movie for parents to think at least twice before letting their teens view it.Now, once you realize the adult nature of the movie, it is a great movie and well worth watching. Unlike the two movies listed above, this one is heavy on story and does not just consist of dead things hopping out at everyone to give you chills. Instead, it is a ghost story AND a story of greed and evil--almost like two different tales that are finally woven together at the end.The acting is excellent (especially the kids at the orphanage), the writing is intelligent and the special effects, while not as omnipresent as in some movies, are excellent and really does the job of portraying a tortured ghost. I particularly thought the way the blood flowed from the skull of the ghost was a brilliant touch, though I won't say more because I don't want to ruin the story. And, the movie has one of the best endings I've seen in a long time.Oh, and by the way, despite the word "devil" in the title, there's nothing in the movie that deals with Satan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS** With the Fascist Franco forces overrunning Spain, in March 1939, this orphanage run by a group of loyal Spanish Republicans is in danger of being taken over with it's staff shot for supporting the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War. The couple running the orphanage Casares and Carmen, who lost her right leg in the war, are secretly buying the Republican Forces arms with a large stash of gold bars and now plan to leave the country before Franco takes over. It's there in the orphanage that young Carlos is sent to be looked after. It's also there where he's contacted by one of the orphans who disappeared when the orphanage was bombed by Fascist war planes about a year ago. It turns out that Carlos is given the same bed ,#12, that Santi slept in before he disappeared from the orphanage. That get's Jamie, a orphan who was a friend of Santi, very mad at him. It turns out that the night that Santi disappeared a huge bomb, dropped from a plane, borrowed itself into the grounds of the orphanage as if to remind everyone about Santi's fate. We also later learn that Jamie was at the scene that night and saw what happened to his friend Santi and kept it a secret all this time until Carlos arrived.Carlos starts to see an aberration at the orphanage the first evening he's there that turns out to be Santi's ghost. Santi seems to be trying to contact and tell Carlos what happened to him, it's by now obvious that he's dead, and even more important just who killed him. Wanting to have his killer brought to justice Santi guides Carlos to a former orphan, and now janitor of the orphanage, Jicinto who it turns out was robbing the safe where Carman kept the gold bars. One evening Santi caught him in the act and that lead to Jicinto accidentally, by slamming his head against a brick wall, killing him. Unknown to Jicinto Santi's friend Jamie was also at he scene and saw the whole thing. Jicinto hid Santi's body in a pool inside the orphanage but now the soul, or ghost, of Satni was breaking loose and getting in touch with Carlos. Jicinto for the time being is having a affair with Carmen behind Casares' back and is planning, with a number of his cohorts, to win over her confidence. This in order for him to get the key to rob her of the gold bars she has locked up in her safe. Everything comes together in the movie when the Fascists begin to consolidate their gains and are about to drive the Republican Forces out of Spain. Casares going into town sees that the Fascists have taken it over and one of his fellow Republicans, Ayala, had been captured and is about to be executed. This gets Casares to think that the Fascists have gotten the truth out of Ayala about his orphanage being a front for getting arms to the Republican Forces. Getting back Casares warn Carman that she, and him, will have to leave the country right away before the Fascists come over and put them both against a wall and shoot them.It's then, during all this confusion, when Jicinto tries to get the key to the safe where Carmen keeps the gold only to have her tell him to get lost. Carmen had already figured Jicinto, who stole the gold bars, out for the back-stabbing swine that he is. Casares kicks Jicinto out of the orphanage, at gun point, only to have him sneak back in and blow the entire place up killing a number of people including Carman. Jicinto's fiancée, a teacher at the orphanage, Conchita who also didn't realize what a swine he was also ends up being killed by him when she doesn't want to go along with him and his friends in getting the gold bars. Jicinto back at the now burnt out and battered orphanage to get the gold bars find that their gone, Carmen hid them in her wooden leg, and with his fellow cooks gone,they also had enough of him, and Casares dying from his wounds, that he receives in Jicinto blowing up the orphanage, Jicinto's left all by himself. Not knowing that all this was arraigned by Santi, from the great beyond, to get him into a trap that he set for him. Jicinto finds the gold bars but he's also found by the dead Santi who together with the remaining orphans, including Carlos &amp; Jamie, have him pay for what he did, not only to Santi but to everyone else at the orphanage.</fullReview>

Scenes that are supposed to be creepy just come off as tired and slow.One good aspect though is the special effects (such as they were) which are very good considering the budget and age of this film.However, by the end it is just a below average ghost story which doesn't really justify the acclaim it seems to have gained. I'm sorry to say, but if this was Hollywood fare it would have dropped off the radar as soon as it was released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute rubbish!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After struggling to stay awake through this incredibly painful excuse of a film, I have to say that with even the best will in the world, it is utter rubbish! Where to begin? The awful acting? The tediously drawn out plot? The pointless unexploded bomb? The almost non-existent ghost? No, it's so pathetically done, that it is pointless to even try. The whole story could have been told in about an hour, but instead is padded out with meaningless plot 'development' which even the most dedicated film buff would be hard pressed to stay awake through. This is supposed to be a ghost story, but the ghost is hardly ever seen, only referred to in passing.The film only manages to redeem itself enough to get one star due to the actual quality of the ghost itself, which would do any Wes Craven or John Carpenter film proud.Unfortunately, though, this still does not help lift this film above the abysmally poor level of mediocrity inhabited by the likes of The Gift and Jeeper Creepers.Take my advice, go and watch wood warp instead!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."The Devil's Backbone" (2001) is a well told story that centers on events in one orphanage home during the war in Spain. The story contains a bit of war, life of children in the orphanage house and some ghost story.The pacing of this movie is good. At running time 1 h 45 min i wasn't bored and it never dragged. The acting was good by all involved. The best job in this movie was made by director and set designed. Every scene is crafted very professionally, and settings are very well done. You really feel like you are in the period and in the place. Terrific settings. The story although wasn't really special. And by the way, it's not a horror movie by any means. This is simple ghost story set in real settings (sound a bit crazy).Overall, "The Devil's Backbone" is a good story well told. It's definitely worth seeing once - it's not shockingly good, but it's a compelling picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Precursor to Pan's Labyrinth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guillermo del Toro's El espinazo del diablo (aka. The Devil's Backbone) is obviously a precursor to El laberinto del fauno (aka. Pan's Labyrinth) in style, content and atmosphere. Nevertheless I think El laberinto del fauno is better on all three of those. That being said, I cannot stress enough that I would really like to see del Toro make more of this. The magical realism and child's perspective are excellent ingredients for timeless movies. By making the historical context more horrific than the actual horror components (ghosts or fauns), del Toro subverted both genres. Horror elements are added for dramatic effect against the horrors of real life (the Spanish Civil War in El espinazo del diablo and Francoist Spain during World War II in El laberinto del fauno). On top of that, when observed from a child's point of view, it all gets even more horrific because of the innocence we associate with young children. Because of that both El espinazo del diablo and El laberinto del fauno are some of the most touching "horror" movies I've ever seen. While del Toro's next film Crimson Peak is a return to his dark fantasy style, we will have to wait and see if it brings back some of these defining qualities that made him a great director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Spanish-Mexican Gothic horror drama film from 2001 Mexican director Guillermo Del Toro who is the genius behind 'Pan's Labyrnith', 'Hellboy', 'Mimic', 'Blade II', and 'Hellboy II The Golden Army' as well as the writer of the screenplay for 'Don't be Afraid of the Dark' and tonight's movie is 'The Devil's Backbone'So 'The Devil's Backbone', one of my new favorite horror films, the characters are deep and complex the film is well written and acted the lighting is great the cinematography is never boring the special effects are really good the story is original and creepy the film is ringingly eerie and scary at times the music is fantastic its just an amazing and very sad film. On the gore meter from one to ten One being something like 'The Corpse Grinders' and Ten being something like 'Braindead'. 'The Devil's Backbone' is a 3 its got a decent amount of violence.Not as imaginative or as creepy and darkly whimsical as 'Pan's Labyrinth' is but it is still a very good film on its own accord honestly it's not as creepy as 'Pan's Labyrinth' but its still as good if you like Del Toro's work then your'll like this one! 5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a ghost and a civil war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Pan's Labyrinth at the movies - then again on TV - a couple of years ago. When I began watching this on SBS TV in Australia at midnight I had not checked the guide for the actual title of the movie - quickly did this on IMDb while the titles rolled (very impressive they were too) and realised that as a del Toro film I had better watch it as the ratings sounded good. Everyone else has told you the story - but as there are no recent reviews they do not mention Pan's Labyrinth, which is del Toro's most recent film shown in Australia any way (I don't count the Hellboys in this as they are not in Spanish and I have not seen them). OK "ghost story" is a convenient tag but it sounds a bit cheap for this sort of quality film - and so far removed from the hack American films of that type which the genre suggests. Having already seen Pan, which is also set in the Civil War and has some vicious moments which reflect the period, but is overall more of a "fantasy" (those tags again) it was interesting to see this. They are more than similar in mood and atmosphere - with Pan I went along with the atmosphere and feel more than the story. The photography here is also great and the music/sound is wonderfully atmospheric and makes you really jump at a couple of points (someone already mentioned the hiding in the cupboard scene). The way it is set from the children's' point of view is interesting - although not really a film for children! All in all a very good effort - not perhaps entirely a masterpiece for me as for some other 10's - but I liked it a lot and can recommend it to followers of del Toro's work (now that I have seen two!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Ghost Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally I gave this movie 9 stars but came back to give it 10 stars. Virtually flawless, a masterpiece and a work of art. Not a ghost story, though there is a ghost. It is, as all great movies are, about people not ghosts or special effects. The cinematography is beautiful, the story works on more than one level, and the acting is excellent. del Toro's work with the children is particularly noteworthy and has nothing to do with the ersatz cuteness that is practically required in American movies. The story may work at an allegorical level for those familiar with the Spanish Civil War but, even for those without that knowledge, the characters are realistic and well-drawn enough to draw the viewer in. The mystery, what happened to the dead boy who haunts the school, is interesting but not central as we watch the last days of the school and wait to see which characters will survive its end. I can't recommend this movie more highly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The subject of this movie is the relation with the truth. The form of trust and friendship. An orphanage, war, an ambiguous and definitely danger, a delicate love story and sacrifice. Dutty and passion, fear and expectation. And the last form of revenge. The ghost is only a piece of a large tragedy. The lost of parents, the responsibility for children's'destiny, the physical misery and the refuge for to mimic a normal life. Principal form of this game is the art of silence. The science of forgetfulness or of waiting. The gold and the specter of death boy are the faces of a single coin. For each , the only important thing is the revenge, either is the instrument of this gesture. Moral: a Greek tragedy and Hispanic solitude. The Don Quixote's spirit is always present.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elegant and classy horror masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guillermo del Toro took the world by surprise in 1993 with his debut "Cronos". In that brave effort he gave us a different take on the vampire myth and gathered a loyal cult of followers in the process. Eigth years after "Cronos", and 4 after his better than expected debut in Hollywood ("Mimic", 1997), once again he dives fully in his beloved horror genre and just as he did with vampires in "Cronos" and creatures in "Mimic", he gives his own touch to ghost stories.Set in Spain during the Civil War in 1939, "El Espinazo del Diablo" tells the story of Carlos, son of one of the many men that fought in that cruel war, as he is sent to an isolated orphanage for boys. There, in the middle of nowhere, he'll go through unexpected adventures as he finds out more about the mysteries of the house, including the ghost of a boy, and the bomb that fell in the the middle of the courtyard but never exploded.In this setting, Del Toro creates a story that is amazing in realism and at the same time, as surreal as a dream. The isolated landscape where the story is set is another allegory to the theme of the ghosts and the memories they keep. The movie itself is a meditation about memories.Federico Luppi, who starred in Del Toro's "Cronos", plays Casares, the doctor of the orphan's house while Marisa Paredes is Carmen, the headmistress. Eduardo Noriega gives an amazing performance as Jacinto, assistant in the house that torments kids, and maintains a complicated relationship with Casares and Carmen.The acting of the kids is also worth mention, since they are very natural and realistic in their performance. There is no false perfection as they behave as real kids would do. Fernando Tielve as Carlos and I?igo Garcés as Jaime are the lead stars, and carry the film with the same force as any adult would. It's notorious the care Del Toro had when casting them.The movie displays very good scares as the story unfolds keeping the suspense and mystery until the end. A classy and elegant camera-work makes the movie flow with good rhythm never being tiresome or boring. Also, a very effective mixture of both make-up and CGI effects that works very good, as it's subtle without being weak.The movie is a very special experience, as Del Toro has taken care of every possible aspect of the film. The silent bomb sleeping in the courtyard is a powerful analogy of what ghosts are in Del Toro's world.To summarize, "El Espinazo del Diablo" is an awesome effort by Guillemro Del Toro, that proves that the only thing necessary to tell a story is imagination and that scary movies can be more than jump scares and fake blood; it is an artistic elegant movie and a meditation on what memories mean.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moral struggles amidst atrocious challenges</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guillermo del Toro has produced a marvelous movie with The Devil's Backbone. It's much more than a plain ghost story. It's the story of greed vs decency, of condign vengeance and courage amidst utter forlornness.The story is brutal and eerie from the very beginning onwards. Fernando Tielve introduces 12-year-old Carlos, the main protagonist who suffers from emotional isolation at the very outset. With him the setting is presented, a remote orphanage in the middle of nowhere, run by a curt but considerate headmistress named Carmen and Professor Casares, an old and big-hearted sympathizer of General Franco's Republican cause. It's 1939, and this is the historical background of the story.It's Carlos and the way he fits into the somewhat bleak routine of daily life, the way he gradually triumphs over the bullying and his first encounter with a ghostlike phantom that makes most of the first part of the story. The atmosphere is wonderfully staged, the use of dim twilight and shades, of gradual gloominess and the visual transformation of Santi, the defaced and martyred ghost is superior and keeps you tensely mesmerized.Santi, as he keeps on haunting Carlos, seems to embody a dark secret, to be the incarnation of an atrocious outrage. Carlos, while gradually establishing a feeling of comradeship if not real friendship towards some of the other boys, becomes aware of Jacinto, the orphanage's overseer, who reacts violently when anyone is caught looking around a particular storage room or the basement which is filled out by a dirty well.The second half of the movie leads to manifold brutalities and reveals the qualities of the protagonists' grit. Jacinto plays havoc with the orphanage and kills a great many of the boys. Carlos and his friends then demonstrate outstanding bravery and commitment to their cause as they fearlessly lead off the fight. They retaliate Santi's murder as well as the slaughter of their pals and tutors in a scene appalling in its brutality and laudable in its determination.The emotional implications as the boys exact vengeance display their courage and fortitude when there was dire need of resistance and morally challenging deeds. In this climax lies the major theme of the movie. Santi, symbolizing the legacy of any outrage, Carlos and his friend Jaime, the strongest champions of moral virtues and consciousness, Jacinto, the greedy and ruthless beast and Professor Casares, the caring and stout fighter for fairness and his boys' well-being, they make up the story. Thus it is not an ordinary ghost movie, but rather a story of individual struggles and individual human virtues let off at each other amidst hostile environments and atrocious challenges.Wonderful accomplishment, highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film? Absolutely! Spooky film? Nah!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, I thought this film was great. It's one of the best melodramas i've ever seen about Spanish war. It's a very sensitive movie with a lot of close ups and analytic editing surrounding the life of the orphans. It gets you into their universe and makes you feel what it was about to be an orphan in times like these. There is also a metaphorical level of political and historical denonciation in this. That's how you make a melodrama interesting, you clearly put up history into the roles of your film. Eduardo Noriega did a great job being the conceptualization of war, totalitarism and hate. Frederico Luppi as the protecting father was once again awesome(he always shines in Del Toro's works).Thing is...what was billed as a horror movie isn't really horror. I mean there is what? Four scenes with the dead boy? Best thing yet is that when he's not there they are not even talking about him! This film could have got on without the use of a ghost story. Sad thing in this is that the special ghost effects are great, Santi is a creepy young fella. Del Toro is so scare to burn every away with horror like Hollywood does, that he only puts some here and there. I know it's a great film but I feel frustrated because handled better, it could have been the best film I ever seen in my life. It has nothing to envy to American classics of New wave europeans.See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotion suspended in time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had mentioned before that so many times people are so angry or uninterested in horror films because all it does is show scared people reacting to extraordinary events. It normally shows limbs flying everywhere or blood caked against the walls. Well, what would you say if I offered you a film that not only gave you a horror story, but also a very character driven stories. What if I were to show you a horror story that could possibly happen to you, or at least you feel that it could happen? Well, look no further, because I have found it in a little Spanish horror film called El Espinazo del diablo (also called The Devil's Backbone). There were several reasons why this film really worked, and worked well. I am going to list the top five reasons that this film worked so that you can take it back with you, and watch this film, and see what direction the horror genre is headed and how it will soon be a bigger part of cinematic culture.1) The obvious -- the Bomb. This was in nearly every shot, and provided so much for my mind. Why didn't the bomb explode? Sure, there are scientific reasons, but when researched further, you may see that it goes so far beyond that. It is the root of this film. It is the biggest symbolic reference in this film. What is the bomb you may ask? My question to you is ... WHO is the bomb? When I watched this film I really felt that the bomb symbolized Jacinto. When Jacinto arrived it was like the bomb arriving. It has the power to destroy, but has yet to. It is dormant, waiting for the appropriate time to wreak the destruction ... just like Jacinto. When he arrives he does not immediately kill, but waits for the perfect time. But, like the bomb, Jacinto has the ability to kill without remorse. It kills to fulfill its mission, which is all. Also, this bomb not only symbolizes Jacinto, but also Santi. Together an unknown force joins these two. The common bond ... the bomb. In the beginning of the film, Carlos immediately runs to the bomb because there is some attraction to it. There is no fear, just an unvarnished desire to know more about it. This is the same for when Carlos first meets Santi, fear is surrounding him, but instead he would rather learn more about Santi and help him.2) This wasn't the normal horror film plagued with beautiful scenery and screaming children, this was almost a fresh retelling of the book The Lord of the Flies. At times I had to ask myself if I wasn't watching a literal interpretation of this book in this film. There are some major differences, but some of the overall themes remain the same. Director del Toro takes a big leap with this film and succeeds where others have failed. He doesn't clutter this film with flowers or filler, he instead tells the story as it should be told, and for that I have so much respect for this film.3) The way that del Toro filmed this movie was amazing. I wasn't expecting the second half of this film when I first began it. I wasn't ready for the death of the children, or the sudden death of the adults. I sometimes get so used to Disney-fied storytelling that it almost jolts me when I am reminded that it can be dark. A story cannot always be happy, especially when you put characters out of their element. I longed to see the ghost, and del Toro wasn't afraid to show him. So many times in today's cinemas we have to wait until the very end to catch a glimpse of the evil spirit that has been causing the chaos ... not in this film. Immediately upon arrival at the school, we see (with Carlos) the spirit of Santi. It really helps build the tension much better than waiting until the very end.4) I loved the theme of revenge in this film. This goes back to my explanation of the common bond between Santi and Jacinto. While the bomb symbolically represents the both of them, characterally, they both are very similar. Both want revenge, both grew up in this school, and both are hopelessly wandering through life. I really though that it fit perfectly that these two characters were so similar, yet hated each other so much. There was a fear there that was kept hidden, but as you the viewer realized, it was always there. Only del Toro could have pulled this off.5) Finally, the actor Eduardo Noriega did an impressive job on this film. I had recently seen him in the film Abre Los Ojos (aka Open Your Eyes) playing the part that Tom Cruise would later improve, and was unimpressed, but upon seeing this film ... I have been reborn. . He has this air of malevolence about him. His intense, dark eyes are windows into a tortured soul. His voice is venomous. He even has an exceptionally evil grin. If someone were to smile at me the way Jacinto smiles, I would go pale and shrivel. At first I was very worried when I saw him on screen, but by the end of the film ... I was nothing but impressed!!! Grade: ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the title you wouldn't suggest what a sophisticated, well balanced and poetic piece of cinematic art awaits you. Although labeled as a horror movie, this film is much more than that. Yes, there is a ghost story, but it only serves as the outline for much more intriguing plot. The tale of a Spanish orphanage in the middle of nowhere with the social background of the fascist Franco Regime starts with slow pace, but becomes increasingly dramatic as it unfolds. Compared with director Del Toros works for Hollywood, this Spanish/Mexican production is far superior on many levels: Not only do the pictures carry a poetic atmosphere which clearly defines them as art, not only entertainment; the actors are also great, especially the young boys act well, the music score fits perfectly and, most importantly, the film does not aim to deliver "easy cinema". It is, in total, the complete opposite of what superficial popcorn flicks are all about. Recommenable as an excellent display of cinematic art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ghost in Mexican-director Guillermo del Toro's beautiful new tale of the supernatural owes more to films like The Haunting than to the malicious spirits that inhabited Poltergeist. Santi, the sad ghost of The Devil's Backbone needs to tell his story to the living so he can find peace and exact his revenge. Set during the Spanish Civil War the story is built around the curiosity of Carlos (Fernando Tielve), a twelve-year-old boy delivered to a remote orphanage after his communist father is killed. Once there he unravels the true story of `the one who sighs,' a ghost that haunts the basement. Guillermo takes his time with the story, letting the feeling of anxiety and dread build slowly, layering the atmosphere with thick slices of mystery and the supernatural. That coupled with one of the best realized screen ghosts of recent memory make this movie both unsettling and worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Devil Backbone is an intriguing and suspenseful ghost story.Guillermo Del Torro has built an impressive track record. His first American film "Mimic" contanined a sense of style and brought suspense to a worn and tired genre. With this film he goes for a more subtle approach. The acting here is impressive. I can not honestly rate these actors seeing as how I have not seen any of the other films but I intend to see "cronos" which is Del Torros first film and features Fredrico Lupi. Anyways, the main theme of this film is what is a ghost? When watching this film one must pay close attention to the opening narration to truly undestand the ending which I will not reveal (the only thing I will say is that it is a great homage to John Fords "the searchers"). The story is inteligently crafted and all the characters come off as three dimensional whiel a lesser horror film would focus more on gore and shock tactic than character development. The sense of tread that flows through the film is well mainted by the "ghost" and unexploded bomb in the courtyard. This is a sad mournful ghost tale that is well crafted. This should appeal to those that enjoyed "the sixth Sense" and "The others" but those looking for a happy ending should be advised to stay away. In the end though, dont listen to me and watch this film and decide on your own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling supernatural drama full of atmosphere and invention. Another excellent movie from the director of Cronos.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Talented Mexican director Guillermo del Toro made one of the most interesting and underrated horror movies of the 1990s, 'Cronos' an original and inspired vampire tale. After making his first foray into Hollywood with the slightly disappointing monster movie 'Mimic', he returns with his most accomplished and atmospheric movie to date, 'The Devil's Backbone'. While the movie has a crucial supernatural element, some gruesome moments and several genuine scares, to label it strictly as a horror movie is misleading and only gives half the picture. Set in the 1930s during the Spanish Civil War, it is a story of a young boy dumped in a run down orphanage. The boy attempts to find his place among the strange and unfamiliar surroundings increasingly aware that he has been thrown straight into a world of mystery and intrigue. The boy is played by talented newcomer Fernando Tielve who impresses with his natural talent and believability, as does the rest of the child cast. The adults in the movie are even better, led by 'Cronos' star Federico Luppi, and veteran Marisa Parides (whose career goes all the way back to Jess Franco's 'The Awful Dr Orloff') as the school's melancholy teacher and tough headmistress. Equally impressive is the hot headed handyman Eduardo Noriega, the star of Amenabar's equally highly recommended thrillers 'Tesis' and 'Open Your Eyes'. Noriega may just turn out to be the next big thing if these three movies are any indication of his ability and passion. Altogether, this is a wonderful movie experience that holds you from the word go and doesn't let you go until its haunting climax. A superb movie that is not to be missed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good SCARY movie from SPAIN!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie delivered the goods. I loved the way it was shot in BLUE and then in daytime hues. The ghost plot wasn't quite as "twisty" as the OTHERS or SIXTH SENSE. However, the plot was very good. This movie was about some ORPHANS during the SPANISH CIVIL WAR. They get scared a lot and some mean guy named JACINTO kills one of them. Jacinto kills lots of folks. At first, he was nice and then suddenly he has no problem just KILLING the kids. As far as the lady with the LEG goes, she was great. She and the wise man with the beard had a special love. Also, what's the deal with that thug named PIG? Isn't he from ED WOOD? There is indeed a GHOST in the movie (a very freaky looking ghost at that). The sub titles didn't bother me either. I liked the ending as well. I would suggest this movie to anybody who likes a good thriller and is in search of something different that what's out in HOLLYWOOD today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is about horror. A not so distant feeling. A very familiar place where you can live from time to time. Horror can be fictional or real, but in this movie, both kinds are related. You can say real horror is truly horrible and fictional horror is just a way to deal with the first one. But there is also another level of depth. This one concerning personal and social fears.The movie is well crafted: from start you get the feeling of being there as a pasive witness, knowing what lies ahead and unable to do a single thing about it...just watch.Good direction, good acting, good ambientation. Excellent movie. Del Toro's outdone himself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Devil's Backbone tells the story of a small shelter for young boys in the middle of a desert at the time of war. They are not jailed in, and are free to leave whenever they like. The outside world is very dangerous for them so they pretty much stay secluded from all of it.The only problem is that there are also dangers on the inside, just not so noticeable. Secrets? Lies? Deceit? At the bottom of it all, a very smart group of unsuspecting young boys.Some of the best effects I've seen in any film. The innovative story telling abilities of director Guillermo Del Toro are undeniable. A must see for any fan of well made films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...the best foreign film I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Spoiler warning just in case.)This movie is titled in English as "The Devil's Backbone." The main characters are Carlos, Jaime, Jacinto, and Santi, as well as Owl and Gálvez. It is about a boy, Carlos, who is left at an all-boys orphanage in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. There he meets Owl, Gálvez, Jaime, and Marcos. Jaime is a bully for the most part, with a terrible secret. Carlos sleeps in the bed of a boy who disappeared, named Santi (bed 12). From there on, a story of intrigue and jealousy ensues.I don't think I could have appreciated this movie as much if it hadn't been in Spanish (because it took place in Spain, and I'm a dork about these things.)Here's my breakdown:1 - Dialogue. The dialogue in this movie was pretty well-written. The boys cussed, and although it was disconcerting to see the younger ones swearing like sailors, I suppose that since they weren't taught "proper" language, it's believable. Especially in the company of other kids, we never really care too much.2 - Plot. The plot in this movie is so intricate that I am surprised I understood it. There is so much intrigue and mystery and anger involved in the tale, and the fact that it wasn't only the one boy (Carlos) who was wrapped up in the entire plot made it considerably believable.3 - Special FX. The special FX were pretty damn good, actually. The only ones that they really used were for Santi, and they exceeded my expectations (after all, I got this in the B horror flick category). Guillermo del Toro (director) did a very good job illustrating what happened to Santi, even before you knew exactly what had occurred.4 - Theme. The theme of this movie was very interesting. It was very plausible, and there was actually more than just one. There were themes of love, of hate, of greed, of sorrow, of fear.. all intertwined to give the movie a feeling of realness.5 - Acting. The acting was excellent, for mostly being comprised of little boys. All of the boys were wonderfully credible, and they weren't over-the-top in any way. They were perfectly well-rounded little boys, albeit they were orphans during a civil war. The characters are what truly make the movie, and they are the kind who you will feel strongly about even before the end of the movie.6 - Overall. This movie had a wonderfully chilling effect overall. It is considered a horror movie, but it makes you think more than the average horror flick. The plot is the kind where you look back and go "oh my god," and it's complicated enough that you need to see it more than once to catch the full effect of it.It must be obvious now why I gave this movie ten stars, and would give it more if I could. I recommend you see this movie, whether you know any Spanish or not (it has subtitles, don't worry). It is the best foreign film I have ever seen.</fullReview>

In this sense it is the truest ghost story of all, since injustice haunts us even after it has been righted. There's no returning to normal; instead, one must remember the crime and its victims. That's only possible by constructing a narrative of the past. This film provides the clearest expression of the moral importance of history I have ever encountered. Go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exorcising demons...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What is a ghost?" the (surprise) narrator asks. "An instant of pain... An emotion suspended in time." Like PAN'S LABYRINTH, THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE is set during the Spanish Civil War- and, like PAN'S LABYRINTH, it presents two parallel worlds: the worlds of Children and Adults. In THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE, our hero, Carlos, arrives at a walled-in orphanage in the desert. There's an unexploded bomb in the courtyard, and it ticks, leading some to believe that it's somehow ALIVE ("Listen to its heartbeat," the bully Jaime suggests at one point). Carlos winds up being assigned to bed number 12- the bed that once belonged to the disappeared boy, Santi- the "one who sighs." The Adult world makes its presence felt when several rebels are stood against a wall and shot. Del Toro doesn't isn't squeamish when it comes to these kinds of incidents (see PAN'S LABYRINTH): the Real, Adult world inevitably crosses over into the Fantasy world(s) of Children- often harshly. "There is no afterwards," Dr. Casares, who runs the orphanage, realizes when he witnesses the killings: the Revolution- for him- has come home to roost. As ever, Del Toro employs the Mario Bava/Dario Argento influence to great effect. THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE is an exceptionally beautiful movie, and there's not a single bad performance to be found. One can't help but wonder if Del Toro is exorcising some personal demons along the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I almost cried after watching this film. The story of Carlos &amp; other boys at the orphanage touched my heart. Here the word "Ghost" is used as an allegory. The ghost of the little boy Santi isn't supposed to scare you or make you feel creepy. The tragic death of Santi at the hands of Jacinto actually gets your sympathy, I felt very sad for Santi.On the other hand, Carlos doesn't even know his father died at the war-field but unfortunately he was left at the orphanage, estranged from his dad. Jaime was so scared of Jacinto that he couldn't tell anyone about Santi's death, but in the end he fought bravely against Jacinto.Special mention for Dr. Casares, in the end he helped those boys to fight against Jacinto &amp; his men, but as a ghost. The definition of a "Ghost" by Casares is just perfect. In this supernatural film I felt sad for the ghosts as there is a tragic story behind their death."What is a Ghost? something dead but still seems to be alive" I give it 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shrapnel damage from the most dangerous bomb of all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Devil's Backbone is essentially a companion piece to Pan's Labyrinth, also by Guillermo del Toro (best known in the English-speaking world from the Hellboy movies). While Labyrinth mixed fairy tale fantasy with a grim war-torn storyline filled with mortally threatened children, Devil's Backbone replaces the fairies with ghosts --- One film critic at the San Diego Reader called the movie "Not at all scary" ---- I would think ANYone would be scared out of their wits by Backbone, not so much from the supernatural elements (which, as in Labyrinth, may or may nor be merely imagined by children- the clues are there for those who seek them) but rather from the horrifying wartime realities portrayed. The unexploded bomb that sits in the middle of the village-slash-stockade is only a portent of the impending horrors to befall most (or rather ALL) of the characters - though the missile itself never explodes, nobody escapes the inevitable and ominous shrapnel of the civilized/educated world exploding into barbarity around them.I rank Pan's Labyrinth among my top ten most-watched and most-obsessed over films. I just today watched Devil's Backbone for the first time, but I have a feeling it'll grace my player several more times this summer --- it's already creeping under my skin and burning its startling imagery into my brain, much like Labyrinth did (and still does). Worth checking out!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A supernatural thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Espinazo Del Diablo has a very odd and interesting gallery of adult characters:Don Casares,;Mrs. Carmen (the beautiful Mrs. Marisa Paredes);the fretful "Jacinto",a froward thug.All these characters had a second,and hidden, dimension,an unconventional one,that makes them fascinating,and that also gives the movie a strong fragrance of melodrama.Being a thriller that features the hostile ghost of a child,it reminds of Nakata's DARK WATER,and,remotely,of the SHINING;and being a recent film about children and childhood during the Spanish civil war,it can be reported to Cuerda's LA LENGUA DE LAS MARIPOSAS.With the last,the differences are extreme.While Cuerda's movie was not deprived of patronizing "pongs",ideological frippery and shabby leftism,schematic and conventional in certain respects,Espinazo Del Diablo is simultaneously straight and ambiguous,a superior work of art.Cuerda made,after all,a lot of bad pedagogy,while Guillermo Del Toro is penetrating and perceptive.The goings-on in "Espinazo ..." are thrilling.There is a child,and there is a protective adult (as in JL Cuerda's LA LENGUA ...,as in Nakata's DARK WATER),and there is a menacing adult (as in SHINING).Both Hideo Nakata's and Guillermo Del Toro's movies are powerful melodramas,to be cherished as such;they are both in my top of excellent movies;whereas Hideo Nakata's is more frightening,and minimalist,restrained,Guillermo Del Toro's is more lavish,baroque,picturesque.The narrative's movements are fluid.The characters show a facet,then,suddenly,another.Very well drawn,indeed,and strong.Their epic interest results from a concise analysis.They have their gall,their oddities,their physiology.Life-sized people.The effect of several twisted,weird people adds to the effect of a weird story.Don Casares and Mrs. Marisa Paredes are the protagonists of some of the strongest scenes:like Don Casares drinking the nauseating,abhorrent liquid;or,the same scientist lying, in front of an open window,lingering,waiting for the gadabouts,the gun on his old knees,while the music plays.Or,earlier,the same Don Casares witnessing the killing of a few belligerents.These are things that impress,and I liked them,if there is any need to mention that."Espinazo ..." is not an excellent thriller because it tells about the ghost of a child;it is excellent because it is very well done.I saw some were more impressed with the "horror content" of "Espinazo ...";I was more impressed with its surreal beauty,and with the displaying of the mysterious facets of a small world,that of an institution,and with the portrayal of some people's,their uncanny secret lives.Isn't this even more beautiful?And it was a joy to watch Mrs. Marisa Paredes in yet another first-hand role.Watch this film,because it is excellent in every respect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chilling Ghost Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Murder wont stay hidden or buried...that sums up this chilling, visually stunning story.This is a film that takes place during the world war - a little boy named Carlos gets dropped off at boy's orphanage to be safe from the impending war. At this orphanage are young to teen boys doing what you'd expect young to teen male orphans do in a time of tragedy.Carlos makes an ambivalent friend with one of the older boys, Jamie. Jamie is somewhat a bully, somewhat withdrawn, very artistically talented and is the keeper of a grave secret of the orphanage. During one of Carlos' adventures with Jamie, Carlos runs into a ghost that has been walking the orphanage for a while. This ghost of a little boy named 'Santi' is one of the best interpretations of a ghost and a story you will ever see in a long time. The Director, Guillermo del Toro, doesn't go for your traditional appearance of a ghost - the mere presence of the little boy 'Santi' ghost tells you the story of what happened to him - it is that detailed, that chilling. And when it's revealed as to why this little boy 'Santi' is a ghost, you'll think back and say: "Now that's amazing!" The story is a good one as well - it gets into all the elements of human emotions of that time: old age, love, fear, death and greed. The school is run by a stern and devious headmistress with one leg, an older but wise doctor and accompanying them is a wonderful, young female assistant (Carmen) and a male caretaker who is as evil (...and sexy) as they come. This isn't your run of the mill war drama, or ghost story. It's paced well, keeps you interested, has you really care about the characters from beginning to end.If at all possible, view it in it's original language and wide screen, it's a wonderful piece of work!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent and suspenseful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen some really, really bad horror films recently, it was refreshing to see a satisfying storyline pan out with some decent suspense en route. Although the treatment of the children's circumstances was handled very briefly (orphaned by the war, short of basic amenities and threatened with discovery), tension was built from a very early stage thanks to effective scenery, lighting and sound. When the lead child tries to break out of the locked kitchen pursued by something horrific, I found it difficult not to share his terror. Compared with a very similar scene in Fulci's 'House By The Cemetery' which was both laughable and inexcusably bad, this was in an entirely different and superior league.There were shades of Sixth Sense about the film; with the unexploded bomb's centrality and the chilling spoken warning, some similarity with Donnie Darko. But this film stands on its own merits and is well worth investigating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful, Stunning, Genre Bending Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Devil's Backbone is the antithesis of the Hollywood Big Picture. A beautiful movie, with a large cast of equally important characters who dictate the pace as the story unfolds. The amount of time devoted to character development is really quite astonishing ? and may be slow moving for many American viewers. Another anti-Hollywoodism is director del Toro's refusal to confine his film into a specific genre, I've read and heard complaints from a number of U.S. viewers (and friends) "he doesn't make up his mind if it's a horror film or a drama." The beauty of this picture is that it shows that life can have supernatural elements to it; that everything can't always be explained away by science ? not even by men of science. del Toro captures the wonderful horror and cruelty of innocence, sexual desire, romantic longings, dreams of fame and fortune, the atrocities of war and sets them in an orphanage far removed from the rest of the world ? yet deeply scarred and affected by it. Throughout del Toro endows his film with heightened tension allowing us that giddy nervousness that the greatest horror films provide. One of the best of these occurs when Jaime and Carlos sneak out, stealing to the kitchen in the dead of night, to refill their water pitchers which the ghost has emptied out. (It'll make you think twice about getting up in the middle of the night for a drink of water!)del Toro isn't afraid of using an abundance of symbolism either. Far removed from civilization the orphanage is dry, parched, dust laden, yet so much of the film is filled with liquid, be it the enormous pool-sized well in the basement, the ghost Santi's liquid environment, Dr. Casares jars filled with rum and human fetuses (cocktail anyone?) or the rest of the cast's blood, sweat and tears. The "dead" bomb in the middle of the courtyard serves the same role as a statue of the Madonna would in a more standard setting, a silent observer, a mysterious presence, something come down from the heavens and is equally as dangerous as any religious icon. A brilliant stroke. At turns violent, heart warming, humorous and frightening, The Devil's Backbone, for those who give it the opportunity, will unfold before you like few things you've seen. Stunning.</fullReview>

Yes it is set in the Spanish civil war, but as scary goes it wasn't, instead it tells a compelling ghost story that grips you through its telling, although it wont surprise you in its ending, the result of the boys learning the true facts of 'Santi' and how he still walks the corridors at night is well told, well acted and for fans of subtitled film's, this is a great one to watch.</fullReview>

The child actors are truly impressive in the way they convey changing attitudes and the onset of maturity. The film is very even handed with character development, each major character goes through their own confrontation with a personal loss or fear. The film certainly feels richer for the way each character is drawn out. One standout scene features improper use of embalming fluid, it is rather disgusting, yet also oddly touching because it provides a great character moment. Towards the end some of the imagery and plotting reminded me of other great stories such as Lord of the Flies and Night of the Hunter. This film has the timeless quality of a fable, much like those other works. The film is so rich and steeped in Spanish culture and history I would almost call it an adaptation of a novel that was never written.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in the dying days of the Spanish Civil War, El Espinazo del Diablo (The Devil's Backbone) tells the story of youngster Carlos who is admitted into an isolated orphanage, unaware that his own father has fallen in battle. He gradually discovers the dark history that lies with him in bed number 12 of the orphanage, as the secret of Santi - the ghost-child who roams the corridors - is unravelled. Amidst the backdrop of war, Mexican director Guillermo del Toro paints a sensitive picture of a world without a patriarch, of the delicate struggle of a group of young boys who strive to be their own masters. The Mexican fascination with the arbitrariness of death and the absent father figure shine through the arid, hostile setting, cut off from civilisation both geographically and politically.However, it is del Toro's sheer enthusiasm for the horror genre that is of greatest evidence in this film. It is a conventional ghost story showing the deceased wandering around the building, haunting the residents and not resting until his personal mission of revenge is complete. We see the classic scenarios of boys locking themselves in cupboards to run away, dark shadows behind curtains and so on, but del Toro has breathed new life into an often jaded formula. The ghost-child himself looks strangely convincing in his pain, with transparent bones and blood gushing out of his forehead. The sheer isolation of the orphanage, the mysterious unexploded bomb that landed on the same day as Santi's `disappearance', and the ominous presence of the resentful Mr. Nasty, Jacinto, all lend an eeriness and sense of uneasiness to the film. It is an unreal limbo world where the dead can walk amongst the living, yet the regular flashes of gunfire bring the viewer back to the reality of war.The theme of the ghost wispily infuses itself amongst all the characters and haunts them on differing levels. As well as the physical presence of Santi the ghost, the inability of the orphanage to play its role as a replacement protector for the children haunts the adults in charge. Casares, the wise old father figure of the orphans is symbolically emasculated by his impotence. He is haunted by his inability to proclaim his love for the widowed owner of the orphanage, Carmen. Jacinto the evil caretaker has been at the orphanage since his own childhood, and resents his own lack of father and the place he has been condemned to for so long. In the background a war is being fought to try to exorcise ghosts and establish a new father figure by the name of Franco. The film brims with ghosts, lost childhoods and lost lives. An intelligent, precise and perceptive account of orphans recovering the irrecoverable, an eerie, supernatural study in the relationship between life and death, but above all an absorbing good old-fashioned ghost flick with a refreshing facelift. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film - not so much a ghost story as a human nature story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really looked forward to seeing this film after reading an interview with Guillermo del Toro in the Jan 02 issue of Fangoria. I wasn't disappointed. Del Toro made a point in the film to contrast the brutality often found in human nature with what he saw as the more subtle nature of the supernatural. The movie's setting during the Spanish Civil War echoes the violence taking place within the halls of this orphanage. We see young boys with knives, eyes already darkened with anger and bitterness. The sadistic caretaker with the face of an angel (Noriega). Del Toro commented that he liked the portrayal of cruelty and greed masked by beauty and sex appeal. Although, personally I found the caretaker to be not so sadistic as just greedy and corrupt. Each character had hidden depths, secrets and agenda's that played out during the film. The ghost, on the other hand, had no such agenda. He was a shadow, a sigh, a memory of despair and pain who only wanted closure and release. While the movie certainly emphasizes the human capacity for violence it does, in the end, show us a glimpse of human triumph and courage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bleeding child is bound and dumped into a murky underground pool as a huge bomb stands unexploded in the courtyard of an isolated orphanage. So starts Guillermo Del Toro's 2001 supernatural thriller THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE, a chilling ghost story set against the background of the Spanish Civil war showing as part of the Film Festival's Del Toro Season. We follow young Carlos (Fernando Tielve), a new arrival at this supposed sanctuary who unwittingly discovers that there is something very dark at the heart of his new home.Displaying Del Toro's idiosyncratic panache for combining the fantastical with the historical, THE DEVILS BACKBONE is one of his most accomplished works. He elegantly builds an unsettling atmosphere choosing creeping, cadaverous dread over startling shocks or explicit gore. The film never rushes itself, spending plenty of time developing well drawn and convincingly human characters, making it more believably effective when it unveils its more nightmarish horror elements.The mostly young cast is exceptional but the true stand out is Eduardo Noriega's Jacinto, a brilliantly composed portrait of brutal masculinity carrying a blemished moral compass. He is a disturbing precursor for the even more overtly sociopathic captain Vidal in Del Toro's follow up film PANS LABYRINTH.There are a few minor plot irritations at work during the film, especially regarding some very irrational character behaviour regarding a pile of burning petrol cans. However these are minor flaws in an otherwise outstanding Gothic thriller bathed in the pounding desert heat. 5 out of 5Cambridge Film Festival Daily</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i was advertised this film by a friend, i have to say i was very unimpressed. subtitles, fairy tales and make believe monsters. Are you sure..? How unbelievably wrong i was, and how thankful i am to this friend for opening my eyes to Pans Labyrinth (Laberinto Del Fauno). One of my favourite films around at this time.Guillermo Del Toro is an artist of the fantasy,thriller genre. Having watched a few of his other titles which have also blown me away. The characters he creates in this film are truly inspiring and breathtaking. The Faun (Doug Jones)is a confused character, but stunning in appearance. Hes so incredibly eery. D Jones also plays the Pale Man. A one eyed monster who uses his hands to see..and likes to eat meat, Ofilias faeries become its main meal. Which is hideous, but thanks to the wonderful use of CGI and puppetry in this film look so realistic and just amazing.The story is so involved, it kept me on edge the whole way through bits of gore, Captain Vigal (Sergi Lopez) smashes the blunt end of a wine bottle into a mans face and there isn't even a cut, the disgusting toad in the tree, the story of Ofilias mother and the renegade Mercedes who almost becomes Ofilias saviour. New revelations coming and going keep it so incredibly interesting and fulfilling. Till its all you can do to lose yourself in the film and even completely forget that its subtitled and your reading your way through it. If there's one thing a subtitled film should achieve its that. It does it easily.The ending is a beautiful one, and so satisfying. This film is truly remarkable and so different to anything else thats out there and recognised. It was truly deserving of all the accolade's it achieved. An absolute must see for anyone, regardless of the fear of subtitles. An eye opener and a chilling song that will last in the mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so I noticed this one on the DVD shelf yesterday, and I thought, why not? I had seen Pan's labyrinth a month ago, and maybe 2 or so other films by Del Toro. And as it usually happens while watching his films, I was at least a little disturbed and unnerved by how familiar it felt watching the characters interact. It was like watching daily events of life unfold, that's how real it seemed. Except for the whole ghost story weaved into it, but which also plays a vital part since I really wouldn't have been interested if it had been another drama film. I rented it for my horror fix, and I sure got it, but I got a lot more than that.I don't know how he does it, but Guillermo knows how to make me cringe by showing me a mixture of fantasy and reality. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. In fact it's not everyday I find a movie that actually unsettles me. And that is the whole point of a horror film. To unsettle you, scare you, startle you, whatever. As long as it makes you feel something. And for that I say cheers to the big man for achieving what most directors don't care about anymore these days, to instill emotion in the viewer. Especially your feelings toward the characters. Some you hate, some you feel sympathy for, some you don't understand and you may even be fond of the little boy with the goggles... I can't say I loved the film. That would be a lie, because it didn't make me feel good at all. I can, however, say that it is a piece of art I will not easily forget, and respect for a long while to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guilermo del Toro companion piece to Pan's Labrynth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This excellent effort by Del Toro was made in 2001, Both this &amp; Pan"s Labrynth take place during the Spanish Civil War. This was a very turbulent time in Spain &amp; was right before the start of WW 2.The setting this time is is a desert type area, an orphanage stuck out in the middle of no-where. It is run by a strict middle age woman with wooden leg, &amp; an older Doctor, Eduardo Noriega a handsome actor plays a jack of all trades &amp; is the key player for the finale..There are some talented child actors as the orphans.A few years back one of the children died, &amp; now is a ghost, just waiting. This is not a horror story, except in the fact that the period of time is one of horror.. It is a gripping tale of suspense &amp; impending doom.. If I tell too much more I would give away important facts.Del Toro is a very skilled director, &amp; also wrote the screenplay &amp; Pedro Almodavar is one of the producers. Clear understandable titles, Excellent cinematography. believable acting make this a film to see...Ratings: **** (out of 4) 97 points(out of 100) IMDb 10 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a grisly ghost story, absorbing style and a bleak perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guillermo del Toro is fascinated by characters who aren't apart of the battles during war, but at the same time he's also just as, if not more, compelled by the plight of children caught in the cross-hairs of good people and very bad people. It's also all the more an amazing view after seeing Pan's Labyrinth, the two films as sort of quasi-film cousins where it's the same universe (del Toro has commented that he sees the characters of Carlos in this film and Ofelia in 'Labyrinth' as two sides of a coin, or close to it, as characters with fantasy elements as something just as real as the brutal nature surrounding them with everyone else). Aside from the little things the stories share in common, like little details involving keys and doors and the uncanny persistence of both children and adults with their own large lots of problems, the Devil's Backbone has a real force pulling along the characters to an ending that gets progressively more bleak and bloody (the body count is fairly high, some characters dying in big ways like in explosions and smaller, more affecting ways in chairs suffering from wounds). But all the while there is also the sense that del Toro is telling something that is half history book territory and half story-round-the-campfire material, handled with an assurance rare in contemporary films, especially from Mexico.Like in 'Labyrinth' as well, del Toro casts his film well with faces that leave strong impressions not soon after we first see them, and get stronger in our minds as we see more looks to one another, exchanges that speak many words that are not always totally answered by 'how did this and this' happen. Carlos (Tielve) is one of several orphans left at a slightly run-down and more than slightly spooky school out in almost the middle of nowhere. There's a doctor Caesares (Luppi, who comes off like a cross between Fernando Rey- a del Toro influence is Bunuel- and Christopher Lee) who has some unconventional practices, like holding onto fetuses kept in bottles with strange back deformities. There's also the conniving Jacinto (Noriega, if not as impressionable and terrifying as Lopez's Vidal in Pan's Labyrinth still makes his mark as a slowly revealing presence of evil), who's having an affair with the head schoolteacher, who also has part of a leg missing. Then there's the younger Conchita (Visedo), who will play a bigger part in the story as it goes along in its tale-spin later on.But the adults are one side of it only, as it's really the first of del Toro's films to deal with the staggering but not-too sentimental plights of children. Carlos, upon arrival at the orphanage, becomes the target of a seeming bully, Jaime (Garces), and upon pulling a kind of water challenge one night, he sees what is to his eyes pure and simple- a ghost, a child ghost to be exact. One of the smart things is how del Toro establishes well the supernatural elements while also getting the child actors, all very good, to convey what should be typical story grounds: the push and pull of the stubborn oldest of the pack and the young new upstart with as good a soul as possible. As the more crushing dramatic turns come with Jacinto's betrayal- and destruction of the premises- it draws the kids inexorably into death and decay, but del Toro makes it on the one hand graphic enough to make the point that kids' perspectives (albeit boys, all the same open to loss of total innocence) are changed by present and past views of violence. The whole facet of the ghost here could possibly be taken as less striking as the one involving the elderly doctor and the money-hungry Jacinto, but throughout, by use of stark contrasts in lighting, deft combinations of make-up and computer effects, the mystery of Santi, the boy lost to the darkest secret of the school, remains strong all the way to the harsh climax.This won't be the same exhilarating cinematic experience for some that Pan's Labyrinth was, and the possible argument that del Toro doesn't quite explore as completely his child-protagonist's own world with that of the world surrounding him outside of the shadows and dark corridors. Then again, del Toro conveys the shattered lives of children- and how there are more layers than might be expected- maturely, and as an always interesting counterpoint to the desperation, lust, love, loss and green of the adults. The Devil's Backbone, in the end, is blood-curdling as horror movie and historical piece, and even manages to squeeze in one or two moments of pitch-dark humor (it is partly Bunuel influence after all, particularly Los Olvidados with the kids).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Devil's Backbone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The lives of boys during a tumultuous time in their country of Spain during a civil war at a little schoolhouse miles away from any form of civilization are effected by Jacinto(Eduardo Noriega)who desires gold bars hidden in a safe within a kitchen. Jacinto, sometime in his life, lost any humanity as this obsession for those gold bars took over. He's also the reason behind a quiet tragedy deemed a runaway by the adult radicals(communists, they call each other reds and take in children whose parents were killed or abandoned as war ravaged the land)whose ghost haunts a specific room containing a dirty pool. That ghost is nicknamed, "the one who sighs" and one new arrival, brought to the school by someone who was tutoring him but has to go back to war, named Carlos(Fernando Tielve)sees him and talks with him. There's a reason this child named Santi has remained between this realm and the next and that is for revenge. Carlos can be the guide for Santi. Jaime(Í?igo Garcés)is a young artist who was friends with Santi and saw the whole terrible ordeal take place. But, that tragedy isn't even close compared to what Jacinto will ultimately do to get his bars of gold. The school/orphanage is ran by two radicals/liberals named Casares(Federico Luppi)and Carmen(Marisa Paredes). Both are always on edge wondering if those who execute commies will ever find out two other reds are nearby.Ultimately, the violence that erupts and sadly effects the lives of innocents is solely blamed on Jacinto's gold lust. Sometimes ghosts have a way of returning the favor, however, and soon enough Jacinto will reap what he has sown.Beautifully conceived and gripping film from the talented visual stylist director Guillermo de Toro. He's able to communicate the horrors of war and poverty as it effects others, especially children..this is truly at the heart of this film. It uses the ghost story elements to draw you in, but this is about the sad state of affairs that often yield from a land destroyed by greed and death. We see the ones effected here. Jacinto is the adult example of a child losing his way and only seeing gold bars as his means for escaping his melancholy. How that desperation effects those around him is shown to us vividly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Devil's Backbone", a drama more than a horror or ghost flick with the supernatural relegated to the background, which tells the tale of a war torn and isolated orphanage for boys in Spain during the civil war of the 1930's. Among the inhabitants and players are a kindly headmaster, a one legged matronly teacher, an evil young male worker, a boy ghost, a couple of female helpers, and, of course, the orphans. At issue it a small amount of gold bullion and vengeance sought by the ghost. These elements are brought together with excellence of execution and a strong sense of art in a bold and powerful drama about survival in desperate times. Well worth a look for Del Toro fans and others interested in foreign cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is a ghost?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carlos, the young orphan, asks from Dr. Casares the question at the beginning of this haunting tale set in the dark days of the Spanish Civil War. Curiously enough, the Civil War captivates like this "ghost", present day Spanish filmmakers. The young boy doesn't have to go far to encounter the vision that everyone knows lurks in the dark, or is it in the minds of all of the people involved in the death of Santi, the young boy who was in the wrong place, at the wrong time. Everyone within the orphanage knows about the tragedy of Santi but there is a conspiracy behind the tragedy and it's Carlos who discovers the mystery. For a director working out of his element, such as Guillermo del Toro is, the film he gives us his concept of evil behind a place that should have been a refuge for all the young children that lost parents in the conflict. The story is absorbing, keeping us interested in what appears to be a ghost tale, but isn't. The director gets good performances from the children as an emsenble and even the grown ups are very good, notably the great Federico Luppi who has worked with del Toro before. The only thing puzzling us is why does it have to be clarified his character is from Argentina when his presence in that remote area, surrounded by the war, would attract the attention he's probably trying to avoid. Marisa Paredes and Eduardo Noriega and the rest are well cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as I'd like to agree with the rest of you cinema-experts around here, I really can't bring myself to call this film a masterpiece and even the genius-reputation of director Guillermo Del Toro is a bit undeserved, if you ask me. His horror movies for large audiences ("Mimic","Hellboy") are truly mediocre and even his so-called hidden &amp; personal horror gems ("Cronos" and this "The Devil's Backbone") aren't that impressive, neither. They're both atmospheric and macabre tales with subtlety and charm, but the wholesome eventually turns out empty and rather dull. "The Devil's Backbone" is a beautiful film to look at, but that's pretty much it. The story opens moving and truly emotional (that's quite logical with a premise set in a orphanage during a devastating war!) with identifiable characters and authentic human misery. The Spanish Civil War is largely illustrated through the only partially comprehending eyes of a 10-year-old boy who's dropped in a desert orphanage after the dead of his battling Republican father. Carmen and professor Caseras, the amiable owners of the orphanage, try to take pity on the young Carlos but he continues to face danger even inside the institute. Carlos has to stand up against the obligatory bully-kid, there's the ominous caretaker Jacinto and ? worst of all ? the ongoing rumors about a missing child that still dwells around the orphanage as a restless ghost. The premise is intriguing, almost poetic, and has lots of possibilities. The technical aspects are sublime, with polished special effects instead of gross-out gore, the camera-work is mesmerizing and the acting performances are terrific. And yet, there's something missing which doesn't make this film memorable enough and that's the overly noticeable lack of action. I'm all for atmosphere-driven horror with almost no bloodshed but at least they have to feature a couple of mind-blowing shock sequences. Films like "A Tale of Two Sisters" or "The Others" follow this rule perfectly, but I only counted one pertinent scene in "The Devil's Backbone" (Carlos' nightly encounter with Santi) and the timing ? halfway in the film ? definitely wasn't ideal. The last half hour is unimaginably tedious and totally ruined the promising story idea for me. Films like this only become masterpieces when the story contains several surprising twists or at least ONE perplexing denouement. "The Devil's Backbone" kindly stays within the boundaries of the expected at all times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guillermo del Toro's Personal Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Carlos (Fernando Tielve), a 12-year-old whose father has died in the Spanish Civil War, arrives at an ominous boy's orphanage he discovers the school is haunted and has many dark secrets that he must uncover.Guillermo de Toro has returned to a few subjects again and again: most notably the Spanish Civil War and orphanages. Here he does both, and does them well, with a little help from producer Pedro Almodovar (who is a top-notch filmmaker in his own right).Film critic Mark Kermode calls del Toro "the finest living exponent of fabulist film" and says his "best work combines a love of the freedom of fantasy with a commitment to the strictures of social responsibility". Indeed, whether working on his own projects or Hollywood blockbusters, del Toro has made a name for himself in blending fantasy with reality. With "Pan", the viewer sometimes does not know where the dream ends and the real world begins. As a companion piece, this film is similar in some respects, though the fantastic elements are much more mellow.The response to the film was overwhelmingly positive, though it did not receive the critical success that "Pan's Labyrinth" would in 2006. Roger Ebert said the film, when compared to "The Others" (2001), "has the same ambition and intelligence, but is more compelling and even convincing." Indeed, while not "Pan's Labyrinth", it is still well worth a watch.Kermode points out that although no one could know it at the time, the comparison to "The Others" ended up being short-sighted: one film is now seen as highly influential (and was picked up by Criterion) while the other is more or less a footnote.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this is a much satisfying movie it is not even close to a "masterpiece" as many have proclaimed .I believe the main reason for the reputation and critical success of `The Devil's Backbone' is that it is a movie that takes itself seriously and has enough quality to back it up? at least barely. We don't have nude teens or a masked killer. There's no blood or cheap jokes. It's a true psychological horror movie. However I do believe they forgot something essential! Fear. The movie wasn't the least frightening. Yes we have a ghost wandering around with the cliché music but it takes more than that. Then the movie has an obvious lack of focus. They try to concentrate on the horror, then on the Spanish war, then on the orphans sadness, then on love affairs etc etc? etc. By the end this is no longer a ghost story but a mess of subjects. They don't even try to get some suspense in. The last sequence is quite unexciting and short with no supernatural element involved until the final moment. Del Toro's direction is quite efficient and the great acting by everyone involved adds to the impact of his work. However for me it wasn't enough.I would say this is not a horror or ghost story. The supernatural is almost absent and its weight on the whole of the movie is minimum.Still the movie deserves a chance because of the `human story' it presents us. Just know what to expect! No great chills or thrills.A good movie nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful drama venturing into phantasmagorical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in 1939 at the end of the Spanish War and filmed in the midst of nowhere, but is in fact to the east of Madrid on the borders with the province of Guadalajara, this film dumps us not so ceremoniously in a large dilapidated and eerie house which serves as an orphanage. Carlos - Fernando Tielve (El Embrujo de Shanghai, qv) - is abandoned along with 30 other boys in the care of Marisa Paredes (El Coronel no tiene quién le escriba) (qv) in an anxious and earnest role, and with only one leg, poor thing, and Federico Luppi (Martin (Hache)) (qv), as well as Eduardo Noriega scheming up other ideas. The house itself is a major part of the film's development and at times had me remembering Mervyn Peake's incredible masterpiece `Gormenghast'.The Mexican director Guillermo del Toro certainly worked hard to get this one up and going, and got together a good cast who also pulled hard to make it work. The Almodóvar Brothers' production was enhanced by intelligent cinematography by Guillermo Navarro which heightened suspense in the gloomy bowels of the house, and Javier Navarrete's music toned in well most of the time. For some reason or other the combination of on-scene background noise and the music frequently overwhelmed the spoken dialogues. Better sound-balance would definitely be called for. Apart from that `El Espinazo del Diablo' is a suspenseful drama, not really horror in the ordinary sense, which skillfully interplays different levels and layers into the story, such that the obvious and overt become fused into a taut psychological play on nerves.I cannot help comparing a little with Alejandro Amenábar's `The Others' (qv); though entirely different in story-line, the comparison is because both films are made in darkened spooky old houses; del Toro's use of the house as protagonist in the film surprisingly comes off slightly better than Amenabar's.If you are interested in films of this genre from Spain try `99.9' (1997) (qv).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a pleasure to come across a truly great horror story, a ghostly tale involving a group of Spanish boys orphaned during the Spanish Civil War in the late '30s at a remote outpost where they are sheltered by two caretakers and a handyman. The handyman is Jacinto (played brilliantly by EDUARDO NORIEGA) who is intent on keeping the boys away from a certain area kept under lock and key.One of the boys starts seeing brief visions of a small boy and hears him say "Many will die". Gradually, we learn the story behind the ghostly hauntings and why Jacinto is tormented by a secret he keeps in the past. There are so many layers to the story that it's impossible to describe the detailed plot without giving too much away.All of it is stylishly directed, beautifully photographed, with great sets and extremely good horror make-up when it comes to the blood and gore involved. There's poetic justice in the finely crafted ending and the viewer can get full satisfaction in the way the story ends.Well worth viewing. Deserves much more attention (and awards) than it has received. EDUARDO NORIEGA certainly has the potential to be a huge international star--looks and charisma to spare, as well as the intense acting abilities of a young Anthony Quinn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set against the backdrop of the Spanish civil war, Guilermo Del Toro leads us into the desperate lives and deaths of the inhabitants of a destitute orphanage, and poses a question.What is a ghost?Over the following hour and a half, several answers are given.Our protagonist, the young boy Carlos, arrives to stay at the Santa Lucia orphanage for the first time, where we are introduced to a variety of tragic characters. There is Jacinto, the vicious caretaker with a hidden past. Casares, the Argentinian doctor who runs the place and shares an unrequited love with teacher and matriarch Carmen. Jaime, the troubled orphan. And finally Santi, the ghost of a boy who went missing the night the bomb dropped and didn't explode. Who these people are and how they inter-relate is what this story is really about. Instead of any real surprises, there is a palpable tension and a sense of inevitability seeded by the film's prologue.In short, this ranks alongside The Others as one of the two best ghost stories in a long, long time. Indeed both films share many qualities, with excellent acting (from both children and adults), direction, beautiful cinematography and some genuinely chilling moments.The only reservation I have is that this film is unremittingly bleak, and if you're looking for a happy ending, then you should steer well clear. But then. since when have you looked to the dead for light relief?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Which inspired me to rent El Espinazo del diablo (The Devil's Backbone), directed by Guillermo del Toro as well.The Devil's Backbone stinks.And, Guillermo del Toro is in talks to do sequels as well.Where all this stinks come from?I have an idea: Both films are competent at best, but they lack in inspiration and motivation. The visuals are crisp, ut give nothing to the story or content; the weakest point being the editing and storytelling..Hellboy's one-liners are constantly before a break in the scene, and there are no long takes. Drastic changes to the source make it "sort-of" good to the general public, instead of great to one or the other (sources say the creator of Hellboy approves of the changes, I think it's a lie). There is Constant dialog throughout the movie, and no progressive narration from Hellboy which ends the expressionistic/comedic overtones we have enjoyed in the books. And, despite the visuals looking crisp they are only competent to the look in the novels (the look is possible). I say it's not dark or has enough contrast.. But that would make it stand out, which nothing does here.Comparatively, The D. Backbone always qued sound effects right before Santi enters, providing a much need obviousness to a scene we will be shown over, and over again without any furthering of the plot. The film could have been cut by 40 minutes. R-E-D-U-N-D-A-N-TIt's possible that del Toro was limited in his expression by his producers, but somehow I seriously doubt it, it's the storyteller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was so-so. The plot drags too much for me to call this a good movie. I liked it when you get to see some of the full view shots of the "ghost boy". It was creepy, but from the start, the ghost seemed harmless, so there wasn't a lot of tension when the young boy, Carlos, sees the ghost in a dark hall. You knew the ghost didn't mean to harm the children. One complaint with this movie is it uses some stereo-typical characters, such as the bully at the orphanage and his friends, who at first give the new kid, Carlos, a hard time. Carlos takes the blame when the group gets into trouble. Like I haven't seen that one before. But, eventually the gang comes to like Carlos, and he takes charge since for some reason the ghost appears and talks to him. What didn't make sense to me is why would the ghost appear to Carlos instead of some of the other kids because the dead boy was already friends with some of the kids and never knew Carlos.FINAL VERDICT: The movie should have been a little shorter. It was OK, but not one of the best supernatural films I've seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh, man I was expecting a bit more, maybe that is because I was a bit disappointed with this one, I am a fan of Guillermo since Cronos his first movie. But I think this one lacks something, certainly a kid is scared with this one, but not me, mimic was terrific. Sorry, I hope Blade 2 is going to be better, please!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Such a tiny fraction of the dialog is even put in subtitles you miss the vast majority of EVERY conversation in this movie! Long conversations are only given a very few words in subtitles. Often you don't even get an entire sentence,just two or three words,such as "bring me". I was extremely frustrated throughout the entire movie,knowing I wasn't even getting the "gist" of most conversations!This film does not deserve such a high rating in any way that I can see. It is not suspenseful,or scary in the least. I didn't even get a feeling of "creepiness" from this one,except from the psycho young adult male! It is just weird and violent. Thankfully, it didn't cost me anything to see it.I got it from the library. I have only felt so "ripped off" by one other movie and that was The Blair Witch Project. Don't waste your money to see this.It most certainly is not what the reviews here would lead you to believe!</fullReview>
