		<shortDescription>Low brow version of what was done better by Steve Martin and John Candy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie I was prepared to like because Robert Downey is an excellent actor and Zack G has proved to be a weird character who can be very funny in the right film.But, it just doesn't work very well. This story has been done before, and with much better effect, in Planes, Trains, and Automobiles. The two movies have a very similar story arc, but in the one case you have two very funny men playing actual mature adults who have differing personalities, and in the other you have two men who are immature imbeciles with differing personalities. The former are likable, while the latter are just annoying.Zack G's character is just too bizarre to be credible, but at least you know where they are going with him. Downey, on the other hand, is an excellent actor badly miscast here. His demeanor is just too "dark" and his personality too brooding and cranky to play the part of a good family man trying at all costs to get home in time for his child's birth. To be honest, his character simply isn't very likable, and is sometimes just downright mean, even spitting in an innocent dog's face. This is in stark contrast to the frustrated everyman played by Steve Martin in P,T,&amp;A - a person every traveler (stuck next to an obnoxious slob) understands implicitly. Another example of such a role being done to perfection is Jack Lemmon in The Out of Towners.I suppose it didn't help that the theater was packed with very young children who had no business going to this movie. The very crude language, extensive drug imagery, and graphic masturbation scenes, while funny for adults, were grossly inappropriate for 5-12 year olds in the crowd. Some people clearly are not cut out to be parents.Perhaps the most memorable line in the movie was Downey proclaiming that he had never done drugs in his life. Given Downey's well documented real-life problems, his statement in the movie couldn't help but make the audience compare the character to reality, thus serving to knock down the "4th wall" in the process. No doubt the contrast was created by intent, but I'm not sure it was a great idea.As Steve Martin, John Candy, and Jack Lemmon proved, superior comedy and deeper laughs come from brilliant acting and comic timing. If you have to resort to endless gutter language, potty humor, and masturbating canines, you have already lost the game before it starts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The critics are being pretty harsh on this film, and yet they give high praise to such films like Role Models and Get Him to the Greek, so go figure. But I had a lot fun with Due Date, It was a fun slapstick misadventure, almost what we loved about The Hangover, so it is clear to say I don't agree with the critics on this one.Peter(Robert Downey Jr) an architect looking to get home to his pregnant wife(Michelle Monaghan) who is expecting in a week. And when he gets on a plane, he quickly gets kicked off, when he gets into an unfortunate incident with Ethan(Zach Galifianakis) a pot smoking moron, and wanna be actor, who is obsessed with the show Two and a Half Men. When Peter is looking for new ways to get home. Ethan has a car and offers to drive him. Although it is against Peters better judgment, but feeling there is no other way, he goes with him. Will Peter make it on time for his child's birth, or will Ethan drive him nuts during this?A lot of people said this is a Plane,Trains and Automobiles ripoff, but you know what who cares. This was a funny laugh out loud film. Downey and Galifianakis have funny chemistry, they just play off each other perfectly. Like The Hangover it is one entertaining misadventure, I say don't listen to the critics, see this movie and form your own opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you make a road trip movie, and you have two mismatched characters sharing that road, one can't help but to think back to John Hughes 1987 masterpiece Planes Trains and Automobiles. It might not be right, but unfortunately, it just happens. And when you do, you come up with the conclusion that this film is a food stamps version of the real deal. While Todd Phillips is talented and Zack Galifinakis and Rober Downey Jr. are fine actors, the material in this film is just mean. In every way.In PTA you had a work-a-holic who was trying to get home for Thanksgiving only to get stuck next to a slob. John Candy was that slob and for all of the shortcomings of his character, Del Griffith, the character, knew he was a bit of a slob, he knew he was a bit annoying and he knew that he was a bit hard to get along with. But when all was said and done, he was a sweet man and absolutely knew WHO HE WAS. If you compare him to Zack's character, it's like comparing a character after he has been through the editing process 17 times as opposed to the original draft that Galifinakis seems that he is. Candy might have been written like Galifinakis' character is at the beginning, but Hughes took the time to polish and shine him. And what we were left with a family man, indelibly devoted to his wife and a man who was giving, honest, kind and principled. He was flawed no doubt, but he wasn't a jerk. The same can be said about Neil Page, flawed, but a decent human being.Due Date has unlikable characters. I mean every single character in here (with the exception of Downey's wife) is a complete jerk at times. Ethan Trembley is so over the top that you just can't take him seriously. He is just mean and he is such a slob that you have no empathy for him. Peter Highman is an angry, violent rage of a volcano that even when he is being helped across country to see his wife, he finds it hard to be nice. This is a man who will punch a child, spit in a dog's face and leave a man broke at a rest room while stealing his car. I found it hard to like any character in the film, but especially the two leads.With PTA, there was humour in the situations. In Due Date, it's just not that funny because in this film, you have crack whores, lots of drugs, unrealistic and cringe-worthy situations, and scene after scene of incredulous acts that would get you punched out in real life. To see a man masturbate in the seat beside you is not funny. However, seeing the dog do it, I have to admit, is.Due Date sis not entirely unfunny. There are sporadic scenes of humour. And Downey is good, as always. But like I said, maybe it's just wrong to compare it to PTA, but there were laugh out loud scenes like the car rental scene, "You're going the wrong way", "those aren't pillows", "do you think this vehicle is safe?" and so on on. Then at the end you have the cover of Every Time You Go Away and it fits perfectly with the tone of the film. At the end of this, you just have Zak being Zak.I wanted to like this, but it disappointed me immensely.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After R.D.J.'s excellent performance in Sherlock Holmes, I thought it would be a pretty safe bet that he wouldn't be into making turkeys.Unfortunately ,I was wrong. This film is everything a movie shouldn't be.It is gross, offensive and totally without merit.One can only ask Why????? Robert Downey Jr chose this dross to perform.The comparison to Planes,Trains and Automobiles is all too clear- but that was an excellent piece of film making and Due Date just isn't.The 2 characters don't mesh, there is no growing bond which you see in Planes etc it's too unbelievable that R.D.J's character who has some intelligence would ever stoop to find worth in anything his overbearing unstable road partner would do.Suddenly in one leap- he confesses he "loves" the guy.And wants to stay in touch. The charm and poignant detail of Planes is sadly lacking.There is no character development,we don't have emapathy for the nerd character,and by the end of it,I had none for R.D.J's character either.An embarrassment to R.D.J's great track record, a bitter blow to your pocket and expectations of an entertaining night out.This film sucks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recipe for a bad movie. Remake a great movie, "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" with many good actors. Discard the potential of Michelle Monaghan and Jamie Foxx. Add canned Juliette Lewis and Danny McBride shtick to save time. Make the Steve Martin character unlikable. Make the John Candy character sinister and unlikable. Imagine how one would react to the antics of the other, and then on occasion, invert the reaction. (That adds suspense!) Re-write PT&amp;A with more action by disconnecting the vignettes; this gives you the freedom to create disasters and then re-start the plot with the leads not dead or in jail, like Saturday morning cartoons. Here's your inspiration - when you do "man slips on a banana peel", don't be afraid to make the audience be the man, make them feel the pain of tailbone falling on concrete. After 98 minutes of bone breaking aggression and multiple felonies, add a "oh my god, my kid is black" site gag, make sure everyone loves one another, sprinkle with pot jokes and sell while actors' reputations are still hot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie with my wife and had no idea what to expect as we had not read any reviews. We just watch anything with RDJ and ZG in it.However it wasn't long before we both mentioned that this was strikingly similar to Planes Trains and Automobiles, but with the difference that the characters just aren't likable - particularly RDJ's character, who is apparently a selfish jerk with occasional moments of humanity.I want a comedy with these guys to leave me with a good feeling. This left me very disappointed and kind of sad that it's apparently acceptable these days to be a selfish jerk as long as you come good in the end.A sad copy of a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There had been in my humble opinion a major lack of entertaining and good comedies in the film market, but then out of the blue I stumbled upon The Hangover. A film I didn't know anything about before I went to see it in the cinema. Just a few seconds into the film I started smiling and laughing, and they kept on pushing it, and I think there wasn't one single dull nor boring sequence throughout the whole movie. The reason why I'm telling you this is because watching Due Date gave me the exact same amazing comedy experience as The Hangover, and that speaks for it self! Furthermore, the acting by especially Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifanakis were both top notch, and I thoroughly swallowed every word they said.If you're in for a treat and hunger for laughs go watch Due Date as soon as you can! I honestly feel like I don't have words to describe it as well as it deserves, but I gave it my best shot and I hope you've got the message! PS: I had the pleasure of seeing it in an early screening. The original premiere date is November 5th.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seriously missing something...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We went to see this without knowing anything about the plot. We went to see it because Robert Downey Jr. was in it and we were in the mood for a few laughs.Sadly, we got very few laughs. The plot seemed disjointed causing it not to flow very well. And the majority of the intended humor used graphical juvenile antics better suited for locker room pranks than a supposed Hollywood comedy.A common attribute of high level movies no matter the genre is to have the audience care about the characters; either liking them or wishing them to meet their end. But in this movie all that was missing. The main characters had few redeeming qualities to latch on to. All that was left was a large amount of indifference...we really didn't care if either of them made it to L.A. or fell off the cliff at the Grand Canyon.It's not the worst movie ever made, but it will do until that one comes along.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We were quite disappointed by this film. After the first few minutes of finding the 2 characters amusing... I got bored. My friend and I actually sat there discussing other matters. We expected it to be laugh-out-loud funny but in the whole screen there were a few laughs, that was it. Everything was quite unrealistic, such as the car crash in which they both should have died, or stealing a Mexican police truck, causing others to crash without being reprimanded, or even being shot and walking fine 1 minute later.It just felt like a carry-on programme, but as a film... Only go and see this film if you really are bored.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painful to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I walked out of the theater after seeing this feeling agitated and wanting to just beat the crap out of someone...and I one who usually runs away when faced with conflict. I had heard that this was hilarious, so perhaps I walked in with excessively high expectations, but I was truly disappointed. I know that Zach Galifianakis relies on awkwardness and an appearance of being socially inept in his stand-up, which I don't generally enjoy, but I had seen him in The Hangover and had enjoyed it, but I did not walk out of this movie a fan of his. He does his schtick well, perhaps a bit too well, making it difficult to watch him. Robert Downey Jr. is very talented and was really the only reason I stayed through the entire film. He portrayed a man with anger-management issues very well, which also seems to be a bit of his "thing" as well.Overall, the film has potential but fails to fulfill it. It does not fall flat, but kind of just explodes into a big, angry catastrophe. Ethan (Zach Galifianakis) is introduced as obnoxious and rude, and I think that the viewer is supposed to end up loving him at the end (possible spoiler), but I walked out rooting for Peter (Robert Downey, Jr.), who seemed to still harbor feelings of loathing even at the end when they are "friends". I didn't laugh once, instead just getting progressively more incensed and frustrated. Perhaps I was getting too involved, but it didn't bring out the best in me.Ultimately, I wish that Peter had pushed Ethan into the grand canyon. And that's that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Comedy Wise as Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was trying to be funny but it wasn't the only things funny in it was the kid pulling on Downy Jr's tie repeatedly and then jab/punch the kid in the stomach because he was misbehaving, the dog masturbating scene and the trio (downey,jamie foxx and zach) accidentally drinking the ashes mistaken for coffee.You can skip to those scenes but actually watching a movie that goes for over an hour and a half is tiresome and annoying, because you have to put up with the obnoxious character Ethan (from the Hangover)who always acts like Drop Dead Fred except his the total opposite and is just plain annoying without any of the humour. Even at the end he was still the same, there is nothing likable about him for being a jerk. His bad from start to finish.Peter (Downey Jr.) was the serious cast while all this was happening he just puts up with Ethan's recklessness and doesn't retaliate and only banters at him in a non-funny way. Jamie Foxx is only in this movie for 10 mins and the pickup truck going over potholes would be funny if there was not a dog falling all over the place also it get's spat on by Peter. The way they portrayed animal abuse made it less funny same with talk about child services. For a comedy movie it doesn't have much humour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I want to open this review by saying I am a 27 year old male who loved "The Hangover." I am a fan of RDJ and ZG, and think the majority of RDJ's work is way above par (at least the projects he chooses). This is my first IMDb review, and likely my last for a long time, unless more such as this comes out. The movie was so unsettlingly atrocious I felt compelled to warn others in the core demographic. Side note- I am not involved in the entertainment industry and did research online to figure out why RDJ would commit to a project this simply downright wrong.Studios, this may have been profitable as the only cost was RDJ and I know you have him committed to a multi-picture. Please be aware that you ruin brand equity in RDJ by associating his name with things like this amongst his core fan base. With that settled, my thoughts on the film:If this title had been billed as a horror film, It might have understandable. I went to go see it with my 18 year old little brother, and we both left in shock, with the same feeling we got from Schindler's List. On the way home we discussed what's wrong with America and why terrorists feel the way they do about America, pointing to demand for this kind of film as a core problem in our culture. Nothing ZG's character did was mildly redeeming, and the only thing I question about RDJ's character is his sanity for allowing contact with ZG. Why RDJ's wife feels that ZG is anything but in need of a restraining order is beyond my understanding.The scene designed to show ZG as anything but criminally insane, the pot in Range Rover Pink Floyd bonding talk, was either cut or muted in such a way that it appeared to be nothing more than ZG drugging RDJ in his sleep. Why RDJ would have any affinity for the deranged ZG is not clear, and why he all of a sudden changes opinion after that and the Mexican breakout less so. What is clear is that you put a great actor with an established brand in a contrived plot film that compromises his ability to remain credible so that you could cash in on his name. Perhaps ZG established a niche market with his appeal to the mentally ill in this film; maybe this segment will allow his movies to run profitably in the future.One question writers: why didn't RDJ's wife or friend hire a towncar, limo or greyhound to get him home?Anyone involved in the greenlighting of this movie should be ashamed of themselves; I hope the promotion or bonus and short run gain to the studio is worth the damage you have done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stick with its predecessor - Planes, Trains, and Automobiles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that Due Date operates under the main premise that the viewer has never heard of Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, for if they had, they'd be wondering why they were watching the same movie with all the jokes stripped out. Due Date is, in total, neither a terrible nor an offensive film. Its problem is that it's a little too bitter, thus eliminating with surgical precision any empathy we might have for its two protagonists. It's a road trip with an obvious end in sight and somewhat unpredictable wacky hijinks in between. You could do worse, but you could do much better.Peter Highman (Robert Downey, Jr.) is an architect who's attempting to fly out of Atlanta back home to Los Angeles to be with his wife Michelle Monaghan, who's about to give birth. But thanks to a bag mixup with a fellow traveler named Ethan Trembley (Zach Galifianakis), Peter finds himself stranded in Atlanta, placed on the national No Fly list (minor misunderstanding, of course). Ethan offers him a cross-country ride in his rental, and off we go.The movie uses the trope of mismatched people enduring a common experience. Peter is uptight, dithering endlessly about what to name his newborn. Ethan is, well, flighty. In fact, Galifianakis seems to be playing the same character he played in the two Hangover films: childlike, maybe psychopathic and/or sociopathic, not all there. He's wildly misinformed about such things as the Grand Canyon and the Hoover Dam, but he is heading west to try to make it as an actor in Hollywood. Oh, and did I mention he's carrying the ashes of his deceased father in a coffee can to dispose of along the way? Well, there's that, too.You and I both know that there's no way Peter and Ethan will make it from Georgia to California without any problems. But Peter has no choice - his wallet was confiscated at the airport, and his bags are on their way to LA. He has no cash and no ID. It could happen to anyone. So he's essentially at Ethan's mercy. Along the way, we learn much about the characters and what makes them tick, but whereas the earlier Planes, Trains got melancholy without getting maudlin, this one achieves no such feat.Downey, Jr. and Galifianakis give it their best shot, and to tell the truth they're not bad. They make an okay team; it's just that it's a teaming we've seen before, and much better. Steve Martin and John Candy got into their share of situations that would never happen to a normal person, but they also ran into problems with which we could all relate; here, it's more of the former than the latter. It's as if the movie keeps daring itself to get weirder and weirder.The final, near-fatal flaw of the movie is that it really doesn't give you anyone to root for - except of course at the end. It's a comedy, after all. But these guys do some rather nasty things to each other, and not in the oh-no-he-didn't sort of way, either; rather, in the scowling, almost hateful way. It's a little disconcerting at times. But the actors do their best, as I said, and you could do worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Healing Schlub</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few years ago the film critic Nathan Rabin identified a stock character he dubbed 'The Manic Pixie Dream Girl' ? those kooky kittens, often played by Zoe Deschanel (truly, the Katy Perry of Indiewood), who save soulful male protagonists from themselves. Well, I fancy there exists a male equivalent of the MPDG, who I'm calling 'The Healing Schlub.' A staple of screwball road comedies, these cheerfully disgusting stoners help steer their hard-ass co-passengers towards emotional closure with their man-child antics. The late John Candy specialised in them, and in Due Date Zach Galifianakis once again lollops up to the plate.Here he plays beardy-weirdy Ethan Tremblay, resembling (like all Healing Schlubs) a space hopper rolled in Jägermeister, dog hair and pretzels. Cursing his luck for having hitched an emergency ride with him is uptight architect Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jr.), racing across America to be present at his first baby's birth.In other words, it's Planes, Trains and Awfully Familiar Stuff; and although the movie's tagline is 'Leave Your Comfort Zone', we pretty much know where we're headed. Still, RDJ automatically adds value to anything he's in, plus Galifianakis is virtually reprising his hilarious breakout role from The Hangover ? a wonderfully inventive treat for the Sideways generation, also directed by Todd Phillips. So what could possibly...? Oh, everything. What a horrible misfire we have here: clichéd, mean-spirited, as amusing as a bed-locked fart, and tonally all over the road ? swerving like a narcoleptic driver (or four scriptwriters) between lanes of slapstick, contrived pathos, and misguided gross-out. And generally, just terrible, terrible writing. (At one point the pair drive an all-too publicly stolen police car from the Mexican border to the Grand Canyon and nobody follows them.) It's no wonder Downey Jr. ? straitjacketed in second fiddle ? looks cross, because, as usual, none of this is actually the cast's fault. All the same, Galifianakis might experiment with leaving his own Comfort Zone quite soon, lest he's written off as a one-trick Schlub.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comedy of mass frustration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Due Date is a comedy of mass frustration. I'm not just talking about what happens to the characters in the film, no, this is simply a frustrating comedy sit through. Here is an all-too-familiar road picture that pins together two people who hate each other and sends them cross-country on a madcap adventure. Needless to say, one guy is an average Joe that we identify with and the other is a blithering idiot who makes every moment a nonstop irritation. If this sounds, at all like the great Planes, Trains and Automobiles, you're not far off the mark.That earlier movie was a great American comedy. It was funny and endearing because we cared about both parties. We wanted to see Steve Martin get home and we cared about John Candy's shower ring salesman despite all his goofy inefficiencies. Here the Martin role is filled by a very sour Robert Downey Jr. as Peter Highman, an uptight yuppie on his way from Atlanta to Los Angelas to witness the birth of his first child. The John Candy role is filled by Zach Galifianakis, as Ethan, an irritant on two legs who gets Peter thrown off the plane when he won't stop saying the word "bomb". Neither of these two characters are really funny enough to spend any amount of time with.Peter is probably a nice guy. He seems to care about his wife but he spends the entire movie in a state of boiling anger and that's probably because he is saddled with a guy so insufferable that he could turn even the gentlest soul into a state of rage. Through a series of mishaps, mostly thanks to Ethan's idiocy, they get into every kind of trouble including: A fight with a veteran in a wheelchair; vehicular theft at the Mexican border; a shooting; a car accident; and questions about whether Peter's wife is pregnant with his child.None of this stuff is really funny. It all seems episodic and some of it is quite violent and unpleasant. I think some of the comic energy that should make these scenes work is missing. We cringe when we should be laughing. I also think that most of the film's failure falls on the head of actor Zach Galifianakis who always seems to illicit the same effect on me as a noisy car alarm. I have seen him in three films now and he always plays the same annoying character: An oddball doofus who has a never-ending repertoire of annoying and disgusting habits. Ethan is a pothead with an annoying dog and even more annoying habits - all of which get under Peter's skin and sadly ours too. His presence, I swear, brings this movie to a dead stop and since he occupies at least 90% of it, you can imagine how unpleasant this movie is.Due Date was directed by Todd Phillips, who made The Hangover, one of my favorite films of recent years. What that film had was a collection of likable characters and a narrative structure that pulled us from beginning to end. Here his story an episodic series of annoying moments and mean-spirited characters. It ranges from disgusting to irritating to violent and finally soft and cuddly. The problem is that very very rarely ever funny.** (of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly a bad movie.It's not Planes Trains and Automobiles, and it never could be.It's the same asinine but much less funny character from The Hangover, for Galafianakis. I'm afraid he is forever typecast as "Fat Jesus" for the rest of his career.Aside from that, the movie wasn't anywhere near as funny or entertaining as the hit-clips made it up to be. Another case of using all the best parts of the movie to produce the trailer for the movie and the rest of it just bombs.Downey Jr's character was downright despicable at times.Why was Jamie Foxx in this movie? Juliette Lewis? Lame.The funniest thing in the movie to me was when Downey Jr's character gut punched the annoying little bastard child of Juliette Lewis's character. That was good.Just know going into this film that it's about 2 hours of your life that you will NEVER get back. Just remember that, and then you make the decision to watch, or not to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zach Galifianakis is so funny in this movie. The complaints about the stale plot, the ridiculousness of the characters' behavior, or the failure of the characters to garner a connection with the other reviewers- or to inspire love or empathy- may all be valid points. I didn't find this to be true, but one could see how others would make the case that the film was nothing special. Nevertheless, I just laughed hard and frequently at Zach Galifianakis throughout. 10 stars. That's all, I am adding lines because they have a minimum of 10 lines. I am not Gene Siskel. Just recommending a comedy; people take insignificant things too seriously</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre, like most films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Due Date is simply one of those numerous mediocre comedies produced by Hollywood year after year. That's pretty much sums it all. One of the differentials of this comedy are the fact that Zack's character is more compelling than your typical set of characters in these comedies, although they are still far from being truly human characters: Zack's character is childlike and very naive, which helps the viewer to root a little for him. While iron man's character is pretty much a normal guy who is unsympathetic, like most normal guys: he is boring and hence performs the role of the straight guy of this show.Recommended for those who like to kill two hours of their life in something other than watching TV series of videogames.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some laughs, not enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to contrast this film with Planes, Trains, and Automobiles. The Steve Martin, John Candy movie was one tremendously funny film about two guys who logically, after being forced to be together for a couple of days, found some things to like in each other. Almost all of PT &amp; F was humorous, with only a few minutes of sentimentality (or drama) near the end.Due Date features two totally unlikeable people who even though there was almost nothing they came to admire about each other, professed to love each other after a couple of days of driving together. The movie broke away from comedy to seriousness far too often, making me think they weren't sure if it was a drama or a comedy.There were some decent chuckles and I can't say it was a horrible movie. But the negatives sure outweigh the positives. Car accidents where the vehicle lands upside down, crushing the roof in are not funny. One scene had a sleeping driver crashing through barricades sending highway workers scrambling, while looking like he was going to kill a few people. This is not funny. I didn't laugh when one star pulled out a gun they found in their stolen vehicle, and promptly shot his companion. Here, we had no idea where he was shot for some time.I was also troubled by the nastiness the stars exhibited toward each other. Things like purposely slamming someone's head into the side of a car are not funny.If you get laughs from drinking the brewed ashes of a dead man, and people and dogs happily masturbating, and almost all characters using the "F" word about every four minutes, then this might be the film for you.Given all these huge negatives, a reader might wonder why I give it four stars. There were several decent laughs and it was not boring. But I couldn't help but think how easily it could have been so much funnier, starting by making the characters at least a little bit likable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This looks like a Chinese copy of "Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles". Not a slightest touch of humor, on the contrary, bizarre things like punching a naughty kid in the stomach, masturbating dogs were displayed to amuse people. All I mean is, this is neither a decent comedy like Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, nor an absurd comedy. No climax, no well thought situations, extremely flat and even boring sometimes. Lacking the connection with reality is also a down side. Maybe it is one of the weakest points of this movie. I have seen people leaving the cinema saloon and I thought they were doing the right thing. It is really a mystery to me to see 7+ stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Presumably, this was supposed to be a "Planes, Trains, and Automobiles" kind of film. I didn't judge this, however, on that or any other specific film, to be "fair." Basically, this movie failed on every level possible. Downey, Jr. did reasonably well with what he had, but all other major elements were downright awful. I'll just mention one thing about Downey's character (Highman) though, which is that if he was given something to be, such as a gay guy who wanted to get back to California before gay marriage was made illegal, perhaps that would have helped provide some "color" (I'm not gay nor do I care about whether there are more or less gay characters in film; I'm just pointing out an idea that might have helped this dreary excuse for a film). Then there could have been a "message" about life's priorities and how our decisions affect others, rather than the forced ending of this movie. It could also have had an "unhappy" ending that would have been acceptable to the American masses (they don't get back in time and Highman and his partner must go to another state to get married).Galifianakis' Tremblay is a ludicrous, impossible human. Is he a "wannabe," a poser, or deluded? Is he insane or at least seriously emotionally disabled? Is he gay? Is he smug and arrogant? He was all over the map. Is this the director's fault? I don't think I've ever seen such a poor performance, because it was so inconsistent (I'll take Torgo from "Manos: The Hands of Fate" over Galifianakis' acting here, for example). And then there is the humor, though mostly the lack thereof. I don't think I found one thing worth laughing at, and that is not an exaggeration! Saturday Night Live is funnier with its worst skits. I wish I could describe how bad this truly is, but it was so bad that there is hardly anything worth noting. It's not funny/bad, like "Manos: The Hands of Fate" type films, but rather old/tired/generic/directionless bad. To make this kind of film work, there at least needs to be good chemistry between the two major characters, which was missing entirely here. Beyond that, there's a car chase, some lame/crude jokes, a forced, sentimental ending, etc., none of it anything but a bore. Compared to this, "Hot Tube Time Machine" looks like "Citizen Kane."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Planes Trains And Automobiles was better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a previous reviewer that hit the nail on the head when he called Due Date a darker version of Planes Trains and Automobiles. Robert Downey plays the Steve Martin part and Galofeeno...oh hell the jerk from The Hangover plays John Candy's part. Robert Downey always brings intensity and style to any part he plays be it comedy or drama. I felt so bad for his poor character, he is involved in two near fatal car accidents, gets tased by a security guard, arrested at the border and gets a bullet because of this other moron. John Candy's character in PTAA was a pain in the butt but he was also a warm and good hearted guy. I have never seen anyone who could play lovable oafs the way Candy could. There are a lot of words I could use to describe Mister Hangover's character but warm and lovable are not two of them. To quote Downey in the movie, I despised him at a cellular level! There are some good laughs in this movie, especially the part where they make some coffee out of his dad's ashes. However, movie lovers everywhere, my advice is to go to Blockbuster and rent Planes Trains And Automobiles. You will laugh a lot more at a cheaper price.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there was one downside to come out of director Todd Phillips' magnum opus The Hangover, it's that every film he would lend his name to in the future would inevitably be compared to it, and it's fair to say Due Date comes up short in that regard. Saying that, the film has its strengths and the cast delivers an above-average final product, but it does little to stand out amongst most other comedies released in the last decade.Downey Jnr. plays highly-strung expectant father Peter Highman, whose confrontation with Galifianakis' Ethan Tremblay at the airport results in both men being placed on a no-fly list. With no identification or cash to his name, Peter has no choice but to hitch a ride with Ethan if he wants to get to Los Angeles in time for the birth of his child. Ethan, meanwhile, has plans of making it big in Hollywood as a recurring character on Two And A Half Men, thus fulfilling his lifelong dream.It almost goes without saying that this film would fall flat if chemistry between the two leads was lacking. Thankfully, both Downey Jnr. and Galifianakis, two of the more comically capable actors of their generation, do a respectable job with their characters. Ethan is particularly well crafted as an individual both physically and verbally funny, but at the same time one who harbours a deep emotional emptiness due to an innate need to make his late father proud of him. Due Date must have felt like a reunion of sorts for Downey Jnr., who appears alongside three former co-stars in Michelle Monaghan (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang), Jamie Foxx (The Soloist) and my favourite actress Juliette Lewis (Natural Born Killers). The first two fill their roles to satisfaction, but I was disappointed with how Lewis was used. Portraying a drug dealer supplying Ethan, who uses marijuana to 'deal with his glaucoma', her role is disappointingly minor, especially considering rumours that her character was meant to be an extension of Heidi from Old School, an earlier, and very funny, Phillips comedy.For the most part, the film operates as a road trip comedy with a simple plot, which allows it to deviate from the story frequently to deliver humorous set pieces not at all relevant to the final scene. The best example is an escape plan hatched by Ethan to break Peter out of a detention centre when he is suspected of being an illegal immigrant. Of course, the scene plays out in the most ridiculous fashion, and requires a massive suspension of disbelief. But, pointless as they may be, these gags are tolerable due to the light-hearted context of the film, even if some jokes are hit and miss depending on your taste in humour and sense of political correctness.More than once, you get the impression that Phillips and the rest of the crew are just going through the motions, putting a slightly new spin on otherwise recycled comedy. Overall, however, Due Date concludes nicely, delivering no more and no less that what should be expected.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this an uneven film, which relied on large wacky set pieces set alongside very serious (bordering on mawkish) emotional moments making for an awkward stop-start feel. Some plot points didn't go anywhere and others had nowhere near the possible comic payoff you were expecting.Personally I found the film lacked a certain energy, in between the large plot points there is very little funny dialogue or character development which ultimately what makes a road movie like this work.Robert Downey Jnr. plays the neurotic straight man up to 11, but often this leads to him going borderline psychotic, while Zach Galifianakis is seemingly a dozen 'wacky' characters you've seen before all rolled into one. It certainly makes for an odd couple but not the best.Its hardly a terrible film but it doesn't flow and feels almost like a first draft. I tried to ignore the unrealistic elements and plot holes but there's quite a few. This was disappointing more than anything as the Hangover managed to balance the off-the-wall elements well for comic effect, here however it just left me unfulfilled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Better Than The Hangover... But Close, Very Close To Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Call me crazy if you want to, because this is my fourth favorite movie. Better than Horrible Bosses? No. Better than The Hangover? No. Better than The Hangover Part 2? No. But, as I said before, this is honestly my fourth favorite movie.Lets start of by saying that this movie has an awesome cast, including Robert Downey Jr., known from Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Tropic Thunder, Sherlock Holmes and much other movies, the great Zach, one of my favorite actors, which was just hilarious in this movie, totally hilarious, for two reasons, first, because he's the same actor, and second, it looks like Zach Galifianakis is the same character in this movie and in The Hangover and The Hangover Part 2, only with a different name, right, but even though, I didn't thought that was a bad thing, it all, Zach Galifianakis is known from The Hangover, The Hangover Part 2, G-Force, What Happens In Vegas, Dinner for Schmucks, It's Kind of a Funny Story and much other movies, the cast also includes Michelle Monaghan, which was okay n this movie, even tough she had a small role, but she was an important character though, she is known from The Heart-Break Kid and some other movies, there's also a bit of Juliette Lewis in this movie, she was hilarious in it, even tough she had like a 5 minutes screen time, she is known from The Switch, Whip It and some other movies, Danny McBride who did also had just a few minutes screen time, but he was very funny in it, Danny is known from Pinaeplle Express, The Foot Fist Way, The Heart- Break Kid, Hot , Your Higness, 30 Minutes or Less and much other movies and the cast also includes the director of this movie, and the both Hangover movies, the director Todd Phillips, which had an okay small role, his role looked like his role in The Hangover when he was in the elevator, Todd Phillips is known from directing The Hangover, The Hangover Part 2, Old School, starring in The Hangover and not much more than that and other guy who I was forgetting about, Jamie Foxx also stars in this movie with a nice role, Jamie Foxx is known from, lets see, my favorite movie, Horrible Bosses, The Soloist (which Downey Jr. also appeared in), Ray and some other movies. Sow, as you can see, this movie has a great cast, but that's just a small great thing from this new masterpiece.Peter Highman (Downey Jr.) is an architect who's heading home so he can be there for his son's birth, his pregnant wife, Sarah Highman (Monaghan) makes sure that everything is according to plan and he comes back at the due date. After a little accident in an airplane, which was supposed to take Peter home, caused by Ethan Chase/Tremblay (Galifianakis), Peter is now on the no fly list because of him. Peter has no way going home but going with Ethan in his car so he they can both can get back to Los Angeles, Peter, to can get to his son's birth and Ethan will have to make it there so he can have a meeting with his agent (Ethan is an actor). Everything was going okay, but Peter didn't know that he was going to have a long ride and he didn't know that Ethan is probably the worst person that he ever met. Ethan will only make bad things during the trip, he will spend all their necessary money on drugs, he will go to a waffle house even though he knows he's allergic to waffles, he will be constantly be talking during the trip, he will still a cop car and... he will fall a sleep during in a car where Peter is also sleeping and he will let the car fall from a bridge, but those are just some of the bad things he will do along that crazy road-trip. Can Peter make it to Los Angeles surviving one of the most horrible persons he ever met?Sow, this is just a masterpiece, first, I can't look at this movie without laughing, when I see Galifianakis on a scenes, I just can't stop laughing, this road-trip movie is just hilarious, entertaining and much better than some recent comedies, in a minute you will be watching a thing in it, and in the other scenes you will be watching a totally different thing in it. Okay, as I said, this is my fourth favorite, some people didn't like it, and some probably will not, but one thing is for sure, if someone watch this movie, it will laugh so hard that will want to pause the movie just can get back breading. Fourth best movie ever. 100% recommended. Grade: A+.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll sum this up in as few words as possible, first off, the movie sucks. One of those movies that you see in the theater and after watching you feel like you had just witnessed a car accident. You just leave the theater with your head down and try to forget everything that just happened...Zack Galifianakis is fast becoming the next Seth Rogen, Micheal Sera, Jonah Hill, etc. His appeal is fading pretty quick as he is being type-cast in the same role, playing the same goofy, lovable, neurotic overweight guy. Hopefully by next year we will all be saying "do you remember that guy..?"Basically the movie is a clash of the opposites/buddy road trip/feel good stereotype that has been done better by classics such as Planes, Trains, and Automobiles. The characters are not lovable at all, do not generate sympathy, and actually work to create animosity towards them. All the unbelievable situations they find themselves involved in are completely ridiculous and have you rolling your eyes and looking at your watch all at the same time.Go rent Planes, Trains, and Automobiles instead, You will get more laughs. Hopefully the next time I see Zack Galifianakis will be on one of those "where are they now" specials in about 15 years...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was on a flight to Singapore when I saw this film on my in-seat entertainment unit. I decided to give it a watch, even though I had heard rumblings that it was not very good.Well, I didn't last long before i switched it off and watched something else...in this case The Social Network, which was excellent...but thats another review. If I had been in a cinema i would have surely walked out and that doesn't happen very often - even if the movie is truly dire.The movie is essentially a big rip of of Planes, Trains and Automobiles. Except it isn't funny and the characters are horrible people. You will hate both characters, I honestly can't decide who was worse.!!SPOILER ALERT!! After watching both characters descend into one endless reel of stupidly unfunny situations after another; like being beaten by a wheel chair bound war veteran; being shot with rubber bullets on a plane by a trigger happy Air Marshall; one character hitting a child...for me, having one character jerk off in a rental car while the other one is in the seat next to him was just enough.I hope they take this movie and bury it in that deep pit in Las Vegas with all the crushed ET and Pacman Atari 2600 games.Awful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you feel down, and need some good humor that may be a little oddball and contains a lot of swearing, watch Due Date. The movie begins with a very simple premise somewhat reminiscent of old sitcoms from the 1950's, and evolves from there into a roadtrip movie, which is one of my favorite genres of movies! From the first encounter at the loans office, up until the accidental Mexican border crossover, this movie shows what happens when polar opposites go for a long ride together. The end also ends up being happy despite the movie's content, with Ethan getting his acting job with a cameo on Two And A Half Men, and RDJ's character showing up just in time for the birth of his new kid. It's an awesome movie! Don't pass it up if you can!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can certainly sympathize with Peter's motivations for getting home for the birth of his kid. I was out of town at a training course two weeks before my first child was due to be born. About four in the morning I got a phone call at the hotel that my wife unexpectedly went into labor. I made the drive between Austin and Houston in record time by driving well over 100 mph and praying a cop didn't spot me. So as I watched Peter frantically trying to get home in "Due Date," I completely understood his desperation, frustration and willingness to break a few laws in order to get to the hospital in time. I've made that bleary-eyed, panicked, dazed-and-confused dash through the hospital before, too.The success of this film is entirely due to Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis. I think if you had taken this script and had any other actors perform it, you would have had an entirely different and less funny movie. The two have wonderful chemistry together and you can tell their ad-libbing enhanced the scenes. A lot of comparisons are going to be made between this and "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" and they're entirely justified. You have a road trip picture with a great comedy duo, and it's a lot of fun.Robert Downey Jr. is excellent as the high-strung Peter Highman. Somehow every situation he's put in spins completely out of his control. Ethan manages to push every single one of Peter's buttons. Because of Ethan, Peter is battered physically, he has multiple run-ins with the law, and he breaks even his own moral code. By the end of the movie, Ethan has violated Peter in every way imaginable except sexually, and he manages to avoid that just barely. Downey is great at portraying frustration and exasperation, especially in the face of Galifianakis. A lot of the laughs are also generated when Peter does something he wouldn't do in any other sane situation. Whether he's punching a kid in the stomach or spitting in a dog's face (how they got that by the humane society I'll never know), there's no limit to the depth to which Ethan can push Peter to sink.Zach Galifianakis is also excellent as Ethan Tremblay. He's a character so incredibly eccentic it's hard to decide where to start in saying why. He's an aspiring actor with no experience or talent, yet dreams of working on "Two and a Half Men." He carries the ashes of his dead father with him which is the source of an endless number of jokes, both obvious and not. I won't even get into Ethan's ritual before going to sleep. Ethan could push anyone to the brink of insanity, yet he doesn't mean to be annoying. Despite his good intentions and efforts to be friendly, any sane human would want to strangle him.There are a few fun cameos in the film, too. Juliette Lewis appears as Heidi, a white-trash, pot-dealing mother of two. Danny McBride has a cameo as Lonnie, a Western Union employee you wouldn't want to mess with (I would also think twice about doing business with Western Union after seeing this! How did they get this approved?). And Jamie Foxx also appears as Darryl, Peter's friend. Considering his crazy comedy past, I expected more from Foxx in this film but he leaves the spotlight for the leads.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As other people have said, "Due Date" is clearly a remake of "Planes, train and Automobiles". But it's a bad remake because there is no sympathy from the viewer for either character played by Robert Downey Jr nor Zach Galifianakis. The reason being that the former is a self-centered architect who is constantly angry and insults everyone and the latter is a pothead loser no one would want to be friends with in the first place. The premise of the movie is also badly brought upon, as we are meant to believe that US Marshalls randomly shoot air passengers who haven't done anything. As a comparison, in PT&amp;A, the characters meet because they are simply stranded due to bad weather. Finally, the comedy value of the movie is virtually non-existent. There's nothing funny about a car crash because pothead loser falls asleep at the wheel, or about spitting on a dog because self-pompous architect is angry yet again. There's nothing funny about drinking the ashes of some dead person, there's nothing funny about masturbating to go to sleep next to a stranger, etc..</fullReview>

It is filled with poor humor random stunts for the trailers and two big name actors. What it isn't filled with, however, is a story. It has a very loose plot that cant even act as a driving force for the movie. No pun intended.The actors though, do, do a good job with their characters and are enough to make you interested in the movie but no matter how hard they try, not even Robert Downie Jr and Zach Galifianakis can save the movie from its inevitable failure.A combination of poor story writing, lack of passion, cheap laughs, crude humor and ultimately what appears to be a rushed job of a poorly thought out idea, put all the nails in this movies coffin.The movie has no soul, passion or emotion and if you are looking for a good laugh on a Saturday night, get something else.You will find more taste and laughs in a Cannibal Corpse album.3/10 stars, 1.5/5 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**** Plenty of possible spoilers ***This movie can't complain that it's actors were on the sloppy side. RDJ and ZG were at their best and were just about the only thing watchable in this movie.It looks like the movie was made for teenagers, cue loud rock music after every scene. If you make a movie about a road trip you have to find a way to make up for a lot of downtime, but the way Todd Phillips handles this is just sloppy. They feel more like interruptions (buy the soundtrack !) than transitions. Apart from the one where they drive stoned we don't get to see anything worthwhile or funny.Funny in this movie is a strange business. It's mean spirited on about every level.On one hand we have a jerk. I'm sorry but there's hardly another way to describe RDJ's Peter Highman. This character would rather die or find another way to get home than accept Ethan's invitation. There might be something called love but Peter hasn't got a clue about that so his eagerness to be at the bedside of his wife as she's delivering the next Highman seems out of place. Hitting an obnoxious kid can be done funny, but here it isn't. He despises the mother, so he insults the kids and when they react badly he hits one of them in the stomach. There's a difference in pushing a kid in the water because you hate kids or people in general and harassing them because they're all white/black/whatever trash to you.Ethan's a basket case. He has no clue on how to behave himself and is clearly mentally challenged. Laughing at stupid people doing silly things has been done ever since the first joke was invented. But Ethan's character is just sad. He seemed to have lost the only one that cared for him in this world and has no idea on how to interact with other people or defend himself. If watching someone loosing his dignity and being destroyed by others is funny, they might as well start putting seats in the local psychiatric hospital.I'm not even going to describe the inconsistencies and the loose ends here, as this movie doesn't care and neither do I. I do hope to see both actors again, in a better movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not fun at all. Period!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is simply disappointing. It is such a pity, because road trip movies can be real funny and last literally forever in our minds, thank God this is not the case, because you will unconsciously remove this movie from your memories. The plot is simply inconsistent and the acting is really unnatural, just as if the actors themselves knew the movie was not for them. What really shocks me the most is that there were people who wrote it and got even paid for that! I loved Zach Galifianakis in Hangover, but here he is not fun at all, maybe a little bit in the end when he actually gets a part in a show. Naaa, not even there!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a Comedy but without the Funny Parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zack Galifinakis and Robert Downey replay a film done by Steve Martin and John Candy which was then called "Planes, Trains and Automobiles." Galifinakis plays the slob which was Candy's part, and Downey plays the uptight urbane architect which was Martin's part. The former film was much more successful.Candy played a clueless loser who was unsophisticated. Galifinakis takes the part somewhere darker. He's a pathetic person is mourning over the loss of his father, whose ashes he carries around in a coffee can. Eventually, there is a mistake and they drink a brew of his father's ashes, mistaking them for real coffee. I am no chef, but ashes and coffee are not almost alike in appearance.Where we are supposed to laugh at Zack, we are feeling more pain than hilarity. At other times, he does things which are so irritating that one wishes he would go away. Comedy is often a stupid reaction to an ordinary event, but Zack is not just stupid and stoned. You begin to feel that he is emotionally and mentally incapable of surviving ordinary life. He is more disturbing than funny. Candy, in Trains, Planes and Autombiles, had his own charm and survival skills. When the pair ran out of money, Candy is able to sell trinkets at inflated prices to enable the pair to continue their journey. His street survival instincts trump the effete sensibilities of Martin's character. Zack's character is incapable of living outside an institution. He's dumb, but he's dangerously naive. This was a painful journey for me, and a disappointment as I have admired Zack in earlier films and have a lot of respect for Robert Downey's considerable talents. Even in this car wreck, Downey is interesting. It's the way he enunciates. He sounds interesting.The responsibility for bad comic timing on stage is not the sole responsibility of the performer. In films, the blame is shared by bad writing, bad directing and bad editing. There was plenty of blame to go around here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The potential for a great movie was there; but, it failed.While it's a comedy--true great comedy comes when the characters are actually believable. This was a poor attempt at John Candy and Steve Martin "wannabees"--not even close.Both characters were obviously not comfortable in their roles--they were just awful. And the "jokes" and "tag lines"--bathroom style humor! BORING! And the "funny scenes"--were more like "Funniest Home Video" type humor. Just watching people get into unbelievable situations and getting hurt, doesn't automatically make it funny--I did not laugh even once during the entire movie! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waste of time. Seriously.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I adore RDJ. I'm a late-comer to his fandom ? I only started to love him after he was in Iron Man ? but I've started to expect a lot out of him in the acting department, what with Iron Man, Sherlock Holmes, and Tropic Thunder.So while I was not disappointed by his acting ability in Due Date, I was incredibly, unbelievably, amazingly disappointed by the fact that he chose to take part in what is probably one of the stupidest movies that I've ever seen. The whole point of the movie, in case you haven't already heard, is that RDJ's character, Peter, has to get to California from Atlanta by Friday because that's when his wife's C-section is scheduled and he wants to be there for the birth of his first child. So he plans to fly home a week early and everything is great? until he runs into Zak Galifianakis at the airport and, as in all stupid comedies, Bad Things Happen That Wouldn't Happen In Real Life.Long story short, they scuffle and RDJ gets shot with a rubber bullet by an air marshal before the plane even begins to move, and both RDJ and Zak's character Ethan are put on the No Fly List. Did you see that coming? Because I certainly did. Of course, RDJ's wallet and therefore identification are stuck on the plane to LA, so he has no way of getting across the country until (dun da-na-na!) Ethan rolls up in a girly red rental car and offers to drive RDJ across the country.What follows is an hour and a half of the stupidest thing I've ever seen in my life. It was full of dull, tired, half-hearted jokes that were barely funny the first time around and not at ALL funny the second time around. Due Date tries really hard to bring in a real plot with the introduction of Jamie Foxx's character ? who, in all honesty, I can't even remember the name of ? but it's too little too late for this sad attempt at a movie that combines both comedy and seriousness.I will probably never see this film again despite the fact that I love both Galifianakis and RDJ. The acting from both of them was actually really, really good, but the writing was just terrible, so the fact that they were the supernovas in a film of black holes shows just how good they are at acting. I hope the two of them get together some time again in the future, but this movie was just terrible. I only give it two out of ten stars, and I really do not recommend it at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>awful Robert Downey Jr</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really need to say i tried my hardest to like the character of RDJ but no matter how much i tried i could not manage to like his character. RDJ casts a bad spell on his character he played as a man to rush to be with his wife expecting to deliver a baby in a c-section labor after some mishap taking place he is taken to the no fly list and gets kicked out the plane then he runs into Ethan who is supposedly the reason why RDJ is on the no fly list is a deranged character who has just lost his dad and wants to make all his dreams come true by going to Hollywood and appearing in the TV show called 2 and a half men. I was pretty hesitant about this duo to ensue a whole movie together without boring the audience however RDJ did his best to be an unlikable character who even performed unsettlingly atrocious personality like spitting on an innocent dog and attempting to get rid of the ashes of Ethan's father. His despising Ethan in every minute of the movie overshadowed doubts on the character of Ethan who is pretty funny with his funny accent and repeating how old he is over and over .Ethan's flamboyant personality matches with the role he was given except for the severe immoral masturbating graphics that was quite disgusting and unnecessary. I did not understand what the director of this movie thought by filming a moment like that. Was it to hit the adult audience and if so what about kids watching this movie? DJR boring and brooding personality made the movie quite a drama than a funny comedy.I could understand some uptight figure in the first 10 minutes of the movie cause Ethan was pretty much the reason why RDJ was kicked out the plane and put in the no fly zone but he was uptight and negative till the end of the movie. All of a sudden his great affinity and postulating his sympathy for Ethan after the Mexican breakout was so tacky and fake. I thought after this affinity of RDJ i was gonna see some better comedy but he pretty much messed it up punching on the face of Ethan after finding out Ethan kept his wallet not to be lonely. After watching the movie Soloist i had really lost a lot of credits on RDJ and i had really hated his weak character. I don't really think he should cast in a movie that is supposedly filmed as a comedy . RDJ is quite a boring actor with nothing worth wondering about him . I was gonna halt the movie in the first 20 minutes but i just felt indebted to Zack cause he was pretty good. Evren Buyruk from USA</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was truly unbearable. The characters were unlikable, and the situations they got themselves into were frustrating to watch. Both leads do their best to rise above the banal and awkward script, but inevitably fail. The plot suffers from being forced to the typical conclusion - in which one main character warms to the idiosyncrasies of the other - despite the fact that the guy is a complete and utter moron incapable of anything resembling normal human interaction.This has nothing in common with The Hangover, regardless of who was involved in its production. It has more in common with the classic, and much, much superior Planes, Trains, and Automobiles - which I immediately loaded in the DVD player after watching Due Date to get the bad taste out of my mouth.My recommendation is to stay away from this and save yourself the frustration of watching it from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was recommended this film initially, thus I viewed it. I must mention, after watching it.....I wish I would not have. Don't get me wrong, it had its somewhat funny parts but in it's entirety it was unfunny. I love a good romp and I also love toilet humor but this film was seriously not funny (aside from the few moments). Downey is a good actor and I can not for the life of me devise why he would do a film like this. He is letting himself down with something of this calibre. Now, Zack Galifacwhocares, well is he a good actor? I think he must have good friends because he can't really act. Think about it, every film he has done, even since bubble boy has been the same character.This film is a regurgitated concept with a few new gags. I say watch Plains, Trains and Automobiles with Steve Martin and John Candy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Today I got the pleasure of watching 'The Hangover II' and it was the first time that I had ever reviewed a movie because it rated as the worst movie for 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014.When I saw that Zach Galifianakis, was in that movie was now in this movie, I had 'BAD' feelings about this one...but Robert Downey Jr. is so good at all that he has done that I thought that it would be a good second chance and to get the taste of that last 'load of - (watch The Hangover II) you will get the inside joke to this last line - out of my mouth!Well now I can say without excluding any actor living, dead or not even born that Zach Galifianakis can take the prize for being the worst actor. Reason that he can win this prize is simple.Yes there are some really bad actors but they had bad scripts or bad editing or bad co-stars but when you are able to take an A List star RDjr and destroy each and every scene with him then you have got to be in then you must win this prize! The movie is a rip off of Planes, Trains and Automoblies - of which I was never a great fan of Steve Martin, but I would pay to see him do a send up of the 'Last Supper' before I would watch Zach Galifianakis even recite his ABC's!!BAD BAD BAD....PS: Jamie Fox could have phoned in his performance and I bet he wish he had.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a waste of Robert Downey's talent. This unbelievably bad piece of celluloid strip is, for his dignity perhaps, one or two steps above detox in a rehab center. It will forever be the low point of his career.The rest of the cast, with the exception of Zach Galifianakis, are insignificant and totally forgettable. However, Galifianakis makes a big impression in his role as a whining, effete dirt bag, similar to the impression a sledgehammer would make on my foot. His character is so grating and annoying, so totally worthy of real life derision and hate. Downey's character isn't much different, except that he generally takes responsibility for the situations that make him out to be such a turd.The absolute low point of this film was the dual-species masturbation scene. Enough said.The high point of the film is when Downey gets his ass kicked, badly.Comparing this piece of trash to "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" is like comparing a rancid, no-frills brand hot dog to a piece of the finest filet mignon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See the trailer? Seen the movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Due Date suffers from the same fate the seems to destroy a lot of other comedies. Everything that was funny in the film, you've already seen in the trailer. I can only think of one bit they do in the film that was obviously too risky for a green band trailer. Due to a misunderstanding, Peter (RDJ) is thrown off of a plane and is officially grounded, meaning he can't take any planes to get home to his pregnant wife who is about to give birth. He decides to accept an offer from Ethan (Galifianakis), who has a car and wants to give him a ride back home. Hilarity ensues, right? Due Date is a cruder and ruder version of Planes, Trains and Automobiles, which is actually the funnier film. Galifianakis plays the same role he does in The Hangover, an obtuse and weird character. Here he plays up the obtuse and weird a tad more though. Robert Downey Jr. a ruder and cruder version of Tony Stark, minus the genius part. So if you like those aspects, the film will generally please you. Of course the film wouldn't be funny without some obstacles in their way. Those obstacles are funny, but again, stuff we've already seen. The supporting cast helps the film a lot, Danny McBride, Juliette Lewis and even Jamie Foxx work well in their small roles. John Candy and Steve Martin did it funnier years ago, which proves to me that comedy is always in the timing and not in the language. I find both Robert Downey Jr and Galifianakis funny, but they both seem to rely on the crude aspect of funny. I would say to stick with the original, although this isn't that bad a film, it just feels like a crude re-hash of something funnier.</fullReview>

Jokes that just didn't fit and scenes that were created by a stoned college group of wanna-be writers who forgot about anything actually believable.

		<fullReview>I agree with many of the previous commentators that it is as a remake of PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES that this film truly stinks. John Candy must have been rotating in his grave (with great difficulty, I would imagine) when this was premiered. But this is awful on so many levels. The acting is unbelievably bad. Did no one tell Downey Jr. that he was in a comedy? Or can he just not do funny? Galifianakis does not act at all. And why should he? After all he sports a perm and a beard and is carrying a lapdog. Surely that's funny enough to carry two films. The writing is atrocious. Some of the crude things the characters come out with are really offensive and hateful. And you're supposed to care about what happens to them? What was worst for me was the camera work and the editing. The camera angles are all over the place: there are hand-helds, helicopter shots and other extravagant shots edited in a fast, gritty way that would make a thriller look overdone, never mind a comedy. It made watching DUE DATE actually really annoying and irritating. There is nothing remotely funny or enjoyable about DUE DATE. Any 10-minute fail compilation on YOUTUBE will give you a lot more pleasure than this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't expect expect The Hangover or compare to PT&amp;A'S and you might like it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only am writing this review basically to respond to the other reviews posted. While i have to admit that Due Date is not in my list of top ten movies of all time, but it seems that a majority of the other reviewers of this film are comparing it to Plains Trains and Automobiles. Which i might add is in my top 3 comedies of all time. (Huge John Candy fan) This is suppose to be a review of Due Date. Not a review of comparing Due Date to PT&amp;A. I think it is pretty obvious that PT&amp;A is a classic and was the type of film that comes along too few and far between and is hard to compile the amount of talent shown by two leading roles for a comparison. With that said, I can agree that Phillips' seems to be getting a little complex with his story lines (this one we have seen before) and understandably after the success of The Hangover and previous comedies this will be compared to and for the common movie goer siting down to watch Due Date with those other story lines and plots in mind will be disappointed. Once you accept the story line and look into the characters i feel RDJ and ZG make the most of there characters come to life and deliver each role quite well. Remember folks, this is a comedy. Overall i would describe Due Date as a wild road trip for two strangers with completely different personalities with some twists and turns along the way that will make you laugh. Not a great movie. But well performed and should enjoy if you go into it with the right mind set.</fullReview>

Sure, going in, you would think RDJ and ZG would be a formidable duo, with SOME comedic meshing together, but the plot wouldn't allow them to, as it went back and forth between love and hate amongst them, cutting off any chance at being remotely funny. What could have been an excellent movie turned into a very poor man's T's, P's and A's. I was wondering why or how RDJ agreed to do this...The trailers showed EVERY funny moment, with so much nonsense in between. Made it to the end of the movie, only because the person who I was watching it with had a few beers and wanted to see the end. Watch at own risk.</fullReview>

I have never wanted to beat the hell out of a character quicker than I did with this movie, and then the character had no redeeming value: get someone shot, get them put on the no fly list, almost run them over, steal their bag, almost kill them in a car crash... needless to say I shut this sh*t off, It f*ck*ng sucks....you can't redeem Hitler by showing that he cried at the end, and you cant redeem someone this sociopathic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grease was a very successful movie in which Olivia Newton-John played an important part. However, when Xanadu came out it became clear that the success of Grease wasn't due to her but, rather, to an excellent ensemble cast in a good film.The Hangover was a very successful movie in which Zach Galifianakis played an important part. However, when Due Date came out it became clear that the success of The Hangover wasn't due to him but, rather, to an excellent ensemble cast in a good film. Plus ca change.Due Date - which is essentially a reworking of Trains, Planes and Automobiles with Robert Downey Jr in the Steve Martin role and Galifianakis as John Candy - has a number of major problems.One: it is one of those comedies which isn't funny. I smiled half a dozen times (to be fair, there were some young women in the audience who found Galifianakis' mildly camp would-be actor idiot hysterical: as I said, I hardly cracked a smile.Two, both main characters are essentially unsympathetic for most of the movie. Downey is angry, uptight, aggressive, and intolerant while Galifianakis, although essentially well meaning, is enormously irritating. He fears being alone: he is alone because he is an enormously difficult person to like. At least Downey mellows in the last third of the film: Galifianakis is as irritating at the end as he is at the start.And three: it is not even slightly believable. The events and actions of the two protagonists defied my best efforts at suspending disbelief and, believe me, that's something I am very good at.In an effort to say something positive, there are several moments of good and touching acting, mainly in sequences when the characters are touching on relationships with their fathers. But overall, this was a major disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A road movie about two different people forced to travel together, done before but a nice twist on it. Unfortunately it didn't work for me.The problem is that this film is shot fairly sincerely with a degree of realism. I think the concept is best suited for a glitzy shallow comedy. With the likes of 'Road Trip' etc. the characters are two dimensional enough to bounce back from whatever is thrown at them, here funny moments are soured by the realisation that the characters are hurting.To progress the plot a certain amount of zany events need to take place, again in a trashy comedy you can get away with throwing all kinds of bizarre obstacles at the characters. Here I found myself questioning the antics unfolding.Where the likes of 'Planes Trains Autombiles' is light hearted with moments of tenderness this got a little depressing.The production is great the acting is top notch, but by the end I was bored.</fullReview>

Not all that much happened in the second half, and a lot of trimming could have been done. - and we had a grossly overweight couple in front of us (me, my mate and his bro). Not only that, but a gang of neds were providing running commentary and trying (and failing) to be funny about it, along with their annoying hyena like laughter.

Let alone a movie with a big name like Robert Downy Jr. in it. Robert Downy Jr. should sack his agent immediately for even suggesting a role in Due Date.An attempt at copying a classic film like Planes, Trains and Automobiles that more than failed to achieve a laugh. Steve Martin and John Candy pulled it off with a well written plot, good timing and the fact that they were comedians. You find yourself feeling sorry for the actors in this film who obviously struggled in the comedic roles.I also could not believe the violence against children, that really sickened me. Abusing children is not funny at all.Please think carefully before wasting your time with this less than B grade movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfunny under every aspect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" and strip the characters of their funny and likable traits and turn them into obnoxious and unsympathetic one-dimensional tools. Then add plenty of unbelievable and unnecessary clichés to the plot just to make the trip last a bit longer. And a very unfulfilling ending... That's "Due Date" for you.Ethan has to be the most annoying and unlikable man-child to ever (dis)grace the silver screen. How we're supposed to feel for him and to like him is beyond me. Au contraire his stupid antics make me even condone Peter's tantrums and psychotic rage, mostly because I know it's more or less the same way I'd react should I ever have to be in the same room/car with Ethan...The characters do not evolve a lick, and we're not given enough (if any) background to understand why they are like they are.The credibility of the movie goes out of the window right after the pot-smoking incident and the Mexican-trailer jailbreak. Surely the border police wouldn't stop chasing a stolen police vehicle after such a spectacular (and over-the-top) escape.Not to mention the fact Peter can survive a gunshot to his leg for almost a whole day without major consequences, and he can also limp around an hospital, and a maternity ward of all things, bloodied and dirty without being noticed.All of that could have been forgiven had the movie actually been funny. But funny it is NOT! It's annoying, unfunny and uninspired.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This could have been a pretty good road-trip comedy. However it pales into mediocrity in comparison with the classic Planes Trains and Automobiles. In my view its the writing. The script should have been so much funnier. The actual plot is fairly standard stuff with plenty of opportunity for mirth. The actors are good and they appear to be trying, but with that material they are just not going to be able to create the atmosphere and the laughs of much better but similar films.Nowhere near as good as the wonderful The Hangover or even Midnight Run.Give it a miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>....but I didn't.I usually love this type of movie and absolutely love Zach Galifianakis and Robert Downey Jr. and have been looking forward to watching this for months but only to be hugely disappointed.This movie had the odd funny moment which did make me chuckle and quite a few people in the movie theatre were doing huge belly laughs throughout so they obviously were enjoying themselves, but really I was wondering what they were laughing about the majority of the time!! I thought the film was quite dark, nasty and mean and I came out feeling a bit low. Ethan Tremblay (played by Zach) was clearly a slob who would get on your nerves quite a bit, but I thought the behaviour of Peter Highman (played by Robert) was truly awful. Having a fight with airport security, punching a kid in the stomach, spitting in a dogs face and just his treatment of Ethan throughout the film was simply cruel. It was extremely difficult, almost impossible to like him. One of the worst moments of the story for me has to be when Ethan and Peter accidentally drink Ethan's dad's ashes which were being kept in a coffee tin and then the remaining ashes get knocked onto the floor of the kitchen and Ethan crawls around trying to sweep them up back into the tin. This scene just made me want to cry, not laugh.I don't think I would like to watch this movie again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have only walked out on a movie one time in my life, up until "Due Date." To say this movie was bad is to do a dis-service to bad movies. Due Date has to be the worst movie of the year and maybe the decade. If you manage to stay for the entire 138 minutes (I stayed for approximately 110 minutes) you can truthfully say it was not only 138 minutes you'll never get back in your life, it will also ensure you will enjoy watching paint drying or grass growing in the future. Acting was poor but it may be because the script was so poor. As has been suggested, this was a poor attempt to duplicate Planes, Trains and Automobiles; however, comparing the two is like comparing a pristine swimming pool to a septic tank.</fullReview>

This was just formula at its worst - a string of forced, try-hard moments that barely even felt connected.

Given I have to type a minimum length for this review to be published, let me say again - this was just a really, really bad movie. In fact, I wonder if I put more spaces between the words and spread out my disappointment for this film, if it would be accepted sooner...worth a try.

		<fullReview>This was a terrible film. I did not laugh through the entire film I chuckled twice: tell a lie I did laugh, I laughed at the end of the film at how disgusted I felt, that this film made it to the big screen the writing was appalling, there was no comedy timing because there was nothing funny in this script. Then reality sunk in that we had actually paid to see this. I expected more from Robert Downey Jr. How did they sign him up to this? Did they show him a different script or did the Iron Man producers not pay him enough?I had not expected too much from Zach Galifianakis although I found him very funny in The Hangover but I now realise that they just give him a prop to play with and expect him to be funny, this time instead of a baby that he pretends to masturbate, they gave him a dog which does it itself.A very, very boring film would not recommend to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film fails in every sense. There was clearly almost no script and the duo simply signed onto work with one another out of admiration. We're clearly seeing a lot of failed improvisation. The film definitely has it's moments but there is no consistent progress of humor. A good comedy is one that picks up speed, this one never manages to get it's start. It's disappointing since I find these two actors and the friends they had appear in cameos tend to pick their jobs quite well and with the intentions of delivering a quality product for the hard working consumer.Further more, it absolutely disgusts me to see the ballot box stuffed. Nobody other than the actors, friends and family would give this turd wad such positive reviews. This movie is a 4 at best, maybe a 4.5 because of the action scenes and random jokes that do turn out to be funny.Really, it's a failed tribute to Planes, Trains and Automobiles. I think I would have gotten a bigger laugh out of watching Downey get arrested for cocaine possession and a handgun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Atlanta, the uptight architect Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jr.) is ready to go to the airport to fly in the first-class to meet his wife that has a Caesarean section scheduled in Los Angeles for the birth of their first son in five days. However, he stumbles with the clumsy pothead and aspirant actor Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis) that provokes an incident in the cabin and they are expelled from the plane and Peter is included in the "no-fly" list. Further, without his wallet with documents, credit card and money and luggage that remained in the plane and are delivered in LA. Peter is forced to accept the lift of Ethan that has attended the funeral service of his father and intend to drop his ashes in the Grand Canyon. Peter has a painful journey with many incidents and accidents and changes his behavior. "Due Date" is a disappointing and uneven comedy that is more silly and stupid than funny. The plot uses a similar storyline of "Dinner for the Schmucks" with a straight man that meets a schmuck and is forced to stay with him to achieve a goal. I had great expectation that "Due Date" would be a great film, but the situations that are supposed to be funny never work and I laughed only in a couple of scenes. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): "Um Parto de Viagem" ("A Delivery Trip")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Due Date's greatest sin is that you hate the main characters. Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jr) is a a hateful man who spits at dogs, hits children, and steals from helpless people. Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis) is a complete weirdo, actor wannabe who is neither likable nor charming. By the end of the movie, Peter does not like Ethan much more than when they first met; their 'friendship' seems more of a chore than a bond. In the film's worst sequence, Ethan, the weirdo who can't act, is thrown five feet into the air in the back of a pick up truck as Peter and his pal laugh in the cabin. The joke is that a bad thing is happening to a down-on-his-luck character that you generally feel sorry for. This is not good comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. It had its moments of laughter, good humor, excitement, and adventure. It keeps you on the edge of your seat at times, and never ceases to be entertaining.That said, WHERE HAVE I SEEN THIS BEFORE?! PLANES, TRAINS, AND AUTOMOBILES!! Although the plot is different and has different ideas with a different story-line, the common- denominators are the same: A cool dude is looking to get home to his family, and encounters an annoying/socially inept travel companion who is lonely and looking for company along the way. John Candy's character in Planes Trains and Automobiles is almost exactly like Ethan in this movie, annoying the Peter (similar to Steve Martin's character in Planes Trains and Automobiles.) Just as in Planes, Trains, and Automobiles - the two lead characters struggle to get across country with one terribly annoying the other. The endings are different (both positive) as well as the struggles to get home and the character personalities/aspirations; but there were just too many similarities with Planes Trains and Automobiles to give this movie a higher rating than a 6.This movie is very enjoyable and entertaining, and I would recommend it for anyone looking for a good movie. If you've never seen the classic Planes, Trains, and Automobiles - you have nothing to compare it to, so I would recommend it. If you have, be prepared to see some extreme similarities that may lessen the enjoyment of this movie. All that said - well done and well acted still make it positive, and I do not regret watching from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Due Date (2010): Dir: Todd Phillips / Cast: Robert Downey Jr., Zach Galifianakis, Jamie Foxx, Michelle Monaghan, Juliette Lewis: Another exhausted road movie comedy full of stupid clichés. This one not only regards the soon-to-be birth of Robert Downey Jr.'s kid, but it also regards his sudden situation where he is forced to be civil to someone who is a complete moron. Downey Jr. is forced into a road trip with Zach Galifianakis, an aspiring actor who wishes to dump his father's ashes in the Grand Canyon. As predicted, they get into various mishaps that are unbelievable while becoming best pals. This sounds vaguely familiar. Maybe it is because Planes,Trains and Automobiles handled this storyline much more effectively. Downey Jr is a capable actor just coming off two blockbusters so this is no advance for him. Galifianakis was likable in The Hangover but here he is downright pathetic. Michelle Monaghan as Downey Jr.'s wife is wasted in phone contacts. It is a given that she will go into labor and Galifianakis will do something that will gain Downey Jr's good graces. Jamie Foxx is the one interesting character who is suspected of foul play with Monaghan, and who actually assists them with transportation that one point. Juliette Lewis is apparently playing the same character she played in another Todd Phillips comedy, Old School, where she was much more fun to watch. Directed by Todd Phillips as a lazy followup to his masterpiece The Hangover. Expect none of that clever comic expertize here although watching the film itself has got to be in equal manner with a hangover. Score: 2 ? / 10</fullReview>

Extreme chemistry between the two leads. Downey and Zach are like two poles, extreme opposite and yet they bring you along on this hilarious ride with them.You would still laugh when you hear "Dad, you were like a father to me."

		<fullReview>I have watched this movie since it came out five years ago and to be honest I was really confused when I decided to review it on IMDb. 6.6 out of 10 is not that low but it's pretty low for what I expected. OK, I happen to love both these actors and so, an eight makes sense for me, but I would at least expect an overall 7/10...! This is an amazing comedy, lots of funny moments there, not the hilarious really obvious ones, but moments with laughter that is deeply rooted in the traits of each character. The laughs that this movie gets are, most of them, intelligent laughs. This is not a movie with jokes that everyone gets. And that's a good thing. The plot is amazing and the acting, upon which the movie heavily depends, both from Galifianakis and Downey Jr., was amazing! Just amazing! The supporting cast carried the movie as well with no problems, actually adding nice elements to the story (like the war veteran). This is a classic that will get laughs out of you no matter how many times you watch it. Yesterday it was my third time and I still laughed most of the time. Good job!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must be frank. This is the second time I am watching Due Date. The first time, I hated it. The 2nd time I found myself chuckling. Odd, I know but, I guess the movie sort of grows on you. The plot is reminiscent of 'Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles' But this is a fresh take. This is probably one of Downey's most laid back performances. Zack &amp; Downey do make for an odd pairing. But, both are witty &amp; engaging none the less. The plot is uncomplicated. Downey Jr. as an uptight architect who likes order in life. However on his flight back home, he is offloaded due to a set of misunderstandings and is stuck with Zack. With no luggage, No money, out of options, Downey is forced to embark on a road trip with Zack, to head home. With a crazy character like Zack, troubles follow. Some parts of the movie especially the prison part is kind of hard to digest. But with a crazy, wacky person like Zack, I guess we can take it with a pinch of salt !</fullReview>

He runs into Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis) who constantly messes up his travel plans. They are both kicked off the plane when Ethan keeps saying "terrorist" and "bomb". They are now on the No Fly List. Peter's luggage and wallet remains on the plane to L.A. He reluctantly takes a ride from Ethan.This is obviously inspired by 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles'. Galifianakis is John Candy's character with more incompetence and more inappropriateness. Downey is Steve Martin's character with more anger. Director Todd Phillips is throwing everything into this. Sometimes it's insanely hilarious. They are not the same charming Candy Martin duo but they still make a fine odd couple. It is at its hiliarious best when Ethan angers Peter and the laughs are big.</fullReview>

I can never forget his lines, "Why would you do that!" I think Jamie Fox and Michelle Monaghan should had some more part do do in the movie as their limited roles makes us want more.

The road trip/buddy comedy starred Zach Galifianakis (who I was surprised to see had some good acting ability) and Robert Downey Jr. (who seems to always play similar characters with the same type of attitude and personalities). Zach plays an odd aspiring actor who just lost his father and is in need of friendship and RDJ is a husband who is trying to get home for the birth of his first child. Crazy and extreme situations arise and the two are forced to go on a cross country trip in order to both reach their destinations. As hilarity ensues, they go through many things together including a lot of hatred, but in the end become friends. While its plot was definitely unique and entertaining, it wasn't anything extremely special. It was worth the watch but nothing that will be ingrained in my memory forever.</fullReview>

Personally i think the movie was decent, had good moments, since i really enjoyed the Hangover franchise and especially Zach Galifianakis as an actor, Zach was practically the same as in The Hangover, he is this extremely stupid, yet super friendly guy, who just always does some non sensical stuff, which is very funny, i would really love to see some more movies with him playing this kind of role. Robert Downey Jr. was decent as always and i think this duo was very well selected for a movie like this.So, although maybe not the best comedy ever made, had some funny moments and great actors.

Story starts with a scene when a decent guy (Robert) bumps into a swag (Zach). And that little bump gets him into shot by Air marshal and detained from flying across US. Pretty much of a starter, then they both decides to travel all the way to LA, for like 2000 Kilometers. Robert is having a kid and he don't wanna miss the chance to be with his wife. While Zach wants to meet his consultant for a role. Zach's continuous nonsense keeps on humiliating and hurting Robert, which by the end made them friends.A must watch movie it is.A funny humorous combination with stupidity, will make you die laughing. In case you are planning to watch it with your kids, don't do that, pretty much an adult movie.</fullReview>

I like shock humor. I think RDJ punching a kid in the stomach is great....the kid was a huge a-hole. I love pot movies, they are funny. No, I don't like college humor movies or much slap-stick but I will watch some of them if they are the least bit bearable. This movie is funny, its not horrible. If you like Todd Phillips' films, and not just the freaking overrated Hangover flick, you will enjoy this one too. It was great after a (gasp) joint, and it was great sober too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad that I watched this surprisingly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I just want to say that even if you don't compare this to P, T and Auto it still is pretty bad. I want to first throw out that I REALLY like both of these actors but that does not excuse how shitty the script is. Of course both RD Jr and Zach G acted brilliantly in this, the issue is they couldn't make what they were saying funny. In fact, the only funny parts were after the weed smoking, there was some OK slapstick stuff but was few and far between and being that that was the only semi funny part of it made me very sad. I will possibly try watching this high to see if that can force it to a decently funny level, but I doubt it honestly. That is my advice though, if you're going to watch this, only do it after taking a bowl or two to the face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A road trip worth taking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A reworking of "Planes, Trains, and Automobiles", Galifianakis (whose last name's pronunciation or spelling is hard to remember) and Downey, Jr. are no Candy and Martin, but they give fine performances. Okay, maybe the latter is as good as Steve Martin, but his co-star is no John Candy. Anyway, the movie is better than I expected, and its got some genuine (as well as cheap) laughs. Although I did not buy Galifianakis playing a character who has suffered a loss. The ashes? I don't feel that storyline was necessary or especially funny. If Downey, Jr. was the one who suffered a loss, then that part might have worked. What I especially enjoyed about the movie is when the two wind up in Mexico, and almost can't get out. Those chase scenes I did not see coming. The film is more interesting when the two are butting heads than when they're not. If you're in the mood for a road trip movie, rent "Due Date".**1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Due Date (2010)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter is about to become a Father and needs to make it from Atlanta to Los Angeles. After a mishap on the plane before take-off, he and an eccentric aspiring actor are placed on the no-fly list. With his luggage, money and identification well on its way to California, Peter agrees to travel by rental car with Ethan and his French bulldog. With pit stops for drugs and nonsensical mishaps abound, it becomes a race for Peter to make it to LA in time for the birth of his child. Can he make it? Moreover, is it possible for him to become friends with Ethan? Fans of "Planes, Trains, and Automobiles" will probably feel more than fulfilled with Todd Phillips' "Due Date". At face value, it may appear as if the director is basking in the success of "The Hangover" (perhaps he is? "The Hangover 2" is on the way); but do not let the marketing of this film fool you. No misunderstanding, it is full to the brim with jokes relying on crudeness and moments that make one question whether or not they should be laughing, but there is truthfully some strong dramatic efforts layered throughout. The film has plenty of engaging elements to attach you to the characters and situations caringly, so you will not be laughing at their expense the entire time.Zach Galifianakis really shines in his role as Ethan; it is a part displays the actor's range. He is both lovable and despicable in the same moments; you truly feel that he thinks his actions are genuine. What can you really say about Robert Downey Jr. that has not already been said? When is he NOT in top form? Even in the worst movie possible, he would be a pleasure. His role of Peter proves no exception. There are many moments where he makes choices that are out of line, but at the same time, he is hardly to blame. The enormous differences in these two characters are what make them gel together so perfectly. They are remarkably similar to the roles John Candy and Steve Martin mastered in "Planes, Trains, and Automobiles", but with a weird appeal all their own.The music soundtrack really defines the atmosphere of the driving scenes, as well. Indie rock and hip-hop (Ice Cube, Band of Horses, Wolfmother) is used successfully to either hilariously liven up a scene or to make one desperately thought provoking. There are some great songs by Cream, Neil Young and Rod Stewart, and "Due Date" contains the best use of Pink Floyd in a film ever, in my opinion.Do not just pass on this thinking it is strictly a dumb fart comedy, it has a whole lot more going for it. Moreover, if you are hoping it is just a dumb fart comedy, you may be nicely surprised to find out otherwise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is basically a bad demonstration of a road trip gone wrong. It's a bad remake of a classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** Not sure if some of the details I've included could really be called spoilers, but I've marked this as a spoiler review just in case.**I guess this review is a little over due to say the least. When this film first came out, I wasn't exactly jumping at the chance to see it. It seemed like it might be a funny movie, but for some reason, my gut instinct told me not to watch it, so I didn't.However, recently I was in the mood for a few good laughs and I thought to myself... A comedy starring Robert Downey Jr. and Zack Galifianakis. Perfect.Oh man was I disappointed. I realize now that I should have just gone with my gut. This was definitely not one of the better films I've seen recently.Robert Downey Jr. Plays Peter Highman, an architect who is trying to make it home to Los Angeles to his pregnant wife Sarah, played by Michelle Monaghan; to witness the birth of their first child in a week. However his trip starts off on the wrong foot when he runs into Ethan Tremblay, played by Zack Galifianakis at the airport and an encounter with him not only gets Peter kicked off the plane but added to the no fly list as well. Things get even worse for Peter when he realizes that his only chance at making it home on time depends on the man who landed him in this situation in the first place. Nonetheless they depart on their adventure from Georgia to California. Of course, this trip doesn't go very smoothly at all.This is a classic plot, that's been done before, and done well. Planes, Trains and Automobiles is an excellent example, as is The Hangover Series. However this movie wasn't as successful, for a number of reasons. First of all, this script is incredibly unrealistic. Car crashes and accidental shootings both of which could have been deadly in real life. As well as the totally unbelievable act of stealing a Mexican police truck and interrogation trailer, causing incredible damage and then driving the stolen vehicle the rest of the way without being followed and apprehended. Secondly, the script was poorly written and didn't seem to flow as well as it could in several spots which lead to a disjointed, uneven movie.This film was a little all over the place for me to be quite honest. It flip flopped between a drama and a comedy far too often, which simply left me confused. The movie went from a serious emotional moment straight into a funny one and vice versa; without even finishing the thought. This lack of transition can work sometimes, however it didn't here. For example: When they drink coffee made from the ashes of Ethan's father (which I found funny based simply on their reactions) however, this scene was directly followed by Ethan's character having a very emotional moment picking up his father's ashes off the floor. Here we also see the softer side of Peter's character sharing in this moment with him, attempting to comfort and help him. This left you wondering what you were supposed to feel. Were you supposed to laugh at their emotional moments and make a mockery of them? Or were you supposed to take them seriously? Was the introduction of the emotional "daddy issue" sub plot supposed to be a ploy to develop a connection between the characters and the audience? If so, it didn't work. At least not on me.With that being said, there were a handful of genuinely funny scenes. I did get a get a couple good laughs out of this movie; however they were just too few and far between for my liking. This film definitely had the potential to be great, it just fell a little short for me.On the other hand, the characters were cast well. Zack Galifianakis did an excellent job at playing the bizarre, obnoxious, childlike, idiot. That's his Shtick and he does it well. Robert Downey Jr. was fantastic as well. He did a great job portraying his character. He was dark, mean, and a little sociopathic and he nailed a man with anger issues. Together, they had a funny sort of chemistry.As I said, this film definitely had the potential to be great, it just fell a little short for me; so I doubt I'd watch this movie again. Save yourself the confusion, watch something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raucous and Hilarious,,,,,Sometimes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Todd Phillip's Due Date is his first film since he directed the 2009 mega-hit, The Hangover. This film has very funny moments that often reminded me of the humor from the Hangover. But, this film is almost exactly the same as Planes, Trains, and Automobiles albeit more raucous humor. I kind of wish they changed things up a little, but that's really all the negativity I got for this film.This film is about two guys, Peter and Ethan who meet at an airport the hard way and after being placed on the "No-Fly" list, they embark on a road trip cross-country from Georgia to California.This was a good idea of pairing Robert Downey Jr and Zack Galifianakis. Downey is such a charismatic actor and Zach is a funny oddball as we know from previous films of his. I was surprised to see Downey more laid back than he usually is. There were great scene stealers as well from Jamie Foxx and Juliette Lewis.Overall, this is a fun ripoff of Planes, Trains, and Automobiles. There are some very funny moments and some dramatic moments as well. This film is essentially one step down from the Hangover. But, it still has its moments. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death as a Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe I never liked PTA because I have never found Steve Martin to be much of a comedian although John Candy tried his best. Such a story needs a good straight man as a foil as much as the one who plays the jackass. Martin's much acclaimed remake of The Out of Towners left me cold, a poor comparison with of Jack Lemmon in the original. Neither do I recall laughing as much, if at all, while watching PTA., my sides were aching by the end. Due Date may be a copycat of a worn out theme. For example, not only PTA, Robert di Niro's excellent Midnight Run comes to mind as well. Maybe I liked DD because its humour was much more European than North American and I am European after all. It all depends on what buttons the script and the comedian push on any given individual's funny bone.Anyway, there is a definite non-puzzling story line in DD; an annoying person constantly bothers the straight man who the more straight he acts the more funny he becomes so long as that difficult role is played well. Indeed, like in PTA the straight man becomes increasingly annoying to the audience and its sympathy with the grown up infant terrible increases in proportion The truth of the matter is that the straight man would have had a hard time getting home in time for the due birth date of his first child but for the slob's offer of a lift. This morally cancels out the fact that Mr. Straight would have been nearly home by the time he is offered a lift by his Nemesis had he not met Mr.Slob in the first place. An example of how embarrassing the situation becomes for Mr. Straight is when Mr. Slob proclaims he cannot get a good night's sleep unless he first plays with himself; a bad example copied by his ugly but endearing little pug faced dog. The black comic symbol of the gaudy coffee tin full of Mr Slob's late father's cremated remains brings to mind Death as a comedy in successful movies such as Meet Joe Black, Roseanna's Grave. Last Orders and Death at a Funeral. One has to have good script writers, producers and a pair of excellent comedians to make something really funny out of Death and in this case the attempt succeeds. The is a comic film you will either enjoy immensely or hate intensely. Give it a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Odd Buddy Road Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Due Date is a comedy road film directed by Todd Phillips, co-written by Alan R. Cohen, Alan Freedland, and Adam Sztykiel, and starring Robert Downey, Jr. and Zach Galifianakis together with Michelle Monaghan and Jamie Foxx.Peter Highman is a high strung architect on his way home from Atlanta to Los Angeles to be present at the birth of his first child with his wife, Sarah. In the opening scene he recalls a dream about being in a forest with his wife, who is in labor. He's unable to reach her and help deliver the child, but a grizzly bear ends up helping by chewing through the umbilical cord. Once on the plane, Peter learns that Ethan Tremblay, who had just prior to boarding at the airport, been a passenger in a vehicle that knocked the door off the limo Peter had been in, is sitting behind him in first class. After inadvertently using the words "terrorist" and "bomb", Ethan gets Peter shot by a Federal Air Marshal with a rubber bullet. Both Peter and Ethan are forced off the plane before take-off.After being questioned by security, Peter discovers that he has been placed on the No Fly List and will have to find another way to get to California. After realizing that he had left his wallet on the plane, Peter reluctantly agrees to travel with Ethan, a bumbling, annoying but well-meaning aspiring actor hoping to make it in Hollywood, to Los Angeles. Ethan is on his way to Hollywood with his dog Sonny after his father's funeral, and is carrying his father's ashes in a coffee can for the duration of the trip.How much you'll enjoy Due Date depends more on your esteem for the leads rather than the quality of the screenplay; it is a mess of emotions and situations, working more than not, though tainted by that air of laziness that the entire production invites.Also,it manages to deliver the laughs but dramatic moments work better than most of the comedy.It was movie that never delivered its potential since it is funny enough but it should have been funnier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not anywhere near as good as The Hangover</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a classic example of a director making a film that was absolutely hilarious (The Hangover) and then his next serving being ordinary at best. Not that this film was bad per se but rather that the concept has been done to death and there is little about this film that would make it stand out from the many other road trip films that precede it and are likely to follow it.The film is about a jet setting architect that is attempting to get home to his wife to see his new baby and a drop out who simply wants to be loved. When they get onto the plane, the dropkick shouts his mouth off and gets both of them kicked off the plane and put on the no fly list, so the architect, who has lost all of his money and his id, must get back to Los Angeles in time for his baby to be born, and the only travelling companion is the dropkick.The dropkick really only wants a friend, however these two characters are the opposite of what one would expect them to be. The architect is rich, sophisticated, and has a lot of high flying friends. The dropkick's only friend is his dog, and the people he knows tend to be a collection of drugdealers and crooks.However we see that both of them are thrust into a situation where they first have to get along, and also have to learn to accept each other. The dropkick has to grow up, while the architect has to learn to accept, and welcome, people outside of his class.Obviously the film ends on a high note. The architect gets home in time for the baby to be born, and the dropkick not only gets to Hollywood, but he also becomes a comedy star. As mentioned, not the best film in the world, but still an enjoyable waste of two hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that tries to have its cake and eat it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'For the sake of brevity, I shall be brief' to paraphrase Shakespeare and be a massive annoyance, which is ironically what this film felt like in some parts. Here you have Zach Galifinakas playing Alan from the Hangover and Robert Downey Jr. on a road trip together, while Zach is extremely irritating and Downey is the straight guys who has the funnies. Aside from the fact that the film isn't very funny and its attempts at humour are often crass and cheap, my main gripe is that both the main characters are priks of an extremely high degree. I liked neither or them at any point in the film; Downey's character is violent and tight (he is very reserved and in one scene punches a child for annoying him) ans Zach is playing the same as Alan in the hangover, but even more of a dick. In the Hangover, we like Alan because although he's an idiot, he means well, but in this, he's a dick from start to finish. To validate my opening gambit, and illustrate my previous point, there is a scene when Zach asks Downey about his father. Downey then gives a brilliant, emotional story of how his father left him, and you could tell he was really trying to hide his feelings but letting them slip out. It was touching. Then Zach bursts out laughing, cruelly, and claims his dad wouldn't do that cos 'he loved me'. The film thought it was funny and played it off as a joke, when really it was cruel and awful and made me hate that character for the rest of the film. There are points when it tries to be emotional, but immediately contrasts them with an attempt at humour, but the jar in tone is so sudden, it fails to deliver on either level. There are a few funny parts, but they are far and few between, while being very cheap. It is shot extremely well however, and overall the acting is very good. Though I wouldn't recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big letdown.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, you see Robert Downey Jr.'s name on this project and you see Zach Galifianakis on the film's cast list too, and think "alright, we're in for the good stuff." Well, not the case here. I saw the previews for this one at least three dozen times. I am sad to say, that's where all the only funny scenes are. You're supposed to lead in your viewers with your funniest scenes, I know. But, you're not supposed to make a preview where there is nothing else to offer, once they decide to watch the full thing.So, the story is Peter Highman (Downey Jr.) is put on the no-fly list when Ethan Tremblay (Galifianakis) is talking about cellphones and bombs on the plane at the beginning of the movie. Tremblay gets a car to rent and asks that Highman join him on a 4-day trip to Los Angelas. Here's where the comedy is supposed to start up, right? Well, it never does.I didn't laugh at anything because I'd already laughed at the previews, so seeing the jokes again that I'd already seen weren't as funny this time around. The jokes that were scene brand new, didn't warrant a laugh out of me, except for two times. But, those two times, I can't recall what jokes made me laugh because they weren't hilarious. Just a quick chuckle.Now, aside from comedy, this movie keeps you distracted from whatever else is going on in the real world, simply for Zach and Robert's chemistry in the movie. Zach and Robert do a good job of making the cheap dialogue turned into gold and keeping the viewer interested on what will happen next.My one really big annoyance I took away from this movie is that no matter what, Peter seems to forgive absolutely everything that Ethan does. Even shooting him, stealing his wallet, all the questions and being an overall annoying twerp for the entire four days. But, nevertheless, even after all of it, Peter says that he and Ethan are best friends now. What? Apparently you can be best friends with someone who nearly kills you, gets you high, almost forces you to miss the birth of your child, confuses you about your wife, and above all keeps you in the hot desert with nothing for cash and gets you in trouble with the Mexico border and also gets you in trouble with the airport security and disallows you to fly. But, it's okay, because it was all an awesome experience and it brings you guys closer.I can't understand why anyone would say this movie is hilarious or rocks for any reason because all of what I said above is true. I can understand that you find it funny if you've never seen the previews, but even if you haven't the jokes aren't as hilarious as they initially seem. After repeated viewings, this movie falls short on all levels of comedy and buddy chemistry. It's only able to be watched because of the names attached to it. Even then, it's a downer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Funny Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this movie recently and I must say, I laughed the whole time. Zach Galifinakis and Robert Downey Jr. make a great team. I find that each one separately is very funny. Put them together and it's a riot. There were some parts that reminded me of The Hangover (which I didn't like) but I thought that in this movie, those parts were much better. I also liked the concept of the movie. Mixed in with all the antics were some very nice scenes that were a bit more serious. It was a good balance.On the other side, I found that some events in the story were easy to predict. At some moments, it seemed like the movie was following the standard formula for a comedy of this type. I would've liked to see a little more originality with some of the scenes.Overall, I definitely recommend this movie for people that like a good laugh and enjoy some mild ridiculousness. Fans of The Hangover (and even some people who aren't) will like this movie. I give this movie an 8.5-9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Downy, Jr. is one of my favorite actors and I eagerly sought out Due Date so that I might see his latest foray into comedic film. Sadly I was a little disappointed, though it was still a funny movie I somehow expected more.In Due Date Peter Highman (Robert Downy, Jr.) is attempting to travel across the country in order attend the birth of his child via cesarean section, hence the title of the film. The first of his many misadventures with total stranger Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis) is getting thrown off his flight and put on the no-fly list. With no money, credit cards, I.D., or car, Peter is forced to accept Ethan's offer to travel together in a rental car all the way across the United States. Like any road trip movie nothing goes as planned and the unlikely scenarios get ever more insane and unlikely as the movie progresses. Ethan and Peter have major character flaws that cause a great deal of tension and set the stage for most of the comedy, making Due Date a buddy movie as well as a road trip movie.Ethan is a crazy, neurotic pot-head wannabe actor while Peter is a self-centered jackass that is needlessly cruel. Individually they are amusing and together they are more so. This, combined with the insane plot twists, makes for a pretty funny movie. Due Date is amusing, I just think my expectations were set too high, perhaps yours won't be.</fullReview>

I would not be surprised if the makers of Skyline lent a hand as it has their bodged direction/production written all over it. The only good thing to say is that they did a great job of making all the actors look total amateurs! Others on here have made reference to Planes Trains and Automobiles which is not surprising.

		<fullReview>Due DateThe difference between traveling via airplane as opposed to traveling in a stranger's car is that, when traveling with a stranger, the intrusive pat down is optional.Needles to say, the commuter in this comedy declined on both counts.While trying to make it home for the birth of his child, unruly passenger Peter (Robert Downey Jr.) is placed on the no fly list.In need of alternate transportation, he accepts a ride from struggling actor/pothead/nut Ethan (Zach Galifianakis).Forcing Peter to endure hours of bothersome personal questions and strange driving habits, Ethan eventually wears Peter's resolve down and he begins to benefit.Peppered with cameos and off-coloured humour, Due Date appears to be an innocuous comedy, but, in truth, is a mean-spirited mess that contains no relatable characters.Besides, if someone really wants to go on a road trip with a crazy stranger, they should ride the Grey Hound.

		<fullReview>Hangover was a one trick pony for director Todd Phillips this i'm sure! As soon as i saw that this was going to be a Planes Trains And Automobiles (Ill entitle it P.T.A.A. for the rest of the review) rip off i almost stopped watching. One person kept me watching and that was Robert Downey Jr. Forgiving him almost immediately for the terrible Sherlock Holmes I figured this will show his comedic side what it did show me is his incredibly ticked off side and who can blame him would you want to travel across the states with Zack Galifianakis? All i learn-ed from this film is how irritating a character that Galifinakis can portray as i wonder if that makes him a great actor? Remember hearing something a while back about Kevin Bacon if he makes you hate him that bad it shows hes doing a good job. Needless to say Robert Downey Jr.'s character Peter Highman is trying his best to arrive home to sunny California in time for the birth of his first son. Things are going well as he is seated on the plane in the seat directly in front of Ethan Tremblay (Galifianakis) well thats where it all goes to hell. After getting booted off the plane due to this butt lick of a man he also ends up on the no fly list for naughty passengers which leaves him with little and no choice to take an offered ride from Tremblay. Hence Planes, Trains And Automobiles the next generation begins. I laughed during this i think maybe twice, actually the feeling i had through most of it was to stop myself with the urge to imaginably punch through the movie screen with the hope that the punch would land directly in Galifianakis's face. Sure they added some new twists to the old story of P.T.A.A. however give me the team of Candy and Martin any day over these two, although also obnoxious at times, at least Candy's character was lovable!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Downey Jr., being an exceptional actor, must have been out of his mind to accept the starring role in this movie. The five seconds of comedy in this film was put into the trailer to entice unsuspecting movie goers into theater seats. Jamie Foxx and Robert Downey Jr. are paired briefly once again in this film, the first time was in The Soloist, and Zach Galifianakis was more annoying that funny. A series of misfortunes befall Downey which sends him on a return journey home to be present for the birth of his first child. What was thought to be a raucous comedy turns into an uncomfortable serio- comedic story that can't end fast enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rude and horrible characters don't make a comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter (Robert Downey Jr) doesn't like Ethan (Zach Galifianakis) for a number of reasons, most notably getting him on a no-fly list. I also didn't like Ethan, nor Peter, nor Peter's wife Sarah (Michelle Monaghan), nor their friend Darryl (Jamie Foxx). Peter has rage and anger issues and yet he's going to be a father. Sarah is a very hateful and spiteful person and yet she's going to be a mother. Ethan is just a messed up kid but things don't jive with him. Darryl thinks it's okay to treat friends and strangers alike with disrespect and acrimony.Worst of all, the writers (6 credited ones) apparently think it's okay to give me such horrible characters, none of which are likable in any way, and expect me to laugh. Road trip movies have great potential for comedy, and "Due Date" could too if there were any elements of empathy in the characters. The one saving grace is that Downey Jr. and Galifianakis are great comedic actors. One of the best scenes has Galifianakis delivering a monologue from "The Godfather", and I'll give credit where credit is due, that was hilarious. Unfortunately, not much else was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best comedies ever, because the acting is so great and the plot is fantastic. It makes you feel so bad for Peter, because Ethan is such a screw up. I watched Plains, Trains, and Automobiles and thought it was stupid compared to this movie. I love how it portrays enough of Ethan so that it shows what an immature character he is, but it doesn't show too much of him. Ethan is not an annoying character to watch, he is an enjoyable character to watch. Zach Galifinakis did an incredible job in playing this character. Robert Downey Jr. is also an amazing actor and did an amazing job at playing Peter. I have watched this movie 5 times and I have always gotten the sense that Robert Downey Jr. hated being in this movie, which isn't at all true. He just did an amazing and convincing job as this character. Robert Downey Jr. has said this movie is one of the most enjoyable acting experiences of his career. I have so much respect for this movie and I think its great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreadfully awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was done far more skillfully back in 1987 by John Hughes with Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles. This version was just silly. I didn't particularly connect with any of the characters. Peter (Robert Downey Jr.) was such a prick that I could hardly stand to watch him. Throughout the movie I just wanted to punch him in the face. Nothing that befell him made me feel the slightest sympathy for him. The only satisfactory way to have resolved his character would have been to kill him off in some grizzly manner, the grizzlier the better. Ethan (Zach Galifianakis) was just so odd that he seem almost subhuman. I thought he was mildly retarded for most of the film. I didn't detect any comedic chemistry from the cast at all.I was really unhappy with this film and expected far more from the cast. Perhaps it was just a bad script or bad direction, I can't say for sure, either way, it was a stinker.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>genuinely unlikable characters and not very funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While RDJ's character is a borderline A-hole, he seems to experience some growth and his humanity surfaces as the movie unfolds. My basic problem with this film was the fact that Zach's character is genuinely unlikable from start to finish. There's no real growth or movement to make the character less annoying or more likable. What you see is what you get and it grates on the viewer almost as much as it grates on RDJ's nerves. They deliver a few funny moments along the way but not nearly as many as I was expecting. It's a wild, unbelievable and sometimes annoying journey but it's not an overly funny trip. I felt that RDJ's talent was wasted as all he does is play the straight man to Zach's outrageous stupidity. Sure his performance and reactions are top tier acting but would anyone expect anything less?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly cannot see how any thinking person can like this movie. Zach's character simply unbelievable, so no viewer can really sympathize with him. The jokes are not funny and the action scenes seem out of place in a movie like this, and are also not credible.Also, while the dog seems to be highly prominent in ads for this movie, the way the dog is treated is often objectionable. For example, and this was in the trailer, Downy's character prods Fox's character to hit a dip in the road at high speed, and send Ethan and his dog flying in the bed of the truck. I realize that the dog was not actually used in that scene, but why is this funny? The dog did nothing to deserve this.I saw this movie at an advanced screening with a free pass, and I really regret going. I personally did not think The Hangover was that great, but it is much, much better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Due Date Doesn't Leave You Feeling Happy or Amused</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie actually starts out good. We are introduced to two men on a flight from Atlanta to Los Angeles - Peter (Robert Downey Jr.), who is an expectant father anxious to return home to witness the birth of his first child, and Ethan (Zach Galifianakis), who initially comes across as a quirky and confident wanna-be actor with the ashes of his recently deceased father in tow.However, about 15 minutes into the flick, Ethan's character inexplicably changes into a stupid, sad and reckless individual, and once problems start to arise, Peter becomes dark and mean. Of course, these types of unlikeable personalities do not work well in comedy, and this is a big reason why the movie fails to deliver. For a majority of the screen time, Peter is bloodied and exhausted from a number of serious injuries, and having to endure watching this just saps-out any humor.Nor is there any shortage of unimaginative and crude comedy rip-offs that just didn't work. The movie "Vacation" contains the classic scene where everyone asleep in the car wakes up after bumpily (but safely) reaching their destination not realizing that Chevy Chase was asleep behind the wheel the whole time. In Due Date, it doesn't work because, when Ethan falls asleep behind the wheel, he totals the car and nearly kills himself and Peter in the process. Another great comedy scene is in "Meet the Parents" when Ben Stiller accidentally knocks an urn off the mantle, and the cat pees in the ashes. In Due Date, the scene where the ashes are mistaken for coffee grinds is not particularly original, and Ethan's constant grieving over his dead father is depressing. Also, there is no comparison between the hysterical wake-up scene in "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" and the crude masturbation scene in Due Date which falls flat.Although Robert Downey Jr's acting is brilliant, this was supposed to be a comedy and it's hard to feel happy or amused after watching this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Contender for the worst film of 2010...and to be honest it looks like it won</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Due Date" is the latest film from Todd Phillips, the brilliant director behind "Road Trip" and "The Hangover", which I thought was the funniest film of 2009. But "Due Date", highly anticipated, especially with Robert Downewy Jr in the lead role, was really a disappointment and ended up not only being the worst film that I saw in 2010, but also the very first movie that has made me turn my iPod on in the cinema.Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jr) is trying to get home to LA from Atlanta to be in the hospital for the birth of his son. And this is when he meets Ethan Tremblay, who gets both of them thrown off the plane and arrested, causing Peter to be put on a "no-fly" list. Desperate to get home, he must accept an offer from the irritating and moronic Ethan, who is hoping to travel to Hollywood to be an actor, for a ride back to LA. Ethan is also carrying his fathers ashes in a coffee tin hoping to scatter them over the Grand Canyon. Well, that's trouble just waiting to happen of course. Time is short and as Ethan gets them into one mess after another, it begins to seem highly unlikely for Peter that he'll get home to see his son's birth.I'm awe-struck seeing the high rating of 7.0/10 here for "Due Date". It's absurd, really is. It's the height of moronic stupidity, and I honestly don't find Zach Galifianakis to be at all funny, in fact, he's one of the few actors that I just can't stand. I could bear him somewhat in "The Hangover" because I really loved that film, but in this, well sorry, but I really don't find watching him masturbating to be funny... it's just disgusting. That scene was up there with the horrendous and stupid depraved humour of "Bruno" last year.Robert Downey Jr, who has enjoyed recent success with the "Iron Man" films and with roles in movies such as "A Guide to Recognising Your Saints" and "Zodiac" in the last ten years, really can put "Due Date" down as possibly the worst movie of his career. I don't understand why he would subject himself to such humiliation. Jamie Foxx manages to stick his head into this as well, and in fairness, he was pretty enjoyable and worked well with Downey.Hopefully, Todd Phillips can do justice next time with the highly anticipated sequel to "The Hangover". Despite this horrendous effort, I'll still look forward to it.There are four credited writers for this. Unbelievable - it took four people to write this crap! That just sums up modern society.</fullReview>

As it went on, I must have turned blue, then purple, and then pale with just enough breath left to turn it off. I have tried to be open-minded to explore films based on member's ratings only to get burnt yet again. I decided to condemn this film to the bottom of my list without any chance to be paroled whatsoever.It would have been good if it was about half the length it ended up being. Not all that much happened in the second half, and a lot of trimming could have been done. - and we had a grossly overweight couple in front of us (me, my mate and his bro). Not only that, but a gang of neds were providing running commentary and trying (and failing) to be funny about it, along with their annoying hyena like laughter.

Honestly i can see clearly that Robert has do his best once again on this movie, but it doesn't work for me. Compare with Hangover Part I, i still prefer Hangover. Due Date is still at the same level with the Hangover Part II.The Storyline going crazier after 45 minutes and I'm really exciting watch a police's trailer robbed..so damn crazy.. So my verdict..If you're looking a movie with: - Smart dialogues - Not too long duration - Harsh jokes - a good looking of Robert - psychological jokes - No Nudity/violenceGo with this movie!

If you want to throw a funny flick on to chuckle at for a couple hours and if you like either of the two leads, if not both then you will probably enjoy this.By no means a comedy classic, a cult classic or even one of the funniest movies of the year, but some parts are enjoyable just because I like road trips kind of movies.I could of done without the ripping off of Plains Trains and Automobiles in seemingly every scene. Ya know the 80s Thanksgiving Classic with Steve Martin, the late John Candy, done by the late, legendary film- maker John Hughes.Outside the pregnancy of Downeys wife, missing the due date is the only difference from Planes, where-as the big deal their in that flick is Martin trying to get home in time for thanksgiving.Same jokes, just done a bit different. Instead of jokes about occupations we get jokes about facebook, one by Zack which I actually laughed at due to excellent delivery.Overall a decent comedy, nothing more, nothing less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is far from a great comedy, but it has a few funny moments. The two central characters work pretty well, but the relentless attempts to provoke sympathy for Zach Galifianakis' character don't work. Zach's character is ridiculously stupid and annoying, so the way Robert Downey's character warms to him just doesn't feel right.Most of the comedy feels forced and not well-thought-out; and one scene in particular is based on very juvenile humour. A few scenes do work well, though, and show that the whole film could have been special if the quality had been consistent throughout. The writers clearly couldn't come up with enough good ideas.Overall, Due Date is a wishy-washy experience, but worth a watch if you aren't expecting comedy gold. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a patch on The Hangover</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hangover succeeded because it was so cleverly put together taking us on a ride. We hadn't a clue where we were going and neither did the cast. Due Date fails, in my opinion, because it is a very weak story with two characters who simply don't ever grate irritatingly or mesh soothingly in a way that convinces. It seems you are watching two actors playing out a script and wishing they could get to the end of it faster than the film is actually moving.The script is poor, bereft of anything other than very scarce and very mild humour, artificially bolstered by seriously silly stunts or premeditated stupidity from people who just couldn't be that stupid if they tried. And we are asked to believe they all lived happily ever after as in one of the worse examples of reconciliation of differences I have seen in a long time.I wouldn't recommend it for viewing (even if you are very drunk and wanting to put off the hangover) but it does have Michelle Monaghan doing her best and for her sake alone I give it four out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie recently. It's a medium funny movie, not quite up to par with 'The Hangover', but funny nonetheless. The interaction between Robert and Zach is pretty good.The interesting part, though, is that I also just saw the movie with Spanish dubbing. The Spanish track is what the English track should've been. The language is cruder, it's funnier, and actually elevates the movie to near 'The Hangover' quality.This is the first movie I've ever seen where the actors doing the dubbing actually surpassed the original work because it wasn't so much a direct language translation, but more of an intention/meaning translation. In other words, rather than translating popular phrases/sayings and the meaning getting lost in translation, (mexican) Spanish phrases/sayings were used...and in cruder form. So, if you understand Spanish, I would advise to give this movie a 2nd look with the Spanish track.So, in a nutshell, if you understand Spanish, rent this movie and watch it with the Spanish track. It's what the English track should've been. The 8 in the rating is based on the other language track.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a typical American comedy - big on the physical comedy, but with very few witticisms and a dull script. I like to have comedies where not only the situation, but the dialogue is genuinely funny. I didn't laugh once in the whole film. The premise also was very unclear, in my opinion. It took me quite a while to work out how the title of the film related to the plot. I understand that this film has been regarded as a modern version of 'Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles'. In my opinion, it has failed miserably to come anywhere near that classic film. I'm really glad I borrowed this DVD from the library and could return it. I wouldn't want to own it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter (Robert Downey Junior) is about to have a baby, courtesy of his rather lovely wife, the rather underused Michelle Monaghan.Following the completion of his business meeting, Peter rushes to the airport for his trip home to be there for the birth, a simple plane hop from Atlanta to L.A. At the airport drop off point, he accidentally bumps into a complete stranger, an unkempt, prissy, man child in the shape of a very full bearded and hairy stomached Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis).Various misunderstanding's later, Peter and his new found non-friend are on the "no fly" list. They go their own way, but reconnect due to Peters wallet and drivers license being mislaid. This leaves him no choice but to face the road trip from hell. Diametrically opposed characters are now firmly in place, uptight, successful businessman jammed together with a man who thinks the Grand Canyon is man made, carries his pet pooch like Paris Hilton with added camp and has the personal habits of a fourteen year old.If you are thinking, this has been done before, minus the dog and camp, you would be right. "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" (PTA), Steve Martin and the late John Candy, created the template for the entire movie.Both Galifianakis and Downey are good actors and the possibilities for belly laughs are obvious but somehow the film manages to get the tone very wrong, squandering the comedic possibilities at every opportunity. PTA had an underlying affection for the characters, a sweetness that you did not necessarily see but underlined the whole story. Here, neither character is likable and the abrupt change in Downey's attitude towards his travelling companion, seemingly occurs off screen.The film is also derailed by two scenes that are poorly judged and executed, which ruin the reasonable work both before and after. These involve a Iraq war veteran and Tremblay's method of relaxing before bed. Presumably both scenes are inserted for the younger crowd but they are neither funny nor advance the plot in any meaningful way.Another sub plot involving Darryl (Jamie Foxx) as Peter's best friend, goes nowhere and again undermines the film. This further amplifies audiences dislike of Peter, leaving no one to actually root for, aside of the unborn child who must remain blameless.If you were expecting another "Hangover" from producer Tod Phillips, this only represents quick drinks after work, with some left over stale finger food, rather than the all nighter you might have been expecting.Overall, very disappointing, as there is a good film in there but the story needs a deft touch and the heavy handed approach leaves the actors little room to create plausible, two dimensional characters. Note to writer, adults punching young children deliberately in the stomach is just not funny, even if they are the neglected offspring of wasted drug dealer (Juliette Lewis) and are annoying.Summary A mismatched buddy/buddy comedy with few laughs, some poor scenes and an underlying tone of cruelty and meanness.Go watch "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" insteadhttp://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Planes, trains, &amp; automobiles" of the 21rst Century, but doesn't have the same impact.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately, you can not even compare John Hughes' comic, and at times rather touching, 1987 film "Planes, Trains,&amp; Automobiles" to Todd Phillips' "Due Date". Not that the two should really be compared, but in watching this film you can't help but reflect on "Planes, Trains, &amp; Automobiles" and a certain nostalgia for great films of past decades.Although "Due Date" borrows particular elements from John Hughes' film, it is not in any way a re-imagining or remake of this earlier film."Due Date" follows the story of two strangers who are flying out of Georgia, and incidentally happen to be stuck together for better or worse once they are put on the "no fly list". What follows is a series of misadventures that occur along the way to their destination Los Angeles.Robert Downey Jr. plays Peter Highman, an ill tempered business man who is on his way home to make the date of his wife's delivery. Although you would like to like Downey's character from the beginning, he is mostly unlikeable for the first half of the movie because of the way he treats people as he appears to come off as pompous. I must add that for someone who is excited to be a new parent, his character seemed rather reluctant to watch Heidi's (Juliette Lewis) two children. Being constantly irritated by her son, Peter lashes out on the boy with a punch to the gut, followed by a threat not to tell Heidi about the incident before he leaves. Although I may have let out a mild chuckle at both scenes, I would have possibly chuckled even more if it weren't for the fact that this man is going to be a father. For this reason these moments lost some its humour as it made me question Peter's qualifications as a parent.We then have Ethan Tremblay played by Zach Galifianakis. This character we would like to feel sympathy for but most of the time his character appears heartless and "pathological" as Peter puts it. Two scenes in particular that shed light on these two claims is when Peter decides to let his guard down and confide in Ethan a traumatic event from his childhood "the abandonment of his father" to which Ethan laughs and says a comical remark. The other, is Ethan's need to commit an "immoral act" (for lack of a better word) before sleeping right in front of Peter.Mostly the film relies on extreme actions from the characters, that are at times a bit shocking, for humour. The film also tries to include a touching story about death and letting go. But it is not conveyed thoroughly enough to have an emotional impact. The film also uses the death of Ethan's father as a gag once they all begin to drink his ashes, that are mistaken for coffee grounds. Once we do begin to laugh we almost immediately shift over into feeling guilty for laughing when we see the emotional impact it has on Ethan. For this reason I feel that there was not a well balanced medium that blended in both the successful amount of humour in with the right amount of sad notes. Something John Hughes did successfully in "Planes, Trains, &amp; Automobiles". It just seemed too sporadic in "Due Date".Overall the film has its moments of humour and the film as a whole is at best enjoyable but nevertheless mindless. But I would recommend John Hughes' "Planes, Trains, &amp; Automobiles" before recommending "Due Date".** Stars Out Of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good cast, but dull writing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The good cast couldn't make up for the dull writing. So much of the movie relies on tired clichés -- especially buddy-movie clichés and cliché travel scenarios. The film doesn't have a fraction of the laughs (nor emotion) of "Planes, Trains, and Automobiles." And I felt so little for the characters that I found myself completely apathetic to their misfortune.I chuckled at only one scene and smirked a few times at Zach's outfit and funny little walk; that is 30 seconds of enjoyment throughout 1.5 hours. I would recommend the movie if stuck on an airplane with few choices. But even then it might be more enjoyable to just read the in-flight magazine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Rush for This DUE DATE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sat down to watch this movie with high expectations. Robert Downey Jr. has been a recent favorite of mine since returning to the spotlight, and I've yet to tire of Zack Galifianakis over-confident idiot routine. With director Todd Phillips (THE HANGOVER) at the helm, I really thought this film should deliver some great laughs. I'm not going to say I didn't like the movie, but it was no where near as fun as I thought it would be. The premise is simple: Peter Highman (Downey Jr.) is an expectant father who needs to get from Atlanta to Los Angeles in time to be there for the birth of his first child, but a chance encounter with dim-witted wanna-be actor Ethan Tremblay (Galifianakis) at the airport ends with Peter on the "no fly" list. Peter's desperate to get cross-country but he lost his wallet in the struggle on the plane, so when Ethan offers to join him Peter's got no choice but to settle in for one of the roughest road trips ever. It seems to me there's a wealth of comedy inherent in the premise, but DUE DATE never rises above the occasional chuckle and there isn't a whole lot that will remain with you after the credits roll.The film has all the ingredients for a great comedy, but they never come together. The trailers really hyped me up for the film and I love both the stars, but I hate to say I didn't laugh a whole lot here. There's some great cameos from Juliette Lewis, Jamie Foxx, and Danny McBride. McBride as an Iraq war veteran working at the Western Union was one of the better moments in the movie, but his moment's over and done fast before we're back to the mundane. It's sad when I think back to the film and the only real laugh I had was Ethan's masturbating dog. Looking back, all the best moments are in the trailer and you aren't missing much if you decide to sit this one out. One problem I had with the film was Downey Jr.'s character; for most of the film, Peter is just a completely unlikable character. Yes, he's stressed. And yes, Ethan is a pain for anyone to deal with. But Peter has some moments where he comes off as completely despicable. Downey Jr. has some great natural charisma so I never got to a point where I hated his character, but I had a hard time siding with him (even after Ethan's final act reveal).I'm giving the film a mediocre score because, while it's not good enough to find it's way onto any top ten (or fifty) comedies list, it's still a mildly entertaining hour and a half. Any comedy with these two in it is going to have some fun material, I just wish they'd worked from a better script. We know Phillips can do comedy (HANGOVER is still one of my favorites) and I hope this was just a fluke. I don't know that I'd recommend this film as anything more than a cheap rental on a rainy day but don't get too excited for it or you're liable to find yourself disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the premise of Todd Philips's road comedy 'Due Date' seems familiar, with a cast that includes Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis I was at least expecting to laugh. While the movie may not be laugh out loud all the way, it had its moments. The problem is that 'Due Date', at times, desperately tries too much to be funny and falls flat. Much of the comedy is low brow and nothing different from what one has seen too often seen in recent American comedies. Some of the jokes, especially the recycled ones, just don't work. The characters Peter and Ethan are hardly likable but Downey Jr and Galifianakis have good chemistry and they somewhat manage to make it despite the poor writing. Michelle Monaghan, Jamie Foxx and Juliette Lewis are wasted. Philips's direction was mediocre at best. Overall, there just isn't much to take away from this movie. Once it was over, I 'forgot' about it and moved on to something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After originally having high hopes, I then began to dread that it was going to be awful, after reading some of the reviews. It fell in the middle, was good enough, without being great. Downey Junior had the incredulous expressions down to a tee. Galifianakis is good at the bumbler. One thing the people berating it got right, he has to make sure he is not typecast as the lovable loser. It is no Planes Trains, but enjoyable enough. About halfway through, you get the feeling it is about to run out of steam, but it picks up. A good cameo from Juliette Lewis as the drug dealer, Jamie Foxx's cameo is mostly pointless, only seems to be there for the joke with Galifianakis' dads ashes in the coffee tin. Overall, an enjoyable enough 90 minutes, but could have been so much better.</fullReview>

So what is it about well the movie is about a guy played by Robert Downey Jr(from Iron Man) who's wife is expecting a baby)and he ends up meeting up with this dude from The Hangover(Zach Gallinfanikis) who brings Downey Jr's charcther to meet his pregnant wife.Overall I refuse to talk about the whole thing cause its genuinely not that funny.

		<fullReview>Due Date is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a stellar comedic cast. It's a very funny movie, which will come as no surprise as it is directed by Todd Phillips, who had huge success with the Hangover the previous year, here he brings us a funny and original take on road trip movies, many hilarious antics ensue and the story even takes some unexpected turns. The only major issue that I had with watching this movie is that it took some big risks with the antics of its characters, we see scenes such as Peter spitting on a dog and Ethan committing a major crime, these do convey their personalities but at times it made them unlikeable, and it was hard to sympathise with them in other scenes because of that. The cast is fantastic and all seemed very interested in this project, of course the two actors that hold the whole thing together is Robert Downey Jr and Zach Galifianakis, who make a very unlikely pairing, which is certainly the main source of fun and laughter here, we never expect to see these two in a movie together, so we're very pleased when we do, and they also proved to be able to deliver more dramatic scenes as well, the chemistry between them was stellar. Filled with many funny scenes and a strong comedic cast, I would recommend Due Date to anyone looking for a good comedy. A soon to be father must travel across the country with an aspiring actor and his dog in order to make it home to his wife before their baby arrives.Best Performance: Robert Downey Jr. Worst Performance: Juliette Lewis</fullReview>

He is the kind of guy you want to kill one minute, and hug the next. Movie star great Robert Downy Jr. plays the ultimate straight man. His logic and reasoning go right out the window with Zach. The things they encounter on the 2,000 mile road trip, are unbelievably funny! Zachs character has a cute little dog. The dog almost steals a few scenes. Juliette Lewis is great as the Medical Marijuana Dispensary owner in New Orleans. From the airport to his wives hospital bedside, it's nonstop action, and hilarity. I recommend this movie highly.

Saw it on a plane so a lot of the swear words were changed which is always a big disappointment. Not sure why they do this on planes with individual headsets and a clear R rating.I give it a higher rating to balance the lower ratings people give. Don't get me wrong, I would not pay much to see this movie but it was a good solid adult comedy that I didn't mind seeing my myself.You can't take this money seriously, there is a lot of nonsensical things relating to it on a number of levels.

		<fullReview>I don't have $100 million dollars. Much less, a mere million (YET ? Lotto's on tonight) but what a disappointment Due Date turned out to be at barely breaking $100 million. I'm guessing marketing ? labeling it as the next Hangover probably didn't help since they were polar opposites.This movie was hilarious! Well, okay, let me preface with you kinda have to be a Robert Downey Jr. fan. Like me. Oh, and you should be familiar with and find Zach Galifianakis funny. Agreed. Also, be aware, it's completely preposterous and is unlike most road trips whereas the lead character, Peter (Downey Jr.) is a real-almost-90%-unlovable-ass. Yeah, I can dig that.So, if you fit into those categories above and understand what you're getting yourself into, just leave your brain at the door and enjoy yourself here. And to clarify, he's not just unlovable, he really is just?plain?mean.Businessman Peter's first of a series of unfortunate events with Ethan (Galifianakis) is outside an airport and is continued onto their "coincidental" flight together. Both get booted off and 86'd from the friendly skies. Having to get across country quick, OK, well, within a few days, now wallet-less Peter reluctantly agrees to join Ethan on a road-trip-from-hell to get home for the birth of his first child.Whew?that didn't take long to give the basic synopsis, and shoot, it sounds clichéd as hell. In reality, that's not too far off a statement, especially when you roll in the inevitable "zany secondary characters" or predictable escapades the find themselves into or the foreseen "twists." If not for the great lines, mainly from Downey Jr. sparing a lot more for Galifianakis, the movie would be a complete dud. Seriously, it was their magic/chemistry that held the loose glue together.And to enjoy them, you'll have to suspend a great deal of disbelief, such as being allowed on a plane with a marijuana pipe because security believes that famous "Oh, that's not mine" line or a government vehicle stolen and yet no one seems to want to put a simple little APB out on it or someone is shot and the hospital asks no questions. Of course not.So, just know what you're getting yourself into, and enjoy these two great comics. It's not for everybody, but I happen to like both leads a lot and went along for the fun ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>High-strung father-to-be Peter Highman is forced to hitch a ride with aspiring actor Ethan Tremblay on a road trip in order to make it to his child's birth on time.When I heard of the combination of Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis, I had some high expectations. On top of that, we have the wonderful comedic director who brought us the Hangover and Old School. And then ON TOP OF THAT, we have the "road trip" genre which Todd did perfect with Road Trip. So with all these expectations and likes, I thought I would have a good time. Unfortunately, after seeing the bad reviews (from critics and walkabouts alike) I decided, unfortunately, to wait till the DVD release. I regret all of it... The movie has a different formula than Todd's previous, it is more engaging and intellectual. What I mean 'intellectual' is the subtle humor. This is where the comparisons with Hangover arise because with Hangover we have in your face humor, while in Due Date have more subtle comedic moments. I thought the mixture of Robert Downey (sarcastic) and Zach Galifianakis (just stupid) was perfect. And what I mean is that they have their differences and their reactions to each other (more so of Robert to Zach) are hilarious. Funny thing is, we're going back into comparisons with Hangover. Zach, in Hangover, was just plain stupid and we really couldn't tell his acting ability. In Due Date, he has many scenes where he can actually act. Surprisingly, I found this to be great because his previous roles never brought out his true inside character. We have many moments that'll have you laughing out loud, with them passing the Mexican border, with them just talking in the car, or those moments where they get along and understand each other. I love the precise moments where they get high and they just talk and laugh, simplistic and humorous. This all leads me to the question I wanted to ask: why does this get such bad reviews? People say this movie is a clone of "Planes, Trains, And Automobiles", while others think the humor was dry and plain. The Hangover gets fantastic reviews because of it's clever premise? This all leads me to the one sentence people will most likely question: I enjoyed Due Date better than the Hangover. The humor, acting, and premise was smart and witty. It didn't have to be gross-out to gain it's audience, it provides much more than expected. Recommended. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jr.) gets a quick look at the guy who just hit the door off of his chauffeur's car at the airport, like with everything else he's a busy man who doesn't think very much about the bearded guy who's probably got more than an issue or two hidden behind the facial fortress. But soon enough that man with a perm to match turns into that person who just won't go away. He's the most foulest, unashamed "companion," but one who instead acts more like a capture of his every next move. As the saying goes, "Sometimes you have to give a little to get a little," but no matter what he does to compromise, the pesky man named Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis) just keeps getting worse and causes Peter to nearly reinvent himself along the way so he can just get to his wife's labor in time but first he has to cover a stretch from Atlanta to L.A. Simple enough, right? This is easier said than done, as he's got no ID, money, luggage or car, and he just got put on the No-Fly list due to a misunderstanding involving Ethan. Now, the man who just caused him enough grief offers him a ride in his rental car with his little dog Sonny because he's going to Hollywood to become an actor, face-shot portfolio, impressions and all. Peter grudgingly excepts, because how bad could it really be? Well, he probably puts up with more idiocy than Charles Darwin himself researched and catalogued. He's the Clint Eastwood of comedies as he's a man of fewer, quicker words and isn't used to opening up. Ethan, on the other hand, is an imploding, extroverted personality all his own. Though he's a walking, talking conundrum: nice, but rude, giving, but takes, a talker, but not a listener, and then sympathetic in one way and a jerk the next. If that wasn't enough Peter meets all kinds of contradictory characters in middle America that he might not have ever seen or wanted to see ever again. Including rude and violent employees and drug dealers who want him to watch their obnoxious kids while they score a deal."Due Date" is a comedy/adventure that is often delivered with deadpan humor that revolves around the ridiculousness of the situations and interactions, rather than droves of inventive dialogue or witty one-liners. The whole trip is a trip, so some impossible and implausible scenarios happen that can insult one's intelligence from getting into fights, near death accidents and possible trouble with the law, but that is only if you take it seriously. Zach Galifianakis puts on a detestable but commendable role as a delusional, sheltered man who's naive and unapologetic but he doesn't even realize it himself. Robert Downey Jr. plays it straight but is able to still line up the comedic scenes and slip in a few lines of his own when it gets the best of him. The R is for drug use, frequent cursing and some minor sexual references. The greatest aspect about this movie, is it never lets up. Even when there's a supposed sad and touching scene, something still manages to goof up, go unexpectedly wrong or put the two actor's back on the ropes. Like the old gag of pulling away with a handshake, it puts the unsure audience on edge but still leaves room to anticipate what will happen next. It's still a growing experience that breaks down their barriers to make the two leads who are entirely different people beforehand now either best friends or just knowledgeable chums that are still at each other's throats.

		<fullReview>Rarely do I come upon a film that I can't get through. This is one of them. I gave up waiting for laughs about an hour into it. The humor is for those who like to see someone being annoyed by circumstances. If you think waiting in a long line while surrounded by hyper-active children with sticky hands is funny, if you think pager's going off loudly when the decorum should be toward the quiet, if you think waterboarding is not torture - then this is the movie for you. It's in your face! Somehow you are supposed to feel sympathetic towards the main character played by Robert Downey, Jr, but it never happened for me. He was completely unlikable. The problem is that non of the other characters are likable either. I guess when I watch a movie that is supposed to be funny I expect to be laughing - I didn't. I watch a movie hoping to be entertained - I wasn't. Instead I ended up groaning at what could possibly come next to ratchet up the next phase of irritation. A fine example to demonstrate this would be the old Candid Camera show. In its early days the pranks were funny. In later episodes the pranks tended toward putting someone on-the-spot by annoying them in the situation to see if they would finally explode. Then people started to complain about the show and how it wasn't funny anymore. And this is what you get in this movie -- situation after situation of annoyance. Like I said, if you like a Chinese water torture, this is the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a good idea to have short easy to remember title.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You should read the IMDb full storyline and full synopsis. It helps. This is a comedy so it's suppose to be funny and it is, funny enough.There are in my opinion four types of comedy. The first is so funny, you will need to catch your breath for having laughed so much; this types also makes you cry because you can't possibly laugh any more or any longer than you have up to when tears just start trickling down your cheek. It's the kind of movie doctors recommend for your health except of course if you had recent surgery. 'Due Date' is not one of those.The second type will, if you are prone to such things, make you pee before you can reach the toilet. 'Due Date' is not one of those either. If you are prone to the aforementioned reaction, by all means avoid good comedies and horror films.The third makes you and your friends laugh enough you would feel spending what you spent on the movie, snacks and refreshments not to be a waste of hard earned money. 'Due Date' might well be this type of movie. At this point I'm assuming you have a sense of humour because the fact of the matter is that there are far more people who believe they have a sense of humour than there are people with a real sense of humour. If you did not at the very least grin, reading the description of the first two types of comedy, your sense of humour is called Schadenfreude in German. Look it up on Wikipedia. The fourth is all other comedies and who gives a rat's ass about those. If you had the reaction described for the first type of comedy while smoking a joint, you could just as easily have been watching this fourth type.I've read some very well written and informative reviews about 'Due Date' on IMDb as you may well have. Mine is not one of them I know.I liked the movie. I thought Zach Galifianakis' performance was his best yet. Robert Downey was good; it's not his best nor his worst.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't compare P. T. and A. to this movie. Why? Because I really don't remember it that well as I've seen it years ago. But I do remember I laughed out hard and I remember that I really liked it as it was sort of a cozy, feel good movie.Well, Due Date is not cozy. And is nowhere near a feel good movie. When it ends you will feel just complete lack of hope - despair that is.Also Due Date is not laugh out hard kinda movie. It really isn't. Hangover was.For my first actual laugh and not a smirk it took exactly 53 minutes. Yes. And the next one came 20 minutes later. That was all.The flow of the story is rather nice and the story itself offers so many funny moments, but fun part just somehow disappears the same moment as these scenes are played out. So who's fault is that? Is it Director who can't find the real punchlines and just keeps going and dragging these scenes until he finally destroys any fun out of it? Partly yes.Is it Robert Downey Jr. who is not a comedy actor per se? No, as irritating as his character might he still manages to pull a few smirky moments.Is it Zach who is killing every funny line with his over the top performance and his lack of connection with the Robert? Yes, mostly it is. If you've seen his previous characters and his acting abilities, then you know what to expect. Actually if you've seen Dinner for Schmucks you will find him much like Steve Carell's character. But instead of pursuing mouse art and dragging around dead mices, he is pursuing acting career and dragging around his character photos which are the only laughs that Zach brought to this movie.Apart from the lack of laughs and some unbelievable scenes which make you roll your eyes in disbelief there is one huge error that drags throughout the movie. And that is it's full of sub-stories that lead nowhere or are not closely explored.Here are a few: 1. What was the whole story about Ethan and his father. We never get to see more than a glitch into this relationship that was obviously the only real relationship Ethan had in his life.2. What was the whole deal with Sarah/Daryyl story? From the get go it was unbelievable, but was never really explored any deeper than just a few hints of possible romance... Yep it went nowhere, but was large part of the second half of the movie.3. Who is Peter? I mean, yeah, he is in architect who is married and is expecting a baby. But that's about as much as one gets to know about him. And why is Peter so angry. What are his tempers all about? Why is he violent? I really wanted to like this movie. I really did. I wanted to laugh out hard. I really did. But in the end I was left disappointed wanting more laughs, more substance, more of a storyline... I didn't like Dinner for Schmucks. And this movies is Dinner for Schmucks without the laughs. And that says a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny...but not Hangover Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without exposing the whole movie (the trailers did a good job at that)...it has it's funny moments but isn't Hangover funny. Didn't live up to the hype IMO, but it was still worth seeing. I could probably count on a single hand the funny moments that were not in the trailer. There was just something about the movie that left you feeling awkward at times when the comedy turned dark. There were a lot of fall fetched scenes where you can't help but wonder how would this be possible in real life. I just hope Hangover 2 lives up to the first one. Also if you think Zack is going to be the same Allen type character as in the Hangover for Due Date you are going to be disappointed. There are similarities to the characters but they are far in between...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Due Date (2010)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate Galifianakis. He's a fat, ugly, unfunny, one note wonder. The fact that he plays the most obnoxiously stupid and annoying person ever does not help this film. Comedies like this run the risk of infuriating. The film tries to bring humor by having straight faced Downey Jr. get beat-up, injured, and annoyed. It doesn't work, mostly because Downey Jr. has rage issues and isn't very sympathetic. I'm all for hurting kids in movies, but the annoying kid should have been hurt by his own stupidity. Having Downey Jr. punch the boy and tell him not to tell his mum, is both sinister and uncomfortable. He later picks on a man for doing his job and so on. There are laughs. There are some great stunts. And somewhere there is a good comedy in here. But don't bother with this when you can watch Planes, Trains and Automobiles. A film where characters have hearts, as well as bad luck, and annoying friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This draws obvious comparisons to Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, and while I've never been a fan of Steve Martin, I find it extremely funny, largely because you care about the two lead characters. I love RDJ, and had high hopes for Due Date because he is in it, but... well, the draft script must have been a lot funnier than the finished product, as I barely raised a smile throughout. Here is a man desperate to get home to his wife about to give birth to his first child, and he punches an obnoxious kid in the stomach, spits at an injured dog, and is generally a b*stard throughout. I have never seen Zach Galifianakis in anything before, and on this offering, I will avoid all future films. Atrocious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't care how great a movie is, if the production company forces me to sit through 10- 15 minutes of advertisements without the ability to FF or go to the main menu, it gets 1 star negative reviews from me. I either paid to rent or buy this film, so Warner Bros irritates me and I'll let my opinion be known. The movie was funny, BTW. Now, here's the principle of the matter...Warner Bros can do what they want with their product, thats their right, but forcing me to sit through ads, well I have the right to complain. This annoys me enough that I will not be buying the Bue-ray, despite being a RDJ fan. Are you listening, Warner Bros? $30 million profit wasn't enough?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From The Hangover to Due Date the fall is great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨My father loved coffee, and now we loved him as coffee.¨Todd Phillips is the man responsible for directing The Hangover, one of my favorite comedies of the decade. He's also directed some other funny movies like Old School and is currently working on the sequel for The Hangover. However his latest film, Due Date, was hugely disappointing. Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis are among today's best comedic actors, but they were badly miscast in this film. The biggest mistake was the approach this road trip/comedy took because the lead characters were immensely annoying and very unlikeable. Robert Downey Jr. 's character is really mean spirited and hateful. He yells at people all the time, easily losses his temper, hits kids, spits at dogs, and even fights with a guy in a wheelchair. It's impossible to sympathize with him even if he's Robert Downey Jr. Zach Galifianakis on the other hand has to play the typical annoying character, but he hugely exaggerates it in his approach. He's really annoying and not someone you actually feel sorry for or could wish the best for him. He's just way too immature and a little too crazy. It's impossible in this genre to avoid comparisons with Hughes' 1987 film: Plain, Trains, &amp; Automobiles, one of the all time best road trip comedies. Phillips could have learned several lessons from that movie before directing Due Date. Steve Martin's character is in no way as mean or hurtful as Downey was, and Candy might have been annoying, but he was still a likable guy who made you feel sorry for him, unlike Galifianakis. There are really very few funny moments in this comedy (and the best were already shown in the trailer). Due Date relies too heavily on pot jokes, foul language, and masturbating dogs; and it has no heart.The story is actually not very different from any other road trip comedy. Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jr.) is an architect and expectant father from Los Angeles who happens to be working in Atlanta. He is trying to make it home on time for the birth of his son/daughter because his wife, Sarah (Michelle Monoghan) is expecting him to show up at the hospital, but an unexpected problem surfaces when Peter has a discussion with one of the passengers of the plane, Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis), and both end up on the no flying list. Peter is forced to travel to LA in a rental car along with Ethan because he left his wallet with money and documents on the plane. As much as Peter seems to despise Ethan he decides to travel with him and their troubles begin. Ethan is not the person with whom you'd want to travel with on the road from coast to coast across the States, much less when he also carries around a masturbating dog with him that believes he's human. Along their journey we meet some other characters like Heidi (Juliette Lewis) the drug dealer, Lonnie (Danny McBride) an ex War veteran working at Western Union, and Darryl (Jamie Foxx) a long time friend of Peter and Sarah. Neither of the supporting characters have enough screen time to make their performances any memorable although some of the funniest scenes revolve around them.Whatever Todd Phillips did right in The Hangover, he failed to do so with Due Date. There are very few laughs, and there are characters we can't sympathize with despite the fact that the actors are hugely talented. I can't even imagine how these two films were directed by the same guy, but I hope he redeems himself with The Hangover sequel. Due Date is a forgettable comedy and a really mean spirited film. Phillips goes a little too over the top in his approach to this road trip comedy. Perhaps the best and funniest moments of the film come from the individual performances of the actors, like the scene where Galifianakis begins to act out a scene from The Godfather. There is also a SNL like moment in the scene at Western Union between Danny McBride and Robert Downey Jr. It's a funny scene, but if that's one of the highlights of the film I'd rather watch a full episode of SNL. The truth of the matter is that the movie fails because the audience is unable to connect or find sympathy with any of the characters. There is not one likable person in this film and that makes us care less whether or not Peter and Ethan make it to Los Angeles on time together. Skip this film and watch Planes, Trains, &amp; Automobiles instead because that is how you make a hilarious road trip movie with likable and memorable characters.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Due Date had all the potential to be a classic road movie. Robert Downey Jr and Zack Galifianakis are both funny men and should have made this a very funny film. Sadly it's a major disappointment.It's obvious that director Todd Phillips is trying to make another Plains trains and Automobiles but he ends up making a pigs ear of it.There are a few funny moments but they are far too rare to make this movie in an way memorable. Downey Jr and Galifianakis do work well together but the script is too weak for them to make this a success.I'm sure some people will enjoy this film but i would say if you want to watch a really funny road movie go for Plains , trains and Automobiles or Midnight Run - They are so much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"My father loved coffee, and now we loved him as coffee."Due Date is a dark road trip comedy with a lot of potential that isn't fully realized.&nbsp;Downey and Galifianakis have both proved that they're funny guys in other movies, but here they both seemed to be on autopilot. The script just doesn't give them a lot to work with, so they have to fall back on their stock comedy routines.&nbsp;There are some funny moments (and a few are absolutely hilarious), but many jokes are complete misses. The story is a simple variation of a guy in a hurry to get somewhere having to partner with a bumbling, annoying person who keeps unintentionally creating obstacles &nbsp;between them and their destination. And of course, they become friends by the end. It's all so routine that the movie seems uninspired, and even boring at times.&nbsp;So Due Date is nothing that you haven't seen before. How much you like Downey and Galifianakis, even when they're not necessarily at their best, will determine whether Due Date is worth your time. I thought it was good enough for a rental or watching on TV, but it's not one of the better comedies I've seen in the last few years.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Hey, 2011 is just born now and I enter my 7th season of reviews! As much as my high school life ! I hope this new year would be better than this movie!) My motivation to go to to this movie was that it stars RDJr whom I considered as legitimate successor of Pacino. Now i wonder if my opinion is still true because here, he plays such an arrogant character that after five minutes I found him pretty irritating (on contrary to Al who always find charisma in his darker parts).Opposite to RDJr, you find a cool and smiling guy but such peculiar that you don't feel at ease with him. As this is a road-movie with those two cases, I found the travel very long, all the more that the director doesn't take advantage of showing great American landscapes.Worst, when the only friend they find is Foxx, i was less and less enthralled because i just can't stand his bragging personality! Sure, it's labeled "comedy" and I laughed ... but a bit: when RDJr punches a kid, when their car crashes but that's all. If I add the Pink Floyd moment, that must be the best parts of this movie.In conclusion, a very weak movie with very weak characters!</fullReview>

This isn't Planes, Trains, and Automobiles; this is Due Date and it isn't Thanksgiving, it's getting home before the arrival of the first born.It's not that this film isn't funny but it's not original and the very least they could do is admit it's a ripoff.

		<fullReview>When you sit down to watch a film, you can forgive it is a remake. You can forgive if the director chooses to make a film that has already been made. You can forgive if the gags are 'expected' or in some cases, childish.What you cannot forgive is calling this film a comedy. Yes, there are those bits that you do laugh at...but in this film they are few and far between. The opening, at the airport, sets up a situation not too dissimilar to 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles'.As well as, where are the charming characters? Where is the finesse? Where is the pathos? Do I really care that Ethan Tremblay is?well, exactly what is he? Why is he there? Is he so removed from a real character, unlike 'Del Griffith' (John Candy) in P, T&amp; A that we do not care if he is?well, odd? We do not feel for Peter or his urgent situation.What is missing are the need to care for these characters. Which is a pity. I wanted to feel for them and the situation, but when they arrived at Heidi's house, all hope was lost.Watch it. Yes.Hope for miracles. No.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>one main lesson that is learnt by Peter Highman(in the movie) but not shown explicitly is when at first scene Ethan Tremblay tells Peter Highman that nowadays good looking, learned people commit crimes more than the not-so-good looking ones... When Darryl steals Ethan's belongings Ethan must have learnt this lesson...in fact apart from the hidden nuances of the film which u have pointed out... the film had lot of out spoken details of the society and what Ethan as a individual feels about it... Be it the talk about Working for foreigners when they board the train and little details like when he keeps talking about his fathers death in a Tsunami, he dozes half way through it, meaning he has moved on with the fact of life.. and the way he asks Darryl if he goes around daily with thieves when Ethan says he has not seen thief in real!!!! or when he forgives the man in last scene, when he warns about using wet cell phones...But i do not understand 2 things... why wasn't the rebel song and his Umbrella fight commercially famous when nowadays simple fight sequences with no relevance of place or facts get so much news... and i must say that the press and media have not given the credit to the film that it deserved.... in this world of cheap stories and acting... a Todd Phillips film like this still does not get, if not better, equal hype to Rajini's movies... If one is hyped for its commercial value this film should have been promoted for its story value... Even Todd Phillips requires his films to do good at box office and does not want his films to be called out-of-the-world and great!!!!Other wise he too will jump into the gutter that is around him... and of course one well known trivia for all of us is that we all know how much Sundar.C must have contributed ;-) One more thing... It must be a heart break for some but this film has its "one line" plot from a Hollywood movie called "Trains planes and automobiles" but except the fact that 2 different people are made to travel together due to circumstances and one of them is narrating a story... The idea of atheist, practical, matured man who starts liking the emotional, finicky guy, Galifianakis and Downey Jr.'s character and also the train scene etc are Todd Phillips's own making and the underlying concept of the society is itself very fresh ... SO i hope everyone feels the same way... cos its not a first-scene-to-last remake thanks all hope u all enjoyed my comments</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Annoying, NOT funny Dialogue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Highman (Downey) needs to get to LA to witness the birth of his first baby. He meets Ethan (Galifianakis) at the airport , bags get switched, a wallet is lost, drug items are found, and both are on a no-fly list. A car is rented and both agree to travel to LA. It is far easier to determine how the pyramids were built than to figure out why certain movies are made. This one is not funny, most annoying, has rambling and non-comedic dialogue and is disgusting at times.And, here we have Zach Galifianakis who is supposed to be the new Hollywood funny man and nothing. Absolutely nothing. No Timing. No, not even the sight gags (telegraphed a mile away) helped. Then we have to have a masturbation scene that is always not funny. And, get this, the dog chimes in too. Disgusting.The only ones who found ZG funny were his in-crowd. But, to be fair, he was very good in IT'S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY. Not funny there either, but very good as a dramatic actor. Cast-wise, the only saving thing in here is Downey. His character was the straight man to Ethan's gibberish. Just as the scripts in Iron Man, and Sherlock Holmes were bad, in my opinion, Downey is the only professional (Okay Jude Law was good too in SH) and I stayed with it because of him. He is always good, even with bad scripts. Maybe someone should ask Downey to help with the screenplay and the plot as well. We might get a better movie. Maybe even a funny one. Jamie Foxx was very good as he usually is and the rest of the cast performed well. The vehicle stunts and crashes were excellent.In the beginning I felt this was a Vince Vaughn role because I heard Downey talk at light speed (Vaughn's schtick) and I wondered if Vaughn turned this role down for some reason. Oh, wait, now I get it. Vaughn is too big to fit into the small car the script called for. That makes sense. And, to add insult to any comedic attempt, the name of the baby at the end of the movie is Rosie Highman. There isn't more to say. The bad dialogue and lack of comedic timing ruined this big time. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Drug Use: Yes. A masturbating dog: Yes. Language: Yes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honestly...not as good as you think it will be...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis are terrific actors, however, this movie does not showcase their talents properly. They're acting is great and believable, intense and heartfelt at times. I was glad to see that Galifianakis plays a similar character to the one in "The Hangover". However,this script does not do them justice.At times this movie is mildly funny with a chuckle or two (the type of chuckle that is reminiscent of the word "lol" put at the end of a very awkward text message).There is some crude humor and some subtle humor, but the problem is that its inconsistent and doesn't really work. They should have stuck with either or. Also, the parts that are supposed to be crudely funny, are hard to watch, because they're not. The car accident, the reference to terrorists, and drug smuggling is just awkward. Basically, this is "Trains, Planes and Aeroplanes" with less funnies and with more references to todays' pop culture (with some references to Facebook, Jason Bourne etc).Honestly, this movie could have been great if the script had been written better (what a waste of potential). The acting is fine, it's the script that's dry. It's not that it's not eventful enough, there's just not enough energy in it. It's worth a watch, but it's not as enjoyable as I thought it would be with Galifianakis and Downey. Somewhat disappointing, but definitely not a total wreck. If you haven't seen "Planes, Trains and Automobiles", watch it instead, better use of time.Sadly, one of the worst movies of 2010.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hangover it's not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised when my roommate all but forced me into watching The Hangover with him one Saturday afternoon. I don't remember the last time I laughed so hard during a film. What made the experience so particularly great for me, though, was that The Hangover brings together not only fantastic, side-splitting comedy, but also craftsmanship on every level, be it a tight screenplay that constantly works and keeps you wanting more, pitch- perfect acting, and deft direction and editing. Due Date... has basically none of these elements. Sure, there are a few laughs here or there-- and I disagree with those who would say the funniest moments are in the trailer, as I didn't find the trailer very funny at all--but overall, this is what I would expect from a Todd Phillips film. The simple, basic, fratastic bilge that could only be funny to a bunch of thick-necked guys (or lanky Star Wars geeks wishing they were the former) who are wasted on flat beer and soggy potato chips. Yawn.I don't know how he did it, but Phillips even got a bad performance out of Robert Downey Jr. There were whole sequences that didn't need to be in the film at all, and way too much that we've seen far too many times before, and not just in Trains, Planes, and Automobiles (of course that comparison is going to be made; this is merely a raunchy, sloppy update of the former). You know there's a problem when a scene in which Zach G.'s character guest stars on an episode of Two and a Half Men is the funniest moment in the film. And, yes, to answer your question, he does play exactly the same character he played in The Hangover; only now he seems self-aware of what he did in the previous and is just trying to do the same, only much worse. A shame, too; he's still probably one of the funniest comedians/actors on the scene. But, we all have to make a buck. As they say, "Even Karl Marx had to pay for his beer." Frankly, I just didn't get this film. I would actually compare it more to Road Trip than to PT&amp;A, which makes sense considering the filmmaker. PT&amp;A combined its comedy with great acting and heart/sincerity. Due Date doesn't even try in this department. Like Road Trip, It's just a scribbled laundry list of uninteresting, trite nonsense and du jour cameos. The Hangover was a fluke. A hilarious and well-made fluke. But a fluke. Oh, well. At least this mess wasn't two-and-a-half hours (Phillips has got something over Apatow there).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jr) is trying to make to home to his wife, Sarah (Michelle Monaghan) who is scheduled to deliver their first born at the end of the week. When Peter arrives at the airport, he bumps into Ethan (Zach Galifianakis), who accidentally switches his bag with Peter and begins to cause trouble in his life. While boarding the plane, Peter and Ethan get into an argument and both are kicked off the plane. This is when Peter finds out even more bad news! He is now on the no fly list. With no one else to turn to, Peter hitches a car ride with Ethan across country to hopefully get home to his wife before the baby arrives. A somewhat amusing road trip ensues...When I first saw the trailer for "Due Date," I felt indifferent about it. Sure, it looked really amusing at times but then I got the feeling it was going to be really bad. "Due Date" was made by Todd Phillips, a man who I feel has gotten a lot of attention off comedies that are better than the norm. I would like to put this out there right now, while most of his films are amusing, all of them are overrated. "The Hangover" was a funny film but it wasn't god's gift to comedy like almost every critic made it out to be, and the same thing goes with "Old School." Phillips knows how to make successful raunchy comedy and has done so since 2000 when he brought us "Road Trip." He's good at it but like everything else, there is room for improvement.At times, the overall story and characters in "Due Date" reminded of "Planes, Trains and Automobiles." You know, the 1987 road trip comedy with John Candy and Steve Martin that was directed by John Hughes? Yep, that one. Sure, it wasn't the exact same movie but it was similar in many ways and felt like it. Galifianakis pretty much played the funny, annoying but ultimately lovable fat guy aka John Candy's character and Downey Jr played the stressed out business guy. It was very similar in terms of characters just with some extras added in to bring it up to date with the times.The jokes in the film were very hit and miss. I found some of them to be really funny and others just fell dead in their tracks. There are tons of drug gags in the film as well as some sex humor specifically masturbation. These jokes didn't really work for me. The funnier jokes to me were the ones found in the trailer involving them putting Ethan in the cab of the truck and driving over bumps. The jokes I found more amusing were the little ones, more than the big ones. I think the film tried to hard at times to be funny and I just wasn't laughing at it.I will be honest and say that I thought, Downey Jr and Galifianakis did have solid chemistry with one another. Galifianakis was back to playing that clueless loser character that he played in "The Hangover." I personally didn't like his character but than again, I didn't like Downey Jrs either. I think that was a big problem with the film; neither of the leads were likable. Sure, they had funny moments but they were both equally annoying and not someone the audience could relate to. Downey Jr plays a good a-hole and he does that extremely well. It's not that they didn't have good on-screen chemistry or that they didn't fit their roles, it's just there wasn't any redeeming qualities about either of them. With buddy road trip films, you have to like at least one of the characters and I didn't here.In the end, "Due Date" received average reviews and for once, I actually agree with the critics about a Todd Phillips film. It's not a bad movie but it's just not great. For every joke that works, there are probably two that fail. It's an enjoyable film that I am glad I watched but probably not one I would want to add to my collection. I think with a little bit more character development and maybe a better and more well-rounded ending, it would have been a much better film. Since the film used characters similar to "Planes, Trains and Automobiles," it would have been nice if it used some of its heart as well. Its not something you will be upset when watching but you will just ultimately saying to yourself, "eh, it was OK." in the end. I think for a comedy, it's decent but than again great comedies don't happen every day.MovieManMenzel's final rating for "Due Date" is a 5.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alternates between hilarious and emotional; causing some awkward moments.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comparisons to "Planes, Trains, and Automobiles" are unavoidable. But I'll try to review this movie for what it is.And what it is, is a vulgar, crude and funny road trip movie about two mismatched guys trying to reach their common destination. Hilarity predictably ensues.Robert Downey Jr. and especially Zach Galifianakis are great in their roles, with Downey perfectly playing a high-strung, uptight businessman, and Galifianakis displaying many ranges of acting from hilarious, dumb, annoying and tragic - so much that at times you want to bash the guy's face in and at others, you just want to give him a hug. I'm really positively surprised at Galifianakis' talents, not just as a comedian, but an actor as well. Here's hoping to better roles to his career. I'm also surprised to see many actors in this movie - Michelle Monaghan, Jamie Foxx, &amp; Juliette Lewis among others.Unfortunately, the dramatic moments caused by Galifianakis' character also causes some awkward moments because as soon as you're done laughing, you've just realized you're laughing at a sym(pathetic) person. The comedy momentum is destroyed many times because of this.On the positive side, the soundtrack is quite hip, the cinematography really displaying the beauty of the American wilderness at times, and the pacing (of the jokes) is just right. Keep in mind that some jokes can be just cruel, but nevertheless he kind of had it coming.Overall, this is a fun movie to watch, but be prepared to face some awkwardness after you laugh at some moments. The film's pretty vulgar and raunchy to boot.Overall: 63/100</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had read mostly mediocre review of "Due Date", so I was already going into this movie with a negative impression, but I must confess that the reviews I had read hardly paid the proper respects to this movie, because I found "Due Date" to actually be quite nice.It is a pretty straight forward comedy movie in the likes of "Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles" starring Steve Martin and John Candy, so if you are familiar with that classic comedy movie and liked it, then you will definitely like "Due Date" as well.The story, shortly put, is Peter Highman (played by Robert Downey, Jr.) getting into trouble because of Ethan Tremblay (played by Zach Galifianakis) outside the airport, and from there, the funny and awkward situations just escalate.I found the story to be likable and funny, and there was a lot of really great humor in the movie. Again, I refer to the Steve Martin and John Candy movie. Lots of far out there situations that make you laugh and sometimes even curl your toes in disbelief. Aside from the funny moments, then there was a nice theme with friendship and differences shining through here as well.The acting in "Due Date" was right on the money and good. Downey and Galifianakis are really working great together, Highman being the one with his life neatly planned and everything usually in place, while Tremblay's life was chaotic and in disarray.For a comedy, then "Due Date" delivered lots of entertainment and good laughs. If you enjoy comedies with more to it than just the average drunk and teen-sex themes, then "Due Date" is well worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's all Uphill from Here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Director Todd Phillips has become comedy director du jour thanks first to "Old School" and the more recent mega-blockbuster "The Hangover". This film is not quite at the level of the two prior films, but it certainly holds it own in today's multiplex. In other words, it has some laughs ... even a few laugh outloud moments. Especially if you have somehow managed to avoid the trailers.The best way I can describe this one is as an updated "Planes, Trains and Automobiles", only with Todd Phillips humor, rather than John Hughes humanity. That being said, Mr. Phillips does work hard at minimizing the gross-out factor and does try to instill some true character development with Robert Downey, Jr and Zach Galifianakis. The element of fatherhood, both loss of and becoming one, plays a role as these two opposites bang heads for 3 days.Ethan (Zach G) is an actor-wannabe, motivated by the sitcom Two and a Half Men. He is an excessively annoying individual who displays only the rarest moments of rationale behavior. Downey, Jr is reunited with his "Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang" co-star Michelle Monaghan as an uptight architect (Peter) and his soon to deliver first child wife (Sarah). They get little screen time together, but the relationship plays a role. Circumstances cause Ethan and Peter into a rental car and cross country race to get Peter home before Sarah delivers.The road trip includes a Western Union run in with Danny McBride, a pit stop for glaucoma meds with Juliette Lewis and a quick ride from Jamie Foxx, after Ethan falls asleep at the wheel and they fly off a highway ramp. Just when things seem better, Ethan partakes in some of the medication, takes a wrong turn and the two find themselves at the Mexico border, glassy eyes and all. This all occurs while Ethan and his dog work to befriend Peter, while transporting not only the "meds", but also Ethan's deceased father's ashes ... in a coffee can.Many of the gags are predictable, but some are quite funny. It doesn't have near the gross-out element of "The Hangover", except for Ethan's pre-bedtime ritual and his matching dog. Would have liked a few more segments with cameos - maybe the other guys from "The Hangover", because the attempt at making these guys appreciate each other falls a bit short. The soundtrack includes Neil Young, Cowboy Junkies, Cream and Pink Floyd, so there is usually a nice background tune playing. Additionally, RDJ and Zach G prove once again that they are forces of physical comedy when provided decent material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In a Nutshell (Short Review): "Due Date" (7/10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the director of "Old School" and "The Hangover".....but I feel the urge to tell you more!Ever since the astronomical success of "The Hangover" everyone is been waiting for director Todd Phillips to come back to us with a follow up, or at least something to keep us going until the release of "The Hangover 2" next year. Well, "Due Date" does the job, it is no Hangover but it is quite funny, entertaining and has two hilarious dudes that we all love.A classic mix up in Atlanta airport ends up getting Peter (Robert Downey Jr.) and Ethan (Zack Galifianakis) kicked out of the plane. Even though they've just met and hit it off on the wrong foot, they both share a furious ride to LA with different motives; Peter in a hurry to make it to his child's birth and Ethan to get to Hollywood and become an actor.Galifiankis side by side with Downey Jr. is what I call good casting, and it serves the movie right. The story, however, may seem a bit overdone at times specially on Downey's character side; it gets tense and you may even hate him for a few seconds which should not happen in such a comedy, but apart from that it's one long series of unstoppable laughing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just like hangover, duo date is an extra large comedy. However, the first was funnier and had better structure in its story line. The laughter was based mainly on the oddness of the characters (Peter, the strict perfectionist meets Eathan, the weird and rough loner). The opposition of the two creates the craziness of the film. Good performances, easy script and clever lines are combined nicely by the director, who tries to make a road trip interesting and exciting. Sometimes, though, he exaggerates, like the scene with the shooting or the heavy beating in the bank. On the other hand, the dog was very cute and the ending with the scene from 'two and a half men' was brilliant. All in all, duo date is easy to watch and has many funny moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not bad, Not good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All in all, I didn't think that this film was that bad. Certainly its not as funny as The Hangover, nor is it Robert Downey Jr's best role, nor is it an intellectual comedy. It is however good fare for the Friday night where you are not doing anything and feel like watching a road movie for giggles. The 2 are funny together, although Galifianakis steals the show from Downey Jr. Not all of it is funny and it does have this stop-start feel to it where it jumps between trying to be funny and failing, and being hilarious.Don't go out of your way to watch it, but if it happens to be on, don't overlook it either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Downey Jnr, A exceptional actor who has the ability to make you laugh while no being OTT. Maybe that's why i enjoyed this film. If Zach was teamed up with someone like Ben Still or Bradley Cooper, then this film would of inevitably been another average Hollywood film. And it is when you get down to the basics.There's nothing to the plot. Peter has 5 days to get his butt to the hospital to see the birth of his first child. A mix up at the airport leaves him in the 'no fly zone' and abolishes any hope of arriving at the side of his partner. Well, he takes a hitch with a junkie low lifer and there endeavour across the states begins.The chemistry between the both of them is wonderful. There are many hilarious scenes and one-liners to keep you laughing throughout the entire film. The Mexico dilemma could of been edited out but never mind.The film was only going to end in one way. No big deal. Both major parts were acted incredibly and to that i say this is worth a watch</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>funny the 1st time. Downey is kind of a jerk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I started seeing the previews for this movie after I had finally watched "The Hangover" for the first time. I really thought it would be as funny. It wasn't as good, though it had parts that did make me laugh from the start to finish. Now recently tried to watch it for a 2nd time and didn't make it to the finish. I guess I need to wait longer before watching it again.I love how Robert Downeys character deals with the annoying kid at the craigslist weed dealers house. But I think he made his character come off meaner than needed. Sure the character should be annoyed and just want to get home, but why would Zach G's character want to be pals with a jerk like that. I wouldn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was very disappointing. I usually find Zach Galifianakis to play funny characters, but in this movie he was terrible. About the only funny thing is when Robert Downey, Peter, gets beat down by a disabled dude and Ethan runs away. Most of this movie was just not funny. It was stupid. Too many body fluid jokes that were just gross. Why is it supposed to be funny that Peter thumps on a kid in a drug dealer's house.Also, after everything Ethan did, there is no way a guy like Peter would still invite him to tag along when his friend picks him up and gives him a car to take home. At that point, Peter doesn't need him any more. Ethan was driving him crazy.FINAL VERDICT: Not worth watching.</fullReview>

He then has to get a ride with a simpleton (Galifinakus)who naturally drives him nuts the whole way their.This movie has a lot of laugh out loud moments and great performances from the cast. It is mainly just these two followed by a short performance by Jamie fox. If you like Zach Galifinakus or Robert Downy Jr this movie is definitely going to make you laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grab this comedy for a night in!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Due Date is a comedy directed by Todd Phillips. Firstly, no I haven't seen Planes, Trains and Automobiles so I am basing this film on its own merit.The plot tells of two guys who, after a series of unfortunate events have to endure a road trip together. We begin when are two protagonists- Peter Highman (Downey) and Ethan Tremblay (Galifianakis) meet or rather 'bash' into each other outside Atlanta Airport. Peter is a methodical, precise architect with a schedule to meet. Ethan is a messy, bumbling no-so-grown-up grown up, who is at the airport to try and fulfil his dream of being an actor. Ethan is lucky guy but possesses the unfortunate ability to jinx the people he comes into contact with. It therefore leads to Ethan indirectly but comprehensively, destroying Peter's trip by getting them both chucked off the flight and when Peter loses his wallet after being banned from flying he dejectedly realises he has no other alternative but to join Ethan for a road trip!Downey Jr's character seems to come so easily to him and its no surprise. It's Downey's signature sarcasm and distinctive slow burn that make the movie. The ability to switch his temperament instantly is marvellous and delivers effortlessly. Galifianakis, in a perm that makes for not comic gold but rather silver and they both play off each other well, sharing banter that supplies amusement throughout. Im not sure if I felt any connection for Ethan Tremblay as his character is so inept (its fun but provides little character connection for the audience).The soundtrack blends well with the film and provides good music for the duration. The tempo of the film never drops because of the entertainment provided throughout, having said that, the problem is you wont miss anything from laughing to hard or to long because the film seems to stay in 2nd gear with only a couple of very humorous bits but no real 'roll on the floor laughing' moments. This is one of my only hang ups about the Due Date, considering the film before it The Hangover (by the same director) was such a huge success, its disappointing that the most isn't being made of a good cast. The story was there, the script could have been better- it just feels like the production was a bit lazy considering the actors performed highly. Im not saying Due Date is a bad film by any means, it is just after a bit of research, you get the feeling it may have been seen or used as a 'filler' for the directing team whilst they worked on a sequel to The Hangover, which is a shame as Due Date could have stood next to The Hangover rather than in the shadows. Overall Due Date is one of the better comedies produced in recent times, with good acting and sufficient entertainment, but if your expecting a comedy to match the delights and heights of aforementioned 'Hangover' you will be very disappointed. If you lower the bar a bit and simply want to grab a funny, enjoyable movie to watch, then choose your Due Date!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think people have too high expectations. I laughed out loud at a lot of the points of this comedy. I loved a lot of the lines ("I thought it said Texaco") ("I despise you on a cellular level." "I get that a lot and I'm working on it.") (When Ethan kept drinking the coffee to keep from choking on it.) I like both these actors. I could believe all the characters. It made sense that they "bonded" after Ethan saved Peter. It was worth renting. Maybe not as good as Hangover, but fun. There were only a few "gross out" parts I didn't like that I won't bother mentioning here. And, it was a bit much to believe the ending (that they would make it to the hospital on time and that Peter wouldn't collapse until he got there.) But I enjoyed watching this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Various reviewers here told the story, I won't go into that, then.YES, it is an absolute screwball comedy and the unlikeliness of events is patent. However, unlike many other so-called comedies, this one is, in my humble opinion, really funny. Why? Because, first and foremost, of Robert Downey Jr.'s acting. He's really worth the admission to see this movie. I couldn't help laughing especially at scenes when he, the lofty, almost tight-lipped, high-brow, "I've seen it all" type of man, is taken down, literally, by circumstances. Incredible how he manages to be credible even when the going couldn't get rougher...So, my 6 out of 10 go to Downey Jr. and if they ask me if I recommend this movie, I'd tell them, yes, go see it if you want to have a good 1 1/2 hour laugh in a not-so-common comedy, although you will see scenes you have seen before. But Downey Jr. is well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Occasionally funny, but marred by many crude moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The success of "The Hangover" seems to have turned Todd Phillips into the next Judd Apatow, and just like that filmmaker's offerings Phillips movies are equally flawed: occasionally funny, they are often disjointed by crude scenes that include unfunny vulgarities and/or inappropriate violence. "Due Date" is no exception.It's not easy to overlook that the plot is more or less risen directly from John Hughes' "Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles", so much so that this movie could actually be considered a remake: A snobby business man desperately wants to get home to his family, when he runs into a well-meaning, but disastrously clumsy person, who causes lots of trouble during that trip, which leads too some funny moments. Fair enough, it's maybe an obvious story, but "Due Date" still has to acquiesce to being compared to "Planes, Trains...". And the plain truth is: It doesn't stand a chance against Hughes' movie.It's not that Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis don't have chemistry on screen, they do. Downey Jr. in particular gives an engaging performance. It's just that one doesn't believe for a second that these two would ever strike up a relationship. Where "Planes, Trains..." is heartwarming and engaging at its core, "Due Date" is marred by too many mean-spirited moments: Punching a kid in the stomach just isn't funny. Laughing at somebody who pours his heart out to you isn't funny. Almost having an accident and looking at a shocked John Candy who turns into a skeleton with hair is funny. Falling asleep at the wheel, skipping the car over and causing it to crash on its roof top isn't. The list goes on.Scenes like these stick out like sore thumbs and should obviously not have been included. It seems weird to me that Phillips wouldn't have felt the same way when cutting the movie."Due Date" is entertaining for as long as its running. In the end, though, it will be "Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles" that people will remember as the road trip comedy classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enroute from Atlanta to Los Angeles via plane to be on time for the birth of his first child, Peter Highman instead runs into fellow-passenger/aspiring Hollywood actor, Ethan Tremblay, and has part of his baggage switched.Just when the flight is about to take off, Peter gets into a situation, is shot and subdued by an Air Marshall. When he regains his senses he finds he is on the 'No Fly List', no money/credit card, nor identification, and is compelled to hitch a ride with Ethan.Hoping to make it in time, he is has no idea that soon he will be assaulted by a 'handicapable' Western Union employee; get in a serious accident that will result in a fracture and several stitches; be on the run from Mexican Police; suspect his wife of having an affair with his friend, Darryl, and that the child may not even be his.....This has been compare to planes, trains.... so many many times on many sites, and whilst the premise is similar, Highman is one of the most unlikeable 'heros' in this type of comedy that you are ever likely to see. On many occasions, his arrogance deserves the punishment that he gets, and you when summarise the film after seeing it, you do find yourself saying 'if only he said that', but then this film would not have been so funny.And it is very funny, even though it was going to struggle after The Hangover, it really holds it together, and goes from one hilarious set piece to the next. Bearing in mind that you do have to take a massive pinch of salt when watching the film, it's a fun movie with some great performances and some very funny dialogue.Playing highman the way Downey JR, does is the ace in this film, as comedies are getting boring with a nice guy in the lead. We want more paranoid anti-heroes.Galifinakias (typo), is what you expect, funny and just totally ignorant to the fact that peter has so much hatred toward him, until the spitting incident.On second viewing, i realised how heartwarming the final third is, and after the film had finished, it was nice to get the impression that they had formed a friendship.It's funny, in a spiteful way, and features the best spitting in a dogs face scene ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shallow and has a poor script, not a good duplication either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing about "Due Date" is that besides the title that makes people go paranoid, the characters in this talk like they are paranoid as well. Just because characters talk fast and mumble doesn't equal witty dialogue or direction. "Due Date" is basically a remake of Planes, "Trains &amp; Automobiles" which is a better movie. Even the trailer made it seem like it's basically a remake of that movie. I give some credit to this movie since it was a bit more humorous not that I found "Trains &amp; Automobiles" all that funny. It did have it's moments although very very few like the part where Robert Downey Jr. character who is the serious and sarcastic guy who has a good balance of being a jerk and being reasonable constantly talks back punches a annoying kid in the stomach. Basically who wants to go back home to see the birth of his child, but everything goes bonkers when he runs into Zach Galifianakis's character. Who is basically a idiot and a failure and also a bit of a jerk off and whatever he does lead to their destruction. He is basically a manchild in this that gets annoying from the very beginning. I was not hyped what so ever to see this movie when I saw the trailer but it has Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis and is directed by the same person that made some funny comedies in the past like "The Hangover". So thought it wouldn't be too bad, which is why this film probably did pretty good at box office despite it having a budget that is almost twice as that of "The Hangover". But this movie is far from being a good movie. Plus the characters aren't likable and Robert Downey Jr.'s character is a saint to put up with Zach Galifianakis's character. This just isn't a good comedy and isn't really worth the time to see "Due Date".4.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a conversation lands them on the no-fly list, Peter (Downey) and Ethan (Galifianakis) must endure a cross-country trip so Peter can make it to his first child's birth. Much like "The Hangover" this movie was a series of bad luck after bad luck. This one though very funny was also very touching in many parts. I will say that this movie does have what I call the "Hype Syndrome". This means that the longer it takes to watch it, the more you hear about it and when you finally do it's built up so much it's not as good as you were expecting. It is really funny, don't get me wrong. I just think I would have liked it more if I haven't seen the preview for it 10 times a day (which about 75% of the funniest parts are in), and heard that it was the funniest movie ever. Not really a new idea, two guys who don't know each other (one neat &amp; one a slob) get stuck together for an extended amount of time. But the two actors give it new life and it's fun to watch the two opposites play off each other. I recommend it but tone down your expectations. I give it a B+.Would I watch again? - Not sure, but it made me want to watch "Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles" again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about an expectant father who is about to fly to Los Angeles to see the birth of his son. His journey is derailed by a foolish and annoying man.Following the wildly funny and hence successful "The Hangover", it is natural for people to expect big things from "Due Date". One can clearly see that "Due Date" tries so hard to be funny, but it just misses the whole point. The annoying character called Ethan, played by Zach Galifianakis, is a fool who messes up everything he touches. Ethan is also annoying to the point that he cannot be likable. He annoys, offends, frustrates and bewilders, and these are not the same as being funny. "Due Date" might have a few funny moments, but it does not have the magic sparkle of "The Hangover".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has its moments but fails in comparison to the Hangover</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer/director Todd Phillips follows up the successful "The Hangover" with Due Date, another R-rated comedy. Phillips brings back Hangover's Zach Galifianakis, pairs him up with the most unlikely co-star, Robert Downey Jr, and sets them on a cross-country road trip. The Hangover stands as the highest-grossing R-rated film in history, but Due Date didn't gross as much. Unfortunately, what audiences will find is that Due Date's not nearly as funny as The Hangover and has two of the most irritating characters you could possibly imagine as focus of the film.Due Date has a few funny moments but not nearly enough to save the film. Also the film is very predictable from start. It was obvious that Peter (Downey Jr.) and Ethan (Galifianakis) didn't like each from the films start, and that towards the end they would eventually come forth and tolerate or appreciate each other more. It was also predictable how Peter was going to make it on time for his wife delivering their child. No matter what happened on the road trip, that was basically expected. I think the funniest scenes were the ones that included the brief scenes with Jamie Foxx and Danny McBride (even though parts were shown in the trailers). Jamie Foxx scene showed him as a long time friend of Peter who picks him and Ethan up from the airport on his truck. The funny scene was Foxx making coffee from Ethan's father's ashes, and the reaction from them(53.20). Danny McBride's scene was also quite funny. He was the late night handicapped worker who has a brief dispute with Peter and Ethan along the way (26.25-30.20).Due Date wasn't all that funny. They really showed many of its funniest scenes in the trailers. But I doubt it was meant for a straight laugh out loud comedy. Their were some depressing or dramatic scenes (Ethan talking about his father's death on the Grand Canyon, a car crash involving Peter and Ethan fallen off a bridge, an accidental gun shot wound by Ethan to Peter, a few drug hallucination scenes, and the final scene at the hospital)Due Date does have its funny moments, but it pales in comparison with Phillips' The Hangover, which was so successful, so funny, and begs comparison because it is still relatively fresh in audiences' minds. Hopefully, The Hangover 2 will will be superior and far entertaining than Due Date.</fullReview>

Robert Downey junior however has difficulty in making you believe his character. You would expect him to be REALLY angry and very hateful but he never is. For that reason it lacks the contrast that might have been vital to the plot. Who knows.I was never really quite sure at what point their relationship changed because it was never properly explained. They must have become friends during the long ride, off camera, or something? I don't know. it's a watchable movie , but it isn't a riot like it should be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into The Hangover expecting absolutely nothing, as I had not seen the preview. I went into Due Date expecting The Hangover, as I think Zach Galifianakis is brilliant. The movie did have more of a heart than The Hangover as the relationship between Galifianakis and Downey Jr. transforms. However, it lacked the one-liner magnificence. Cars are stolen, shots are fired and babies are born. The story with Jamie Foxx lacked substance, his character confusing. I didn't find this movie to be as "R" as The Hangover. It was just as outrageous, maybe more-so. I cringed in several parts, which is not something I particularly like to experience in a comedy. Downey's raging got old, and it wasn't funny in the first place. Overall, the movie wasn't terrible, it may have very well been considered a "great" comedy if created before The Hangover. Galifianakis made the movie. I don't think I laughed at anything Downey said, despite his acting and good looks. He belongs in dramas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I appreciate that "Due Date" dials back the faux-outrageousness that made director Todd Phillips' shallow smash hit "The Hangover" such an aggravating, unfunny experience for me. "Due Date" deals in plot and character, words I was beginning to think had been dropped from the comedy screenwriter's handbook. The problem is, "Due Date" isn't riotously funny either.Humor is always a balancing act. While "Due Date" sports fewer laughs than "The Hangover," it boasts a higher laugh to joke ratio. Also, since its predecessor crams shtick into every vacant nook and cranny, we never end up caring about its group of sorry misfits, let alone their Vegas bachelor's party gone awry. When a joke falls flat in "The Hangover," there isn't a safety net to break the fall. The film splinters on impact.The tightrope is safer in "Due Date" because we actually care about Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jr.). An expectant father with anger management issues and a lousy row of bad luck, Peter is exactly the sort of flawed protagonist we inherently root for. His cross-country companion Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis), however, is another story. His sole purpose in the film is to instigate Peter's short-temper, a task at which he excels. We don't care much about him, but then we don't need to?his personality quirks aren't the punchline, Peter's reaction is.In that regard, there are some beautifully cathartic moments that distinguish "Due Date" from many of today's ultimately polite comedies. The gravitas with which Downey Jr. delivers his tirades make them that much more effective, and his lack of conventional comic attributes is what makes "Due Date" palatable. If only his resolve had held stronger.As Peter and Tremblay arrive at an awkward friendship, Phillips regrettably kills the only thing "Due Date" has going for it: animosity. These are characters I don't care to see get along; when they're enjoying each other's company, it hard to enjoy either's. Everything funny about the film comes from their being at odds?Peter's unapologetic audacity is what makes the character such a great foil to the naive, annoying Tremblay. Stripped of that dynamic, the film merely sputters.Where "Due Date" finally collapses is in its cheap third-act schmaltz. The film is all but devoid of a climax, and Peter arrives at the hospital to meet his wife to neither fanfare nor adversity. The film is almost working against itself at this point, because Tremblay never becomes a proper antagonist. Even when the nature of his greatest deceit is laid bare, the character clash between he and Peter is underwhelming in comparison to earlier bouts. That they afterwards go on to become buddies is the coup de grace.Though "Due Date" is hardly a contender for comedy of the year, it nevertheless displays more intelligence than one would expect from the follow-up to "The Hangover." That intelligence, however, renders its "Hangover"-esque material (masturbating dogs) embarrassingly obsolete. The characters are strong enough to overcome the script's stinkers, at least until friendship rears its ugly head.Still, "Due Date" is encouraging as a testament to the importance of strong character writing, if only because it edges out a pass in spite of its blemishes elsewhere. Odd as it might sound, it's refreshing to see even a middle-of-the-road comedy that isn't trying to squeeze in six lame jokes per page. "The Hangover" may have had more laughs, but I'll take better characters any day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 'Goof' goof.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 'Goof' section of IMDb, it says that Daryl never appears at the birth and this is classed as a pot hole. The reason he wasn't there was because the baby was born EARLY, on a Thursday, when he had previously stated that he is only in town on Friday for the child's official due date. For an unexpected birth like that, would you think to call your best-friend who lives miles away? I don't think so ;) Remove it if you can!Poking aside, this film is a definite MUST SEE and I would recommend it to anyone who fancies their sides split for 100minutes. Zach is his usually funny self and Robert manages to pull a dead pan character extremely well in a fantastically comical way. Clichés are broken and replaced with gut busting unexpectancies. Go see this gem.</fullReview>

Robert Downey Jr and Galifinakis make such an uneven couple it becomes more comical then most movies combined in 2010. One of my favourite movies at the moment.Sad thing about the movie it was rather short. I am a long film type of guy and so short films are very disappointing for me. All in All Todd Phillips yet again does not disappoint. Brilliant Director</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far from a Masterpiece but It's Still Very Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Due Date (2010) *** (out of 4) Simple but often times hilarious comedy about a father-to-be (Robert Downey, Jr.) who gets kicked off his flight to L.A. because of a pot head (Zach Galifianakis) that he doesn't even know. Needing to get to Los Angeles for the birth of his first child, Downey agrees to share a car with the stoner and of course nothing goes right. If the story of two completely different people traveling across the country due to strange circumstances sounds like PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES then you'd be right because this here is pretty much a remake of that film. DUE DATE doesn't come anywhere close to the brilliance of that Steve Martin-John Candy film but the two stars here are so good that you can overlook the rather silly screenplay. Much like the director's previous film THE HANGOVER, this movie isn't shy when it comes to raunchy humor and we get plenty of that including a rather shocking sequence where the two men are sleeping in the car when Galifianakis needs to masturbate to get to sleep but what happens with the dog is just priceless. We even get some child abuse humor when the pothead decides to stop at a drug house and buy some weed while Downey must watch the sellers kids who get on his nerves very quickly. If that type of humor seems to cross the line with you then you might want to avoid this but things are pretty straight from here with a wide range of jokes ranging from the boys accidentally crossing into Mexico illegally to getting into a fight with a vet at Western Union. The humor gets thrown at you a mile a minute and while some of it misses I think for the most part it works because the two actors are just working so hard to make you laughs as much as you can. I honestly can't understand some of the negative reviews this thing has gotten because it doesn't set out to be a masterpiece or some sort of high art. It probably doesn't even set out to be as smart as THE HANGOVER and while it doesn't reach that level that doesn't mean it's not a success. Clearly the relationship between Downey and Galifianakis is the main reason to watch this because the two men are so different and so good at the roles they're playing that you can't help but be drawn into their situation. Downey is such a jerk as a character yet he's such a fine actor he can play it to the edge without going overboard to where you can't stand him. Galifianakis is just the opposite as he's such an annoying person yet the actor himself is so good that you can't help but love this guy. Both Jamie Foxx and Juliette Lewis appear in quick scenes and do nice work as well. There are several gags here that seem to have been borrowed from PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES but unfortunately this film forgets to have its heart or depths. With that said, DUE DATE is still very funny thanks to its actors and the dog is pretty good too.</fullReview>

Even as a slice of low brow comedy ? it's trying to emulate "The Hangover", a trashy sleeper hit ? the film fails.The film errs tremendously by casting actor Robert Downey Junior as the "straight man". Downey is at his best when madcap and unhinged. Why cast him only to reign him in? 3/10 ? Worth no viewings.</fullReview>

Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis answer the question with LOL comedic timing, facial expressions, and expert physical talent. Regular guy Peter Highman (Downey) finds himself without options, when he crosses paths with Ethan Tremblay (Galifianakis) on his way from Atlanta to Los Angeles for the birth of his first child. Forced to go cross-country with Ethan the pot smoking wannabe Hollywood actor, or miss his wife's due date, Peter finds himself being led deeper and deeper into Ethan's nutty life as it plays out on the road. This is a simple tale that proves to be great entertainment for the very basic fact that good writing, spot on acting, and a dog, always makes for a good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing yet unsurprising</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fresh off his massive world-wide smash, The Hangover, director Todd Phillips comes out with Due Date. Plotwise, this is a typical "odd couple" style of comedy which only works when both the main characters are interesting and, of course, funny. Thankfully, both Robert Downey Jr and Zach Galifianakis do a great job. Downey plays a father to be that is pushed into hitching a ride with a troubled idiot played by Galifianakis. What follows is a cross-country road trip with as many crazy scenarios as you can fit in an hour and a half. Offensive and cruel jokes abound in this funny comedy but it still carries some heart. The humor is definitely not up to the calibre of The Hangover but it still has some great laugh-out-loud moments. Galifianakis is what really makes this film what it is. He creates a classic character that is infuriating, pathetic, and stupid yet he also manages to make him likable and understandable - no easy feat. The dialogue is quick and witty and the guest stars make welcome appearances. The film itself is not going to go down as a classic but it is an amusing, although unsurprising, comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictably outrageous Due Date, forced flat and noisy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Road pictures featuring travelers thrown together by necessity rather than comradeship always increases plot possibilities. Instead of riding along with buddies you are all strangers and it becomes evident fast who your siding and identifying with. If your lucky the trip will be interesting. With Due Date you might want to get out after a few blocks.Archetect Peter Highman (Robert Downey) prepares to leave Atlanta for Los Angelas to be present at the birth of his first child when he crosses paths with the flaky Ethan Chace aka Tremblay (Zach Galinafikas). After getting both of them thrown off a flight they enter into an abrasive partnership to get to the West Coast. Fresh from the mega success of the recent road pic Hangover director Todd Phillips attempts to make another lightening strike with the same over the edge humor and the scene stealing Galinafikas as catalyst for the comic mayhem. Like Hangover, Phillips keeps the comedy and the violent slapstick flowing but the outrageousness and absurdity with moments of sentimental smarmy relief is forced and flat. Designated straight man Downey is refreshingly surly and put out while Galinafikas tweaks his off the wall character from Hangover to more affected and less effective. There's a french bulldog along for the trip that figures big on the posters and little on the screen. Save for a signature routine that he repeats from Hangover where he used a baby, Phillips makes it more apparent that he's following the same formula from Hangover where the novel humor re-heated here only makes him look like a jerk off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite the new Hangover</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because of the unexpected success of The Hangover (at the time of writing, the highest grossing R-rated comedy ever), people were reasonably excited about Todd Phillips's new project, road movie Due Date, which blends an established genre with the director's un-PC approach and the acting talents of Robert Downy Jr. and Zach Galifianakis. And yet, the mixture isn't an entirely successful one.Nothing wrong with the plot, however derivative it may be: due to an airport mishap, Peter Highman (Downey Jr.) is unable to take a plane to Los Angeles so that he can witness his wife (Michelle Monaghan) give birth to their first child. The only option is to rent a car, but with his wallet missing he has to accept to make the journey in the company of Ethan Tremblay (Galifianakis), an aspiring actor with a few problems in the social skills department - in fact, he's the reason Peter got thrown off the plane in the first place.If it all sounds a bit familiar (two mismatched "buddies" traveling together), it's because the movie is essentially a cruder re-thread of Planes, Trains and Automobiles. Problem is, John Hughes's charming comedy had a charismatic leading duo and a sharp script that only occasionally - the "Those aren't pillows!" moment and Steve Martin's memorably filthy rant at the car rental - relied on adult-oriented gags. Due Date, on the other hand, while having no major defects in terms of casting (more on that later), suffers from a lackluster screenplay that makes up for its lack of substance with R-rated jokes galore, most notably with a masturbation gag that invites unwelcome comparisons with one of the most notorious scenes in The Hangover. It also doesn't help that the film's crude spirit is let down by a schmaltzy climax, like most mainstream comedies today.Which leaves us with the actors. Curiously enough, Galifianakis is the least interesting of the lot, in no small measure because he's essentially recycling his Hangover shtick (although the Two and a Half Men joke is a good one, as is his Brando impression). Downey Jr. is more fun to watch, if only because he gets to fully embrace his darker side (you wouldn't see him picking a fight with a kid in the Iron Man movies, would you?) and even make fun of his troublesome past (at one point he quips: "I've never done drugs in my life!"). Monaghan is, predictably, a bit useless, but cameos by Juliette Lewis, Danny McBride and Jamie Foxx add plenty of chuckles along the way.In the end, though, Due Date is arguably the weakest film Phillips has made in quite some time. In fact, for those craving a road movie with R-rated comedy moments, his earlier effort Road Trip is a better option.6,5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Due Date Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can lightening strike twice with director Todd Phillips, director of the highest grossing comedy of all time, "The Hangover"? Phillip's has taken one of the ingredients from that film and thrown it in here. The specific ingredient is Mr. Zach Galafinakis, who absolutely stole "The Hangover" in every scene he was in, which was basically the whole film. What made "The Hangover" work so well was the chemistry between the leads. This is what makes "Due Date" stall a little bit. Sure, the parts where Downey and Galafinakis are conflicting with each other are believable, but the parts where they are supposed to be friends isn't. Galafinakis is basically playing the same role of the weird fat man as he did in "The Hangover", but the character of Downey Jr. is just plain mean spirited and very one dimensional.The film is about Peter Highman (Downey Jr.) who must get back from Los Angles before his wife gives birth to their first child. Everything goes to plan until he meets Ethan Trembly (Galafinakis), who is an aspiring actor who wants to try to make it big in the city of dreams. These two are then kicked off the plane and put on the no fly list during the first of their many conflicts in the film. Both decide to share a rented car and drive to L.A.. From here, everything that could go wrong does.The film definitely has laughs, but it seems there is no passion in the jokes or anything else in the film. The film gets the job done, but with a very passive feeling to it. Another problem is that everything, well outside of Ethan's dog favorite past time, has been done before and way better. "Due Date" offers nothing really new to the table. It takes existing plots points and tries to make them more disgusting.It isn't that I hated the film, it just is very lazy and has absolutely no spark what so ever. Hopefully Phillips phoned this one in and is saving his passion for "The Hangover 2".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you enjoyed Zack's 40 year old weirdo character in "The Hangover", and are looking for a laid back, uncomplicated comedy, this movie is for you!About 20 minutes in, the chief premise of the movie - two mismatched strangers become compelled to travel across the US together - becomes evident. This is where the similarity between "Trains, Planes and Automobiles" starts and finishes. Due Date was always going to be compared to the Martin / Farley classic but it is in no way a rip-off / remake; they are two very different movies.Robert Downey Jr flawlessly plays the straight man who is attempting to race home to his expecting wife. Zack plays his unique character displayed in The Hangover who is irritating, obscene, and highly accident prone.Due Date is not as thoroughly hilarious as The Hangover but is a similar type of comedy and well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is PTA on steroids!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One can't help but remember Planes, Trains, and Automobiles while watching this movie, the story of an uptight architect (Downey) and a lovable loser wannabe actor (Galifanakis) forced by circumstances to make an automobile trip across country together, with the goal of making it to LA by the time Downey's character's wife gives birth on her "due date".As much as I loved PTA some twenty odd years ago, this is like the next step -- putting PTA on steroids and escalating the comedy and stunts to a new level. I seldom laugh out loud at movies but the two leads play their characters so well, in a variety of situations, that it is laugh out loud funny throughout. It also contains some of the pathos of PTA as the characters gradually get to know each other behind their equal masks to the world.The end is heart-warming but not sappy, and ends up tying things together in a great trip and adventure for the viewer, and leaving the viewer with a feel-good sensation when all is said and done.I also seldom do this, as I am a cynic by nature, but I highly recommend this movie--it is a great experience!</fullReview>

We laughed a lot, squirmed due to over-the-top action, laughed some more but recognized that this is a dirtier version of "Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles." Road trips with opposite personalities are pretty much the same -- this one is just crazier and pushes the decency envelope a bit. I'm not a prude but even I was a little uncomfortable over a "spanking the monkey" bit. It is a fun, forgettable, not-too-long film -- just don't go with your parents, kids (who should NOT attend this movie) or coworkers.

		<fullReview>In short, this movie is garbage.I love Robert Jr, but he lacked so much in this film. I don't know whether it was his acting, his role, the script, the directing, or whatever, but all I know is that I wasn't pleased by him for whatever reason.If that's not bad enough, Zach Galifianakis is even 10x worse. The very limited times I actually smirked in this movie was merely due to how hard others in the cinema were laughing, most of them 15 years old or so. Maybe they were high, maybe their sense of humour is different, maybe it's an age thing (but I'm sure other "older" groups have enjoyed this movie too) but I was definitely not as pleased as other people in the cinema.The jokes are not funny! The character Zach's plays is dopey, it's supposed to be stupid that's it's funny, but in fact, it's so stupid that it's simply stupid with no comedy. The plot is horrendous. How the plot develops from A to B to C is even worse. I didn't care about the characters, about the jokes, about the movie! In conclusion, this is my opinion of course, this movie is nothing. I walk into a comedy, I want to laugh. Pulp fiction is what I deem "comedy", but not this thing. I won't even call Due Date a movie, it's just a "thing." I don't even know why I'm giving it 4 stars, probably because I have, unfortunately, seen worse "things" than this thing. Nevertheless, this movie is awful! Please avoid if your sense of humour is similar to mine (Coen Brothers are pleasurable).MINOR SPOILERS Oh, one more thing, it's probably a little spoiler, but I don't know how much clearer Robbie Jr wants it to be that Jamie was sleeping with his wife. And even if he wasn't, the connection between them is simply wayyyyyyyyyyyy tooooooooooo close. Seriously, how dumb!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start with, let me apologize. Mostly, I am apologizing because I paid for another movie (The Colored Girl) with the intention of going to see the "funniest movie of 2010" but refusing to pay for hack actors that I am tired of seeing in everything just because they stick around. First, he ruined Iron Man although I enjoyed it because it was my favorite comic book as a child, then, he has the heart to be in a comedy where he plays a white man playing a black man playing a white man playing a moron. Well, I digress and must insist that I am sick and tired of people making 10, 20, 30 million dollars to be just the same old tired buttock actor they always have been. As a review, let just say that this movie had a couple of points of laughter but these were mostly washed out by lack of humor mixed in with a lot of dramatic acting for which I think Zach G. has proved he can be quite an actor. Do not pay to go see this movie as you will walk away a saddened, disappointed person. Downey, I give your movie a great big raspberry, a thumbs down, an F, no star, 0 out of ten and I put you on notice that if I ever see you again, I am going to get my money back. Oops, I never paid. But this is two hours of life I will never get back. And all you studio employees that keep on going onto this site and giving the movie high ratings should be ashamed of yourselves. 7 out of ten? You must be nuts. Here is another problem though, if it is the funniest movie of 2010, how does it get a 7 out of 10? Proof that it not only is not even close to funniest, but also proving that the studio minions are at work giving this film high marks. Downey, just go away for maybe ten to twenty years and I might like you again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Pitch: No planes or trains but some automobiles.The Review: Has Hollywood finally run out of ideas? For anyone around the same age as me, if you were to start describing a film where an odd couple are forced to engage in a road trip together, you'd probably think of Planes, Trains and Automobiles, the John Hughes movie from nearly twenty-five years ago. But this isn't a remake ? or at least, it doesn't claim to be one ? but conceptually it's so similar that the two would happily pass as related. So if we're not to get originality in concept, we could at least hope that execution would see us through.So casting Robert Downey Jr. in the "straight" man role taken by Steve Martin would seem to be a wise choice. Downey Jr.'s star is as high as it's ever been right now, and if anyone can do the sardonic, oppressed narcissism required for such a role and still remain charming it's surely the Iron Man. Or at least, it should be. He's not helped out by a script which requires him to be graphically unpleasant on at least a couple of occasions, and while the moments in isolation are funny they go a very long way to undermining our sympathy for his plight.Zach Galifianakis gets the John Candy role, although at times it feels as if he got a single card with the word "simpleton" on it in place of a script. He's slightly more affable than his co-star, but his rank stupidity begins to grate when it becomes clear that it's the only thing servicing the plot. Actually, that's not quite true; Downey Jr. gets his own share of stupid moments, not least in his jealousy over Jamie Foxx's character that strains credulity more than a little. Michelle Monaghan is in the movie as well, but has so little to actually do that I could have played the role in a wig with a cushion up my jumper, and you might well not have noticed.Director Todd Philips, as well as throwing himself a cameo, keeps the action moving along, and when the script calls for actual action, the set pieces are efficient. It actually works marginally more effectively as a buddy action road movie than it does as a comedy, but it's not really working particularly well on any level. There's parts to enjoy, but there's just as much that will cause you to hope that the next close scrape for our dynamic duo turns out to be fatal, so we can all be put out of our misery. There's precious little feeling of development to cling to, either, more a sense from the characters that they're glad it's all over, and you may share a similar feeling. John Hughes' original remains the benchmark in cross-country curmudgeons for the time being.Why see it at the cinema: Some nice views of the Grand Canyon to be fully appreciated and a few chuckles to share with your fellow audience, but sadly only a few. Although if you ever wanted to see America's highest rated sitcom on the big screen, the bizarre Two And A Half Men cameos will give you that chance.The Score: 5/10</fullReview>

They meet at the Atlanta airport and the adventure begins.Having being denied boarding the flight, the reason for which I won't spoil here, they are forced to take a road trip to LA. Plus there's a dog with Ethan. Peter's already regretting the decision but has no choice. The next couple of days are full of surprises neither of them is ready for.Feeling completely out of place, Peter is harassed by endless questions and embarrassed by outrageously hilarious behavior. He has no idea he will end up from a businessman in Atlanta to a guy with ripped clothes, a broken arm, a gunshot wound with handcuffs two days later.There's never a dull moment in this movie, even though it has a few serious moments. It brings a refreshing feel to the movies this year and will make you laugh as much as, if not more than The Hangover. RDJ as always, is brilliant with the role of the utterly frustrated businessman who would kill Ethan if it was legal to do so. Zach is, well, perfect as the plump wannabe actor who says and does inappropriate things at the most inappropriate times. Get ready for another hilarious adventure from Todd Phillips!

		<fullReview>Many recent comedies lack true satire and rely on banal themes that society keeps paying good money to see. Due Date, although a fairly mainstream film and quite cliché in content, contains whimsical scenes but still fails to go beyond average.This is the story of a soon-to-be-father, Peter Highman(Robert Downey Jr.), and his journey with a peculiar fellow, Ethan(Zach Galifianakis), who has ambitious plans. The adventure begins at an airport in Atlanta, where Peter Highman and Ethan encounter each other in a fender bender. To say the least, they begin their love-hate relationship there and it further escalates continuously throughout the movie. Each character is going through their respective struggles and Due Date emphasizes on putting the two lead actors in horrid situations. It's the capricious behaviour of the Peter-Ethan tandem that lures the viewer, and the main characters' polar opposite personalities fill every scene with action, and that's it. The base of the story is empty and, once again, fails to provide viewers with any thought-provoking material. A strikingly large amount of the content is disconcerting, and it's difficult to relate with any character in this movie since everyone's flaws are revealed and you are trying to separate yourself from them. The movie is built upon the constant opposition of the main characters and is just a generally hard movie to follow since the plot is aimless.Due Date features the odd side of relationships between family and friends, and sneaks in laughs even during the most dire situations. If you're ever in need of a chuckle and enjoy crude humour, you will not be disappointed. This movie, like its numerous counterparts, does lack a solid foundation and is a story that progresses without profound purpose. Due Date is on par with those in its genre because it is purely entertaining and nothing else.</fullReview>

It may not be as funny or have the same heart as Steve Martin and John Candy's comedy classic but Due Date is still funny to watch and it's more extreme and vulgar and it's definitely not a remake.What makes this movie fun is watching Robert Downey Jr. and Zack Galifianakis act as the uptight future father, Peter Highman and the childish and irresponsible aspiring actor, Ethan Tremblay/Chase. As Peter and Ethan make their way to California for the birth of Peter's first child, Ethan keeps screwing up and most of the heat is given to Peter. And even though Ethan drives Peter crazy, in the end he learns to appreciate him. The funniest scene for me was probably the one with Danny McBride and the handicap Western Union employee. There's also some drama in the film and I like the contrast between Peter and Ethan as well. Like it deals with how Ethan is coping with the death of his father while Peter is getting ready to be a father for the birth of his first child. I also think Galifianakis was funnier in this than he was in The Hangover and he showed more emotion at times as well. Again, Due Date may be silly at times and not be as good as Planes, Trains and Automobiles but it's not terrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There are planes and there are automobiles, but where there used to be trains there is now a glut of bodily orientated humour, in what is film with a persistence to flag.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Due Date is a relatively unfunny concept comedy chock full of the sorts of material we've all seen played out before. In its rawest of forms, the film is a tale of binary oppositions being thrust together and forced into attracting rather than often repelling; one character, a hotshot businessman with inherent degrees of professionalism, we come to observe somewhat embrace his goofier, wackier side; his travel partner, a slobby layabout with some questionable ethics as to what constitutes as normal sociological behaviour, we witness come to learn of how to move away from these primitive ways so as to aid him in getting a somewhat prestigious casting call. First and foremost, we do not like the characters as much as we did the leads in something like Martin Brest's 1988 film Midnight Run; nor indeed do we take to them, nor enjoy their interplay, as much as we did Steve Martin and John Candy's in the previous year's Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles. Observe the amount of car wreck/chase sequences in Due Date, then observe just how adequate the scene in the latter of the above examples was in which the two hair-brained leads squirm past two trucks on a freeway, causing sparks and scares a-plenty. It was just the one scene, and it was sharper and funnier than any second of what eventually transpires to be a seven minute highway chase sequence in Due Date involving border patrol police.Robert Downey Jnr. plays an architect named Peter Highman, a man with a loving wife; a great career and a baby on the way. He calls his family home from a plush Atlanta hotel suite, a cut to the other end of the line revealing wife Sarah (Monaghan) in a kitchen we rather like the look of inferring affluency; Peter's due back in a few hours on a flight he's about to catch and is promptly driven to the airport in a luxury sedan, further still reiterating these opulent credentials. At the airport, he will stumble upon Zach Galifianakis' character for the very first time; a man of many stage-names and pseudonyms, but for the most part of this picture, just Ethan Tremblay, whom carries around with him his temperamental pet dog. The director, a certain Todd Phillips, makes a point to shoot Ethan's ugly and somewhat unglamourous arrival through the languid, disgusted gaze belonging to that of Peter: a looking down at the proverbial curb-side trash; this frizzy haired and unshaven composite of all things Peter goes out of his way to avoid crash landing into his world for the briefest of moments that is still too long to bear.Chaos ensues when they board the same flight bound for Los Angeles; Peter to get home, Ethan to make it to that Hollywood casting call so as to hopefully kick-start a new acting career. Several no-go buzzwords later leads to a mix up on the still grounded flight, and after some clumsy post-9/11 American travel policy slants which are oddly revisited and subverted when a Gulf War One veteran beats up one of the leads, the two are placed on a no-fly list and banished from the airport premises, thus forced into taking the trek across the open roads and interstates together in a hired car. We can see what's coming later down the line, but the manner in which Due Date pulls us along to that place doesn't amount to enough to get overly excited about; the film beds down into that easy groove of road movie shenanigans we are neither bothered nor overly enthused by, Due Date subscribing to more of a physicalised branch of comedy to get across its laughs rather than one more inclined toward scripture and dialogue, and it doesn't really work. The film as more fun than we do watching in its counter balancing of Peter's pig-headed, prejudice ridden problem with class with Ethan's more depraved-than-one-would-like behaviour he applies to life; the script persistently toying with this sense of one always being the lesser of two evils whilst keeping a balanced stance on whom of the two its audience should attune themselves toward or veer away from.The crux of the film lies with the anticipation of Peter's change in attitudes in dealing with, or reacting to, those of Ethan's ilk; it is a shift alluded to very early on when he willingly appears to discuss the sensitive issue of his father's 'leaving' at a very early age, but we see through it as a false dawn. His coming around is alluded to, and then dragged back, and then alluded to again, before being dragged back in a to-and-frow manner too inherently unbalanced to be moving; the arc of the character's feelings lacking an even, authentic transition. Since we live in this post-American Pie world of sex jokes and more predominant than-ever stoner comedies, Ethan must come to interact with a drug dealer so that the film may pause for a gag or two on junkies and drug addiction or whatnot. On other occasions, the film will feel inclined to lean toward comedy relying on bodily functions; the likes of which include spitting, vomiting and self-gratification ? and there is even one of those obligatory scenes in which characters ingest what it is they really ought not have done, in what is a persistently unfunny display. During one scene, there is a strange exchange-come-instance of confusion on whom it was that wrote a passage from The Godfather, leading to the invitation of laughs at certain characters and their idiocy. It leads one to wonder if the film's targeted audience will even know the answer themselves amidst all their guffawing ? perhaps the joke's on them, for those whom haven't seen Midnight Run or Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles, it certainly is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peeps, why so serious... its a comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think some of the bad reviews this film has been given are rather unfair considering Due Date is just a comedy. Why are so many reviewers being so serious about the content of this movie. This film is fiction and its a comedy... not to be taken seriously. If you just relax and watch this film without trying to be critical and picky, it is very entertaining and has some good laughs. The acting from the lead parts is very good. Maybe thats why some reviewers do not like this film as the characters are not very likable to begin with and this is portrayed well by the actors. If you compare this movie to other movies and analyse the scenes against how realistic the scenes may be then you will find faults and I guess you have a right to do so. But you could be focusing your analytical and critical skills on other movies that are actually trying to portray a serious movie based on true facts which in turn deserves more scrutiny and attention to detail when being reviewed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of the Hangover and with it of Zack (Alan). So when Due Date hit theaters, i knew the producers are trying to bank of the success of hangover by casting Alan and trying to make money out of the first viewing of this movie. After viewing this movie, my thought remained the same..just that they didn't make a bad movie either! I laughed at many places and some parts were extremely hilarious (btw i never saw any trailers for this movie).The drawbacks - well, for starters, Robert Downey didn't belong in this movie. I felt someone like Ben Stiller or Adam Sandler would've done justice. Then the emotional part towards the end sucked. Then again, directors should understand that there will NEVER be a second hangover (i haven't seen Hangover2 either but i can say that with confidence), so please don't overuse Zack. He is good. Don't make him predictable. Overall i liked the movie. Go watch it for Alan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Due Date is born!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing two other of Todd Philips' films ('Old School' &amp; 'The Hangover'), I was somewhat sceptical as to the outcome of Due Date. The first film I saw from Todd Philips ('Old School'), I didn't rate. The second, however, I felt was fantastic. And so to my final verdict on Due Date...hilarious. Now I'm not saying this film is as good as 'The Hangover', because it's not. However, it is a far superior comedy to 'Old School', and it also heavily features the best thing/actor about 'The Hangover', bar 'Mr Chow'. And that thing/person is Zack Galifianakis. Now this guy is simply superb. His comic timing, his use of irony, his dishevelled look, and his overall pathetic but beloved self is what brings the movie to the forefront of modern day comedy. Downey Jr is also great but it's really Galifianakis' wining diva that makes the film an incredibly moving, funny, and most of all infuriating take on one man's (Downey Jr) journey/sanity being ripped apart by another man's (Galifianakis) incapability to relate to that said man.This film is not too long, well acted, funny and most of all a real great way to spend a Saturday night in. My advice is go watch it now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Takes the mainstream comedy into a new high of inappropriate humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing that crossed my mind was that this was a huge Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles knock-off. We meet the tense, serious expecting father played by Robert Downey jr. and the lonely annoyingly nice-ish wannabe actor played by Zach Galifianakis. What will happen when these two guys gets put in the same car? One thing is certain. Yet another odd couple is ready to take the big screen.Have to say though, I had not expected this. Being from the director of The Hangover, Road Trip and Old School, he wrote the latter two as well, I knew I wasn't exactly getting anything family friendly - but this? Due Date takes the mainstream comedy into a new high of inappropriate humor! Leave aside a lot of awkward touching, Robert Downey Jr. actually punches the air out of a kid and spits on a dog. With rapidly increasing insanity and crudeness all I could do was wonder what would happen to these guys next. It's obviously quite situational, and we get some great cameos from Jamie Foxx, Danny McBride and rapper RZA among others.And my god. The plot enters into insanity. During the last 30 mins or so. I could hardly believe my eyes. I just sat glewed to the screen in utter shock at what could happen in what I had assumed would be a run of the mill comedy. It's a bit exploitative and it breaks quite a few taboos. If you didn't believe that this guy could out craze The Hangover, you were wrong. It gets a bit too silly sometimes, and Galifianakis characters is simply too out of this world - as is the movie - but overall it was a blast. A great job from everyone involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad.....not bad at all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see this film being compared to Planes, Trains, &amp; Automobiles, usually followed by a 1 or 2 star rating....which is totally unfair. Is it strikingly similar to PT&amp;A? Absolutely. But viewed independently it's not a bad film. I love both Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis, so maybe that's why I sort of enjoyed the film. Galifianakis has plenty of adorable lines that are delivered in his one-of-a-kind way that come off as endearingly earnest and entirely clueless at the same time. Maybe it's his skinny jeans or his Capezio shoes, but I have to just look at the man and I start to laugh. While Downey doesn't get the majority of the funny lines, the situations he finds himself in and the chemistry with Galifianakis' character are entertaining enough to keep you watching. And surprisingly there are some genuine heartfelt moments that have you coming to love both these guys just a little bit.So I'm a bit surprised by the harsh ratings. I've seen a ton of comedies that can only dream of being this good. And I'm not saying that's it's great or anywhere near the level of PT&amp;A, but it's more than adequate, and one that I'll likely see again soon. I was pleasantly surprised.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best comedy since The Hangover.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Due Date is a tale about a pair of strangers that meet on an airplane on their way from Atlanta to Los Angeles. Ethan, an aspiring actor with a rather peculiar personality, begins a conversation with a businessman named Peter while waiting for their plane to take off. Somehow the chat leads to the subject of "bombs," which immediately alerts the authorities. Peter is shot with a rubber bullet after being deemed a threat and put on the "no fly" list along with Ethan. Unfortunately for Peter, his wallet -- or so he believes -- is on an airplane flying over Kansas. The only way to get home before his wife's planned C-Section is by hitching a ride with Ethan.The movie really takes off as soon as the pair rolls out of the airport parking lot. It would be too easy to give everything away, so I'm going to keep my description of what happens as "vaguely detailed" as possible.With Ethan clutching the ashes of his recently deceased father, the pair catches themselves in a number of precarious, yet equally hilarious, circumstances. Not only do they get beat up by a paraplegic employee at a Quick Cash station, but they also find themselves in a serious car accident, apprehended by border authorities and baked out of their minds on potent marijuana. And that's just the half of it.However, it's not the physical comedy that I enjoyed as much. The genuine dialogue between the two divergent characters was outstanding. The duo couldn't have been more opposite, yet mixed so well together. Robert Downey. Jr. was spot on in his role as the angry, up-tight, sarcastic cynic while Zach Galfianakis was superb as the innocent, slightly slow eccentric. The conversations they have while doped-up are simply epic. It was also extremely ironic that Downey, Jr. played the role of a character that "had never done a drug" in his life.Point of advice: Before watching Due Date, throw all practicality out the window. This is a wild comedy...not a realistic melodrama. Though there was a few small sections of the film I could have done without, Due Date isn't one constant dirty joke simply waiting for a set up. No, there is a concrete plot line and verisimilitude within the dialogue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny - but not another Hangover :P</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After "The Hangover" this one is a bit less appealing offering from Todd Phillips. It's a comedy where Peter(Robert Downey jr.), an architect, travelling home in Los Angeles meets an eccentric wanna-be actor Ethan(Zach Galifianakis). Things started to go downhill for Peter due to Ethan's actions and he missed his flight, and ultimately had to take a lift from none other than Ethan. From then,the movie revolves around the journey of Peter and Ethan to L.A, where Peter needed to be on time for his wife's delivery. The movie has quite a few funny scenes (the masturbating dog and where also where Ethan did a Marlon Brando) and dialogues but lacks a little story-wise. Both Robert Downey jr and Zach Galifianakis delivers a good performance. Special mention for the scene of Grand Canyon, that is a visual treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The new Hangover?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Due Date" has been hailed as the new "The Hangover". It does share many similarities...Todd Phillips is once again the director, it's about a male bonding experience and Zach Galifianakis once again appears as the "strange" guy. Yes, there is definitely similarities, but it is not the next "The Hangover". Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jr.) is on his way back from Atlanta to Los Angeles to be there for the birth of his first child. Unfortunately, due to a number of unfortunate events, all due to aspiring actor Ethan Tremblay ( Zach Galifianakis), he gets denied boarding on his flight, losing his wallet and having to find his own way across the country back to his wife, Sarah (Michelle Monaghan). With a traveling partner like Ethan, this is going to be no easy journey.Being as "Due Date" does have so many similarities to "The Hangover", one may be forgiven for believing that this is the sequel. It also takes in elements from Todd Phillips other films such as "Old School" and "Road Trip". Therefore, the making of this film would have almost been a walk in the park for Phillips', it's not like it is something he hasn't done before. So all up, he does direct the film well. He certainly knows what he is doing when it comes to editing, camera angle choices and casting for this film. Even though "Due Date" isn't as funny as his last film, it would be unfair to say that the film isn't funny at all. There is some clever dialogue and clever verbal jokes, although they are not the most original jokes. For example, one can always see where a tin of someone's ashes in a comedy is going. The humor won't be to everyone's liking, but if you have enjoyed Phillips' in the past you will enjoy this film. The direction where the film is going is also very predictable, no guessing is really needed for the end. As they say though, it's the journey that matters, not the destination.Zach Galifianakis plays exactly the same role as he played of Alan in "The Hangover", there is just more of him. Some of his antics are quite funny, but others are again just predictable and after time can just get quite annoying. There is no doubt that Galifianakis can play other roles as we did see him do in "Up In The Air", this just seems to be familiar and safe territory for him. He doesn't do the role badly at all, and he serves his purpose as the painful travel partner well. On the other hand, Robert Downey Jr. is great and so likable in this role. He plays the role of Peter with so much ease and is completely natural and believable. It is so easy to forget that he is acting and he keeps the film grounded. To Phillips' credit, he did definitely pick the two perfect people for the lead roles for this film."Due Date" is predictable and not the funniest film you will see this year, but it does it's job. It gives the audience a few laughs and keeps the entertained. Perhaps next time Todd Phillips will step outside his comfort zone and bring something different to the table. With "The Hangover Part II" in production as we speak, we can't expect anything different from him for awhile. Can he make any films other than those male bonding road trip films which he is so good at at this point in his career? We are yet to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Due Date gets a three and a half star rating out of five</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fun, rolling, laugh-out-loud, comedy about an odd couple who are both trying to get from Atlanta to Los Angeles, the one in five days to be there for the birth of his child, and by pure coincidence end up being forced to travel together and running into some "speed bumps" along the way, Due Date is a modernized adaptation of "Planes, Trains, and Automobiles." Directed by Todd Phillips, who brought us such "classic" titles as "Old School," and last years smash hit, "The Hangover," Due Date soars. Downey Jr's dry but droll wit complements Zach Galifianakis' pure absurdity. It is nice to see Galifianakis finally getting his due. I am sure we will see much more of him and his ridiculousness in years to come. Perhaps, Galifianakis owes a debt of gratitude to Phillips for giving Zach the role in, "The Hangover," causing him to explode onto everybody's radar. It is the age of absurd in comedy and ironically Zach Galifianakis is the Brando of absurd. Not to mention, several priceless cameos help the film achieve even more comedic merit. In purely, Hitchcokian style Phillips again provides a bit of acting as he usually does. "Due Date," provides line after line and scene after scene of hilarity, but still manages to touch hearts. Three and a half star rating out of five stars. Written by Dave Shafer</fullReview>

To be honest, I'm not surprised there are no Jewish people in this film as I have a deep rooted belief that Robert Downey Jr is a Nazi and harbours anti-sematic ideologies.

		<shortDescription>Exactly what I expected: another vulnerable comedy circling around the clash of "the douche" and "the loser"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Todd Phillips, the creator of "Old School" and "The Hangover" thought he could pull another "classic" by casting the Hollywood's Playboy at this moment, Robert Downey Jr. and the hilarious comedian Zach Galifianakis. Great cast but not that great story. The typical "glam meets nerd" has been done tens of times before and I really though this approach would be different but it just didn't worked that well. I'm not suggesting that this movie is not funny, on the contrary, it had some nice jokes and physical gestures that were hilarious in the first stage but then everything just became dull, pointless and usual. The story didn't deliver much, the characters didn't deliver and because of that the audience didn't respond with anything else besides "hatred" towards the douche who spit the dog's face and "sympathy" towards the loser who just lost his father... Another thing that didn't worked and I thought was too much of a cliché was the involvement of sensitive scenes which always makes the audience to go silent after a "haha" like they feel wrong about laughing or something. The jokes were good but you had many moments when things became cheesy and you would laugh more because of the hysteric chick, two rows behind me. Put it this way: don't even try to compare/expect this to (be) Hangover because you'll be disappointed. It's good times at the cinema but nothing more.The cast was good, even though the characters didn't had much to do since their development is almost non-existent but still, Robert Downey Jr. made me hate him at times, acting "the douche" persona, which was similar to his Iron Man impersonation in "Iron Man 2" and Zach Galifianakis who played the same, the only, the irreplaceable "Fat Jesus". I wonder if Zach will build his career further acting the same guy over and over again because I must notice that there will be a time, and that could be sooner than we think, when people will get bored by the same interpretation.I also noticed a step behind in the cinematography, music and editing since The Hangover. In Hangover everything was perfectly made while this looked really rushed like "yeah, let it that way just let's get over with it". With all these, I enjoyed this movie, had some laughs but mostly I was just smiling. 10 minutes before the end I looked in the Coca-Cola bottle and there was nothing left, I wished I could drink more... didn't even thought about the movie... all I was thinking of was... "I need to get more god damn Coke!...".</fullReview>

This is a comedy of misunderstanding. The best scene happens early, when Peter and an airport security agent (RZA, hip-hop's drollest comedian) squabble over what a terrorist seems like. The movie keeps finding ways to tweak misperceptions about race, class, patriotism, and paternity, always at Peter's expense. Why couldn't those same misapprehensions be turned on Peter and Ethan's relationship?In the opening minutes at the airport, Peter and Ethan make eye contact. Not just any eye contact but the sort of prolonged stare that Kathleen Turner might have given to William Hurt at some point in "Body Heat.'' It's not arousing, but it's not completely empty, either. Though it could be that the meaning of such an exchange has changed, given how frequently it happens now between ostensibly straight men from "Pineapple Express'' to almost anything with Paul Rudd, the vocabulary has certainly not. It signifies attraction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny at times, but been done before</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Due Date, Robert Downey, Jr., and Zach Galifianakis play the typical odd couple in this vulgarized take on the road trip movie. Galifianakis' character accidentally lands Downey onto the no-fly list, and Downey's wife is going to have a C-section in five days, so the two must travel cross country together to get Downey home for his baby's birth. Fairly standard scenario, Downey is the straight man, and Galifianakis is the guy who no matter what he does, his crazy antics will always wreak havoc upon Downey in one way or another, and these gags just feel tried and done before. For example, Downey has an African American friend in Jamie Foxx, and of course they play the usual gag where Downey walks into the delivery room and sees an African American baby on the table to only find out that he went to the wrong room, and this sort of sums up how the whole movie is. It is a movie that seems more interested in these kind of one note gags than any hint of a real story with emotional heft. While a few of the gags are funny, most of them, like the above mentioned gag, are been there, laughed at that before. While these gags can still make you laugh, how many times can we laugh at the same thing, and when it's surrounded by a standard, cliché story that is light on any real consequence or conflict, you wind up with Due Date.I give Due Date a 5 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie gets its act together in the third act</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A comedy road trip movie only needs four things: funny gags and lines, an interesting story, enjoyable characters and committed comedic actors. Mix all of these together and you'll get films like; National Lampoon's Vacation, Dumb and Dumber and the Blues Brothers. The director of the "Due Date" is Todd Phillips, who directed "The Hangover", what he did right with that film is the consistency funny jokes that were coherent with the story. Despite the great performances by Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis as well as direction of the jokes they still turn out flat and pointless during the first and second half of the movie. The move was redeemed when the third act had killer antics firing back and forth. The synopsis of "Due Date", is Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man), playing architect Peter Highman, who is in Alabama for business. The film starts the day he is leaving to see his pregnant wife, played by Michelle Monaghan (Eagle Eye). When he arrives at the airport he bumps into Ethan Trembley, played by Zack Galifianakis (The Hangover), who is basically a man-child with aspirations to be an actor. After their encounter, which was less than great, they meet again on the same plane and after a conversation involving the words "bomb" and "terrorist", they both get kicked off the plan and there forth Peter finds out that he is now on the "no fly list". Instead of paying for a rental car or having his wife wire him money, he hitches a ride with Ethan, because consequently Peter lost his wallet and ID on the plane. This starts the crazy and shenanigan filled road trip to reach his wife in time to see his baby born. Two of the best things that "Due Date" delivers are the performances of the head roles and the cameos that were fun to watch. Anyone who is a fan of Robert Downey Jr., like me, knows that he always brings his "A" game. He did a great job in "Iron Man", " The Soloist" and "Tropic Thunder", which earned him an Oscar nomination. As I was watching Downey Jr. loose his complete mind riding with this moron I was totally convinced some of the things that Ethan does like falling asleep and driving off a bridge and miraculously surviving, shooting Peter in the leg with a pistol and bugging him with annoying questions helps draw the audience into the charade. I'm really starting to get into Zach Galifianakis. After seeing "The Hangover" I thought he was hysterical and here he plays a character that says dumb and illogical things while not realizing it. That is where Zach flushes out his gags because he says them with such confidence that you want to slap him across the face, true evidence of a convincing character. I always enjoyed seeing my favorite celebrities as cameos in movies. I get a sudden jolt of giddiness for some reason for a couple minutes. This movie had a whole mixture of celebrities; Jamie Foxx, Danny McBride (Tropic Thunder), RZA the rapper, Keegan Michael Key (Mad TV) and Charlie Sheen. The two main problems that I saw in "Due Date" was the jokes in the first two acts and how a number of fell flat for me. I also didn't like how the director, Todd Phillips, made Robert out to be to much of an a?hole. The jokes in the first half of the movie left me staring quietly and only a few chuckles. The editing showed that a joke was a dud with the quick cuts that happened constantly. The third act was the gem of the film with every line and sight gag was hysterical. Realistically if a guy were to be stuck with Galifiankis's character for about two or three days, I'm sure he would start to become a jerk. Phillips took this direction to far and at the end of the second half I wasn't really liking Peter and if I should root for him to reach his wife. Near the end, that character trait lightened up and I was able to enjoy Peter's character more. This movie isn't the perfect road trip comedy, but I did have a really fun time and in the end enjoyed it. The jokes and the performances will make you like the film. I give "Due Date" a total of three out of four popcorn bags.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad but it could've been a much better movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hangover is an absolute classic and I must say anyone who reads this could possibly agree, however the maker of The Hangover has made a comedy called "Due Date" which is not as funny.We have Peter Highman an architect who wants to witness the birth of his first child and then after being kicked off the flight to Los Angeles we have someone he barely knows asking if he wants a ride to LA.Now there are some good points this is one of the few comedies out in cinemas (it's in cinemas in Australia but maybe past that in other countries) the other one which I would recommend to you more is Wild Target. But this isn't as bad as The Other Guys because the movie evolved from one guy screaming to the other guy.It turns out Zach Galifianakis' character had Robert Downey Jr's wallet the whole time so he could've made the trip alone. Also one weird question what happened to Jamie Foxx's character he just shows up then leaves inconspicuously.In The end Peter arrives in time for his child's birth and Ethan gets what he wants and becomes an actor on his favourite show Two and a Half Men so it's an "everybody wins" scenario... besides Peter being shot, having a broken arm, blood loss, having to go across the country with some annoying guy who had his wallet the whole time and never being on the good side of things beforehand... yep that sums the movie up and the next movie is?...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of the best jokes are in the trailers. If Robert Doeney Jr. doesn't want to spend time with Zach Galifianakis why do you? Both play unlikeable characters. Spit on a dog? Actually Galifianakis performance is the highlight of this road romp. His performance might be recognized at award season.For a relatively short movie, it begins to feel long and drags at times.There is a major tone problem. Pardon the spoiler but it spoils the mood. Perhaps it is funny when Downey is shot by the Air Marshall with a "rubber bullet" to keep it light. There is nothing funny later when he is actually shot and nearly bleeds to death.There is a distracting use of music.The movie is adequate entertainment at bargain matinée prices. The ending was a fun pleasant surprise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as classic as 'PLANES, TRAINS &amp; AUTOMOBILES' but a good buddy comedy film in it's own right.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'DUE DATE': Four Stars (Out of Five) Sort of a modern variation on the John Hughes classic 'PLANES, TRAINS &amp; AUTOMOBILES'. This one is directed by Todd Phillips (known for directing a few comedy classics of his own including 'ROAD TRIP', 'OLD SCHOOL' and 'THE HANGOVER') and written by Phillips, Alan R. Cohen, Alan Freedland and Adam Sztykiel. It stars Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis (who Phillips gave his big break to in 'THE HANGOVER'). The film also features two past Downey Jr. co-stars in supporting roles: Michelle Monaghan (who also starred as Robert's love interest in 'KISS KISS BANG BANG') and Jamie Foxx (who recently took a dramatic turn next to Robert in 'THE SOLOIST').In the film Downey plays Peter Highman an architect eager to get home to Los Angeles in time for the birth of his first child in five days. Upon arrival at the airport he meets an odd unemployed actor named Ethan Tremblay (Galifianakis), Their bags are mistakenly exchanged and then Tremblay is seated next to Highman on the plane. Due to some crazy destructive events, caused by Tremblay, he and Highman are kicked off the flight and put on the 'no-fly' list. All of Highman's luggage as well as his wallet are left on the plane so with no money or ID he's forced to take a ride offered by Tremblay, who's rented a rental car. Good natured and well intentioned but still a Tasmanian force of destruction Tremblay turns Highman's trip home into a treacherous disaster ride from Hell.The movie is pretty much exactly what you'd expect and exactly what the previews sell it as. Phillips directing is top notch, the screenplay is witty and Downey Jr. and Galifianakis are hilarious. Of course the most important ingredient in a buddy comedy is the talent and chemistry of the two leading men (or women, or one of each) and in this case that ingredient is very strong and effective. They make the movie totally worth watching; the way they play off and react to each other is perfect. The movie is touching and at times surprisingly dramatic but it's a little too over the top to take too serious for any length of time. It's a screwball buddy comedy and a good one at that. Not as classic as 'PLANES, TRAINS &amp; AUTOMOBILES', which seems like it could be endlessly compared to, but it's a good comedy film in it's own right (not nearly as classic as 'THE HANGOVER' either but they can't all be five star classics). Still a good buddy comedy film worth seeing.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j95Zjdlcbe0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unoriginal Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Due Date that Rove interviewed for yesterday looks just like the movie Planes, Trains and Automobiles where Robert Downey Jr is Steve Martin and Zach Galifianakis is John Candy which Downey's character hates. The only discernible difference is that they are are trying to get across country in time to a pregnant woman instead of for a thanksgiving dinner. Which just happens to be around the corner. Does Hollywood ever come up with an original idea or does it always like to cannibalize itself? An increasing number of American movies are ether remakes of European films or totally unnecessarily added sequel/prequels to already established classics. That in the end only exist as a money making exercise and not to tell a great stories which in turn ruins the entire movie franchise. (eg: All three Star War prequels, Indiana Jones and the crystal skull and all Die hard films except the original.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's what you expect it to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, Todd Phillips' follow up to the highly successful 'The Hangover' was released this Friday. What do i think about it? Well, sir, i'll get to that soon, but first i would like to say @#!&amp; YOU to all the people who keep comparing this film to other movies. Seriously, just because Trains, planes, and automobiles has almost the same plot, doesn't mean it's trying to copy it... And stop comparing this to The Hangover, this isn't a competition. Anyways...Due Date, this movie is about Peter(Robert Downy Jr.), who is on a business trip in Atlanta, while his wife is pregnant and expecting a Planned C-Section in a few days. So obviously something is going to go wrong, and of course it does, starting when he arrives at the airport. Almost immediately his door gets knocked off by another car, and who's inside this said vehicle? Ethan Tremblay(Zach Galifianakis), an aspiring actor who is also going on a trip to California for an interview. Ethan is your eccentric 'Idiot' to your traditional Straight guy &amp; Moron pair. These two characters end up having to drive from Atlanta to California together, and why is that? Because, ironically, after the car door incident, Peter and Ethan get pared up on the same flight right next to each other. After the Pilot tells everyone to turn off all electronic devices, Ethan notice's Peter resides from the request and explains to him why they ask people to turn off their cell phones, all while saying the words BOMB and TERRORIST repeatedly, this gets the flight attendants suspicious, so they call the air marshal, and escort them both off the plane. This puts them both on the no fly list, and Peter is without his luggage and wallet, meaning he cant rent a car to drive himself. So he hitches a ride with Ethan, the man-child.Now, you're thinking "But why doesn't he just catch a greyhound bus, or stay at the airport and get his wife to wire him cash.", well, i don't know why he doesn't catch a bus, and he cant get his wife to wire him cash because his wallet and I.D. is gone. But that is a good question, and if i had thought about it while i was trying to enjoy the movie, i probably wouldn't have had a good time, so i recommend that you don't try to look for every single flaw, in fact you shouldn't do that with any movie, unless it's absolutely horrendous like "Takers" or something. This isn't the only real noticeable flaw in the movie though, there are a few ones that stand out. Like the part where Ethan steals a Truck and crashes into a police car causing it to flip it over several times, because the police would have been all over them throughout the journey. But i really didn't mind any of that, because it IS a comedy, and comedies tend to have stupid stuff like that. It's meant to make your laugh, and it succeeds doing so. I don't think the story is the most original or the most well written story of all time, i just know i liked the movie a lot and it deserves a little revenue. It's no Hangover, but it sure does the job, and by the way... The Hangover 2 is being filmed right now.There are also a few scenes in the movie where it attempts to add a dramatic effect, which kind of works in the beginning but starts to be a little overdone towards the end. The scene where Peter asks Ethan to act out a scene and begins to cry was actually not bad. Compared to the terrible dramatic placement in the original script, it's a huge improvement.Overall, this movie is just what it promised to be, a movie that makes you laugh, and gives you that feel good feeling when you leave the theater. You won't have this feeling if you go in with a Critic's mind set, but if you be a little more vulnerable and just convince yourself that this isn't supposed to be a masterpiece, you will like this movie. This is no Hangover, so don't run into the theater and expect a mystery, or an original story, or something that will make your head explode, else you'll be disappointed. Good film, definitely worth the full price.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh My God! I have never enjoyed a movie so much like I did today, at least in 2010. Unlike a child in The Hangover, Zach Galifianakis has a new 'gadget' in this movie, Sunny, a well 'trained' dog.Fate has Peter Highman(Robert Downey Jr.) travel with John Chase(Zach Galifianakis) a.k.a Ethan Tremblay to L.A to make it to his child's birth on time. Will he make it? Yes. How ? Well, go watch the movie for that. Zach Galifianakis and Robert Downey Jr. will give you a century minutes of laughter and entertainment.It is festival season here in India. As expected, tickets for all the newly released Indian movies were sold off in advance. After a lot of deliberation, me and couple of my friends decided to watch this movie hoping it to be at least a decent entertainer. And, as it turned out, sometimes unplanned things bring more joy than planned things do!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another fun comedy from Todd Phillips</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Todd Phillips has proved that he is one of the best comedy directors out there today with films like The Hangover, Starsky &amp; Hutch, and Old School. Phillips proves it again here with Due Date.Robert Downey Jr. stars as Peter Highman, an architect from Los Angeles who was on a business trip in Atlanta. He has to get back to Los Angeles by Friday to be in time for the birth of his first child. Downey has proved himself to be a comic thespian with films like Tropic Thunder and proves his comedic talent here. Downey plays Peter as a guy full of emotions as he knows his objective of getting to Los Angeles is important. Downey does an excellent job of making Peter a well-rounded character.Phillips brings back his Hangover player Zach Galifianakis to co-star with Downey as Ethan Trembley, an aspiring actor from Atlanta determined to make it to Hollywood. Ethan's biggest objective to be on his favorite television show, Two and a Half Men. Galifianakis does an excellent job as Downey's travelling counterpart. He is given the best lines in the film and proves that he can do more than be Alan in The Hangover. Zach makes Ethan into a well-rounded character that makes you like him.There are also some great supporting players in the film. Danny McBride has an excellent scene where he works at a cash-wire building. McBride is hilarious when he reveals that he is a war veteran and takes out both Peter and Ethan. Jamie Foxx also has a good short part as an old friend of Peter's who gets him out of the hospital, and helps him treat Ethan like another human being. Foxx does a fine job, but is not given a whole lot to do. Juliette Lewis has a short part as a drug dealer for Ethan who ends up taking a lot of money from him. Lewis, like Foxx, does some okay work, but is not given much to work with. Michelle Monaghan also has some great parts as Peter's pregnant wife. Monaghan does excellent with the short amount of screen time she has.The writing is brilliant as Phillips and his co-writers do some great work focusing on building a relationship between Peter and Ethan. They also do some great work in the situations that Peter and Ethan get into.This movie is a lot of fun. I found it to be a great combination of writing, Phillips's direction, and the performances, especially from the leads in Downey and Galifianakis. They show that they have some excellent chemistry together and make a funny duo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Half-Baked!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Todd Phillips 'Due Date' is half-baked, that has 2 ace actors behaving to be as it's cornerstones. This comedy-road film, suffers from weak writing! 'Due Date' tells the story of a would-be-father, played by Academy-Award-Nominee Robert Downey, Jr. and an aspiring actor played by Zach Galifianakis. How these 2 extreme guys join each-other on a trip, they'll never forget!'Due Date' begins with a bang! The first 40-minutes are super, but, as soon as Jamie Foxx enters the scene, and there after, the film loses paces and ends up as a drag. The jokes seems forced, even though both of the actors are energetic in each frame! One expected more from Todd Phillips. He's made a decent film, but, I expected it to be a Laughton. The Screenplay gets bumpy after a while. Cinematography is fine.As mentioned, 'Due Date' rests on the shoulders of ace actors, Robert Downey, Jr. and Zach Galifianakis. Downey as a highly strung expectant father is flawless, while Galifianakis is brilliant as an aspiring actor. They have clearly over-powered the entire film with their performances.On the whole, this one surely comes up as a weekend laugh, but sadly, not of all-time. Watch it for the Performances of it's Strong Lead Stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who doesn't love a good road trip movie? Todd Phillips, the director of Road Trip, returns to the genre with a dream pairing of Robert Downey, Jr. and Zach Galifianakis. Both are considered some of the funniest actors in Hollywood today. It is mostly thanks to its leading men that the viewer keeps up with the story. The crazy hijinks of the film are usually not particularly funny and sometimes outright annoying. Not to mention obvious at certain points. For instance, who among the audience doesn't get what is going to happen to a coffee jar full of a dead man's ashes the minute the topic is discussed? A couple of rewrites should've worked wonders. Particularly Galifianakis's character is close to being so utterly, life-threateningly moronic that it's nearly impossible to like him. The actor saves what he can, but is still not my favorite comic sidekick. Downey Jr.'s character's rage towards him is meant to show the character to have some anger issues, even though he's acting mostly pretty reasonable given the circumstances. Towards the end the hijinks get so crazy, this overplayed comedy works better. Actually Due Date is one of those comedies like Knocked Up that's about the main character growing up and adapting to boring mediocre family life. At the beginning RDJ is shown to not get along with children and even though his methods of handling a problem child are hilarious, they are hardly good parental advices. But during the road-trip with a huge man-child he learns to suppress his anger towards simpler people and thus is allowed to enter the family life. How sweet, but the film is no match for The Hangover. ** / *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way better than overrated "The Hangover"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truthfully I wasn't expecting too much from this movie.Based on an early reviews, which gave it clearly bad vibe it was suppose to be mediocre at best, but I was hoping that it could deliver at least few laughs here and there. As it turned out, it is one of the better comedies of 2010 in my honest opinion. Pairing Downey Jr. with Galifianakis was very good idea for a road trip movie plot, and Due Date holds on for all of its 100 minutes thanks to various really funny(sometimes touching) exchanges between two leads. Also we have got cameos of few famous stars(among others: jamie foxx, juliette lewis)which always helps to enrich the story. It is not entirely perfect comedy, there are some weird, and not necessarily funny parts, but those are automatically recompensated, and thankfully outnumbered by those that work just fine. Some critics made complaints about characters not being well written enough, as we don't know great deal about them when the movie ends.I say, this is comedy, not a Thelma &amp; Louise type of road movie movie.It's not a character study, it's humor is based strictly on the dynamics between main players. I almost forgot to mention that DD is very well shot, and some moments really make you appreciate some of the landscape US can offer.So to sum it up, it is probably my favorite comedy of the year, and although I thought that The Hangover was good(but not "most grossing R rated comedy in history" good), I hope that there will be people who will also find Due Date more pleasant treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hangover 1.5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is essentially what the Hangover would be if it hit the road. Put Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis in a car and hope that hilarity ensues. And it does. The two play off each other very well, and embrace the mean spirited, but ultimately heartwarming relationship that forms between them. The movie is very much about Downey and Galifianakis. It's not like the Hangover where there were tons of cameos and side characters to sustain the laughs; it almost all comes from the two guys. Galifianakis gets to be a bit much. He's better in a trio than as one half of a duo. But when he gets to be too much, Robert Downey Jr. effectively responds, acting out the audience's frustration with very gratifying results. It's not the Hangover, but nothing ever will be. Due Date is funny in it's own way. The humor is a little darker thanks to a hilarious Robert Downey Jr., but director Todd Phillips still has fun sucker punching the audience with his signature brand of situational humor. Ultimately, this movie is very, very funny. It's been a few years since we've had a really good road trip movie. Sitting shotgun with these two guys is a fun way to spend an hour and a half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unfortunate all-around disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After being forcibly removed and banned from flying home, Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jr.) needs to find a new way to make it to Los Angeles in time for the birth of his first child. Enter aspiring actor Ethan Tremblay (Zack Galifianakis), who unwittingly helped cause Peter's removal, and was also taken off the flight. Ethan is driving to L.A. to start his acting career, and invites Peter along for the ride. After a bit of hesitation, Peter decides to go on the road trip, and as you can expect, just about everything seems to be holding Peter back from his ultimate goal.After the wild success of The Hangover last year, it was clear anything Todd Phillips decided to make was going to be met with some skepticism and obvious need for comparison. I will get past that question first ? Due Date is not, and likely was never meant to be, anywhere near as funny or enjoyable an experience as The Hangover. The latter was a film that was great the first time, and gets better every time I watch it. Unfortunately, even without trying to compare it, Due Date suffers from being a disappointing movie no matter what way you look at it.While the trailers may suggest a downright hilarious comic mismatch of Downey Jr. and Galifianakis is in order for audiences, that does not seem to be the case with the final film. The scenes from the trailer are just as funny as you remember them, yet the stuff that was left out is not nearly as good. But this is not a mere case of the studio swapping in all the best scenes for the trailer to hide the fact that the movie is horrible. No, this is more of an unfortunate case of a movie playing with scenes that probably initially read funny, but came off as terribly unfunny. I smirked throughout the movie, but there just seems to have been a disconnect between script and final film that holds the movie back from its aspirations of being a hysterical comedy. Even having a partial homage-like feel to the great Planes, Trains and Automobiles is not enough to make this movie any funnier.Another point of contention is just how mean the film is. There are more than a handful of below the belt, meanspirited jokes sprinkled throughout Due Date, but only a few of them actually work as they were intended. The rest simply miss the mark, and flop on entry. I laughed out loud during a particularly disturbing joke involving Downey Jr.'s character babysitting two young children, but even that seemed like a bit much on further reflection. The lighthearted idea that drives the film seems to be at odds with jokes that cannot seem to find any reason to stick and actually be funny, and these elements are never rectified by the time the film ends.Even worse is that, rather surprisingly, neither of the leads is especially likable.The charm and unmistakable charisma Downey Jr. has been displaying since Kiss Kiss Bang Bang seems to have totally evaporated here. He has his motivation and goal set from the beginning to get to L.A. in time to see the birth, but about halfway through the movie, I just stopped caring whether he made it or not. The writing seems to have stripped away any reason to want to see him succeed, and succeeds instead at making Downey Jr. come off as a scummy, sniveling whiner. Giving him a ridiculous drug hallucination sequence is only the beginning of some of the more silly elements the film forces on him. He is a better actor than this, and despite trying desperately, even he cannot seem to break through and really make something of his character. Does that not suggest anything from the start? Galifianakis fares a touch better, but not by much. He gets to deliver a bit of range, especially in jokes revolving around his character's ability to "act". But he is still being relegated to the role of crazy outsider who does and says really wacky things, specifically to elicit laughs from the audience, and continue being cast in the now stereotypical Zack Galifianakis-designated roles. Except, in the meanspiritedness of the script and film as a whole, these wacky things border a bit too much on the absurd. A specific scene involving something Ethan does to fall asleep (that his dog somehow has the ability to repeat) comes to mind, and I am unsure if it was a genuine wacky Galifianakis moment, or just something the writers threw in because they felt it was right up his alley. Either way, it comes off pretty inane and silly, and drags the film down even further into the murky depths of badness.As a Phillips film however, Due Date does stand out for how elaborate it is. It looks and feels much more physical and demanding than the rest of his films have been (Starsky and Hutch notwithstanding). It looked like a lot of work went more into the behind the scenes filming than it did the script or storyline of the film. But his transitioning and development as a director should not nearly have hindered this movie into the sheer oblivion it keeps hitting at constant intervals.Due Date made for an interesting idea and a great trailer, but an incredibly disappointing film. It has quite a few funny moments, but just not enough to make the film feel worthwhile. In the end, it seems to be more of a stepping point for developing ideas, jokes and methods for filming The Hangover Part 2 than it is an actual cohesive final individual product. Phillips, Downey Jr. and Galifianakis have made and continue to make much better films. This one is far from it.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outrageous and hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last year, Todd Phillips brought us The Hangover. Along with its massive success, it helped turn its three lead actors into even bigger stars. Included in that line up was Zach Galifianakis, stand-up comedian turned actor who now seems to be Phillips go to guy. So how could Galifianakis possibly top being in the highest grossing R-rated comedy of all time? He teams up with the man who became known for his portrayal of Tony Stark in Iron Man and Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes, Robert Downey Jr, for the most outrageous comedy of 2010.Seeing Robert Downey Jr in a film like this after his career exploded from doing Iron Man seems more outstanding than it really is. Or maybe it's just the mere thought of seeing the lead actor from some of the past few years biggest blockbusters in an R-rated comedy that features his character get high and be extremely ill tempered throughout its duration is entertaining in itself and strangely liberating. There isn't source material to follow that if strayed too far away from could cause fans to go into an uproar. Due Date is an original film and it just seems like doing comedy after two superhero films and a film based on the world's most infamous fictional detective would be creative freedom of sorts.There was some concern that Zach Galifianakis' character in Due Date would be too similar to his character in The Hangover to really deliver a lot of laughs or be distinguishable in comparison. Truth be told, both characters are extremely similar but it works so well. Galifianakis is so funny, it hurts. Ethan Tremblay's ignorance is really what makes the film so incredibly ridiculous, over the top, and just downright hysterical. The blossoming friendship between Peter and Ethan is where the heart of the film truly lies though. The chemistry between both RDJ and Galifianakis is what makes so many scenes in the film so great. Watching Peter be in agony over having to deal with Ethan and his eccentric ways is pure comedy gold.An interesting note about the film is that nearly every scene from the trailer is in the film. With all the alternate takes and deleted scenes that get shuffled around these days before a film gets released in theaters, that's saying a lot. It does make you wonder what sort of extras will be on the DVD and BD versions of the film though. One scene comes to mind that wasn't in the film, but that's it. Everything else that you've probably memorized ("You better check yourself before you wreck yourself.") is in there.A few scenes to be on the lookout for, Peter has a certain way of dealing with the kids of a local drug dealer named Heidi (played by Juliette Lewis) that is sure to get an outstanding reaction from a packed theater. Also, the film puts an awkward yet priceless spin on the simple act of masturbating . There are so many gloriously preposterous things that transpire in the film that it should give you plenty of material to talk about with friends for days.It's safe to consider Due Date as this year's The Hangover and that should definitely be taken as a compliment. It's the same director and one third of the main cast, but Due Date manages to set the bar for ludicrous acts achieved in film. Zach Galifianakis will provide most of the laughs, but it's the chemistry between both him and Robert Downey Jr that makes the comedy feel a bit more genuine than other comedies out there.

		<shortDescription>A Match Made In Heaven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout the past decade Director Todd Phillips has created a name for himself by shaping the buddy comedy genre starting in 2000 with the release of "Road Trip." The films "Old School" (2003), "Starsky and Hutch" (2004), and "The Hangover" (2010) followed leading to Phillips's latest comedic creation "Due Date" created by a match made in heaven. Phillips teams up with Zach Galifianakis ("The Hangover", "It's Kind of a Funny Story") along with Hollywood a-list super star Robert Downey Jr. ("Iron Man", "Sherlock Holmes"). Downey plays future father Peter Highman who has been banned from being on an airplane because of an encounter with Galifianakis's character Ethan Tremblay. Peter has no other choice, but to drive cross country from Atlanta, Georgia to Las Angeles, California cross country with Tremblay whose dream is to appear on "Two and a Half Men." Together they embark on a chaotic, hilarious, emotional quest following the basic structure of the buddy comedy genre."Due Date" is not just another buddy comedy. It is a buddy comedy with two actors that many would have never paired them together in a movie, however, the chemistry that Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis have together on screen creates the perfect equation and drives the entire film from start until finish. Downey's serious subtle comedic dialogue is very clever and hilarious, while Galifianakis's boisterous, goofy and childish personality gets in the audience's face and brings the house down. Downey and Galifianakis's relationship clicks and connects with the audiences a lot more than other buddy comedy films and incorporates a deeper vibe concerning the back-stories of both Peter and Ethan allowing their characters to avoid being one-dimensional.Michelle Monaghan does not do a very good job playing Robert Downey Jr.'s wife Sarah Highman. She is very dull in the film and does not work well with Downey at all. Phillips fails to develop her character and portrays her in a very bad light. There are many questions surrounding her and her faithfulness to he husband Peter Highman. There are a couple unnecessary plot twists that seem like they were just thrown into the film and are never fully developed. Jamie Foxx was the subject of one of these twists, but isn't in the film long enough to deserve any praise for his part. He could have been a very important part of the film, but by the end his character's small appearance was very insignificant and did not fit into the overall scheme of things.In the end, the film is about friendship and how friendship is found in the most unlikely of places and weirdest of circumstances. Together these two teach the audience how to have a good time and laugh at the mishaps that happen throughout life. In the words of Ethan Tremblay, "You better check yourself, before you wreck yourself."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are there comedies that don't use shock humor anymore?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How far is too far? Due Date provides a great deal of laughs, but lacks the sustaining enjoyment because the undertone of the movie is paved with a road of discomfort and queasy humor to get there. The scripting was key in this one and the characters did amazingly well with many lines that no doubt made the audience cringe and laugh at the same time. It was as if we were laughing but deep down maybe we felt we shouldn't be. Lots of lines that used shock value for laughs. What brought this about was primarily Zach Galifianakis' crazy antics with his most unusual character.The plot is as follows: Peter Highman (Robert Downey, Jr), successful businessman is on his way to witness the birth of his baby across the country. He becomes entangled with Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis), an "actor" on his way to Hollywood for his shot in the limelight. Through Tremblay's actions, the 2 end up having to carpool across the country together, and of course they are on a timeline (we have the successful duplication of the plot line from Planes, Trains, and Automobiles).The relationship between the 2 main characters works. On one hand we have Ethan, who says whatever he wants at any time. This guy doesn't have a censor button anywhere on him, and his dialogue consists of things that most people wish they could probably share aloud. Downey is confrontational, direct, frustrated, and out of patience. We see the mean-spirited relationship even out when Peter puts Ethan in his place, responding to every idiotic notion that his counterpart has.There wasn't really a dull moment in the movie, and there were a few heartfelt moments as the audience becomes won over and slightly sentimental by the quirkiness and over the top antics covering the deeply buried emotions of Ethan. A large part of the movie is him saying the most inappropriate things at the most inappropriate and inopportune times.So I had to ask myself: does me laughing throughout the movie make it a "good" movie? And I had to answer, that yes for the most part that was true. After all it is a comedy, but the comic moments didn't keep my eye from the main storyline, which I felt was weak. What I am trying to say is that although I laughed, the level of enjoyment I experienced from the movie was not in correlation.One of my favorite scenes had to be Galifianakis' impersonation of Don Corleone from The Godfather</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another super-hit comedy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Todd Phillips, whose The Hangover was such a hit, does another mismatched-males-on-a-trip film, reminiscent of John Hughes' 1987 film Planes, Trains And Automobiles; but he proves that good writing and skilled direction can wring juice out of a dry shell of an ideal.Put one uptight man and one weirdo together on a forced road trip and the result partly very funny, partly gross out and one small part tender ?the idea of grown men realizing what it means to be really grown up. Hollywood calls such movies 'bromances.'Ill-tempered businessman Peter (Robert Downey Jr), is trying to get home in time for the birth of his first child. Due to the antics of the idiotic Ethan (Zach Galifianakis, replicating his Hangover character), both men get thrown out of the plane and put on the blacklist. Peter luggage and wallet are on the plane, so he is forced to share a car from Atlanta to LA with the irritating aspiring actor.The road trip is made exciting and eventful, by the bizarre things that happen on the way, and cameos by stars like Jamie Foxx, Juliette Lewis and the director himself. It's not as hysterically hilarious as The Hangover, but the ingredients are all there, and it's not all witless slapstick either, as many such odd-twosome films tend to be, especially when hinging on a thin wire of a plot. There is an inventiveness to the gags, spirited performances, and in the end, some sympathy created for the two basically 'unlikeable' characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Due Date is a case of premature birth to the big screen. And you won't be faulted for thinking it was made for infants</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zach What? What? With Due Date, you'll no longer have to second guess that last name as the movie firmly establishes him as a comedic star who can stand on his own. Although a household name in the US thanks to his numerous television appearances, Zach Galifianakis is probably lesser known in the East unless you actually took notice of him as the hapless sidekick in The Hangover..Having none of the typified Hollywood leading man's good looks, Galifianakis is the loser that you will either find grating or endearing due to his quirky underdog qualities. So your liking of him depends on whether you find quirks like him strutting around with a broken wrist like a prissy queen amusing.Pair him up with the charismatic Robert Downey Jr and you will think you have a bona fide comedy in your hands. Yes, the two leads are effortlessly funny. And yes, sadly, their acting chops are the only saving graces of this mean-spirited and sometimes imbecilic road adventure that skids off course in the over-the-top third act.The Hangover is still the better movie of Todd Philips. At least that film had a hook to keep you interested in finding out what happened that night when the male buddies were intoxicated. Due Date does not have this hook. And because of that, it isn't as compelling. So what it relies on are the comic antics of Downey Jr and Galifianakis, which they expertly and effortlessly deliver. Here, Downey Jr plays a buttoned-down architect with an upper lip so stiff that Galifianakis' drifter cum actor wannabe character has trouble loosening. And Due Date plays the tension between these polar opposites to over-stretched effect; the movie is mired in scripting pratfalls with dialogue and situations that border on the lame, offensive and incredulous. And this relentlessly mean comedy relishes taking potshots at poor Downey Jr's elitist insouciance that you will come to a point where you wish it will all stop.There is one cringe-worthy scene involving a maimed Iraqi War veteran taking down the two leads because of some insensitive remarks. Its violence is groan-inducing and surreally out of place in a supposed comedy. Worse, that scene is not funny. But it doesn't stop there. Like most of the disposable lowbrow screwball comedies out there, it heavily relies on physical comedy of the scatological ilk. And it cheapens the movie considerably.In the third act, this movie shifts to absurd gear and throws logic out the window. When the duo take on the Mexican custom police in a pseudo-Michael Bay action sequence, you will start to go What The F***. It's all downhill from there. And whatever sweetness coaxed from the first two acts are quickly forgotten.With Due Date, it's great to see two class act comedians giving their all. But you will shake your head at the missed opportunities here. What could have turned out to be a bittersweet buddy comedy gets lost in absurd hokum, boisterous action scenes and excruciating physical torture.- www.moviexclusive.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film that seems to be cruelly reviewed by some...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first i was a little hesitant about going to see this film. I guess i was a little worried that, as with so many other comedys (Grownups to name but one), all the best bits were used in the adverts/trailers for this film. I was wrong and boy am i glad i went to see this movie.For me, its one of the funniest films i'd seen for a while with plenty of laugh out (and in some cases very loudly) moments. The story, and thus the film, flows from start to end with very little in the way of 'boring bits'. Downey Jnr was excellent throughout, as always it seems these days. Although my one negative was that the end was very and quite typically American in that 'everything works out' kind of way, but even that is a tiny moan on an otherwise very entertaining film.Why so many people are comparing this to Trains, Planes &amp; Automobiles... which by the way is one of my favourite films... i just don't get. Yes its 2 people, who are quite clearly opposites trying to get across the USA but that's where the similarities stop. This film and its comedy are clearly aimed at todays generation of movie goers and todays sense of humour which has evolved from what it once was... what was good 23 years ago in PTAA remains good, but show it to a 20 year old today and i'd bet some of the humour would be lost on them. If i made my younger brother, who's 17 years of age, watch something like a classic 'Carry On' film.. he'd be crawling up the walls inside 10 minutes. So i do feel to compare 2 films which a generation between them isn't quite right for me.I'd recommend that you go see this film, enjoy it for what it is. A damn good laugh and great way to spend a couple of hours at the flicks.Enjoy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laughs throughout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been very interested in watching this movie ever since I found out about it. I was a fan of Todd Phillips' The Hangover and through that I loved Zach Galifianakis. Robert Downey Jr. always does solid work. Through all of that I had high expectations and as with all expectations there is always a risk that they will not be met.I caught a pre-screening of this in Michigan and it was highly entertaining. It's up to par with The Hangover to me and more meaningful. There were more sentimental moments here than in Phillips' last movie and the humor doesn't rely as much on gross-outs and raunchiness.The cinema was laughing throughout the movie. It's not an original idea (comparisons with Planes, Trains, and Automobiles are inevitable) but it was more than satisfying. I say it's the funniest movie of the year but I haven't seen all the comedies released this year.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Due Date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have seen the Steve Martin/John Candy classic Planes, Trains and Automobiles, then this is pretty much the same film, only with no train and only a small segment of plane, it's mainly a road movie, from director Todd Phillips (Road Trip, The Hangover). Basically easy to wind up yuppie Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jr.) is making his way home to Los Angeles from Atlanta, and he has five days to get there before his wife Sarah (Michelle Monaghan) gives birth to their baby. A number of mishaps at the airport start occurring though, such as being taken off a plane using the words "bomb" and "terrorist", having his luggage go on ahead, and losing his wallet and ID, and it seems to be when he is near stranger Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis), real name Ethan Chase. They are both forced off the plane and put on the "no fly list", and Peter can't find any way to get home, and the only way seems to be hitching a ride with Ethan going across country, and the journey will be very hellish. It is not just Ethan, the aspiring actor, and his dog that are being extremely irritating, but on the way they have a punch up with a handicapped Western Union employee, have a serious car accident when Ethan falls asleep at the wheel, go on the run from the Mexican police, and at one point drink Ethan's father's ashes mistaking it for coffee. For a long while Peter cannot stand Ethan with his annoying personality, his constant questioning, his moments of inability to act and ultimately his presence, but slowly he warms to him helping him to get home. Eventually they seem to be good friends, and Peter allows Ethan to scatter his father's ashes where he wanted to, The Grand Canyon, and he confesses to at one point leaving him behind at a gas station they stopped, and Ethan confesses to having Peter's wallet. Right at that moment Peter gets a phone call from Sarah saying that her water has broke and she is going into labour, so they speed back in the police car they stole, and they arrive just in time, but Peter passed out and Ethan cut the cord, and in the end they agree to sort of stay in touch. Also starring Jamie Foxx as Darryl, Juliette Lewis as Heidi, Danny McBride as Lonnie, RZA as Airport Screener, Matt Walsh as TSA Agent, Mimi Kennedy as Sarah's Mom, an appearance by Jon Cryer as Alan Harper and Charlie Sheen as Charlie Harper both in Two and a Half Men and director Phillips as Barry. Downey Jr. is really good as the tormented and easily angered guy who just wants to go home, and Galifianakis gets his moments as the irritating child-like loose-cannon guy who wants to be your pal. The road movie premise is a good idea for this kind of "buddy" movie, and there are some good slapstick and stupidity jokes, so while it sometimes feels like something you might have seen before, it is a fun comedy. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Due Date Review. 24th march Cast: Robert Downey Junior, Zac Galifianakis and Jamie Foxx Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jr) had a bad start to the day. To make it even better he was placed in front of the hilarious Ethan Trembley ( Zac Galifianakis). Ethan got them both kicked off the plan and put them on the "no fly list". Peter lost his wallet containing money and ID, which forced him to go on a road trip adventure all the way back to LA, with the annoying and frustrating Ethan Trembley and his "masturbating Dog". The film has some hilarious scenes which are very well written and performed. I would say it was yet another outstanding performance from up and coming actor Zac Galifianakis, building on his previous box office phenomenon the "Hangover" in a way Zac plays the same weird and crazy character. During Due date what made me laugh was his sudden spurts of feminism, when he was disgusted at Peters behaviour, for example the way he holds his dog under his arm, throws his head back and walks of. A good performance from the classic Robert Downey Junior, however I don't think the character "Peter Highman" suited his acting style, usually Robert plays the wild and crazy character for example in Sherlock Holmes he was a bit wild, and also in Iron man the clumsy sarcastic man, however in due date he was in a way being the sensible one out of the two. To me it did not suit his acting style. Never the less I would say despite Due Dates mixed views and opinions, I would personally say it is a must say and this year's "Hangover" a must see and funny well written film. I give it **** stars Jack Cahill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is yet another outstanding performance from Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis. Zack's character (Ethan) has the same characteristics that we all have learned to love from The Hangover, so if you loved that then you should enjoy this movie. And Robert Downey Jr. comes back as a witty and well regarded character. Its about everything that you would want from a movie with these actors.I have since watched the movie several times and I laugh more every single time I watch it.

		<fullReview>hey, this is clearly a remake of Planes, Trains and Automobiles. It is very funny and has the same drive for 'wanting to get home' as PTA. At the end of the day is doesn't really have the redemption for the main character that PTA has. So let's call it 'PTA lite'. Worth watching all the same for the fantastic Zach Kalifianakis. Glad that Zach had his chance to do his thing in the spotlight after his great Hangover performance. Robert Downey does a good neurotic male impression. But Jamie Foxx was not at all stretched in this movie; why ask him along when offering him so few lines? His whole section could be cut to 30 secs and keep the plot on track.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't have $100 million dollars. Much less, a mere million (YET ? Lotto's on tonight) but what a disappointment Due Date turned out to be at barely breaking $100 million. I'm guessing marketing ? labeling it as the next Hangover probably didn't help since they were polar opposites.This movie was hilarious! Well, okay, let me preface with you kinda have to be a Robert Downey Jr. fan. Like me. Oh, and you should be familiar with and find Zach Galifianakis funny. Agreed. Also, be aware, it's completely preposterous and is unlike most road trips whereas the lead character, Peter (Downey Jr.) is a real-almost-90%-unlovable-ass. Yeah, I can dig that.So, if you fit into those categories above and understand what you're getting yourself into, just leave your brain at the door and enjoy yourself here. And to clarify, he's not just unlovable, he really is just?plain?mean.Businessman Peter's first of a series of unfortunate events with Ethan (Galifianakis) is outside an airport and is continued onto their "coincidental" flight together. Both get booted off and 86'd from the friendly skies. Having to get across country quick, OK, well, within a few days, now wallet-less Peter reluctantly agrees to join Ethan on a road-trip-from-hell to get home for the birth of his first child.Whew?that didn't take long to give the basic synopsis, and shoot, it sounds clichéd as hell. In reality, that's not too far off a statement, especially when you roll in the inevitable "zany secondary characters" or predictable escapades the find themselves into or the foreseen "twists." If not for the great lines, mainly from Downey Jr. sparing a lot more for Galifianakis, the movie would be a complete dud. Seriously, it was their magic/chemistry that held the loose glue together.And to enjoy them, you'll have to suspend a great deal of disbelief, such as being allowed on a plane with a marijuana pipe because security believes that famous "Oh, that's not mine" line or a government vehicle stolen and yet no one seems to want to put a simple little APB out on it or someone is shot and the hospital asks no questions. Of course not.So, just know what you're getting yourself into, and enjoy these two great comics. It's not for everybody, but I happen to like both leads a lot and went along for the fun ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are looking for a night out when you are ready to holler in laughter, go spend 2 hours watching this one. Zach has very much the same astounding screen presence that Jack Black had in his best acts. He owns the screen and his persona can make one fall off the seat even before the first syllable comes out of his mouth. This one promises a good two hours you will not forget, and may even encourage you to see it again with another set of friends after the effects of the first viewing has worn off.The story line is simple and fast-paced, may even be termed clichéd by some (read other reviews, I kid you not)... but it has humor that is as contemporary as it gets. New age, no-holds-barred, and yet tasteful (on most occasions), this is one not to be missed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As everyone already knows this is the new movie from the director of the hangover. Basically this film follows the same recipe, but the big difference is that this one doesn't focus only in comedy ( which in most parts is very good) but also has a very well developed dramatic background that makes us understand why the characters are the way they are. The merit of the film is to create interesting situations in a plot that is no longer original and in the end get us to like a person that at first sight seemed in-mature and irritating. Yes it also has some scatological humor that may disgust some viewers but in the end is good entertainment. And the plus there are at least to dramatic scenes that put this movie over others of the genre. And the scene with the Pink Floyd song is worth the ticket</fullReview>

It's very similar to 'Planes, Trains, and Automobiles' Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis were perfect together. Downey Jr. stars as Peter Highman, a man on his way home to Los Angeles to be there for the birth of his child. Unfortunately, he runs into Ethan Tremblay, who soon becomes a nightmare for Peter. They switch bags on the plane, and both get put on the no-fly list. When Ethan rents a car, he offers Peter a ride, and he reluctantly accepts. Along the way, Ethan asks him strange questions and continues to bother Peter. They get injured, and almost thrown in jail in Mexico. Will Peter get to L.A. in time for the birth of his child?

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and funny, but not very memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Planes, Trains and Automobiles is one of my favorite comedies, and even though Due Date is not an "official" remake of it, it definitely has the same premise of two completely different men trying to reach to the same place by every possible mean, provoking laughs because of their contrasting personalities and the adventures they suffer while they are meeting to each other, until they start to appreciate with each other.However, there is one big difference between both films, because while Planes, Trains and Automobiles had an affable tone, Due Date is frequently cruel, uncomfortable and even offensive...however, I do not mention those three things as something negative.Due Date is one of those comedies which are funnier because of their actors than because of their screenplay.Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis have a very good chemistry with each other, and they make the evolution of the relationship between their characters totally credible.And besides of that, they have a natural charisma which makes their characters to be likable to the spectators.I will not deny that there are some scenes in which some spectators will feel in the limits of tolerance during some of the many irreverent scenes from Due Date.But I suspect that those who laughed with Observe and Report, Role Models or Pineapple Express will not have any problem with the rude humor from Due Date.In the negative side, I have to say that that the supporting actors are absolutely wasted, and I think it was a mistake to use famous people in characters which could have been filled by extras without creating unreal expectations.If I know that Jamie Foxx, Michelle Monaghan and Danny McBride appear in a comedy, I expect them to have a substantial participation, or at least really funny scenes; but no...they are simply there to inflate the profile from the movie.And I also have to say that Due Date is a bit disappointing in the narrative aspect, because the screenplay feels too predictable, and it cannot transcend the old formula of "odd couple", so we have various clichés we have already seen too many times.In conclusion, I have to recommend Due Date, because I have to admit that, despite all my complains, it made me laugh in various moments, and it kept me entertained.However, I did not find the movie to be very memorable, and I did not find it nearly as funny as The Hangover, the previous movie from director Todd Phillips.</fullReview>

I was beginning to think Robert Downey Jnr had lost his touch after seeing Iron Man 2, which was a total nightmare! I was wrong I'm glad to say and he was totally engaging in this film. I wasn't sure if Zach Galifianakis could top his performance in The Hangover, but I really think he came close if not possibly edging a little better. There were times that I laughed out loud and I found the the film amusing all the way through, I was never bored and there were small moments where it was really quite touching and emotional. I don't want to tell you anything to give away the story, but it's a story about two guys, who were seriously unlikely to be friends taking an action packed and hilarious journey together.

		<fullReview>Lets start off by saying that this film is in no way comparable to 'The Hangover'. Because it just would not be right to compare these two together just because they have the same director. With that out of the way lets get on with the review.The film is about Peter Highman(Robert Downey Jr) who is a father to be and has to travel back to Los Angeles to be with his wife. At the airport he switches bags with a wannabe actor Ethan Tremblay(Zachary Galifianakis) which turns out contains weed. When Peter gets put on the no fly list he gets stuck with Ethan who is heading to the same place as Peter and since Peter's luggage was on the plane when he left he has no money. Ethan soon offers Peter a ride with him and before you know it they leading us on and adventure with laughs and mayhem.The story of this film is a pretty decent film if you just want to sit back and laugh. Storywise it is exciting enough. The two characters are an uncanny duo and thats what brings the laughter out in me is because they are mismatched. Writing was good with a bit of drama showing Peters childhood life and Ethan's father's ashes being one of the few main things circling around in this movie. This by no means was the directors best effort. I still liked 'The Hangover' slightly more as this film had slightly less laughs than the one before.So overall I give this film a 7/10 for being repetitive and at the same time having laughs with a pug being thrown in for cuteness.</fullReview>

There were many times when I laughed hard out loud but the movie seemed to lack a continuity between scenes. To me the movie was just a bunch of short skits, each pretty similar in make up. It also appeared that they tried to reuse certain elements from "the Hangover" in order to get a laugh. This movie had some really funny moments but was over all disappointing in the fact that it was just thrown together and not very well thought out. My opinion only. Still, it was worth seeing on the big screen.</fullReview>

Mr. Peter high man (Robert Downey JR) and Ethan tremblay /chase (Zach Galifianakis) play a pair of guys with nothing in common expect the need to go to losangles.Robert Downey JR,character play a neurotic architect who need to get back to Los Angles in 5 days to see the birth of his son and Zach Galifianakis plays a freethinker going to make it big in Hollywood.In his quest to get home he meets Ethan tremblay /chase( Zach Galifianakis)at the airport,their bags get mixed up in the front of the airport when Ethan 's friend drops him off and takes the door off RDJ's car that drops him off at the airport.Needles to say that started a series of events that gets him thrown off the flight he needs to be on to get home. To make things worse his luggage and wallet with money credit cards and id is sent home to Los angles without him in his luggage. Peter is up a river without a paddle until Ethan offered him ride home across country, without money he said yes even thought Ethan had them both thrown off the flight and him on to the no fly list for some pot paraphernalia found in his bag that actually belong to ethane.I thought the travel across county was good touch, especially when they stopped at the Grand Canyon nice touch Throughout the traveling across country peter was actually starting to like Ethan even thought he was a little quirky to say the least.I thought their chemistry was excellent together as a comedy team. There were 2 scenes worth mentioning. The guys are sleeping in the car outside and Ethan decides to masturbate to fall asleep while peter is trying to sleep, and the dog is masturbating in the back seat. Peter called a friend to pick them up after Ethan wrecks their rental car played by Jamie fox. Ethan was in the back of Jamie's truck and peter asked is that drainage ditch Jamie says yes he drives into it full speed Ethan goes flying in truck bed.This no hangover by any means, but a good movie by all means.This movie say to me don't judge someone until you get to know them.It's about to leave the theaters so I would say rent it for a few good laughs on a sat night when it comes out.

		<shortDescription>Due Date gets an eight! Good stuff.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into 'Due Date' a little apprehensive. I couldn't erase 'The Hangover' from my mind and knew I would instantly compare the two. I've always thought 'The Hangover' was overrated. Funny still, but overrated. 'Due Date' BESTS 'The Hangover'.The coupling of Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis is so real, as are both the characters, even if Ethan is a little exaggerated.The story is bizarre. That's where it lost it for a me a little, there are certain scenes that are used purely for comic value and feel out of place. However, mixed in with these scenes are a couple of genuinely emotional scenes which take you by such surprise and leave you wondering why you're feeling sad in the middle of such a seemingly out-right comedy.The comedy value is fantastic in this film, one-liners aplenty and beautifully timed, mixed with amusing and sometimes grotesquely outrageous scenarios that make you feel guilty for liking Ethan as a character so much.'Due Date' is one not to miss, but as is always with comedy... better seen with friends. It's more intimate than 'The Hangover' and more accessible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern "Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles" -- typical tactics improved by two great stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd normally consider it a cop-out to label a film exactly like another and purposefully avoid direct comparison between two films, but "Due Date," starring Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis as polar-opposite travel buddies thrown together by unwelcome circumstances, bears more than just a resemblance to John Hughes' "Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles." In this case, 21st Century update is spot-on.The 1987 film with Steve Martin and John Candy was not so much a yuck-fest as a humorous story of two incompatible folks with different social attitudes who learn to get along. The same can be said of Todd Phillips ("The Hangover") new film. Few surprises exist in "Due Date," which sticks to a conventional "road trip that keeps getting worse" formula, but the dynamic between Downey Jr. and Galifianakis make it an enjoyable cross-country romp through familiar territory.Downey Jr. plays Peter, an expecting father heading home to Los Angeles in time for his wife's (Michelle Monaghan) planned C-section in a few days. While on the plane, fellow passenger Ethan Tremblay (Galifianakis), a clueless and eccentric aspiring actor en route to "Hollywood," lands the two of them on the no-fly list after a "terrorism" mishap. The two must journey together (along with Ethan's dog Sonny who has a unique "talent" to put it mildly).Galifianakis plays a more fleshed-out version of his "Hangover" character. Ethan is slightly more eccentric and twice as naive/ignorant. One scene has them stuck at the Mexico border because he misread the "Mexico" sign as saying "Texaco." The stand-up comic certainly has a knack for the lovable idiot. His character is so dumb he's most certainly undeserving of sympathy, but Galifianakis earns that back. Downey Jr. plays his quick-tempered foil and the one whom we naturally identify with, just as we do with Martin in "Planes." Most of the mishaps are fairly run-of-the-mill. Ethan smokes marijuana for his "glaucoma," so check off pot jokes. You may also check off ignorant car accidents, the consumption of ashes, physical assault from unlikely assaulters and masturbation. Hard to ruin a movie with that typical of a list.Like "Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles," the journey of the two characters provides the heart of the story. Peter can't bring himself to totally screw over Ethan and ditch him despite the simplicity of such a feat due to Ethan's minuscule intelligence. Rather than being two warring personalities, their relationship remains dynamic through the entire film and keeps that storyline interesting enough to the point where the predictable gags don't run (or ruin) the show."Due Date" is certainly funny, but more so in moments and quotes than in the comedic situations. The acting earns laughs while the situational humor in the writing is hit or miss. Perhaps that's only because the film sticks to a tried and true formula as opposed to carefully manufactured and clever plotting as in "The Hangover." But while formula usually spells disappointment at the movies, "Due Date" is money and time well spent. There's a reason John Hughes films are timeless, and even if "Due Date" completely hijacks that quality, there are times when familiarity can be a good thing at the movies.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Due Date really hit the funny spots during the movie. As you know the director of Hangover, directed this film. So you know you'll get the same humor on this movie.Basically the story starts off, with Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jr.) going towards Los Angles for his new born baby. The Plan to fly to L.A. from Atlanta does't exactly meets the plan Peter had in mind. Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis) ruins his plan. Peter gets on the no fly list, and decides to drive to L.A. with Ethan.From then on the story gets funny. Here are +'s and -'s. (+)The story is basic, easy to follow. (+)funny moments.(+) good acting. (-) to short, or thats how all comedy movies are.Overall (7.0)--A. Haynes--</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long Overdue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The gratuitous gross outs of Hangover are present in Todd Phillips' newest comedy, Due Date, which takes a bizarre trip into the region of black and absurdist, but ever so gently and tangentially.Robert Downey Jr's tense architect, Peter Highman, hitches a ride with Zach Galifianakis' clueless aspiring actor Ethan Tremblay in order to get to LA from Atlanta in time to witness the birth of Peter's first child. Along the way Peter endures Ethan's dense lovingness while Ethan takes crushing criticism from the uptight Peter.Danny McBride and Juliette Lewis provide part of the eccentric cast that makes this picaresque one of the best comedies of the year. That distinction comes in part from a crisp, rapid fire dialogue to a Downey whose comic timing approaches perfection. Galifianakis plays a variation of his hug-a-bear persona perfected from Hangover and It's Kind of a Funny Story. It's just that Downey is a master of nuance, whose every twitch oozes character; Galifianakis can only hope for such range.Each part of their journey illuminates Peter's flaws and seems to move him into a more loving attitude toward his partner, a staple of the modern bromance in which the men may actually say they love each other, a harmless affirmation of character development without danger of homosexuality.Yet, as the film reaches its conclusion, I am uncertain about what has happened to Peter, if anything other than a manic trip, and what difference it all has made to Ethan (none that I can actually see?he's still happily clueless but working appropriately as an actor in a TV bromantic comedy about two men and a half of one).The wanking baby of Hangover is ramped up to a self-pleasing pug, as bizarre as it sounds, and absurdist, but it is funny as dog imitates a master (Ethan) who pleasures himself to get to sleep. Director Phillips keeps the dark light, and in so doing gives us an enjoyable bromance to counterpoint a callous election time where there is little love or humor.Due Date is long overdue this year.</fullReview>

We all agreed to see Due Date and were very glad we saw it. We truly enjoyed this film. The movie was consistently funny and with heart. Robert and Zach play very well together. With movie admission going up all time I have to say this movie is worth the price of admission. It was really great to hear the audience laughing hysterically. There were parts of the movie where I truly had to compose myself so I didn't miss the dialog. I highly recommend this movie. Just really great fun! You wont regret it.</fullReview>

I liked the drama part of the movie too. Instead of the Zach just being funny it was good to see him serious too.But after I just said that don't get the impression that this is a serious movie,because it's really funny . To me in my opinion, I liked Due Date better than Step Brothers even though Step Brothers was really funny, but I liked Due Date overall more.

		<fullReview>The Hangover is one of my all-time favorite comedies. I admire some other films the creators of this movie have made (Road Trip, Old School). And this movie is right up there with those movies.Due Date follows Ethan (Galifianakis), an aspiring actor who has glycoma, has his father's ashes in a coffee can, has a tiny dog,is a chronic masturbator, loves Two and a Half Men, and lost his virginity at age nine to a great gal named Sheila Pimples.Ethan teams up with Peter (Downey Jr.) who - due to Ethan (who was sitting next to him) talking about bombs - gets kicked off his flight with Ethan.Ethan offers to give him a ride back home so he can see his wife give birth to their first child.The antics they get into range from, stopping at Ethan's drug dealers house, fighting a paraplegic, drinking Ethan's fathers ashes thinking it's coffee bean, and so many more.If you enjoy rated R comedies, Zach Galifianakis, enjoy Todd Philips movies, liked Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, or just plain like to laugh, watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zach Galifianakis &amp; Robert Downey Jr are both names movies fans are getting to know better. Zach should change his last name to make it easier to spell, but since The Hangover boosted his career, he is getting more roles. Zach is a funny guy, though I think his comedy character in films is still evolving.While this movie is a road movie in the traditional sense of the plot, the chemistry between Zach Galifianakis &amp; Robert Downey Jr is an interesting mix. What makes this film a lot more spirited than I expected was the strange chemistry between the two of them. While the film starts with Downey Jr as the straight man, it actually evolves into him being the funny man at one point in the movie.Zach Galifianakis &amp; Robert Downey Jr go to an airport and both board the same plane for LA. Then Zach manages to get both of them tossed off the plane. Then he puts Downey Jr through an obstacle course of events that are best described as un-likely.While the chemistry of the actors bring this off just fine, the script is not the best one. There are parts which come off predictable &amp; a few surprises along the way. While not for the kiddies, this movie is solidly entertaining for me on a first viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie will either work for you or it won't. While that is true for many other movies too (it's a taste thing) this is really extreme in whether you will like it or not. I'd suggest watch a few seconds of the trailer (one or two jokes) and if they work for you, try the movie. Even then it's not a given, that you will like it, but if you couldn't laugh about the joke in the trailer, you will not be able to laugh in the movie either.The movie stands with the chemistry of the leading men and while it might sound surprising, Robert Downey plays the "straight" man (pun intended). And while Zack Galifianakis, hot off the Hangover, goes crazy quite a bit, there are even wilder characters along the way. The humor might offend you (it's anything but politically correct) and you might rightfully ask, if the movie had to go that far out, to be funny. Still it dares to show things and hit you when you least expect it. I loved that about the movie. But as you can see by the other reactions, there is another side to that, too.Of course there are a few misses along the way. But still the whole package did it for me. I knew what I would be getting from the movie and it gave me exactly that. Depending on your taste you might see things differently.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good, but it ain't the hangover</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Due Date follows a simple story. Peter Highman is a man who has to get to LA to see the birth of his child. In a misunderstanding to the cause off a bearded man, Peter is put on the "no fly" list along with the bearded man. Peter unfortunately could not get his luggage of the plane which along with it had his wallet, complete with all credit cards, money etc. that was essential to getting Peter to LA. His only way to see the birth of his child is to travel with the bearded man, Ethan Tremblay by car to LA. What follows is a road trip movie full of ups and downs (mostly downs) which involve their car flipping off a bridge in result of Ethan falling asleep at the wheel, drinking coffee made with Ethan's father's remains, Peter breaking an arm and Peter getting shot in the leg just to name a few. Due date has a bit of everything but the one thing it lacks is the ability to make you laugh hysterically, unlike the Hangover. Indeed it does have its moments, i mean have you ever seen a movie with a masturbating dog? Don't get me wrong, Due date is definitely worth the ticket and the two leads, Downey Jr. and Galifianakis especially create great comedy. But a fact always nagged me through the whole movie. Has anyone reading this seen a little film with Steve Martin and John Candy called Planes Trains and Austomobiles. As much as I liked Due Date at the end it felt like a raunchier version of the John Hughes classic. The similarities are endless. Anyhoo, it's still a good movie, but don't expect the hangover. And it does deliver the laughs quite well.Don't try to compare this to the hangover also, just go in thinking nothing of it and you'll think it's a better movie.For any fans of the hangover who are reading this the sequel comes out in May 2011!!! How awesome is that!!!!!!!!8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting however a little out of place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into my local cinema with very high expectations of this film, mainly due to the one and only Zach Galifikanas. He is extremely funny and delivered very well in The Hangover and did not do too bad here, except he did not fit the Bio of the character. For one his character in the film, Ethan Chase/Tremblay is a saddened son who has just lost his father and cannot say goodbye, thus carrying him around in a coffee can, confiding in his dog. But then he has some random outburst's that try and force a laugh into this film. it does not progress naturally and it runs a little flat at many times during the movie. Robert Downey Jr. plays Peter, an uptight, angry, father to be who meets Ethan at the Air Port after a incident involving their drivers. He is quite arrogant and rude. Downey did a great job delivering this character and was a real highlight. he did not try and outdo himself in anyway, he just acted and made it real! But then errors in the storyline lets the whole film down. there is quite a bit of 'bending the rules' in this film and it was funny for a cheap thrill. nothing more, nothing less. I highly doubt that a lot of that was thought through however the whole puzzle was pulled back together at the end when a more realistic scenario takes place. i wont give it all away, i would recommend you see this film, but it is no hangover.3.9/5 Stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw this film with my 16 year old son &amp; I must say, I laughed constantly throughout the movie. Something I haven't done in quite a long time. Yes there is vulgar language throughout, but at least they gave it an R rating then so you know going into the movie that it's NOT FOR YOUNG CHILDREN! I haven't seen The Hangover yet (directed by the same director, Todd Phillips) so maybe I'll give it a try. Anyway this movie is a road movie that really works. Has anyone seen the recent Sherlock Holmes movie with Robert Downey? I thought Downey was HORRIBLE in that movie...so over top and hammy with his performance. Well in this movie, he does a complete 180 and is the picture of restraint as his character tries to control his spiraling rage at Zach Galifianakis' character. Galfianakis is perfect as the poor mope who has the ability to get under a person's skin &amp; annoy the hell out of them &amp; yet, immediately cause the person to feel guilty after you've inevitably just finished screaming at the mope for being such an annoying pain in the ass! Yes, there are a couple of scenes that are a little hard to believe...Like getting away from the police after being chased down the highway in a pickup truck...Sorry in real life, they'd be in jail. But it's not a major issue, so you say, so what to yourself and move on. More troubling is a very vulgar, tasteless and totally unnecessary scene when Galifianakis starts masturbating in the car just before the two characters are going to sleep. It's unbelievable to the point of being extremely weird...where you start to wonder about the writer/director of the movie...kind of weird. It's scenes like these that give Hollywood it's deservedly at times, lousy reputation. It's like they're just gonna put something in the movie for it's shock/gross out factor regardless of how stupid &amp; inappropriate it is to the film. That being said, thankfully the scene doesn't last too long! The performances by Downey &amp; Galifianakis are top notch as well as cameo appearances by Juliette Lewis as a pot dealer &amp; Jamie Foxx as buddy of Downey's character. Definitely a fun movie for older teens(16 &amp; above)&amp; adults to enjoy!</fullReview>

Robert Downey Jr, is as always gold in his role of the ever frustrated executive trying to get home to his pregnant wife. She is due any minute, but his plans to go direct to her side turn awry when he meets up with the portly Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis). Under some crazy conditions they get thrown off a plane and get put on a no-fly list. The pair share a rental car and travel across country to get to L.A. There are some wild moments, dangerous situations and extreme rudeness. An appearance by Juliette Lewis as Heidi the drug demon is a welcome surprise. Overall this is a funny film, serious tones are injected concerning the two guys friendship in development. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Due Date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few years ago, you are likely to go Zach Galifianakis who? With Todd Phillips's The Hangover to thank, the rotund actor is probably one of the more recognizable up and coming comedians to hit the silver screen, and would probably be able to branch out of ensembles and support roles such as that in Dinner with Schmucks, to marquee his own film. But it's a step in the right direction now that he continues with Todd's follow up film Due Date, in a leading role opposite co-star Robert Downing Jr, Hollywood's comeback kid.One thing's for sure about this film, if the chemistry between the two leads feel forced or artificial, the entire film will tank, because it hinges on their repertoire and ability to play off one another, in a road trip between the city of Atlanta to Los Angeles, where Downey Jr's Peter Highman has to be back in time to witness the birth of his newborn. But no thanks to Galifianakis' Ethan Tremblay, a walking talking Calamity James, they get off the wrong foot in their serendipitous meeting at the driveway of the airport resulting in a slew of unfortunate incidents from embarrassment from a bag swap and the inevitable painful arrest by an air marshal, culminating in being put on the no-fly list. Talk about how things start to go downhill as Peter had predicted, with every possession of his gone other than a soft toy monkey, he has no choice but to buddy up with Ethan who offers him a cross country ride home, being an aspiring actor looking to make it big in Hollywood.Did the chemistry work? An affirmative yes from the get go, thus beginning an adventure of two men surviving pretty much every incident of their own doing, as if trouble lurks behind every corner, with either one being the trouble magnet. It's a typical road movie with pit stops designed to tickle our funny bones at the expense of the character's predicament, and at times you wonder whether to laugh or cry at them. Some of the best shenanigans involve the consequences of smoking weed (albeit accidentally and not much of a choice on Peter's part), and an extended sequence involving a bust up at the Mexican border, which in a way also contained the biggest plot loophole in the film.But we're not going to nitpick at the plausibility of the episodes encountered by the duo, especially when we're more than likely to wonder if Peter can arrive safely in one piece as the injuries begin to mount. While most episodes are played out for laughs, there are interspersed with more dramatic elements such as the running thread on Ethan's need to get the ashes of his father, stored in a coffee tin yet specially set up as another plot device for a wicked gag, to the Grand Canyon. It's all about the usual themes of a budding friendship and the development of camaraderie after a more than destructive introduction, a coming together of strange bedfellows who will otherwise in their own circle of everyday life wouldn't even get to meet.And with road movies, cameo appearances have become a staple. Juliette Lewis, last seen in The Switch, appears here as a weed dealer who mixes and matches her offerings from her kitchen, while Jamie Foxx contributes his two cents worth as Peter's long time friend who also turns out to be the ex of his wife Sarah (Michelle Monaghan), and provides a small degree of a subplot as to whether he and his wife have already gotten over each other, or not, though it didn't offer much as it got blown over in less than 5 minutes. The best supporting appearance has just got to be Sonny the dog, who probably trounces all the best lines Downey Jr and Galifianakis get, with just an incredibly sick but unexpectedly funny scene involving, well, you got to find out for yourself, suffice to say it may have contributed to the higher rating of this film as well.It may not be Planes, Trains and Automobiles which I deem as my personal favourite road trip film of all time and I'm setting my benchmark against it, but Due Date does not even come close to that classic unfortunately. That said, it still has enough laughs in it for a weekend romp and comes recommended for the two lead's comfortable screen chemistry with each other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Continues the Hangover legacy, but lacks the same charm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slap Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis together with an average storyline and over-the-top comedic situations, you basically get The Hangover 2. Except, the sequels are never better than the originals, right? Robert Downey Jr. plays the temperamental Peter Highman, whose only hope to reach LA in time to see the birth of his child is to drive across the country with Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis), a melodramatic and immature actor-to-be. It's pretty much the same formula: some ridiculous fights, a couple of disgusting awkward scenes, a heartwarming conclusion, and a handful of passable jokes. Due Date rolls with the same spirit as The Hangover did, but it seems lacking. It's not because the characters were boring, because Downey and Galifianakis deserve to be applauded for how well they played their parts. It's simply because it's nothing we haven't seen before.You can't expect any more than The Hangover, but if you're desperate for more of the same... here's your chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not dueing to much to change the reused plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Todd Phillips' new film Due Date reminds us of two films instantly. Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, the classic John Hughes film which stars Steve Martin and the late John Candy and Phillips' unexpected 2009 success film The Hangover. Both films I say surpass this one up, but that's not to say this one was a complete and total bust. Due Date did have me laughing countless times, but compared to a Comedy that's clever and funny like PT&amp;A, this one is only funny without being clever too much.I did enjoy the overall plot I will say. It's got the right plot and the right amount of laughs to be classified as "a good comedy". It's nothing amazing, like I won't make time for it whenever it comes on TV, but maybe in a year I'll turn it on for the Hell of it. Zach Galifianakis, I think, is getting better and better with his acting, but I wish he would go on to do more besides silly comedies. I'd love to see him in a straight forward drama or maybe even a Horror film. He may be great in comedies, but he should try some other stuff. The problem/downside to that would be if people see his name on a project of drama, they'll get them to believe the film itself is just laugh out loud humor. Similar to how Adventureland fooled some people to think it was an all out Comedy by plastering "From the director of Superbad" right on the poster.Tightly wound, short fused Peter Highman (Downey Jr.) desperately wants to get home to Los Angeles to see the birth of his first child from his wife Sarah (Monaghan). To do so, his intentions are to fly, but after being kicked off an airplane when a overly friendly, annoyance Ethan Tremblay (Galifianakis) makes a big deal about his cell phone. Peter is now on "the no fly list" and has no money, credit cards, or drivers license, so there's almost no way to get home. Until Ethan shows up in all excitement hoping to get Peter to hitch a ride and they'll become close friends.Peter unwillingly accepts the ride from Ethan and are now off to California. Let the road trip movie Comedy antics begin; everything that could go wrong does. Peter and Ethan come into every obstacle known and Peter is at his wit's end because of Ethan's laidback attitude. It's almost as if Peter is annoyed by everyone but himself.Robert Downey Jr. resembles Steve Martin and Zach Galifianakis resembles the late/great John Candy. Although this movie had good laughs/intentions, more could have been done with the characters and their overall dialog to make the relationship believable. We never really get into too much about both Peter/Ethan, we don't really know them and, hey, we're with them for ninety-five minutes we might as well know more than Peter's married and his wife is having a baby and Ethan's dad is dead and he's an aspiring actor.For what Due Date is, it's funny in various places, but doesn't come close to the mark The Hangover left on Comedy. I don't consider The Hangover to be on my list of favorite movies like most teenagers do, but I will say I did laugh more than I did in a movie theater in years. People have said Due Date surpasses The Hangover and that is funny how that's many comedies goal is to surpass the laughs delivered in The Hangover. Some reviews for Hot Tub Time Machine and She's Out of My League said they were better than The Hangover and I disagree totally. Due Date had an an even greater challenge, not to deliver more laughs than The Hangover, but be memorable enough to overshadow the Hughes' masterpiece Planes, Trains, and Automobiles. That's right there is already a challenge that, so far, hasn't been won.Starring: Robert Downey Jr., Zach Galifianakis, Michelle Monaghan, Juliette Lewis, and Jamie Foxx. Directed by: Todd Phillips.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's no Hangover, but still a great time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming off of the success the wild success of The Hangover from 2009, Todd Phillips joins forces with Zach Galifianakis again to bring us Due Date. True to his fashion, Galifianakis plays an irreverent manchild named Ethan Tremblay who aspires to one day be an actor in Hollywood. Alongside him is Robert Downey Jr. playing an expectant father who is wired ridiculously tight named Peter Highman. The two characters are polar opposites in appearance and personality, yet somehow they end up traveling cross country together to make it in time for the birth of Peter's child. It could have been just by chance, or maybe it was meant to be. Either way the gags along the way from Atlanta to Los Angeles are plenty hysterical as well as disgusting and vulgar.Downey and Galifianakis have hilarious chemistry together, going from two people who you would never expect to be in the same vicinity as one another, much less get along, to two actual friends by the end of the film. It's a ton of fun watching the two actors with entirely different personas and overall acting molds work together so well to make a hilarious, yet also sentimental film about friendship. Zach Galifianakis has quickly become one of my favorite comedians. He is extremely bizarre yet very progressive in his comedy, and I honestly think I like it more than his films. He plays a very specific character on stage, yet also plays one specific character in film so far it seems. He plays the role of the obscene and naive manchild very well, but I definitely hope he fights off this typecast for future roles, and doesn't become cursed with the single role plague. He still does it very well now, but like anything else, it will get stale eventually.Due Date was no doubt hilarious, and I had my share of laugh out loud moments, but at times it almost felt like Phillips was trying too hard to top The Hangover. As much as I don't want to base my review off of The Hangover, it's really hard not to when it was one of the main advertising angles for the film, and also very similar in many ways. Audiences fell in love with The Hangover when it was released, so there was obviously a lot of pressure for Due Date to live up to its predecessors name. And obviously it isn't nearly as good as The Hangover was, but that's not saying too much considering The Hangover was, in my opinion, one of the most solid and high quality comedies to come out in recent years. It doesn't mean Due Date wasn't good, and it probably surpasses The Hangover in certain aspects, but overall it's not at quite the same caliber.For a comedy, Due Date was surprisingly sentimental at moments. There's an overarcing storyline which carries the development of the two leads, involving Ethan Tremblay's father who died recently and Ethan now carries around in a Folgers coffee can in the form of ashes. There are some gut busting hilarious moments worked into this storyline, but also some surprisingly heartfelt moments. Galifianakis perfectly hones in with his likability as being a goofball, but then surprises us all when he reveals he can do a lot more than just make people laugh. There are a couple very sentimental scenes where you wholeheartedly believe in Galifianakis' character, and truly feel for him. I wasn't expecting these kinds of emotional moments, but was very pleased to see them actually work well in a straight up comedy film.Due Date has its highs and lows, but mostly highs that will have you laughing your head off. I enjoyed every moment of it and never felt bored and never felt like the comedy or the characters were getting old. It stayed lively and funny the whole way through and even though it's not The Hangover, it is still well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is it possible for someone to have such bad luck in one movie? How can someone's bags get switched at the beginning of the movie? Who carries weed on a plane? How can someone be put on a "no fly zone" so soon? The guy with the beard was so manipulating throughout the entire movie that is wasn't funny! I am mad they gave Jamie Foxx an almost "walk on" role in this movie. If Robert Downey Jr. and Jamie Foxx would have left the crazy guy (who carries his fathers ashes in a coffee can), then that would have ruined the plot of the entire movie. We should have known that the baby would end up being a girl instead of a boy. And in real life, no one rides across the country in a car with a man that he had just met!</fullReview>

During most of the duration of the film the cinema was in fits of laughter. There are some amazing one liners that are fun to quote back to people after the movie has finished. I found the characters likable despite many people on here saying they were not. Of course everybody has their own opinion but I think this is just the characters personalities. I also loved the cute dog that was in quite a bit of the movie. I would definitely recommend this to everybody who loved the Hangover.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You never know what to expect when you put Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man, Sherlock Holmes) and Zach Galifianakis (The Hangover, Dinner for Schmucks), but the movie was extremely funny, strangely enough the duo just seem to click, great chemistry.Now the story is simple,a straightedge architect with a don't-mess-with- me attitude, Peter Highman (Downey) leaves Georgia to head home to Los Angeles and back to his expectant wife, whose due date is within a few days. In the airport Peter has a chance encounter with Ethan Tremblay (Galifianakis). Ethan, an eccentric, inspiring actor, accidentally got Peter kicked off his flight and put on the no-fly list without having a wallet or photo I.D. This forces Peter to hitch a ride from Ethan, with the hope of getting to his wife before he misses the birth of his first child. The comedy stems from a domino effect of mishaps and life- threatening experiences, usually involving something illegal. The film at no point disappoints , special credit to Jamie foxx's cameo and of course sonny the dog. There are a lot of memorable moments in the film worth mentioning but i'd prefer you seeing it rather than me saying it. I'm tired of all the negative comments this movie is receiving, before reading those comments watch the movies for yourselves to decide and get ready to be blown out of your minds!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another "Odd Couple" Road Trip Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Road Trip" director Todd Phillips' new farce "Due Date" resembles the John Hughes comedy classic "Planes, Trains, &amp; Automobiles" without the trains. As the protagonists, Robert Downey, Jr. and Zach Galifianakis play polar opposites. Literally, they constitute 'an odd couple.' Downey is cast as a tightly-wrapped architect while Galifianakis is a complete nincompoop with a beard. They collide with each other at the Atlanta airport and they are both bound for the same West Coast destination. Downey is anxiously rushing back to be with his wife before she delivers their first child. Galifianakis is going to Hollywood to break into show business as an actor, and he has the perm to prove it. These two behave like a mongoose and a cobra. Downey would be the cobra, and Galifianakis the mongoose. The adolescent screenplay, contrived by Phillips along with TV's "King of the Hill" scenarists Alan R. Cohen and Alan Freedland as well as Adam Sztykiel of "Maid of Honor," emphasizes rude, crude humor. Surprisingly enough, nobody farts in "Due Date." Even more surprisingly, nobody gets kicked in the balls. Audiences that crave to be in the wrong place at the wrong time will either howl in hilarity or cringe in disgust at the masturbation scene. The masturbation scene, which is about as far as Phillips goes to push the envelope, sets a whole new standard (high or low depending on your taste) for comedy. Some might call that scene cruelty to animals. The audience that I sat with found it infectiously funny. Downey and Galifianakis start out hating each other in chick flick style but wind up becoming best friends forever. Keep in mind that few scenes in this lowest common denominator comedy are remotely credible. The writers struggle to make everything as goofy as the protagonists are obnoxious. Most of the gags are cretinously stupid and could have been used in "Jackass 3-D." Downey and Galifianakis draw us into their unsympathetic characters, and you'll wind up laughing at their antics because both screw each other over so beautifully. Downey's coffee and dough nuts scene is a good example. Mind you, "Due Date" isn't half as hilarious as "The Hangover" or Phillips' other classic "Old School." Comparatively, "Due Date" is more like "School for Scoundrels." "Due Date" does earn its R-rating with several scenes depicting the use of marijuana and the abuse of profanity, principally the f-bomb. Nevertheless, the performances are good, especially Jamie Foxx as Downey's best friend and Danny McBride as a Western Union cashier.Architect Peter Highman (Robert Downey, Jr., of "Iron Man 2") is riding in a black limo to the Atlanta airport terminal where he plans to board a flight to see his lovely pregnant wife, Sarah Highman (Michelle Monaghan of "The Heartbreak Kid"), in California in time to be at her side when she delivers their son. As the limo pulls in front of the terminal and Highman opens the door, another vehicle side-swipes the limo and tears its door off. The redneck-looking driver emerges from the other car without a care in the world, apologizes, and then helps his friend out, Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis of "The Hangover"), who totes around a small white bulldog with a cone on its head. No sooner have Peter and Ethan met than the luggage handlers get their bags mixed up and an airport security screener (Robert Fitzgerald Diggs, a.k.a RZA of "American Gangster") accuses Peter of trying to smuggle a marijuana pipe aboard the plane. Peter talks his way out of this difficulty and gets seated in first-class only to find himself staring at Ethan fuzzy pot belly as Ethan tries to stuff his luggage in an overhead compartment. A stewardess passes them and accidentally nudges Ethan so that Peter has his face mashed into Ethan's hairy belly. As the pilot is preparing to take off, Ethan reminds Peter to shut off his cell phone. Idiotically, Peter gets into an argument with Ethan after Ethan informs him that terrorists have been known to trigger bombs with cell phones. Their argument escalates until a U.S. Marshal appears with gun in hand and shoots Peter with a rubber bullet. Peter slumps unconsciously in the aisle and recovers later in the Marshal's office where he learns that he is free to leave. Unfortunately, he learns he has been banned from flying. Moreover, his luggage is in route to Los Angeles. Even worse, he learns that Ethan was pulled off the jet, too. They run into each other in the rental car parking lot. Since Peter stuffed his valuables in his luggage, the poor architect has no money, no identification, and more importantly, no credit cards. Ethan pulls up in a rental and invites Peter to accompany him on his cross-country drive to Los Angeles. The comedy of errors that unfolds hereafter consists primarily of things that neither man either likes or understands about the other. Ethan plans to go to Hollywood, while Peter points out that Hollywood is really nothing more than Los Angeles and he assures the paunchy fellow with a dog that he won't make it as an actor.The fun and games really begin as they enter Texas. Ethan falls asleep at the wheel while Peter is sleeping, smashes through a road construction barrier, plunging the car off a bridge, and then crashing it on the highway beneath it. Miraculously, Ethan emerges without a scratch. Peter's old buddy, Darryl (Jamie Foxx of "Stealth"), picks Peter up at the hospital, and they give Ethan a lift in the back of their pick-up truck. Phillips and company pile one outrageously absurd scene atop another, and none of them are remotely plausible but are pretty funny. Before everything is over, Peter and Ethan steal a Mexican border patrol vehicle and careen across Arizona with lights blazing so our hero can arrive at Sarah's bedside in time. "Due Date" delivers a lot of raunchy humor, but Downey and Galifianakis redeem it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DUE DATE (2010) ***1/2 Robert Downey, Jr., Zach Galifianakis, Michelle Monaghan, Jamie Foxx, Juliette Lewis, Danny McBride, RZA, Matt Walsh. Hysterically funny road trip to hell comedy from filmmaker Todd Phillips (who co-scripted with Alan R. Cohen, Alan Freedland &amp; Adam Sztykiel) with Downey as an uptight architect whose beautiful wife (Monaghan) is due with their first child, and his unbelievable misfortune in running into bad penny actor-wannabe Galifiankis (a riot!) forcing him off his airplane and into a living nightmare of one ridiculous moment after another in his trek to his impending family with the comedy of errors escalating. Loaded with belly-laughs of epic proportion, the odd couple is a stitch as the increasingly violent prone Downey frustratingly attempts to make sense of the completely moronic yet sweet Galifianakis to the point of sheer madness. Truly satisfying blend of vulgarity and sentimentality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice work....And let's hope to see more of Todd Williams's work in future!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hangover was surely some shameless advertising for Todd Williams way back in 2009....That was one flick which surely rooted his DNA-cum signature into the minds of audiences across the globe last year...........so much so, that all that was needed was to see the line "from the director of The hangover", and in New York Minute, there you are, staring at the big screen, in time for "Due Date'. If you want to compare it with the Hangover, the first is, that this film is in no way different from The Hangover, in that the key to both their plots comes from the recipe unexpected + crazy. Sure, Due Date does take you again down a seemingly familiar road of laughs, just like The Hangover, but this is somewhat funnier and crazier. For starters,we the real humour comes from the conflict of characters, or shall i say, personalities. Peter Highman, played by Robert Downey Jr. is of a serious nature, which becomes engaged with the goofy, crazy nature of Ethan Chase , played by Zach GalifianakisTo start, one flaw which plagues this movie, is the shallowness of plot. A storyline which of course didn't take too much thinking, and after a while, especially after both Peter and Ethan end up in the car together, it's predictably obvious what's going to come. But then again, one can undoubtedly say, that any comedy flick can get away with such aspects as shallowness of plot, low-star acting, as long as they keep the audience stocked with a bellyful of laughs! A sure test of the market's appetite!Now that I've shared the mistakes, here's the next piece of the puzzle: This director surely knows how to create a record of sorts by making two successive films which both share their common element, namely humour And what really drives the show is Ethans goofiness.....The actual character is the soul of true comedy....sure, even in real life, Ethan is a comedian, and those who are already familiar with him, tend to find most things which he does as comic, simply because of the image he has projected in their minds....in other words, his prior-created impression in the minds of so many viewers itself perpetuates the humour we see......and that is one major area this movie plays on. In fact, evident it is that this movie paints Ethan in exactly the same colours he puts himself in in real life. So should we say that Zack fits the bill of Ethan, or Ethan fits the bill of Zack?And best of all, what really draws its strands together, and keeps it from plummeting down to the bottom of the scale is Ethans simplicity perpetuating his folly, giving rise to a killer recipe for humorous disaster....which we clearly get to taste throughout. And you can clearly see that even though they have run out of ideas, it still provides room for a bellyfull of laughs... This film hits all the right comedy beats!Ethans side, intertwined with Peter's frustration and desperation gives the plot its real foothold, and hence allowing the director to lace the plot with some brilliant ideas he comes up with.Stripping it down to its bare elements, we see Ethan as a major contributor.....Ethan, standing alone, contributes no solid value to the storyline...interestingly enough, he is one comedian in this film who, without a character as the object of his comedy, would simply stagnate, and create a quagmire of some sort. Peter becomes the "unfortunate" victim of Ethan, and the duo make for a killer subject-object combination. This is the true appeal of the show.....the fact that the comic person has an object for all his foolish contrivances......which we really get a taste of on two occasions: At the Western Union counter (the money-transfer incident) when the wheelchair-bound Western Union employee attacks Peter, and later on when we see that in such a massive car crash, Ethan not only escapes unhurt, but he manages to sleep through it. What we witness is what the director really wants us to know: that foolish and wacky he may be, but Ethan is really the "driving star" of the show. Escapes he, unhurt, and in fact, he only wakes up after the car is turned to shambles, while his guest has a broken arm and three cracked ribs.It is this star duo which prevents Due Date from completely misfiring. Sure it doesn't achieve the same status and appeal as The Hangover, but it injects enough adrenalin into Peter, and enough innocent folly into Ethan, to create a mojo effect which leaves us jonesing for more from the director Todd Williams.</fullReview>

Im not the type of person that laughs on any stupid joke!!!The movie is well directed, contains the funniest jokes and actions I've ever heard and seen, some of these jokes are even to intelligent to get at once and that's what makes it so funny. Zach Galifiankis is the future Jim Carrey. I've not seen a movie this funny for a long time, maybe this could be the funniest movie I've ever seen. Robert Downey Jr. is a great comedy supporter to Zach and the movie is a well-constructed comedy which is rare to find these days.I would HIGHLY recommend this movie for anyone, any age, and for any personality because I guarantee you that you'll laugh your ass of every 2 minutes like the whole of the theatre did!!</fullReview>

Lol really, look at how many movies today take bits and pieces or have the same ideas as another movie and are nothing like any of the originals people claim it to be from and how huge they have gotten.... Especially considering the movie is two decades away lol really , just let it go.As for Due Date, Yes the movie had dark points and there were sad points but not every comedy has to have meaningless laughter in it to make it a great comedy!!! I thought the role played by both Robert D. and Zack G. were both great and funny considering they are total opposites!!! As for Robert punching the kid and spitting in the dogs face , i thought were just outrageously a couple of my favorite parts of the movie cause its not something you expected and it just shows you how annoyed and upset his character really is having to deal what he's dealing with on the road lol. As for Zack's character i didn't expect him to play the exact character from Hangover and i quite frankly didn't want that cause then you might as well have just named him Allen in the Due Date movie and called it Hangover 1.5....... I thought he was still originally funny like always and it shows he can also play a non funny sensitive side that makes you feel bad for how clumsy and simple minded he is.Over all, all thought the movie was awesome!! Not AS MANY laughs as i was expecting but still very entertaining and recommend seeing in the theaters its worth!! You'll laugh , say OMG, almost cry, and want to see it again. Very good job on making this movie and can't wait for Hangover 2 from you guys!!!</fullReview>

My wife and I laughed throughout the entire thing. Imagine traveling across country with the most annoying stoner imaginable...this is what it would be like. This would have been a "10" but there were no outtakes at the end of the movie. There had to be some great outtakes! They should have added them. No nudity but lots of profanity. Don't take the kids!

		<shortDescription>Better than Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.Yet wouldn't exist without it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having recently received a Regal Movie gift card I knew "Due Date" would be a prime selection for it's use. To begin with I am very fond of Downey's and Zach G.'s work. I suppose there will be a slight bias to my opinion. Scene after scene it was a real giggle fest for me. Maybe not as over the top and nearly gross out as "The Hangover" but I found it was in good taste. Having watched Kiss kiss bang bang the night before I noticed that Downey's character in Due date was a lot like his predecessors, Val Kilmer in that well done film. Also Michelle Monaghan was in this picture also, so it gave me a real kick back from Kiss Kiss bang Bang.Anyway... Due Date I thought was more thoughtful and more just plane silly(a term of endearment) in it's script, acting and direction than trains, planes, and automobiles. I understand the nearly 20 years that separates them. Yet it seemed much more cozy of a film. That I know I will enjoy on DVD for years to come. Although ever since I had read the dismissal of this film as just a modern day rip off of "PTandA" I was immediately drawn to it, being a huge fan of it for many years.Yet to my amazement I was highly awoken in the theatre to it's difference in comparison and to it's greatness in contrast. In the end it is a bit of a raunchy comedy so I know many will not come to terms with it's subject matter. Yet flat out I found it as much of a step up to "TPandA" as one could create and make work. P.S. It's great that I am 24 going on 25... Since this film I know would have been one of those that I wouldn't been able to watch, since the level of Adult situation it contained. I know it will be one of those... You know.. The kids Love yet they aren't allowed to see..... but they will find a way :) As a moderator It isn't nothing to bad. And there isn't any of those Sexy love scenes.. That the Typical American Prude dreads so much. One with Michelle Monaghan would have been nice, yet you know... Ya can't win them all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With his most recent film, the 2010 movie 'Due Date,' director Todd Phillips ('Road Trip,' 'Hangover') has decided to take a different approach to cultivating his comedic talents into ninety-minutes after ten unbridled years of success. Instead of the witty and often hilarious one-liners constantly lighting the audience's smiles and occasionally unsettling their stomachs, he has now instead provided the audience with the dark, underground aspect of the comedy film. While it is undoubtedly incredibly hilarious at times, the offensive remarks thrown between the characters do at times expand into the realm of dark and uncomfortable comedy, and too many, this dialogue will no doubt be acknowledged as being disturbing rather than awkwardly funny. 'The Hangover,' this is not.The story follows the highly-strung Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jr.) as he meets and subsequently gets stranded with the eccentric wannabe actor Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis). With Peter needing desperately to get from Atlanta, Georgia back to Los Angeles as soon as possible for the birth of his first child, he must place his trust into the hands of Ethan. With no money, no identification, and the realisation that every time Peter enters a domestic airport, he will be searched in the most sacred of man areas, what follow is today's generations 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles'. As mentioned before however, this is not a John Hughes film by any standards.Peter is an angry, aggressive, ignorant, and ill-tempered middle-class businessman, who has little regard for others and their problems. When he can't settle an argument or situation using rationality, he instantly resorts to verbal, and sometimes, physical abuse. While Ethan is a vulnerable, well-intentioned human being, who unfortunately has many obnoxious qualities which would quite easily send the average person into a fit of insanity in mere moments. And it is through this relationship, where the film initially falters, before excelling in the final third of the film. For the first half of the film, the loathsome qualities of both men and their ability to kill the occasional emotional moment of connection with an often disconcerting flash of awkward humour, constantly keeps the audience at arm's length with regards to allowing them to empathise and connect with the characters and their situations. But this isolation, begins to break-down as we begin to learn that both men, are simply that; men, under the most stressful of situations and that while they may have initially resented each other to the point, they have both their underlying reasons why they both constantly end back up in other's company.Aside from the relationship between the two men, there is little else that the film tries to introduce to stir up the narrative of the film. The secondary characters such as Darryl (Jamie Foxx) as Peter's best-friend, and Heidi (Juliette Lewis) as a Craiglists drug-dealer, become slight restrictions in the boys road trip from coast-to-coast, but provide little else aside from momentary comic relief. 'Due Date' is a valiant effort in the contrasting character road-trip genre, but it just lacks any invigoration or invention that Phillip's previous outings provided for the audience. And by attempting to introduce prolonged scenes of disturbingly awkward comedic sequences that most often than not end in the audience squirming at what they have heard, rather than laughing at what was said or done, Phillips will have isolated his the loyal contingent of comedy fans who just want to break-away from the serious nature of life, rather than become engaged within it during the confines of a theatre visit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy that pushes decency way over the top</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Synopsis) Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jr.) must get to LA in five days to be at the birth of his firstborn. He is about to fly home from Atlanta when he is tasered by the Air Marshall, and he is put on the "no-fly" list. With no luggage, money, and ID, Peter has really hit rock bottom. Desperate to get home Peter is forced to accept the offer of Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis) to hitch a ride with him cross-country to Hollywood. For the next several days, Peter is going to regret his decision, because he will be harassed by endless personal questions from Ethan, and embarrassed by Ethan's comic antics and offensive behavior. Peter is about to have the most terrifying and agonizing journey of his life.(My Comment) The road trip itself is a collection of pratfall scenes that uses accidents, hijinks, disasters, pain, death, family, friends, and drugs to make you laugh at their expense. Robert Downey Jr. plays a smart architect who's life is great and going his way, whereas Zach Galifianakis's character has never achieved anything in life, but after the death of his father, he wants to make it big as an actor in Hollywood. Both men seem to be growing up during their road trip and seeing life in a different light. Ethan's actions are so outrageous at times, that you don't blame Peter for wanting to kill him. There are several crazy scenes that push decency way over the top, and you just want it to stop, even though you are laughing while it is being shown. There were many lines that were used only for shock value to get a laugh. The storyline seems lacking, but it is a comedy, and you will laugh during the whole movie. (Warner Bros. Pictures, Run Time 1:40, Rated R) (6/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good laugh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We went to the theater expecting to see something else discovered once we were there that the movie we had planned on wasn't showing and basically bought tickets for Due Date because nothing else was showing at that time. Lucky accident because 5 minutes into the movie we started giggling and didn't stop. The whole theater was laughing. It really was an enjoyable experience. I'd suggest it to anyone who is looking for a good comedy it was excellent! Robert Downey Jr.and Zach Galifianakis are an unlikely duo, and perhaps that is what makes it so believable. I don't usually choose comedies but found this to be unpredictable, witty and fun. I am surprised I haven't heard more about it-we'd both see it again and would buy it if it came out on video or CD later. A definite keeper!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely worth going to see!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few friends and I had the chance to catch this for free and we loved it! This movie was definitely worth checking out. From the beginning on we all laughed at the crazy antics of Galifianakis' character. A weird 'actor to be' type that drives Downey's character to see-red quite a bit through the movie. At times I was rooting for Downey to take the easier course, but there was good reason for him not to. Oh, the highlight of the movie for me (and there were plenty to be found!) was the 'baby-sitting' part! Downey does what everyone wishes they could do to annoying brats, haha. And another honorable mention would be the night they sleep in the car, oh boy was that disturbing but funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Downey Jr. and Galifianakis may be the new Laurel and Hardy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolutely funny movie. Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis are wonderful together. They are the modern day Laurel and Hardy. One is fastidious and pompous, the other a witless but lovable oaf. They get into all kinds of jams and of course whatever they do just makes things worse. There are many great one-liners and what is even better, the story is dynamic as the fellas are on the move - literally. They bicker, they fight, they yell, they laugh, they make up, they care about each other, they're friends. It's a cross country comedy. Along the way they meet all kinds of interesting and amusing characters which add to the movie's upbeat mood. This is a zany movie, one that keeps the audience's attention and makes the audience laugh. If you like slapstick comedy and want to watch a movie that is pure escapism then this movie is for you. It's worth the time. And if this movie spawns a sequel, hopefully it will star the two lead actors who did such a wonderful job in this first-rate comedy.</fullReview>
