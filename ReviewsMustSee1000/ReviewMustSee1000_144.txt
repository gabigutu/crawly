		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie on the plane the other day, trying to find something to keep me awake (as sleep on an airplane never leaves you rested, but merely with a stiff body).What I saw was, however - to my positive surprise - much more than just something to pass time, as I actually enjoyed it a lot.I find the plot quite fascinating and very original, and it has, with its unpredictability, more than just a few surprises in store. Granted, there are a few inconsistencies with the storyline, but I didn't see them as a big problem, as the movie, as a whole, works.All in all, a really good horror thriller, which keeps you guessing till the very end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original idea with conventional pitfalls.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the Julia's Eyes world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival a couple of days ago, and I have to say that although I was entertained, it did fall short of my expectations. Seeing how the film was produced by Guillermo del Toro, I was really hoping for a horror/thriller on par with Pans Labyrinth or The Orphanage.Julia's Eyes does have an original idea at its core and that's what keeps you guessing and entertained through the duration of the film. Unfortunately the film does fall into some cliché horror jump scares and the plot does not completely come together. It feels as though the filmmaker started with a great idea but wasn't fully able to pull it all together cohesively in the end. I want to keep this review spoiler free so I'm not going to get into any plot details, but suffice to say that the antagonist's plot line does not come to a rewarding conclusion.That said, I think there is a lot to like here, the acting is great, some wholly original ideas are explored and there is enough tense and truly scary scenes to keep most horror/thriller fans happy.Julia's Eyes is a film I enjoyed on the whole and I think people should seek out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but not totally satisfactory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Foremost, I am going to allow myself the indulgent whim of an editorial comment in order to express my disgust for the phrase: "(insert the name of a famous director) presents". In many movies (specially, from the fantastic genre, and even more specially when they were made by unknown directors), we have seen that tricky phrase before the title, like announcing the fact that a famous director was responsible for the film we are about to see. I perfectly understand the commercial utility from that ruse; and I imagine that many young and unknown directors can tolerate the humiliation of the semi-anonymity in exchange of the economical potential which represents the "approval" from a famous director. But even like that, I still think that that is a cheap trick which, above all things, has the "accidental" consequence of fooling to the spectators. I do not know about you, but I know many people who still think that The Nightmare Before Christmas was directed by Tim Burton, or that Guillermo del Toro directed El Orfanato, or that Hostel was directed by Quentin Tarantino. Is that an important problem? I guess it is not. That may not even reach the "problem" category. And I really do not have any solution or suggestion in order to solve the situation. After all, that is another necessary evil from marketing in order to attract more people to the cinema, or to sell more DVDs. But still, that is not enough for me to like it. End of the editorial comment.I had been thinking all that because Los Ojos de Julia is another film "presented" by a famous director, in this case, the previously mentioned del Toro. I highly doubt the fact that he had a real influence in the making of this film, but his name prominently appears in this film's publicity. Anyway, I think that that simultaneously is an advantage and a disadvantage, because even though that may make more people to see this film, many of them might expect one of the many supernatural fantasies full of special effects that that director uses to make, when the truth is that Los Ojos de Julia is a thriller with slight supernatural touches which may result too modest to the people who might expected to see Hellboy 3 or Pan's Labyrinth 2.I liked the first half from Los Ojos de Julia very much. The screenplay raises a fascinating and unpredictable mystery, which genuinely kept me in suspense during that while, because it was impossible for me to predict where the story was going. The previously mentioned "supernatural touches" are very well achieved, and they never reach the tiring extremes of "ghost woman with a long black hair" or "vengeful spirit from the past". In fact, there are various elements in order for us to doubt about the existence of supernatural factors in the story, because Guillem Morales' direction keeps on that thin line between the realism and the fantasy, with a lot of atmosphere but at the same time "real". However, all that does not avoid Los Ojos de Julia from having some clichés, from the chases through dark underground corridors which seem ten times longer of the building they are in, to the mysterious old man who warns the main character on the danger she runs if she keeps investigating, without forgetting about the unbelievers policemen who do not take the desperate theories from the main character seriously.Speaking of which, Belén Rueda makes an excellent work on her dual role of Sara and Julia (even though she only appears as Sara for a few minutes). Her performance is even more appreciated during the second half of the movie, when the tense initial narrative starts to crumble with a sudden twist to the melodrama, anchoring the movie into a much more predictable and conventional formula, which we have already seen in too many North American movies. Fortunately, that did not avoid Rueda from keeping the necessary energy and conviction in order to make that second half entertaining and lead us to an appropriate, but somewhat corny, ending. Anyway, I think it is a shame the fact that Los Ojos de Julia betrayed its excellent first half with a poor second one, but it still has enough positive elements to recommend it, like Rueda's performance, the good atmosphere and the fact that it is entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start with the GOOD POINTS: 1) Good leading actors who acted naturally and were credible. Although I felt that the too much focus was givem to the actress's cleavage. She is a beautiful woman. There s no need to get viewer's attention to something else than her face.2) Nice, dark atmosphere and surroundings.3) Feeling of desperation, fear - needed in horror.BAD: 1) The ending. Too much of a coincidence and twists (blind neighbour's secret - why would she do that, mother-son situation) 2) Mystery man who followed her (Why would he do that? Especially as he couldn't know she was going blind at first)3) Affair thing - very unconvincing for me 4) Her husband's suicide - not exactly explained. How could this thin man hang him? If it was him? Or why would her husband kill himself? Out of guilt? I don't get that.5) Lea girl and her weird behavior. Couldn;t she warn Julia just after she went out of her father's house. Why wait and braek into somebody's house? So, not exactly a good movie, although seems so at the beginning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Julia, (Belen Rueda) like her twin sister Sara suffers from a degenerative nerve disease which is slowly but surely turning her blind, with her twin having succumbed to total blindness earlier. When her sister dies, apparently of a suicide, Julia feels there's something not quite right. Her sister wasn't depressed, and in fact had been looking forward to a potentially curable operation. Plus, there's rumours of Sara having had a mysterious boyfriend. But why didn't he go the funeral? Doubted by her Psychologist husband Isaacs (Lluis Homar) Julia resolves to investigate. But her disease is getting worse, and she keeps feeling that somebody is watching her every move. Is she cracking up? Or is something more sinister at play here?Julia's Eyes starts off very promising indeed, with a gripping first hour, as director Guillem Morales ratchets up the tension with some clever visual tricks and an increasingly dark and creepy tone, as well as some entertaining red herrings.However, by the third act, it unfortunately gets kinda... silly. It also unfortunately has a rather ludicrous revelation, as well as some clichéd bad decision making on the part of the protagonist. It also could have been a leaner affair, being rather needlessly overlong. As well as this, the film doesn't really cover all the elements of its rather layered plot as well as it could have, with one or two loose ends that will very probably have the viewer raising a suspicious eyebrow.That having said, it has some decent performances, is pretty absorbing and again, has a nigh on excellent first half.Any horror or chiller fan should find much to like here, but ultimately it comes across as rather dissatisfying, considering its ambition.7/10- A solid enough film, that's worth checking out overall, but potentially could have been excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Julia's Eyes a very sophisticated thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was actually a pleasant surprise. I liked the beginning because it could of went the supernatural way or the other. The first half kinda toys with you about the death of Julia's sister and keeps you guessing where this is going to go. The setting and the good of this film is very good because it is very scary and tense. There is this great scene where Julia was in the bathroom with the other blinds and they "sensed" something which I won't reveal. I loved that this film was not predictable like the other mindless horror/thriller films. This film has believable twists, not just something out the blue or for shock. I believe that this film works because of the actress. She carried the movie very well. I actually liked her character which is hard to do in horror films. I actually liked the chemistry between Julia and her husband..it wasn't cheesy or over the top...it was very endearing. I loved the ending....She was actually smart and very real. Go check this out and you won't regret it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm usually very cautious with my expectations towards Spanish horror/thrillers, especially if they look a little supernatural-themed and receive a lot of praise from beforehand. "Julia's Eyes" showed these characteristics, what with being produced by golden boy Guillermo Del Toro and all, but since it played at the Belgian Festival of Fantastic Films I still definitely wanted to see it. I'm glad to say "Julia's Eyes" is a tense and well-scripted thriller that is rather straightforward in its shocks and horror, rather than exaggeratedly suggestive and ghostly. It has been proved in the past that thrillers with blind female protagonists can scare quite effectively. The ravishing Belén Rueda joins the good company of Mia Farrow in "See No Evil" and Audrey Hepburn in "Wait Until Dark"; blind or narrowly blind damsels in distress who nevertheless fight back courageously. Julia suffers from a rare hereditary ailment which slowly but surely causes her to go blind. In order not to accelerate the forthcoming blindness, Julia must avoid all sorts of emotional stress. That's easier said than done, of course, especially when she discovers that her twin sister Sarah ? who struggled with the same disease ? committed suicide in the basement of her house. Julia refuses to accept that her sister solely killed herself because the eye operation failed and begins to dig into her private life, much against the will of her devoted husband Isaac. Julia discovers the existence of a mysterious and invisible man in Sarah's life, someone who may have drove her to commit suicide or even killed her. But then Julia collapses and loses her vision. The operation to save her sight is performed, but the first few weeks she'll have to live in darkness though with the help of a private nurse. It is during this period that Julia experiences exactly what her sister went through during her final moments? The plot of "Julia's Eyes" is quite convoluted, with many characters that each have their own peculiarities and secrets. Nevertheless, director &amp; co-writer Guillem Morales knows to maintain the suspense at a continuously high level and ? even more importantly ? the fear remains realistic and almost sensible. Especially the sequences taking place in the first few days after Julia's operation, when the audience is supposed to be as blind as the heroine herself, are extremely tense and unsettling. It's also during this period that the script contains a few harsh and totally unexpected shock moments that will surprise even the most experienced horror fanatics. During the last half hour, "Julia's Eyes" drops all allures of being a superior &amp; sophisticated thinking man's thriller and literally turns into an old-fashioned bona-fide horror flick with nasty images and grotesque plot twists. I thought it was fantastic! The acting performances are terrific, with Belén Rueda basically deserving an Oscar for her role and Lluis Homar and Pablo Derqui providing excellent support. Highly recommended</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The same team - actress (Belen Rueda),producer (Guillermo Del Toro) , musician (Fernando Velazquez) , cameraman (Oscar Faura)- who made ¨The orphanage¨ bring us another terror film , ¨The Julia's eyes¨ or ¨Los Ojos de Julia¨ . And again a wonderful Belen Rueda as semi-blind woman in a movie with intense sequences of horror and suspense . The story deals with a mature woman named Julia (Belen Rueda in a double role) married a psychologist (Luis Homar) , she is slowly losing her vision by a degenerative ill whilst attempting to investigate the mysterious death of her twin sister named Sara (Belen Rueda) , also blind , who supposedly committed suicide . An old woman (Julia Gutierrez Caba) leads her to Baumann Center where Sara had relations to other blind women . Later on , finding alone in a house is terrorized by strange events . She is pursued by a psycho but can't hide in the dark . This is a highly suspenseful and cerebral mystery that tells about a woman losing his sight and being helped by his husband . It's a battle of wits between an intelligent almost blind woman and an evil villain and winds up pitting two rival, the obstinate blind woman and the brutal psycho against each other in order to save herself and destroy them both.The film contains tension , thriller, drama , mystery , plot twists and shocks , including decent scares with tense terror sequences especially in its final part , in a creepy denouement , near of the end with a crazy killer trying to murder her . The picture is thrilling and some moment brilliant, and the actors are quite reliable as Belen Rueda , Luis Homar and special appearance by veteran Julia Gutierrez Caba . Although is sometimes slow moving and stagy , however is entertaining for continuous suspense . Belen Rueda is sensational in one of her best films along with ¨El Orfanato¨ . Sinister and mysterious atmosphere is finely photographed by cameraman Oscar Faura . Suspenseful and stirring musical score by Fernando Velazquez who previously composed for successful terror films as ¨The orphanage¨ , ¨For the God of others¨ and ¨Devil¨ . The film is well produced by the great producer/director Guillermo Del Toro . The motion picture is professionally written and directed by Guillen Morales who formerly realized ¨The uninvited guest¨ also dealing with violent confrontation among two characters . The movie will appeal to suspense enthusiasts and Belen Rueda fans. Rating : acceptable and passable . It's well worth watching and contains some really eerie scares and disturbing images .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the Darkness We Fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A stellar film directed by Guillem Morales. What I expected was not what I got and that may be why I loved this film. With an helping hand from the always wonderful Guillermo Del Toro, this manages to be a little bit of everything. Creepy, funny, endearing and shocking. You never know where the film is heading. It follows Julia, a woman who is suffering from degenerative sight disease (DSD), who finds her twin sister , Sara, hanging from the basement in her house. Although the authorities believe it to be a tragic suicide, Julia is adamant that she was murdered and seeks to uncover the truth. In an effort to retrace her sister's final steps, Julia finds herself drawn into a dark world where nothing is at it seems. As those nearest and dearest to her are killed off and her sight begins to disappear, Julia is confined to her sister's house. And finds herself rapidly facing a nightmare from which she cannot escape. There are a lot of subtle hints in 'Julia's Eyes' that I genuinely like as much of the film is shown from the perspective of Julia's progressive blindness rather than those around her. I have a lot of respect for Belén Rueda (as Julia) in this. I thought she was beautiful in The Orphanage, her acting was subtle; not overplayed and I honestly thought she could not top the performance. As expected, I was wrong. For this role to be good was really not an option because you had to really feel for the character, not just when it came to the tension of the piece but also the ability to make an endearing role whereby you feel for her as her sight begins disappearing. She managed a mammoth task by doing this. Whilst the crux of the story is about finding out what happened to her sister it does change direction soon thereafter to what will happen to Julia and her sight. Of course the twist lies in the truth of what happened to Sara and that combined with the darkness of her own predicament, is stunningly done. It's a slow burner that really grips you from start to finish. I do like that from the start of this film they show Julia's boyfriend completely yet beyond this, it changes tact. Many of the cast who come into the film from this point on, you hardly see their faces if at all, it's a nod to the condition and how it takes precedence over the course of 'Julia's Eyes' The opening scene is cleverly written as the tension really grips you. And throughout this film is not dialogue heavy, relatively light yet it captures the emotion of the piece. There's not a lot of special effects, some nice make up though. Anything bloody feels and equally looks real. However it's not that much. It has nothing to do with the age rating but instead the draw of the film lies in putting many of the scenes in darkness. The viewer cannot see what is really happening and nor can the main characters, it adds an eerie quality to the truly terrifying moments of which there are quite a few. Potential SPOILER below; There is one scene in the film where the point of a knife finds itself barely inches from Julia's eyes and you'd be hard pressed not to cringe in fear. There is something about the eyes and the danger they are placed in that makes me feel very nervous and that entire scene my body was covered in goosebumps. This is a small show of what the film can and does do. Its score is composed fantastically. Those musical minutes reach surprising heights however to compliment the darkest pieces, it's just a few notes here and there, done at the right opportunity to capture the emotion and yes, the fear. In terms of the scenery, there is not that much. Some gorgeous houses, hotels but beyond that it is quite sated. There is a lot of greys and whites around the other colours and they tend to drown out the more prominent colours that do exist. It's not a bad thing. Too much vibrancy would have ruined the feeling of the film, the starker colours however give it a little more texture. Past the usual praises there really is a lot I can recommend about the film. The acting is top notch, the scares aren't just done for effect and the underlying story has a bitter-sweet edge to it. It begins slowly with that one scene to pulp it up, but the more Julia presses on, the more those terrors begin to surface. It's a clever film that carries some very subtle hints within. And it is hard not to become engrossed in the film and where it is ending. The ending with Julia is absolutely beautiful and yet heartbreaking. And for the first time in a film that is based around the thriller element, I can say I did cry as it tugs deeply at the heartstrings. It's not atypical, don't go into this expecting the usual scares, it's more than that and if you want to take a journey into something much different I can highly recommend this film. Engaging, genuinely terrifying and sweet, this for me was the film of 2010.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mindblowing Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watched "Julia's Eyes" Original Title-(Los Ojos de Julia)-I got this movie in my collection from one of my Friend's collection. It's a ? Spanish Movie which I got with English subtitles. When yesterday I selected this movie to watch I had no idea what kind of movie it was and so I also had no expectations from it. Just knew that it's a movie of different language, different genre so may be there would be something new but when the Movie started I just jumped out from my chair. It was really a spine chilling moment which grabbed my whole attention towards the movie and this attention remained as such throughout the movie. Every Scene, short dialogues, murder clues, every drama I was just enjoying by watching repeatedly with the help of the rewind button of my laptop.The movie started with the mysterious death of Sara. She was found hanging in the basement of her own house where she lived alone. She was blind due to a degenerative disease of her eyes. Police tried to loosening the case thinking that she was committed suicide because of loneliness and depression but her twin sister Julia, who was also suffering from the same degenerative disease in her eyes and rapidly deteriorating her sights didn't believe that it was a suicide. While doing her own way of searching the mystery of her sister's death Julia came to know that Sara was undergone a surgery on her eyes with the hope of regaining her sight. Also she found some clues of a mysterious boyfriend of Sara. Simultaneously with the run someone always tried to swipe away all the data, clues and even murdered the persons who knew anything about the case.The first one hour was so intense, so twists n turns that one could not made an idea in which way the movie was going. Last 30 mins there was also a brilliant Cat- Mouse duel between Julia and the murderer.After watching the movie I read from the internet that it was the same team- actress (Belen Rueda), producer (Guillermo Del Toro), musician (Fernando Velazquez), cameraman (Oscar Faura) - who made "Orphanage" previously. The same team again delivered an Intelligent, Tight gripped, spine chilling thriller which is original in its nature. Regarding acting everyone was brilliant. Belen Rueda was in a dual role in this movie (Sara n Julia). She was just terrifying throughout the movie. You can just watch this movie only for her acting if you keep every other things apart. Cinematography was brilliant in every part. Script writing, direction, technique with playing light n shadow just compel you to tighten your sit belt throughout the movie.On a whole Guillermo Del Toro was again delivered a movie which was surprisingly good and taught everyone what the definition of a thriller is. A MUST SEE for every thriller movie lovers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Los ojos de Julia (Julia's Eyes) is directed by Guillem Morales who also co-writes the screenplay with Oriol Paulo. It stars Belen Rueda, Lluis Homar and Julia Gutierrez Caba. Music is by Fernando Velazquez and cinematography by Oscar Faura.After her blind twin sister mysteriously hangs, Julia (Rueda) refuses to accept it as suicide and begins to investigate the events herself. Unfortunately she is also becoming afflicted by the same degenerative eyesight that affected her sister. Can she solve the case before here eyesight completely fails? Can she stay alive, even, especially as dark forces appear to be closing in on her.There has been some rather nifty horror movies come out of Spain in the last ten years or so, Julia's Eyes is another welcome addition off of the production line. The blind/eyes afflicted girl in peril formula is hardly new, with very good formula spookers already existing having come out of Asia and America, how nice to find that this Spanish entry is as good as any of them.Guillermo Del Toro is once again on producing duty, continuing his crusade to give upcoming Spanish horror directors their chance in movie world. OK! So it's not unfair to say that many a horror fan would like to see Del Toro directing such material himself, but his presence is felt here, where much like El Orfanato (The Orphanage) the atmosphere that pervades the picture is Del Toroesque.Julia's Eyes is very much a blending of thriller conventions, where it deals in psychological discord, slasher traits and whodunit mystery shenanigans. Mix them up with dashes of Gothic and Giallo and you are good to go for edge of your seat/breath holding entertainment. Thematic thrust comes by way of viewer voyeurism, and some scenes are macabre in construction, with one involving blind girls in a locker room really tingling the gooseflesh.The colour scheme ranges from misty tinted coldness to tech-noir starkness, and the sound work is terrific, especially once Julia is handicapped by her bandaged eyes and we the audience need to buy into her dangerously dark world. Camera techniques, also are smart, with Morales cleverly not showing us the faces of those interacting with Julia once her eyes fail her, again this puts us in her world.At nearly two hours in length, film is a touch too long, which when you consider there is no real great character development to speak of, is a bit annoying. However, this is about atmosphere and a genuine chill factors, a picture that gnaws away at the senses throughout and leads us to a poignant finale. Rueda, just as she was in The Orphanage, is terrific, and Julia's Eyes, much like The Orphanage, is also terrific. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable, highly unpredictable thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A respectable blend of drama and horror, using strengths of both but also succumbing occasionally to the weaknesses.Suspense is present from the very beginning, building to an exciting and unexpected climax, unfortunately falling a bit flat afterward. In fact, the last 30 seconds of the film somewhat blemish the drama of the story as a whole, mostly because the ending touches on a relationship that was hardly explored and not at all significant through the rest of the film, partly because of the focus on the very thing that makes this movie good: the constant twists and turns in the story. This also leads to some ideas that are passable but don't make nearly as much sense as they're supposed to; particularly the whole "people who aren't seen"/"There was no man with her (Sara)"/"Don't look at me!" motif. I still don't get it, but it has little impact on the story anyway.I believe the entirety of the story could have used some fine tuning, and run time could have been trimmed by 10 to 15 minutes... But overall it's engaging, well acted, and sets an excellent and fitting mood visually. Thrillers that can't project the protagonist's experience to the viewer fail horribly... this movie does an outstanding job providing a sense of confinement that fits the title character's world, and this is where its greatest strength lies.Although character relationships are a bit thin and suspense doesn't hit many high notes, this is a fairly exciting thrill ride and a good effort all around. One last thing, I would recommend watching it without distraction... the mood is more visual and in the flow of the story than it is intellectual or suspenseful, and it's easy to lose interest if you step away for a few minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm always skeptical of horror films which use consistent jumpscares to frighten the audience instead of more honest, creative methods. Happily, Julia's eyes contains a grand total of one jumpscare, meaning the rest of the film had to find another way of being scary, and I'm happy to report that it didn't disappoint. This has to be one of the only films that has genuinely creeped me out, and it's down to the excellent writing, directing and production. Unfortunately, I can't say that about many other horror films these days.I only came across this film by chance as it was on television one night. I decided to give it a go, which turned out to be a pretty good decision. This is now one of my favourites in the horror genre - brilliantly written and gripping all the way through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! When I saw Julia's Eyes for ?3 in Morrisons the other day, I thought I may as well buy it, as it's something I've had my eye on for years and eventually forgotten about, probably due to the mediocre reviews. So I was expecting something of a mediocre film. What I wasn't expecting was another Spanish horror classic that was packed with nail-biting suspense and masterful direction. Either I'm a fool, or Julia's Eyes is one of the most under-rated horror films of its year!Julia's Eyes opens extremely strongly with the murder of her sister and from then on it just gets better and better. You know you're in for a superb ride, right from the beginning as it shows off some outstanding cinematography and directional flare, which the film only builds up right until the terrific climax! What Julia's Eyes does well for the first half is establish characters and relationships which is a thing most American horror films do poorly. In fact, the first half doesn't seem like it belongs much in the horror genre at all, which isn't a bad thing because the third act more than makes up for it. Besides, the characters are so well established and likable you're likely not to care. Belen Rueda puts on another fantastic performance, she's extremely believable as a blind woman and also makes herself very likable.The first half acts more as an engaging mystery thriller with Belen investigating her sister's so-called suicide, much to her husband's disappointment. There are some excellent stand-out moments such as a wonderful POV murder where no one notices the man fleeing the scene. It adds a supremely thick air of mystery and another dimension to the films themes. It's as much about loneliness than anything else.Things become extremely disorientating once Julia becomes inevitably blind and it works very effectively to the film's advantage. We never see anyone else's face once she becomes blind so everyone becomes a suspect as the audience loses their sight as much as Julia does. The remainder of the film simply doesn't let go and becomes a thrilling and frantic fight for survival. By the end of it I felt worn out and also highly satisfied. Morales builds up heaps and heaps of tension and suspense, he could easily give Hitchcock a run for his money! I was squirming in my seat, shouting at the TV and gasping. All these are signs of a highly effective and masterful shocker.In some of it you feel as confused and paranoid as Julia does. And whilst the identity and motives of the killer may not be all that incredible, he's still very creepy and believable. There are some fantastic chase sequences and never-ending tension. It builds up to an exciting finale, to which you might need to find your breath back. Yes, Julia's Eyes may not be up there with The Orphanage or REC but it's not damn far! It's a solid horror/thriller which made me feel involved and entertained. There isn't much gore, but it certainly doesn't hold back when it needs to and also includes possibly the ballsiest eye squirming sequence since Zombie Flesh Eaters. Julia's Eyes is a Spanish masterpiece. It looks great and also has enough depth to make you feel involved. I'd highly recommend, you might find yourself s surprised as I was!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Julias Eyes was one of the tensest movies I have seen in a long time. I left the cinema truly scared of the shadows, but that is what i was expecting when i went in.I am of two minds about the film. It was both very well and very badly done. The story itself was quite a muddle with many characters popping in with seemingly meaningful parts to just be forgotten about in the midst of the mayhem. The story lines that did pull through til the end were amazing. The scenes shot where Julia was losing her sight were great, making such good use of shadows to create a fear of the unknown. Also the cuts to pure darkness created a lot of suspense and sympathy for Julia.It was frustrating the lack of sympathy and understanding the authorities gave to Julia in her situation. And also the gaping lack of friends or relatives she seemed to have. Many of the characters were very strange particularly the old man in the basement of the hotel who wouldn't tell her who the killer was, Lia and her dad.... "he is just lonely and your attractive" what a totally relevant excuse to try to rape a distraught blind lady who had just been attacked in her house. And Lia stealing the key and then hanging it up in her hallway!?!?! The killer was a great character with that intense flash camera hiding so easily and always being one step ahead, seemingly predicting her every move makes a great horror protagonist. Although, her decision to go home to her sisters house following her operation (actually heard a few laughs in the cinema) and the subsequent arrival of her 'carer' Ivan made it all very obvious who the bad guy was.I think it is only my love for scary movies that lets me cover the massive holes in this movie and leave me with mostly positive recollections. I don't know that Guillermo Del Toro really needed to "present" this film, I think it could have done well enough on its own steam especially with Belen Rueda as the lead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this not knowing exactly what to expect, due to the mixed reviews. While it is slow ISH to burn (at about 2 hrs length), I felt like it offered enough twists and turns along the way to keep you very engaged and on the edge of your seat. I felt like the storyline was quite original, and the movie does a great job of showing how Julia loses her sight over time, with certain scenes done from her point of view. All the actors play their parts very well (rare among most thrillers I feel). I watch a lot of horror/thriller movies, and while this isn't a horror movie, it definitely scared me! Contrary to other reviewers, I actually really enjoyed the ending. It's quite moving and goes very well with the story. Overall, a recommended view for anyone into a good thriller with 2 hrs on their hands.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The leading lady Belen Rueda is gorgeous....this is what captured my attention to begin with. She is a pretty good actress, very expressive and convincing and the supporting cast is very good too. The movie is set in a small village in Spain and the visuals are very believable and the lighting decor etc is natural and free of gaudy colours as usually seeing in Hollywood flicks. The first half of the movie has palpable tension,there are many scary moments in the movie. Alas the last 20 minutes were not up to the mark...it was as if the rest was so majestic that there was no good way to end it all. In short a Spanish original film(subtitled),not the typical puerile slasher type Hollywood teen nonsense. Either watch and enjoy the original or wait for Hollywood to bring out a dumbed out version in a year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Spanish horror cinema is one of the big surprises of recent years. The orphanage, and less-in measure-REC REC 2 showed signs of the vitality of a genre that scares when it comes forward with a Spanish accent.Julia's Eyes is a psychological thriller where a woman who is going blind in the middle of her job has the sensation that she is being strangled after that she shortly receives news that her sister who is already blind due to both having a genetic illness they both share, committed suicide (the myth that twins,can feel when something happens to his/her sibling at the same time)which is never brought again in the film,Julia who knew her sister pretty well knows that it wasn't a suicide but murder instead.This is an excellent hook for a thriller that, relatively speaking, could be related more with old mysteries of Alfred Hitchcock or the early films of Dario Argento.In fact it would not be unusual for Alone in the Dark (1967), Terrence Young film with Audrey Hepburn would have represented some influence in this story, as they have some points in common.The tension in the film is produced by great acting specially from Belen Rueda, the strong band and effectiveness of the sound effects,angle shots framing( there's a brilliant technique in the middle of the film that gives an idea on how a blind person interacts with someone that they can not see), photography, and the locations. it has some minor flaws in the plot but above all its a terrific film to enjoy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well put together. Moody, Slow... more of an old-fashioned Thriller than a Horror film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, the quality of the film is very good. IF you are the kind of person who doesn't mind or actually likes Foreign Horror / Thrillers AND you don't like them too extreme, then you should enjoy this one.One thing though, is that it is VERY old fashioned, slow, and does NOT pander along the lines of today's modern Gore-Soaked Horror films. Although, it DOES have a few well done Horror elements that are very effective. It almost plays like a Spanish Alfred Hitchcock film. The pacing is EXTREMELY deliberate, but it steadily and effectively builds a level of tension. BUT, again... Very important; IF you DON'T really care for very SLOW films, or if you prefer more in your face Horror, then you will definitely NOT like it.All in all, strictly as a Horror film, I wouldn't say that it is one of my very favourites. However, when I write reviews here, my main concern is to be as accurate as possible and in my lowly and wretched opinion try to portray the film as objectively as I can. And... VERY importantly, whether I feel that it is a quality film or not. This one definitely is. For me personally, I REALLY liked the Guillermo Del Toro produced 'THE ORPHANAGE'. THAT movie really is more my kind of Horror film. There is much more emphasis on mood and atmosphere with strong Psychological / Supernatural overtones. So, films more along the lines of 'THE ORPHANAGE' or the similar British period Horror film about a Haunted Boarding School, 'THE AWAKENING', and the INTENSELY Psychological and unsettling 'SESSION 9' are really more my type of Horror.But, with that said, this one is done very well and is quite involving throughout. Like another reviewer mentioned here, this really is more of a Thriller as opposed to a Horror film, but within that Genre it is very well executed. HOWEVER... Do keep in mind the rather slow and old-fashioned pacing...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the intro, a blind woman named Sara is pursued by some man. It looks like she's about to commit suicide, but then the man "helps" her to her death.Sara's sister is Julia. She arrives at the house and refuses to believe that Sara committed suicide even though that's what everyone concluded. Julia also suffers from the same unspecified ocular condition that causes progressive blindness. At the beginning of the movie, Julia has 70% vision, a few minutes later she is completely blind.She sets out to investigate on her own what happened to Sara and hears from other blind woman about Sara's boyfriend. Yet no one else seems to have seen or known about this invisible man. Except for a hotel's custodian who tells her there is indeed a man who projects no light/life/spark. Julia herself now is being chased by this invisible man. Her loving husband doesn't believe any of it until he finally agrees to help her, disappears, and then his corpse is found hanging in Sara's house- another "clear" case of suicide according to cops. In her search she meets various strange neighbors, yet another blind woman, a creepy man and his daughter, whose face isn't shown.Julia undergoes some eye transplant surgery. Her eyes have to be covered so she is assigned someone to care for her. For a good part of the movie, the camera never shows who this kind caretaker is. Julia even falls for him. The neighbor's girl shows up and tells her that she's in serious trouble if she stays with him. The fact that his face isn't shown until she removes her bandages is a hint at who this man is.Julia's Eyes has some of the characteristics of Spanish horror films. It's somewhat fantastic, it's very human, slower, has a lot of meaningful details, and is filmed only in shades of brown/gray. It's is surprisingly watchable, has it's jump out of your seat moments and a bit of violence. Belen Rueda is an attractive woman, and the director knows it. But one has to be somewhat in a fantasy mode, even though it seems to aim for realism, because the behavior of the characters is so mind-boggling and dumb at times. Meanwhile, the dialogue shows brilliance, insight, and tenderness. This movie is about 15-20 minutes too long with Julia running around all over the place, slowly because she rarely can see well, and bumping into everything. In the end everything falls into place and is explained. But the greatest weakness remains the improbable and nonsensical actions the characters are required to take for the sake of the story. This is becoming somewhat common and odd. Scriptwriters should use a bit more imagination to advance their story without forcing their characters to act in ways no rational person would.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the death of the blind Sara (Belén Rueda), who hung herself in the basement of he house, her twin sister Julia (Belén Rueda) suspects that she was actually murdered. Julia has a degenerative problem in her eyes and is losing her sight and she temporarily moves with her husband Isaac (Lluís Homar) to Sara's house to arrange her funeral. Julia goes to the Centro Baumann for blinds where Sara frequented and she learns from the others blind users that Sara had a boyfriend. Julia is chased by a mysterious man but the police inspector Dimas (Francesc Orella) does not believe on her. Julia follows the last steps of Sara trying to find the identity of her secret lover. Julia is surrounded by deaths and weird events while she loses her sight. Is she also delusional? "Los Ojos de Julia" is an atmospheric film but flawed and misguider. The director gives the sensation of a supernatural story and ends like a "giallo" blended with "Blind Terror". The name of Guillermo del Toro, who is the producer, is also used to mislead the viewers. Belén Rueda has a magnificent performance; the cinematography and the camera work are excellent; the plot is intriguing; but the resolution is very disappointing. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Os Olhos de Júlia" ("The Eyes of Julia")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Los Ojos De Julia" may be a notch below "El Cuerpo", which came out two years later and has some of the same people involved in its making, but it's still a very good thriller: it's suspenseful, atmospheric, and has some extraordinarily well-conceived and executed cat-and-mouse sequences (especially near the end when Belén Rueda removes the bandages from her eyes but has to keep pretending that she can't see). The use of light and shadow, as well as the general use of the camera in this movie, should be used as teaching tools in film schools! Rueda is a vulnerable yet strong female lead, she gives the film her all. The script does contain one hard-to-swallow contrivance - or is that two: that Rueda would prefer to go back to her house right after the operation rather than being taken care of at the hospital, and that the police would let her. I also thought the ending (spoiler!) is overly cruel to her character: yes, she survives, but she has basically lost everything. She could have at least regained her eyesight. *** out of 4.</fullReview>

There are plenty of plot twists to keep the audience guessing; a little old lady that lives around the corner and a creepy neighbour and his daughter. Great performances all round with Belén Rueda getting the nod from me as the most notable. I did find it a little overcomplicated in places, but it did all pan out in the end. Over all, a nicely put together tense drama with elements that the Slasher and Horror genre fans will lap up; worth a look.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 6.7/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Thriller than Horror, but profound! Highly recommended!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In almost all my reviews I introduce myself as a horror-freak, to make sure potential readers know that I'm no professional critic, but have a vast experience and fascination with horror films. Horror, not so much thriller.Julia's Eyes, while having many Horror aspects, is mostly a thriller, and in my opinion - a very good one, much underrated. The story is very original (though I've seen some reviews and comments comparing it some sort of Italian genre that I've never seen) and well told, the characters are interesting and intriguing, and the acting lacks for nothing.Perhaps my favorite feature in horror films is the twists, and in this film they start right around the middle and continue in great numbers until the end. For me - that's no less than a treat. At any given time we think we know something, then find out we were wrong, or knew only half what we've been thinking we know. I've seen some complaints about the film allegedly presenting itself as being a supernatural- horror/thriller, then not following through and turning out to be "nothing more" than a murderer/cat-mouse-chase type. If you ask me - that's been just another one of the film's twists. Making the spectators believe something is supernatural when it isn't - only goes to show how excellent this film is.A lot of the footage is supposed to be seen as if from the eyes of people with degenerative eyesight, so it makes perfect sense why something that's just scary and unnerving would appear supernatural, director Guillem Morales simply "let us in" his creation and made us see (or rather not see) as the protagonist did.Coming to think of it, while the Thriller part may have been slightly more dominant, there were many startling and frightening parts, and I personally was at the edge of my seat the entire time. And as a bonus - the drama bits portraying the love story of Julia and Issac were beautiful and touching, adding a very fitting pinch of romance to the film.All in all, I've had a great time watching this film, and went through exactly what director Morales meant for me to go through. Seeing this film rating only 6.5 here feels like no less than a travesty, and I'll happily do my share and rate it the 8 I believe it deserves. Highly recommended!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The work of a great upcoming director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a bit silly/corny, mainly due to the script that allows too many psychopaths to appear for the story to remain credible. BUT, this is also the work of an incredibly talented visual director, who explores the themes of seeing/being blind in a very creative way. The challenge here is to "visualize" blindness in a way that a seeing audience can relate to, and the director does this very convincingly. E-g. in the scenes between Julia and the caretaker, the caretaker is always filmed without showing his face, which allows the viewer to feel the same uncertainty about his identity and intentions that the main character feels. There is also a beautiful scene where the caretaker transforms into Julia's former lover through a simple camera movement, a scene that visually explains how Julia projects her feelings towards her lover onto the caretaker. Another plus in my book is the empathy the film shows in regards to actual blind people. it takes its subject seriously and in fact lets the audience, at least to some extent, experience the pain of loosing one's eyesight. I rented this movie believing that it was the work of Guillermo el Toro, and, although I find that it lacks a bit of this great director's originality, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the visual creativity of Guillem Morales was on par, if not surpassing, the level of his mecenate.</fullReview>

That's the real sense of horror to be enjoyed in my view.Well coming to the point, yes this was a good attempt. I see the horror films of 80s; they are also good, because they have the sense of classic without any SFX. In the new era added SFX creates more spine chills and throat soaked. I agree with it but even then some directors make useless things, like I saw a movie "the ward" and I was totally taken back, not by horror but by the logics and acts that was being performed. Every girl was a hot girl and they had nothing else to do except to be maniac.In my view, this was a very good attempt, apart from adding SFX, director did a very good effort and to my view it was quite met the hopes.</fullReview>

The second half is an utter disappointment.The supernatural elements -- Sara talking to an "empty" room, the hand on the shoulder, etc. -- prove to have been an utter con. But worse is that the previously sympathetic, blind heroine then chooses to recuperate from her one chance, once in a lifetime operation alone in the isolated home where her sister and husband had previously betrayed her and died in mysterious circumstances. At that point, it lost all credibility.And the boobs keep coming. That Julia never bothered to quiz the girl next door early on in proceedings was bonkers. That the killer was the son of the "blind" neighbor was obvious from the get go -- otherwise why bother mentioning the subject. That Julia was still mooning over her feckless, unfaithful husband at the end was preposterous.Del Toro not only did himself a disservice by lending his name to this, he did the audience one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Welcome Spanish Import...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guillem Morales's film 'Los ojos de Julia' (English translation: 'Julia's Eyes') is another recent Spanish import from the production desk of Guillermo Del Toro which manages to adequately combine an engaging plot with many well-orchestrated visual sequences.Julia (Belen Rueda) is devastated when she finds out that her sister twin Sara (also played by Rueda) has committed suicide, apparently due to her inability to cope with her recent blindness which is part of a genetic disease that will effect both sisters throughout their lifetimes. Sensing something is wrong and with her sight slowly fading, Julia alongside her husband Isaac (Lluis Homar) sets out to investigate her lingering suspicions surrounding her sister's death. Including an apparent boyfriend that nobody can ever recall seeing nor can they describe him and the myriad of characters which she encounteres throughout her existence. As Julia's sight begins to slowly fade, she must attempt to unravel the mystery behind her sister's death.Where Morales makes 'Julia's Eyes' work is in the combination of subtle close-up shots, atmospheric lighting and the alternating use of diegetic and non-diegetic sound, he and cinematographer Oscar Faura literally place the viewer within the confines of central protagonist. Instead of simply utilizing the age-old, and overcooked mainstream cinematic method of providing a false scare, followed by heightened non-diegetic sound, they as an alternative, allow the emphasis of the situation to be drawn from Julia's surroundings. Close-up, and medium-close-up shots of insignificant objects, and segments of wall, become ever more important as Julia's eyesight begins to slowly fade. While the avoidance of recording any distinguishing facial features of many male characters, especially during the second and third acts of the film, not only instils a sense of mystery in the title, but also again represents Julia's impending loss of sight. By primarily using the visual aesthetics to communicate to the audience the tone and atmosphere of the piece, Morales extends the engagement of the picture to further audiences by not necessarily providing a scare with every scene, but by consistently keeping the tension up at a high level.The film isn't without flaw however; the story is cluttered with many sequences essentially repeating aspects of the story that have already been stated for the viewer and this unfortunately adds a further ten minutes to the running time of the picture. While the actors Belen Rueda and Lluis Homar provide strong emotional performances throughout, the majority of the remaining cast members attempt nothing to step outside of their stereotypical roles, nor is any screen-time provided for them with any depth beyond their scope as a one-time narrative pusher. Everybody else becomes somewhat of a pawn in Julia's mystery and while there are some potentially interesting characters around her, they are never fully developed to the extent where they can make an impact on the film's overall narrative. 'Julia's Eyes' is yet another above-average addition to the Spanish horror/thriller genre, which despite being slightly overlong, contains a solid story with many convoluted and inter-connected twists keeping the third act engrossing until the end credit sequence begins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As movies in the horror/thriller/mystery genres have became more cookie-cutter with their increased production and popularity (think the time after Scream where the genre blew up and everyone seemed to think they could be horror masters), one of the major things I look for when critiquing a movie in the ability of the director and actors to transcend the screen. What I mean to say is that truly horrifying movies are such because they make the audience feel and live as if they were actually there during the trauma. As if the trauma actually was happening, or even could happen to them in the future. These are the movies that sometimes make you watch you back and look around the parking lot on your way out to your car, or check you closets and make sure your doors are locked before you go to bed. A horror movie to me is something that doesn't just have cheap jump-out scares (of course any fast and unknowing action can cause someone to flinch), it has my heart racing as I've immersed myself in the story before anything even happens.With all of that off of my chest, Julia's Eyes really captures the fear of being unable to see, and how utterly horrifying this would be in a situation such as the one she is placed in. It's scary enough to believe that your sister may have been murdered, a killer is on the loose, and may be coming after you. However, now imagine that you are blind and therefor a step or a sense behind who is after you. This movie does a great job not just presenting this situation, but having the audience thoroughly understand and become literally blind as Julia is. This ability takes the fear level way above that of the routine scary movie of today. For this reason I rate it slightly higher. For a fan of this genre it's a definite must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inconsistent horror/thriller with an interesting premise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A woman suffering from progressive blindness and her husband come to investigate the apparent suicide of her sister, who had the same affliction. There turns out to be much more to the death than it seems on the surface, and more people may end up finding a similar fate unless the mystery can be unraveled.&nbsp;Julia's Eyes gets off to a good start, with an interesting premise and a captivating opening scene. But, most of what follows is not equal to the introduction. Frustrating characters and annoying plot contrivances keep Julia's Eyes from being anything more than an average mystery/thriller that had me almost disinterested during the middle portion. The ending, fortunately, is strong and helped restore some of the good feelings I had about the movie during its beginning.&nbsp;Don't get me wrong, it's a tense movie throughout, thanks to the natural fear of not being able to see the danger around you. And there are plenty of story twists and turns, and not all of them are predictable. But watching characters make dumb, illogical decisions just for the sake of plot progression draws me right out of the atmosphere that's so necessary for an effective thriller. When Julia's Eyes is good, it's very good. It's just unfortunate that parts of it are exercises in pure frustration.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film. The tense and exciting opening scene drew me in immediately, and the film had me on the edge of my seat for the whole thing. Perhaps, after the first scene, the film takes a bit of time to get started, but the climax is extremely tense and hard to watch without shouting at the screen. The plot is that a woman called Julia, who is suffering from a degenerative disease that is slowly making her lose her vision, finds her already blind sister who hanged herself in her basement. She believes that her death was suspicious, but is alone as the police and her husband thinks she is chasing ghosts. There are some really clever little additions the director put in, such as when Julia goes blind, the camera angles are done in such a way that you never see anybody's face, except the husband, who previously in the film "taught" her how to feel his presence when she went blind, and Julia herself, which I thought was a nice touch. The film genuinely fills the viewer with a sense of paranoia, which is what separates this film from the generic disturbia like serial killer horrors. I am a great horror fan, and this film disturbed and scared me a lot more than the rubbishy cheap thrillers like paranormal activity that the film industry spews out today.That said, I do have a few criticisms about Julia's Eyes. The plot is good, but a few clichés sneak in, like the classic husband-doesn't- believe-wife story, which seems to be a favourite of Del Toro (the same thing was used in The Orphanage)which I feel is overused in horrors nowadays. People complained about the scriptwriting, but I speak Spanish, and the subtitles don't do the film justice. The killer is pretty guessable from around the middle, I actually dismissed the fact it could have been him because it was too obvious. That is my major concern, and I had to explain one of the twists to my friend who I was watching the film with. The film also ends on an unbearably cheesy note.However, the twists are great, especially the one about the husbands suicide, and completely unguessable (except who the killer was), and although the film wasn't nearly as good as Pan's Labyrinth, Devil's Backbone or the Orphanage, it was still a very enjoyable thriller with some extremely exciting moments. I also finished the film appreciating my vision a lot more than when I started, which I guess is a good point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, to a point - the ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit to not watching many foreign films - I'm a simple being. However, this film is one of those like Pan's Labyrinth (mentioned by many here) where you quickly forget you are watching a subtitled film.An atmospheric, tense thriller without being ruined by the Hollywood blockbuster virus. Yes, OK there is a fair amount of gratuitous shots of the leading lady and her ample bosom, along with the rest of her - but as a red-blooded male, I'm certainly not going to complain, and to be honest these shots seem to lessen, or become less obvious as the film goes on.Well shot - with the occasional cliché, but generally a good watch.Oh, apart from the ending which was cheesy, abrupt and altogether rather naff. At least it doesn't pave the way for an awful sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rampaging through the darkness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When her blind twin sister Sara dies, Julia Levin (Belén Rueda) is instantaneously convinced that suicide is out of the question, despite what her husband Isaac (Lluís Homar) and police claim. Suffering from the same genetic illness, Julia's sight is also failing, a process quickened by stress. When the truth behind Sara's death slowly lapses into an obsession, strange things start occurring with a shadow of a man constantly lurking in the background. While visiting a home for the blind, the local janitor reveals much into the nature of this presence: 'an invisible man', a person with such a weak life aura, that he melts with the shadows, unnoticed by normal people, only noticed by people with heightened senses, such as the blind...The intriguing premise, offering some philosophical origins of conception, offers a strong backbone for the story: a faceless man, unnoticed by the world at large, not due to special skills, but thanks to insignificance. However for the most part this aspect of the story gets a purely functional treatment, utilised for its possibility of creating tension and a sense of thrill. Our perpetrator is constantly mired in shadows, unseen, lurking somewhere in the background. Meanwhile as Julia's sight falters, so does the camera - a concept used with dreaded effectiveness throughout the movie. Corresponding to Julia's growing blindness camera angles start becoming less revealing, creating a sense of lack of control, while peoples faces are entirely cut from the picture, with only voices offered to differentiate between characters.This creates a level of chilly atmosphere into the somewhat cumbersome and overly convoluted story, which attempts to introduce too many threads and dangerously languishes into melodramatic territory, but without the same sense of control offered by Pedro Almodovar. Thus soon the movie becomes more about how it was filmed, less about the somewhat poorly handled story which challenges the attention span of viewers with non-focused narrative. These plot contrivances make "Julia's Eyes" level down to slightly above average horror fare, albeit when the base concept works it does so with some thrilling panache. A shame given these moments of pure perfection are sabotaged by the overall chaotic distractions bundled into the plot.</fullReview>

Idiot. Just plain dumb.Good DOP though. The first half is not bad at all.

		<fullReview>A Masterpiece. I cannot qualify this movie in any other way.It grabs you from the very first sequence and from then on you are its tormented (in a gorgeous edge of the seat hysterical spectator way) recipient.Great clenched white knuckles suffering --one suffers alongside with the blind Julia all the events that one after another terrify her in the blackness of the night, listening to unknown noises, feeling touched by an unknown presence, etc.-- such suffering and white knuckle wringing as I haven't experienced since "The Others" (Amenabar's film, another masterpiece).The photography is... spectacular (to light "the darkness" in film is terribly difficult, they did it here with superb mastery of the media).The script couldn't have been more elaborated in every tiny detail (they worked on it during a whole year and wrote it 17 times before accepting the final one) and that dedication shows, scene after scene.Unforgettable.All the actors impeccable and the director, a great one.

		<shortDescription>A disappointing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guillermo del Toro has often been presented/named as a horror director/producer... Usually, though, the films he is involved with are more like "dark fairy tales" with sympathetic monsters and... that kind of boring stuff.This movie (which he has produced) is not like that. It actually starts as a decent mystery/thriller which offers very good scares and deals with one of the most tragic conditions a human being could ever face: the loss of one's eyesight. The directors ideas for the depiction of blindness are very very good, and the viewer can actually feel the character's helplessness. And that's about all that's good about the film.Once the plot starts to unravel, the story sinks itself into absurdity, providing us with a villain driven by one of the least realistic motives ever. To top that we are faced with some soap opera situations/twists that are equally non-believable. Yes, in Norman Bate's case, this kind of ideas was very interesting, but after the repetition of those models for the 1000th time, to be honest - we've had enough of them. Also, visually it is one of those "modern" movies that take place in a world with only three to five colors, ranging from blue to (hardly) green. Finally, the movie closes with a repetition one of the most used movie clichés, i.e. the "using camera flash in the dark in order to see" scare...The verdict: when this movie tries to be original, it resorts to ideas that defy logic completely, and when it incorporates classic patterns, it does it in a way that is completely uninspired.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one is an example of how a director can spoil a movie with weak direction. The story is quite interesting, it unveils in multiple layers, the mystery is really good and the lead actors have done well. However, the presentation is weak. The events are not tightly woven; there are gaps in terms of logical connection between scenes and events; many overstretched series of dialogs may bore you; uneven pace of the story on screen is unwanted; etc. These are some of the weak links. As if that was not enough, the movie has a seriously sad ending, which I thought was not very helpful. I feel a good director could have made a gem out of it. I strongly believe this movie deserves a solid re-make. Hollywood, kindly take notice of it and do justice!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a decent Spanish thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is more of a thriller than a horror movie, even if the beginning makes it seem like a horror movie. The premise and atmosphere for the most part seems to be done right. However the build up and development is just so darn slow and boring. With Julia going on a detective mode to find his sister's killer to her going blind and paranoid. This movie is just boring when it comes to the build up, which is actually mundane. After a hour and 10 minutes in is when things starts to get interesting. It goes with the who is telling the truth direction, which actually does kept me on my toes and interested in what was going on. The tension even gets pretty darn high near the end. The actress that played Julia did a good job, but here character was poorly written as well. Overall this is a decent Spanish thriller with a good cinematography, but kinda lame and drawn out story until the end. It's watchable if you have the patience until the twist.6.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bags of atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blind-women-in-peril movies have been around for yonks (ever since the days of WAIT UNTIL DARK and BLIND TERROR, back in the late '60s) so the Spanish-made JULIA'S EYES is nothing particularly new. Where it works, however, is in ladling bags of atmosphere into a mystery-laden storyline, leaving it an evocative and genuinely spooky viewing experience.The plot sees THE ORPHANAGE's Belen Rueda playing a woman assailed by both oncoming blindness and the mysterious suicide of her sister. The slow but compelling narrative sees her gradually drawn into a mystery involving a faceless stranger, while director Guillem Morales, who has style to spare, makes excellent use of his heroine's condition to add to the overall feel of the film.Yes, the storyline is convoluted in places, and it manages to pack in plenty of cliché along the way too; the heroine does some very stupid things at regular intervals. Nevertheless, JULIA'S EYES works very well indeed thanks to its stylistic flourishes and tense, suspense-packed developments. The ending drags a little but for the most part this is a very good Spanish chiller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Atmospheric Thriller That Never Quite Fulfills Its Potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The synopsis of 'Julia's Eyes' or 'Los ojos de Julia' tells of the story of a near blind woman investigating the death of her twin sister who is not sure whether the man she sees is real or a product of her failing sight. Sadly, the mystery of this promising idea is deflated in the opening five minutes when the flash of a camera and the opening of a medical pack proves that there is in fact a person present who is hankering after the deaths of our resident blind folk. It begins positively with blind twin Sara(Belen Rueda) frantically hurrying around her darkened house convinced that there is an unwelcome visitor present with her. As she stares at and berates her presumed assailant in a corner of her house - in darkness because of a power cut - with horrific, blinded eyes, a flash of lightning illuminates the empty corner bereft of life. It is this air of mystery and ambiguity that should lead the way in a film that doesn't exploit the use of shadow effectively enough. Still convinced that there is a man with her, Sara proceeds to the basement where, attempting to take her own life, a foot kicks away the stool she is standing on causing the noose round her neck to strangle her. In another part of the country, her sister Julia(also Belen Rueda) sinks to the floor with breathing problems aware that something is amiss with her sister. Acting on this, Julia travels across the country with her husband Isaac(Lluis Homar) where the discovery of Sara's corpse prompts her initial grief to develop into suspicion that not is all as it seems. Unfortunately, 'Julia's Eyes' suffers from the usual generic flaws that all modern horrors are guilty of: within what seems like five minutes since the discovery of her sister, Julia suddenly believes that foul play is afoot, prompted by a few innocuous discrepancies. Even more frustrating is the usual method of having no-one believe the heroine's pleas that there is a killer on the loose, even when she has been driven half mad by the torment. They continue to wave away the claims of a sane professional with no history of mental illness even when people seem to be dropping dead, left, right and into bath tubs. This particular storytelling technique has become something of a joke in recent years but its use shows no signs of subsiding. Setting its flaws aside for the moment however, the film manages to maintain a consistent level of threat and atmosphere due to its examination of the effects of blindness. In one particular scene, Julia infiltrates a blind woman's centre alone to gather information pertaining to her sister when, apprehended by the blind women, they enquire into the man who has accompanied her, smelling him out, in an unnerving but humorous scene. Turning around, Julia catches a glimpse of a shadowy figure departing from the scene who she gives chase to. In one of the rare effective uses of shadow, Julia corners her terroriser before slowly and cautiously edging towards the invisible breathing figure using her mobile for light. In another shock moment, a grieving Julia is comforted by Isaac's hand at her sister's graveside before looking up and seeing Isaac a considerable distance away conversing with other people. Startled, she rises and turns but there is no-one else present in the proximity. A film that doesn't rely on cheap scares, 'Julia's Eyes' instead focuses on creating tension and atmosphere in order to draw in its audience. Some clever nuances include, the film never deviating from first person perspective such as when Julia has had eye surgery and is required to wear a bandage, the audience is never shown the faces of people around her including the killer. Similarly, at the film's climax the only source of lighting is through the intermittent flashes of the killer's camera after the power supply to the house has been cut. The climax though drawn out by about twenty minutes is an enthralling battle of wits and mind games between Julia and her tormentor as she attempts to stay one step ahead. The relationship between the killer and his mother however could have been given fuller examination in light of the revelations it brings to the plot and the killer's psychology. The mother however, as well as this aspect of the plot are given no chance to flourish, ironically, in an ending that meanders from one location set piece to the next. Nevertheless, 'Julia's Eyes' is a worthwhile thriller that elaborates on the concept of fear of the unknown by examining the effects of blindness but never quite capitalises on the sense of mystery that it displayed in the opening few moments. Instead of a world lived in the shadows, we have a film about a shadowy killer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blinded by the poor script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been some exceptional Spanish horrors made in recent years such as The Orphanage and Rec. and the Spaniards seem to be head and shoulders above the Americans at the moment when it comes to this genre.Julia's Eyes is not really in the same ball park as the above films but it is still looks great never the less. This is a film about a sister who's blind twin dies unexpectedly and because she has inherited the same disease that makes her blind she begins to find out the hard way what exactly happened to her sibling.There are some really good things about this movie and there are some really bad things. Firstly the way we see things happen on screen depending on the sight of Julia is very clever. I like how we don't see the characters faces when Julia cant either. Secondly , Belén Rueda is superb as Julia and is totally convincing and she has to be because the script is all over the place . There are so many things going on in this film that don't make sense or that people wouldn't do in real life , it spoils it a little. Yet i still liked it despite it's obvious flaws.</fullReview>

A few clear flaws and mistakes too. Oh and I don't know why the director/makers had to have an attractive woman half-dressed half the time which was gratuitous distraction. Oh hang on, they do that in most movies. But I expected more from del Toro. After one hour I knew what the final hour held in store, but just wanted them to get on with it. Almost a walk-out situation, but not quite. Overall a very forgettable film, but I can imagine some will love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so scary or thrilling Spanish thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following a recent spate of successful Spanish horror movies, Julia's Eyes has been released as a new addition to bolster their stable. We follow a woman who is unconvinced that her blind sister has died as all else see it. We follow her on her trail, noting that she herself is suffering from ailing eyesight, and we watch the plot twist and turn to try to keep us going.First question is whether this is a horror film? The viewer has to suss out if this is a supernatural or a slasher movie (or both). Personally, I did not find it frightening or jumpy, so I prefer to see it rather as a thriller, although despite the scares being weak the film is gruesome at points.The film is tagging along on the coat tails of the more masterly Spanish horror films like The Orphanage and REC, but it's not in the same league. However as it begins by being presented by the much lauded Del Tero, then it has not helped itself and comparisons are inevitable (and it suffers as a consequence).Some great acting by our lead actress doesn't mask an otherwise mixed story. Some interesting twists but nothing ground breaking. Good camera work and shooting marks it higher than otherwise it deserves(usual late night movie) but for me it's not enough. There is a wonderfully directed scene in the denouement but you won't be remembering much else.Not one to rush to watch, a thriller with some good points but little else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My eyes must be wrong. It takes more than 1 decent scene and some subtitles to make a classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a disturbing trend among mainstream critics; that somehow foreign films are better even if they are more or less the same as the much maligned Hollywood product.Julia's Eyes is a prime example. It is your standard 'vulnerable woman in peril after making several dumb decisions and a plot ridden with plot holes' horror film. In previous decades this film was called 'Blink' and 'Jennifer 8'. It also shares parallels with dozens of other films in which the woman under threat was not blind."But this one is French, and features actors in their 40s. Prep the 4 Stars printing team, and have a 5th on standby in case this film is even average!" Well it is average, and does start out reasonably well, but ultimately Julia's Eyes fails to capitalise on the foundations and denigrates quickly into yet another illogical film filled with inconsistencies, lazy 'it was only a dream' scares and gore that would be derided if it were not a foreign language - read: 'more worthy' - film.Julia and Sara are sisters. Both have the same degenerative eye disease that constantly puts them in danger of losing degrees of sight. Sara was blind. Sara lived alone.I am using past tense because after the opening moments of Julia's Eyes Sara becomes past tense. As in dead.But Julia cannot believe that her sister would kill herself as is reported - even though it is made clear that in recent years they were no longer close. On the basis of one song that was playing on the CD player she convinces herself that there must be more behind this. Isaac just seems to want to move on, and worries that the associated stress will not benefit Julia's ever-deteriorating vision.Julia's ensuing investigation is effective in as much as there are no wasted visits or queries. Every meeting with someone provides her with one vital clue that propels her one step forward to the next person or place, where inevitably a bystander, waiter or neighbour recalls something that helps her progress to the next stage. At one point she walks into a change room and overhears several blind women openly discussing Sara, a few minutes later and a creepy man walks up to Sara and proffers information of his own that proves key.During the process Julia learns that Sara had a man accompanying her in hew final days. Julia wants to know if it was a boyfriend why was he not present at the funeral? And why can no-one remember even the most vague details about this man even when they have seen him? One man even refers to him as 'an invisible man ...with angry eyes'.Things take a further turn for the worst - and predictable - when Julia is left alone and vulnerable, in the home of her late sister no less. What follows from there is nothing less than Hollywood-style extremism. A mysterious key with no obvious door. Mysterious neighbour(s) who know a lot but choose to drip feed information only when the story needs it. A sudden visitor with bizarre claims (a different one to the one mentioned earlier!) and a number of phone calls and run-ins that you would think practically demand follow up at some stage or other.If this were in Hollywood this would be panned as lazy and inconsistent, en Francais it apparently gets a free pass.But I am here to once and for all stand up for reason, common sense and basic standards in film and say that Julia's Eyes has been made several times before with only minor variations. This is competent stuff and boasts a couple of decent scenes and violence that is sensibly doled out in small doses so as to retain its impact.Final Rating - 5.5 / 10. Julia's Eyes is just another decidedly average horror film, just one that happens to be in another language.P.S. At one stage I wrote something down in all caps upon the introduction of a new character. It was a definitive statement about how things would turn out. It was unfortunately spot on. Julia at least was sporting bandages over her eyes at this time, but if it were that obvious to me then everyone else should've seen it coming too. .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Julia battles with her eyesight, the film battles with lack of suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a film titled Julia's Eyes, Belen Rueda's, whom plays the titular character, has very unremarkable eyes, even though much of screen time revolves around them. None the matter, the actress proves she can carry a role in a thriller which thrives thematically but wanders in quality and not always in the good direction.As thrills are scarce, the story centers on Julia, whose blind twin sister Sara is killed by an unknown man, whom Sara (also played by Rueda) has been involved with. Only the police believes she committed suicide. As Julia is driven to investigate her sister's death, she loses her own eye sight to a series of small, stress-induced strokes. The more she looks for her sister's killer, the less she is able to see.This is a kind of a genius idea, not only on plot level, but on character level too. We know Julia is a determined woman and loves her sister very much, even though they we never see them together and have no idea what their relationship has been like.As for the issue of themes, there is much to be said about seeing and being and not being seen by other people, which is what the film excels at. If not so much with everything else.</fullReview>
