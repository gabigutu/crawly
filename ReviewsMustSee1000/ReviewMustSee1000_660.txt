		<shortDescription>The Best Political Satire Since Dr. Strangelove</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely can film satire make you laugh and be worried about the future at the same time. Levinson's film does just that, with a great cast and great writing, this film succeeds.You may have noticed that many of the posts and reviews argue that this is not plausible. Obviously these posters do not realize that satire is supposed to be over the top and show what can happen in extremes, and ironically, this came out just after Clinton's sex scandal, and is still relevant today with George W. and will continue to be regardless of the president. Also, some may think it oversimplifies the public as idiots, but this isn't true, especially if they are being deceived and information is withheld. There are some implausibilities, as in why no reporters went to Albania or how other countries didn't get involved other than denying the charges, but these are small and even addressed in scenes with the rival candidates, news reporters and even CIA head William H. Macy.Really I don't know how anyone can not like this film since it is smart, funny and scary all at once with fine performances and direction all around. This is an American political satire classic that is sadly becoming less satire as time goes on.OVERALL: 9/10. Buy or at least rent before the satire becomes reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not nothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this before the brouhaha with Clinton and Lewinsky broke, and I imagine most of the negative comments about this film came because they saw it after and thought this was a Nostradamus film. When I saw it, I thought it started a bit slow, and was a bit too self-satisfied (like the scenes of people crying at a concert; that seemed fake). However, for most of the way, this is sharp, biting, and yes, funny, though when I first saw it, I thought it was more accurate in its Hollywood satire than on its government satire. Time, of course, proved me wrong.David Mamet will never be universally loved, because not only does there seem to be a large group that doesn't get him, but that thinks those of us that like him are degenerates. Myself, I happen to think he's one of the best playwrights and screenwriters working today (though I'm split so far on his novels). His writing may be highly stylized, but I guess I'm in tune to the rhythms of his dialogue. And he doesn't assume his audience is dumb; rather, he seeks to challenge them by asking you to come to your own conclusions, rather than hit you over the head. And he does that very well in this movie; at the beginning, we may think Conrad Brean and Stanley Motss are real sleazebags, but at the end, while we deplore the action they take of faking a war just for political ends, we can't quite dismiss them either.Of course, a lot of that has to do with the performances of Robert DeNiro and Dustin Hoffman (Anne Heche is also a standout as Winnifred Ames, the increasingly bemused presidential aide). DeNiro seems at first like a teddy bear here, with his beard, his hat, and his bow tie, but he transfers the energy associated with his more volatile roles (TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL, GOODFELLAS et al) to guile and street smarts here. The way his eyes probe whoever he's talking to, and the way he anticipates almost every verbal comeback the other person has demonstrates that(he can't anticipate every event, of course, but once he gets used to it, he can).But the standout here is Hoffman. There's been a lot of comment on Hoffman basing his character on Robert Evans. My own theory is he read Lynda Obst's excellent book HELLO, HE LIED, which talks about the producer's role, and simply played that. I formed that theory because of his mantra whenever things go wrong, "This is nothing!", especially when Winnifred reads him the riot act after their plane crashes. There's a part in the book where Obst talks about having to argue budget with the studio, and realizes it's all a game where they have roles to play; she argues for more money, the studio for less. Just as Winnifred's role is to be pessimistic, and Stanley's is to be optimistic. And Hoffman never condescends to Stanley, instead showing a talented, maybe amoral guy who deep down is so insecure that he values credit even over his life("F*** my life, I want the credit!" is one of the best lines of the film"). Contrary to his line, this film is not nothing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest political satire ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not understand the people who did not like the movie. For me this is the greatest political satire since Chaplin's "The great dictator". Both de Niro and Hoffman are great as well. This movie is not about Clinton although they did predict correctly the Kosovo war, and Albanian terrorists. It is about American political system which is made by and for TV. Several lines from that movie ("Why Albania?" - "Why not?", "Albania does not rhyme", "What do you remember about the Gulf war? One smart bomb... I was in that building when we shot that shot", and many more) are impossible to forget because everyday political life does not let us forget them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Barry Levinson's under-rated "Wag the Dog" is a brilliant piece of satire which is to the 1990s what "All the President's Men" was to the 1970s. The president is in trouble after a sexual scandal with an under-aged girl. Enter Robert DeNiro and Anne Heche who want to distract the nation with something else as they try to get their boss out of the hot seat. The only problem is: nothing is going on. So it is up to them to create something to rally the country around the executive-in-chief. Now enter sleazy, but high class Hollywood director Dustin Hoffman (in a well-deserved Oscar-nominated turn) who is contacted to start an imaginary war. He agrees and the plan works, but as time goes by more and more problems occur and the lies continue to snow-ball. Levinson's excellent direction and Hilary Henkin's clever screenplay raise the performances of all involved. Naturally DeNiro and Hoffman are guaranteed to excel in a film like this, but good work is also done by people like Heche, Denis Leary, William H. Macy, Woody Harrelson and even Willie Nelson (!?). Somewhat ignored in 1997, but still one of the best films of that year and one of the more important films of the 1990s. 4.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wag the Dog is a brilliant satire of the American political system with enough realism to make it plausible. It speaks the strongest to people who already have a visceral loathing of the American democratic process (not how it was in 1789 but how it is now). They see a degraded and ignorant public easily duped by politicians who are no more than habitual liars who will say anything to get elected but lack any idealism whatsoever. Intelligent, funny, but also very depressing, 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Short &amp; sharp satire on media manipulation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the campaign to re-elect the president of America, an underage sex scandal between a girl scout and the president in the oval office. To divert attention spin doctor Conrad Brean is called in to manage the fall out and hold it off for the 11 days till the election. Conrad employs Hollywood producer Stanley Motss to produce a war in Albania to divert the media away from the real story.This was made before Clinton was accused of misconduct with Monica Lewinsky and the subsequent re-start of military action in Iraq. This seemed to give it a much greater feel of realism and much more credibility. However even before this happened it was still a very sharp and very good satire on political spin, but also managing to have a dig at Hollywood movie types. The story is told in a very stage-play fashion and is dialogue driven with very funny moments throughout. It's not as terrifying as a real look at media manipulation could be because it chooses to be a comedy instead but it still makes plenty of valid points.The two leads are excellent at the head of an all-star cast. De Niro manages to be a professor-style character while at the same time having an easily accessible sense of menace just beneath the surface. Hoffman is good sending up Hollywood producers well and drawing parallels between the creation of a film and the creation of political news stories. The cast also has a series of cameos and extended cameos who add both humour and quality to the film - Willie Nelson, Denis Leary, James Belsuhi, William H Macy etc.Recently in the UK we've had huge problems with spin doctors running the Labour Government - to the extent that 11th September was described as "good" by one as it gave them the chance to bury several bad news stories that they had stored up. And more recently with various Governments' waging a media war to win support their stance regarding military action. This film doesn't make hugely serious points but it does make you think about how the media is used to shape public perception and make us think what those in charge want us to think.Overall a very funny, very clever satire that has a great cast, the only criticism being that it stretches it's point a little too far with the "old shoe" section.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly great satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It had been a while since I last watched this film, but I once again remembered the reasons why I loved it so. Thoughtful and evocative, this film really captured the nature of politics and spin doctoring. This certainly ranks as one of the best political comedies of all time. The over-the-top attitude of the film didn't detract from anything, making this still quite believable. It also demonstrated how people's emotions can be manipulated when aggressively attacked. The fragile nature of the human spirit tends to make us more susceptible to such manipulations, as demonstrated in this film. With the exception of Anne Heche, everyone's performance in this film was rather good. The only other downside was Mark Knopfler's score, which was completely out of place in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Principle of Fundamental Surprise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a thoroughly enjoyable movie. The story is probably familiar so I'll just summarize it. The president of the USA gets caught having sex with a teenage Firefly Girl and DeNiro and Heche hire Dustin Hoffman, an old Hollywood hand, to produce a distracting event, like a war with Albania, to flood the media and distract the public's attention for long enough (11 days) for the president to be reelected.One thing after another goes wrong and each time Hoffman comes up with yet another colorful lie to extend the life of the story. The CIA publicly ends the war prematurely? No problem. "This is NOTHING!" cries Hoffman, "You ought to try shooting 'The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse' when two of the four horseman die two weeks after the beginning of principal photography!" No war? No problem. Hoffman invents a hero who was left behind in an Albanian prison camp. "Every war has a hero." The man chosen to be the hero -- Woody Harrelson -- turns out to have spent the last twelve years in a military prison for raping a nun. Lies are piled upon lies.We all know that political spin is put on everything that happens in Washington. This movie came out in 1997 during Clinton's presidency but he never started a war to deflect criticism. And yet the way Levinson has directed it, and the way the performers attack their roles, it is almost completely believable that deceptions like this take place. Hoffman stretches his acting a bit but he is never so hammy that he is unbelievable as a Hollywood producer. "Ramon, bring me my veggie shake now." And, "They told me I couldn't make 'Moby Dick' from the point of view of the whale!" He brings to the part some of the smooth-talking duplicity that he showed in "Papillon" and "Midnight Cowboy." He glows with self satisfaction as he spells out his accomplishments to DeNiro. "This is the greatest thing I've ever done, bringing this war to a satisfactory conclusion." DeNiro: "But there was no war." Hoffman: "That makes it all the more difficult." Nobody else is in the least bit over the top. They play it the way Levinson directs it, as a realistic straightforward story. None of the actors seems to know that he or she is in a comedy and it works very well.I don't think I'll mention any more of the gags because I don't want to spoil it. But it's hard to forget the scene near the end of the film when Hoffman is looking out the window at the funeral of Harrelson's character. Huge American flags, the casket being carried by the "men of the 303" (invented for the occasion). Hoffman spreads his arms expansively and says to DeNiro -- "Look at it. The whole thing is a ******* fraud, and yet it's 100 percent honest!" A victim of his own egotism, Hoffman decides that he wants credit for the production and is perfunctorily disposed of, having "suffered a massive heart attack poolside." This was probably a funnier movie when it first appeared. President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp and all that. A war built on a string of lies seemed so outrageous that it was impossible to take a movie like this seriously. Well, circumstances change. The movie is still a great success but my heart sank at the sight of the flag-draped coffin returning from "Albania." The story seems equally outrageous now, but in a very different sense of the word.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can a movie created in the late 90s still speak to a voting audience in the late 2000s? Prior to "Wag the Dog" my answer would be "no", but watching, and now re-watching it for a second time in the past week, this film could be watched today, watched next year, or even watched prior to the next four elections, and it would continue to feel current, real, and modern in today's political/cinematical world. The power of the dialogue, the intense chemistry of the characters, and the constant interruption of the television generation into the political world will continue to keep "Wag the Dog" out of the black hole of cinema ? it will not be dated, never forgotten, and forever enjoyed. As we continue to allow CNN to give us our news, this film will remain as vivid as America's apple pie.Act I: The Chemistry of the Characters Robert DeNiro and Dustin Hoffman could play chess for three hours, and it would capture my attention from beginning to end. DeNiro is a powerhouse of an actor, not just because he can play the tough gangster type, but also because he can take a character like Brean and give us simple, verbose, and intelligent. His range can be seen throughout this film. He commands each scene that he is in, focusing our attention on each of his words and lingering on his next move. In my eyes, it is more powerful than "Goodfellas" or "Casino" because of his subtle nature. The scene that stands out for me in "Wag the Dog" that requires viewing for DeNiro's talent is that between CIA Agent William H. Macy and DeNiro discussing the honesty of the war on Albania. To me, this shows the power of his talent.Jumping onto the other side of this film, there is Dustin Hoffman. While DeNiro pulls his obvious strengths with this film, Hoffman makes "Wag the Dog" more than just a political film. Listening to the commentary, Hoffman discusses the fact that he nearly didn't make this film because he couldn't find Motss's character. Thankfully he did, due to his compelling portrayal; we are taken from political conspiracy cinema to this raw human drama. The final act was sublime due to both DeNiro and Hoffman's chemistry, but also because we believed Motss' words. As audience members, we wanted to see him tell his story (knowing that he never would). It was the human element, the Motss' true self, that we were drawn to, and Hoffman stayed true to those moments until the very end. This isn't your typical Hollywood happy film, this basis itself on ? albeit conspiracies ? but honest conspiracies. Could you survive the greatest hoax ever and promise not to tell a soul? Surrounding these characters, we had Willie Nelson, Denis Leary, Anne Heche, Kirsten Dunst, William H. Macy, John Michael Higgins, and ? who could forget ? Woody Harrelson. These are our players, and they take us from scene to scene with the greatest of ease.Act II: The Writing &amp; the Directing David Mamet. Does anything else need to be said? Having been a full time follower of his work, I was not surprised to see that it was his quick-witted words coming from our characters' mouths. It is the fast-paced level of intellectual banter that transforms "Wag the Dog" into the powerhouse that it is. It works because you finish watching the characters actions and it is the words you find yourself quoting for weeks after. Mamet's political punch to this film was reminiscent of Kubrick's ideas behind "Dr. Strangelove". The two were films that were absurd, but it was also the ideals that they were satirizing that makes both viewable today; just as powerful as they were when they were released. Mamet's words with Barry Levinson's direction takes "Wag the Dog" into perfection. There are no heroes, there are no villains, and we know so little about the characters that it is simply the story, or the words, that pull us into this film. The beats are hit, the angles are crisp and tight, and our characters are perfection ? possibly the best casting in years. With this in mind, we have only the third act remaining ? cause, as everyone knows ? there is always a third act! Act III: The Final ThoughtOverall, "Wag the Dog" is perfect. Very few films in my eyes fully carry the honor of being watchable at any time, any decade, or any political year ? but "Wag the Dog" does. Watching with a group of friends, I was surprised as to how many had not seen this feature, remembering that it had been birthed nearly 11 years ago, it still seemed surprising. "Wag the Dog" overturns those political conspiracy theories and makes you laugh, think, and realize the impact of our commercial media. It was enjoyable to hear the current terms like "plumber" and "commercial president" in this 1997 film, boasting the truth that this film was made before its time. Looking back, there are those that could complain about our premise being too cliché, that the same conspiracy theories have been done again and again, but to me, this was fresh. This entire film was fast-paced, amazingly acted, and media driven. In the commentary, it is talked about how it is rumored that the media doesn't even check sources any further, and this is a glowing example of that regime.Grade: ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood is sometimes able to produce satirical films that, in retrospect, appear to predict future developments in American politics. `Being There', the story of a simple man whose homespun philosophy is taken for profound wisdom and who, as a result, becomes a candidate for President, may look like a satire on the Reagan administration, but in fact it was actually released in 1979, during the Carter years. `Dave', which features a womanising President called Bill whose marriage is in trouble because of his adulterous relationships and his trimming of his radical principles, came out in 1993, just after Bill Clinton had taken office. It must, however, have been planned well in advance and was presumably not actually intended as anti-Clinton satire, but that is how it tends to come across today.`Wag the Dog' is another film that proves to have been unintentionally prophetic. Shortly before an election, the President is embroiled in a potentially explosive sex scandal which threatens to end his presidency in disgrace. In order to distract the public's attention, his advisers concoct a wholly fictitious military crisis in the Balkans and hire a Hollywood producer to provide the necessary harrowing footage of war scenes. When the Albanian government protest that their country is not in fact at war, the aides present this as a triumph of American diplomacy that has averted the threatened crisis, and, in order to keep the affair in the public's mind, concoct a further sub-plot involving a supposed military hero (in real life a convicted rapist in a military prison) held prisoner by a rebel faction.All of this may seem very familiar, but bear in mind that this film was made in 1997, two years before President Clinton, faced with a potentially explosive sex scandal which for a time threatened to end his presidency in disgrace, took America to war over a crisis in the Balkans. At least he didn't need to concoct a fictitious war. The parallels with the more recent Iraq war are perhaps less exact, although the scenes involving the supposed hero `Old Shoe' were strongly reminiscent of the ballyhoo surrounding Private Jessica Lynch.Like `Being There', `Wag the Dog' is not, of course, a work of social realism. In real life, a simpleton like Chance could not become President without being found out, and no administration could actually get away with inventing a bogus war. (That's why they have to provide real ones). In order to make a satirical point, both films exaggerate prevalent tendencies in modern political life. `Being There', among other things, is about self-deception- Chance never pretends to be anything he is not, but those around him deceive themselves by seeing him as what they want him to be. `Wag the Dog', on the other hand, is about political `spin' and the deliberate deception of the public. Politicians try and deceive as many of the people for as much of the time as they think they can get away with, and the media will go along with such deception for as long as it is in their interest.`Wag the Dog' has some sharp points to make, and there is a very good performance from Dustin Hoffman as the Hollywood producer Stanley Motss. Motss is recognisably suffering from status anxiety in its most acute form- the form that afflicts the brilliantly successful and wealthy man who still feels undervalued by society and will do anything, however unethical or even dangerous to his own safety, to win public recognition. (He complains that there is no Academy Award specifically for producers, ignoring the fact that one is not needed because the producer traditionally receives the Best Picture award).Despite that, however, I felt that the film as a whole was not as sharp or as funny as it could have been. I think the reason is that it is basically a one-joke film; once the war story has been exploded, the plot tends to lose direction. The idea of concocting a wholly bogus war is a brilliantly surreal satirical conceit; the idea of concocting a bogus hostage drama, although more inherently plausible, lacks the same inventiveness, so the `Old Shoe' scenes come as something of an anti-climax after what has gone before. I felt that Robert de Niro as the presidential aide Conrad Brean was less effective than Hoffman; I have never thought that comedy is his forte and that he is at his best in serious roles. (I may be judging unfairly, as there are several of his comedies that I have not seen). I also felt that it was a mistake not to show the President in the film- this may not be a realistic film, but the idea that a spin doctor could create a fictitious war without even the President being aware of what is going on strains credibility past its limits. Moreover, as we found out with Nixon and his attempted cover-up of the Watergate affair, the culture of spin involves our elected leaders themselves, not just members of their staff. Overall the film had its moments but could have been better. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the calibre of the talent involved would suggest Wag The Dog is a very well acted and directed film, however for some strange reason it isn't a particularly satisfying one.Perhaps that is mainly due to the fact that it is somewhat of a one joke idea, or maybe it's due to the fact that with current events as they are it's all too plausible and the whole thing of late is somewhat comically overexposed. Whatever it may be in the end you can't help but feeling that the film somehow missed a beat somewhere along the line and ultimately wasn't all that it should or could have been.That is not to say that this isn't an entertaining film, it is. From the fistful of great performances from Robert Deniro, Anne Heche, Denis Leary, Willie Nelson, Woody Harrelson and especially Dustin Hoffman who seems to be relishing his role here, to the well played supporting roles filled out by the likes of William H. Macy, Craig T. Nelson, Kirsten Dunst et al 'Wag The Dog' has all the talent performing admirably. It also has a sharp, amusing script (by Hilary Henkin &amp; David Mamet, based on the novel "American Hero" by Larry Beinhart) going for it and Barry Levinson's direction is top notch, but despite being quite entertaining, it also seems too slight by half, and just not focused or funny enough to quite make everything work successfully at the end of the day. Regardless of it's flaws Wag The Dog is still a fun, well made and entertaining film that deserves to be seen and enjoyed, it just isn't quite able to reach the lofty peak that it aspires to. But just so long as you don't go in expecting an hilarious rib tickler of political satire it's a pretty fair bet that you will be suitably entertained.One man's opinion. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scariest thing about "Wag the Dog" is that it has a very realistic feel. Sure, there are some far fetched things but overall the movie leaves the impression like this is something that could actually happen in real life or already maybe has happened.But "Wag the Dog" is more entertaining than anything. Yes, in a way you can compare it to "Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb" even though it is not as brilliant of course. The subject is treated in a very entertaining and comical way and that is what makes "Wag the Dog" a very fun movie to watch. But yet it also knows how to bring over the important political message of the movie. In that way this movie is comparable to "Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb".The main cast is very good. Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman are great in their second movie together ("Sleepers" was the first which was also directed by Barry Levinson and they can now be seen together again in "Meet the Fockers"). It sounds weird but they really have some chemistry together. Anne Heche however at times irritated me and also isn't exactly the most talented actress I've seen. There also is a very good and entertaining supporting cast with actors such as Willie Nelson, William H. Macy, Woody Harrelson, a still very young Kirsten Dunst and Craig T. Nelson in a uncredited role as 'enemy' Senator John Neal. Really entertaining are all of the Woody Harrelson sequence's, they are highly fun and might very well be the best parts of the movie.A very fun entertaining movie with a realistic feel! Highly recommendable.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People may think of "Wag the Dog" as fiction, but time and again, the movie has shown itself to be reality. Whether it was Bush Sr. coming up with the Gulf War to distract people from the Savings and Loans scandal, Clinton threatening military action against Iraq to distract people from the Lewinsky thing, Bush Jr. invading Iraq as a we-can't-find-Osama diversion, or the current threats against Iran, this movie is the hilarious but unfortunate truth.The plot of course has spin doctor Conrad Brean (Robert DeNiro) teaming up with Hollywood producer Stanley Motss (Dustin Hoffman) to fabricate a war, so as to distract the country from the president's sexual follies (and to think that the movie came out around the same time as you-know-what). It just goes to show that truth really is stranger than fiction, especially when politics is involved. A great satire. Also starring Anne Heche, Willie Nelson, Kirsten Dunst and Woody Harrelson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writers Hilary Henkin, David Mamet &amp; director Barry Levinson deserve an ovation to attempt a film like 'Wag The Dog'. An outstanding work of cinema! A Washington spin doctor who, mere days before a presidential election, distracts the electorate from a sex scandal by hiring a Hollywood film producer to construct a fake war with Albania. An Incredible Idea, turned into an Incredible Film! Levinson has made many, many Masterpieces before, but this 1997 classic ranks as his finest work to date. His understanding to the subject &amp; his brilliant execution leaves you awe-struck. A film where Minuses are hard to find.Performance wise: Dustin Hoffman is fantastic. He's a treat to watch in each &amp; every scene he appears, every dialog he delivers is a treat to watch, each &amp; every expression he conveys is a treat to watch. This is his strongest performance to date. Robert De Niro is excellent, as always. Anne Heche is superb, and she looks really sexy in that short-hair-cut. Woody Harrelson is first-rate as the rapist. Others are perfect in their parts.On the whole 'Wag The Dog' is cinema at it's best. Two Big Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My reaction to this black comedy reminds me of how I felt when I first saw "Dr. Strangelove" back in 1964. That movie was terribly funny, even as Slim Pickens did the atomic mid-air rodeo ride that was destined to start World War III. Yet, I was chilled by the truth in the caricatures up there on the screen parodying our real leaders. In a similar manner, "Wag the Dog" offers up the same kind of black comedy satire, with great insight into how the modern, amoral, political PR mind works. Much was made at the time the movie debuted about its clairvoyance in depicting a president who needs to distract the country from his sexual dalliances. However, while that fact provides the motivation for the movie, it really isn't central to its theme. The problem just as well could have been illegal bribes, or any other scandal. The real guts of the film are right there in the title (which is explained for us in detail in the opening credits, in case we didn't get it): The minions are running the show, and the politicians are just bit players in the resulting drama (the President's face never even appears in the movie!). Viewed from today's perspective (2002), this movie is far more relevant than when it first appeared because it understands the politics of terrorism, suitcase bombs, the increased role of the CIA and, at the end, the need to go back to Albania (nee Iraq) and finish up the job. It is definitely a far more relevant film to view today than it was in 1997.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute idea, but execution overloads suspension of disbelief</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has a neat enough premise; the US president gets caught with his hand in the underage cookie jar right before election time, and his hatchetman Conrad Brean (De Niro) goes out to divert public attention. To do so, he enlists the aid of Hollywood producer Stanley Motss (Hoffman) and the two cook up an entirely fictitious war for the president to deal with and solve in statesmanlike fashion. It certainly captured the public's imagination at the time (Clinton &amp; Lewinsky), went through a revival in the Balkans during the Kosovo crisis (in the film, the phony war is with Albania, which borders on Kosovo), and at the time of writing, with the US economy in trouble and war with Iraq looming, is being dredged up again. But "Wag the Dog", I am sad to say, has a fatal flaw in common with most conspiracy theories: its credibility ceases about five minutes after the opening credits. We are made to believe that every single person enlisted in Brean and Motss's project can be trusted to "never say a word about this to anyone." Surely, only dead men tell no tales, but a trail of dead actors, gaffers and special effects people would be noticed (okay, maybe not the actors). It's never made clear to us whether the war is completely fictional, or its causes are fictional but the war is all too real. In the former case, any journalist arriving in Albania would presumably notice a marked lack of US troops; in the latter, one would expect more (in fact, any) footage of Brean threatening the careers of various generals. Motss cooks up a fictional SpecOps unit for dramatic purposes, with the explanation that nobody's heard of it because it's so secret; this unit then parades down the Washington Mall, its members' faces visible to all and sundry, in highly distinctive garb (the half-black/half-leopard print beret... please!), contrary to practice of every existing SpecOps unit. Most of the cast of "Wag the Dog" deliver a fine performance; the direction and production values are more than adequate. All of it is ultimately wasted on a script which is riddled with holes through which you could drive an 18-wheeler.</fullReview>

Fast talking and fast walking, the film moves from city to city, limo to jet, and studio to studio. The movie doesn't slow down until its final scene when nothing happens. Very political is all you can truly say about Wag the Dog. Anyone who believes in conspiracy theories has Wag the Dog as one of their top ten favorite films.

		<fullReview>Courtesy of Barry Levinson, right before the Clinton scandal, long before the War in Iraq, comes an essential part of the explanation for each. Media is biased more by the five o'clock deadline than it is by politics, but politics influence media and vice versa in a very close way. Thus comes an essential dark comedy from the 90s that analyzes the ways in which glamor building and a little interpretive spin can change America.Robert de Niro plays one of his finest roles as Conrad Brean, a spin-doctor who has eleven days to keep the country distracted from a sex scandal so that his President can get re-elected. He joins up with Hollywood producer Stanley Motss (Dustin Hoffman) and creates a war. Crisis averted, but how long can they hold on? An important aspect to this is the lack of general compliance in the conspiracy theory. Dark meetings are held under the capital, but the CIA aren't informed. The President is fully knowing of the build-up, but becomes a prima-donna performer too distracted with theatrics to play ball. Reporters are subjected to the power of suggestion, but are willing to demand answers too.This movie shares thematic and stylistic connections with Levinson's latest film with de Niro, What Just Happened?, but Wag the Dog I think will stand the test of time much better. Oh, and did I mention that it's hilarious? I almost forgot--deep belly laughs throughout.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stinging political satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Barry Levinson has always been a director that yanks the rug out from under his audience when they least expect it. He starts his films off with a knowing grin that sets a playful tone, and then the trap snaps and schit gets real in ways we didn't see coming. He never loses the lighthearted tone to his work though, and even when things get decidedly grim, there's always a winking light at the end of the tunnel that somewhat restores the airy note we rode in on. Wag The Dog walks this tightrope terrifically, a buoyant political satire with dark flourishes in all the right places, but a piece that knows it's place, and when to pull up its britches and pad it's daring, dark ending in surreal mannerisms that make it easier to swallow. When the U.S. President is caught up in a torrid sex scandal, spin doctor Conrad Brean (Robert De Niro) is brought in to fix the situation using any means he can. His brilliant idea involves utterly fabricating a war with Albania in order to smother the affair and distract the American people using a shameless smokescreen. The scary thing is (and not just for the film, but the sad state of affairs in the states, these days even) that it works splendidly. Using the help of of eccentric Hollywoood producer Stanley Mottss (Dustin Hoffman), spacey songwriter Johnny Dean (Willie Nelson), spiffy 'Fad King' Denis Leary and head honcho politico Anne Heche, Brean concocts an entirely false and unnecessary conflict just to facilitate the whims of their commander in chief. This is another film that eerily predicted the internet atrocities of the future which plague us today. In a world filled with laughable lunacy like Kony 2012, je suis Paris and bring back our girls, one begins to wonder what kind of unseen cogs spin to dictate what we filter our profile pictures through and gab about nonsensically on a monthly basis to distract us from whatever is really happening behind the scenes. When you take into account that this was made in 1997, it becomes all the more apparent that's it's a film with quite the head on its shoulders. Hoffman really steals the show as the bronzed up, coiffed motor mouth of a tycoon, so deliriously dumb that he unknowingly stumbles into answers to is own obvious musings half the time ("this is nothing, piece of cake"). De Niro is a sly fox, deliciously underplaying Brean and getting us to lay our guard down, so,that we don't see the danger in his persona until it's already dictating choices that we make. There's also fine work from Woody Harrelson, Kirsten Dunst, William H. Macy, Harland Williams, This one really deserves more acclaim than its remembered for, and will make you think almost as hard as you're laughing. b</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Negative comments about this movie suggest to me that those reviewers were expecting more of a typical movie story. I won't pretend to be a movie critic who understands technical or aesthetic aspects of movie-making. But this movie made me think -- and its insight into politics and media stays with me 15 years after its release. (I still regularly recommend this movie to friends.) The movie conveyed the idea (apparently originally proffered by Larry Beinhart's novel "American Hero") in a realistic, and frighteningly believable, way. Many times if I'm watching TV news, this movie comes to mind, as I wonder to what extent the media is being masterfully manipulated by entrenched political interests. I'm so disappointed that many more people haven't seen this film, and that too many people who did see it apparently didn't "get it" ... which is probably exactly how politicians like it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The premise of the movie was rather interesting, at least it seemed to have a certain potential, but the treatment operated by Barry Levinson it totally disappointing.Indeed, he delivered this story, both amusing and highly improbable, with no conviction and in a total linearity when it could have been a lot more impacting. You never get caught up in the game of those two spin doctors because everything is delivered in a monotone way from start to finish, with no variation of tone nor rhythm, and the movie therefore appears as absolutely soulless.To make things worse, the photography is cheap as hell and gives the impression you're watching an old TV movie from the 90's, not to mention some doubtful choices regarding cinematography.In the end, you can only regret the waste of the two talents that are Dustin Hoffman and Robert de Niro in this anecdotal feature.</fullReview>

I simply want to point out the aspect that most people forget when referring to this movie. Everybody notices the wit of the script, everybody notices the superb acting of Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro. Well I want to point two less noticed aspects of this movie. Anne Heche, doing a perfect job as the perfect yes woman, the counterpoint of Hoffman and De Niro, the audience of their escapades, admiring them when they work their magic, getting angry at them when it all seems to fall apart - being the exact balance against which the two are to be compared. The other hardly ever noticed aspect of this movie is the brilliant work of Barry Levinson - it's not only the guiding of every actor and every actress, not only the perfect pacing of the plot - it's the amazing control he exerts over the look of the film. The lighting and color control of this film are of the highest class ever achieved in cinema, an aspect not commonly present in American cinema who pays much more attention to the story and often neglects its design. Have one more look at this film and pay attention to the way people are getting swallowed by the background shadows or of how they emerge from these shadows and then think of the fact that the entire film is about the shadow game of politics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great cast, a good story and tons of wasted potential; Wag the Dog should have been a classic but it isn't. The satire in this movie is spot on, and it seems to be becoming more relevant each day (was it really released before Bush days?!) but the writing just isn't strong enough, and Barry Levinson isn't good enough to pull the whole thing together. More importantly, it falls in the cracks between comedy and drama, taking itself too seriously one moment and then not seriously enough the next, yet it's never actually funny.There's a lot to like here - especially thanks to the cast. Every dialog between De Niro and Hoffman - I'll say it, the two greatest American living actors - is sublime, as is a brilliant cameo from Willie Nelson. That's enough to make it entertaining, but it's not enough to make an impact. You'll enjoy the movie, but you won't remember it, and for that reason the point it makes is completely futile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining political satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Barry Levinson's film, Wag the Dog is a political satire about a political spin doctor and Hollywood producer who stage a war in Albania to cover up the president's sex scandal during the upcoming election. We the audience are shown how Conrad Brean played by Robert Deniro and Stanley Motts played by Dustin Hoffman create an outlandish fake plot to distract the American public from sexual allegations made by the president. After Albanian war is created, fake news footage is created within a studio, create fads (throwing shoes onto tree branches in support of a false war) and catchy sayings with theme songs are created by famous country singers in support of their fake war hero, Sgt. Schumann, who turns out to be psychotic resulting in his own death. After that, they stage a funeral procession for Schuman. It's amazing how this whole big sham becomes Brean's best work because it's so convincing and looks so authentic. He is so proud and enamored with his own creative work he decides he wants credit and his greed and pride lead to his death. The secret service take care of him. Good example of how the government can easily dispose of someone who gets in their way and no one would ever know. The obvious message is; Americans believe what they are told and hate whom they are told to hate. The American public is very gullible and too lazy to find out the whole situation and facts themselves. In the film, we see how people jumped on the bandwagon without giving the situation much thought. I notice Americans have become very complacent and comfortable within their overprotected lives. We should be aware of global and national politics on a much larger scale. We are so behind compared to other countries. We should get more involved by questioning our government. Corruption exists in many government systems but the American people is the only country I know of that is either unaware or okay with that. It was very frustrating to watch everyone go along with the diversion. I am sure there is much we do not know. I was actually rooting for Brean and Motts to fail but I am sure the outcome rings true.There are so many examples in American Politics that resonate without own because American government has initialized wars (Iraq War) and also created false sense of patriotism to get Americans to back up their country even when the motives seem somewhat blurry (weapons of mass destruction). "Even when a conflict is real and necessary (the Gulf War, for example), the packaging of them is invariably shallow and unquestioning; like sportswriters, war correspondents abandon any pretense of objectivity and detachment, and cheerfully root for our side." At one point in the film, Levinson asks, "Why does a dog wag its tail?" We are told, "Because a dog is smarter than its tail." To the film director, the tail is smarter and we the viewers and American people are taken for a ride and invited to be that easily manipulated dog. The message is clearly to be more aware of the government and become proactive by questioning what is going on and don't just accept everything the government tells you to be true. Learn the facts from both sides.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes you want to read the book rather than re-watch the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched the film, and I have very mixed feelings about it. On the one hand, it cannot be said that the film is bad. It started out as a clever comedy; it made its point about corrupt governments and general public believing anything they see on television; all hints were clear, all actors seemed okay; dialogs were smart; everything was fine. Closer to the end it felt like the writers got carried away and lost control to a certain extent, becoming more illogical and absurd with each scene; but considering that the film was a comedy, it could be forgiven.But the ending just completely puzzled me. I sat bewildered for five more minutes staring at the titles. I did not understand what they wanted to say by this.The first part of the film was a satire, but it was funny. All the inconsistencies, exaggerations, lack of logics, and broad generalizations seen in the first part of the movie could be accepted only if the film posed as a satirical comedy. I hate talking about happy endings, but a (more or less) happy ending could help this movie stay a satirical comedy. But the abrupt and cruel ending suddenly claimed that the film was politically realistic. If so, it rendered the rest of the movie almost totally ridiculous. I do not want to say that a movie cannot or must not be funny AND serious at the same time, but in "Wag the Dog" there is an abyss with a very thin bridge between the two aspects, and it is not very good for style.I am not going to argue whether Americans or other nations are actually so stupid en masse as to be so ignorant of the outside world and to believe everything their politicians say on TV; maybe, they are, after all (though I personally would like to hope they aren't). "Distract attention" scenarios are quite popular nowadays even on the family scale, to say nothing about politicians and governments manipulating the public opinion. Maybe it IS actually possible to fake a war (only the process would not be as simple as in the movie and would not involve so many people, hundreds of potential "leaks"). So basically, from the viewpoint of credibility, the scheme outlined in the film maybe holds water. But the filmmakers should have been more careful about what they actually wanted. If they wanted a cynical satire, it should not have an ending like this. And vice versa, if they wanted a serious political warning of sorts, all absurdities and inconsistencies in the first part should not stick out that much. The movie and the ending just don't fit with each other, and it leaves the impression of something not very carefully thought out and produced hurriedly with a mere aim of shocking the audience and making money.But, striking out the ending, the film does give food for thought, even though every idea in it is exaggerated to the point of absurd. It's not the best political satire in history, but not the worst either. Just maybe it would be better to read the book, after all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes going into the cinema for this particular movie, especially with the like of De Niro and Hoffman on the poster I knew it was going to be great, and it actually was...The movie itself is based on a novel and the screenplay adaptation really deserved accolade.The movie was up for 2 Academy Awards best Actor (Hoffman) &amp; Best-adapted screenplay. Whilst it didn't win either of them it really deserved to.The story actually isn't that hard to understand, the president touches a young girl and the press are onto it like hotcakes. So the presidents right hand man (or in the case girl) Heche gets the presidential adviser De Niro in to help fix the problem, and with election on in 11 days it isn't going to be easy to fix.De Niro gets cutthroat &amp; eccentric Hollywood producer Hoffman in on the scene and to divert the countries attention away from the sex scandal they decide to create a war. Hiring actresses to play young girls in the bombed wreckage and bringing in singers to create full-hearted songs to bring America back on the president's side, the three amigos (Heche, De Niro and Hoffman) actually do a magnificent job.Watch the movies for the laughs, watch the movies for the music (which unfortunately is not on CD) but overall watch the movie to escape reality and to have a great hour and a half.An amazing movie a solid 9/10*I would like to personally congratulate the actors on a remarkable performance.</fullReview>

Aside from the fact that the leading actors are renowned as they are, Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman and Denis Leary played their parts terrifically. The movie starts with anarchy in the white house, as the president has been accused of molesting a young scoutgirl. The `special man' (De Niro) has been called to divert the eyes of the CIA, the opposition leader and the whole nations, by starting a mystical war with Albania `.Q.Why Albania? A. The question you should be asking is: why not Albania.'. The plot thickens when a Hollywood director is called to help orchestrate the biggest show, blind the entire nation as `Old Shoe' (or private Shoemaker, who inconveniently was a psychopath) was declared a hero of their ongoing orchestration. I don't want to spoil the whole movie for you guys, but it's safe to say there were a lot of cracks in the movie that made it a classic.</fullReview>

Wag the Dog loses steam after it invests the entirety of itself in one joke: that the public will throw itself behind a war if only the media baits it in that direction. The rest is downhill. Things go wrong as De Niro and Heche try to keep their heads above water until the election, but not wrong enough to be funny. I'm upset that more energy wasn't put into the script. Did nobody realize they had Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman on the same side of a political satire? Hello? Where was the quick, witty banter?

I think had this really been done well or better people would have been flocking to it.But word of mouth kind of spreads and truth be told this just wasn't great. The film's pace was awful, and there was no sense of excitement which is needed in a movie to "hook" the viewer. Also with a plot like this, the whole movie should have been riveting but it wasn't. In this case there was no tension to the movie-to sum up- great cast, great plot, but not so great enfolding and ultimately disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wag the Dog (1997): Dir: Barry Levinson / Cast: Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro, Anne Heche, Woody Harrelson, Kirsten Dunst: Brilliant comedy about manipulation starring Dustin Hoffman as a filmmaker approached by Robert De Niro and Anne Heche to make a film involving the President's conduct with a young female. The media will be their audience and the news will be their advertising. They stage a fake war in Albania and even present a phony war hero. This is all done to boost an election that was suppose to happen eight days earlier. Ending is questionable but structure is clever resulting in one of Barry Levinson's best films. He previously made other such clever media outings as Rain Man and Good Morning Vietnam. Here he toys with the nature of media interfering in news and exploiting it in a method that draws higher ratings. In this case it also works politically. Hoffman delivers a brilliant performance as a filmmaker out to outdo himself. De Niro and Heche are flawless in their quest for diversion. This is questionable but presented with great touches of humour. Woody Harrelson plays the drunken phony war hero who is oblivious to everything around him. Kirsten Dunst is also featured as an orphan in a fake footage sequence to fool the masses and provide more amusement. Ambitious film about media illusions that gives new meaning to creative art. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's two weeks before the president's re-election and he's far ahead in the polls. A sex scandal allegation with an underage "Firefly Girl" erupts threatening his lead. Spin doctor Conrad Brean (Robert De Niro) comes up with an idea to redirect the talk to Albania. Along with Winifred Ames (Anne Heche), he recruits Hollywood producer Stanley Motss (Dustin Hoffman) to manufacture a fake war.This is a brilliant satire with just enough realism for the audience to question whether this is actual reality. De Niro and Hoffman are absolutely wonderful. The humor is biting. It hits both politics and Hollywood. The title literally infects the popular lexicon. It's a wonderfully funny satire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and Shocking How Real It Is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I personally don't like the news. All news just takes stories and negatively embellishes the heck out of them. Wag The Dog somewhat supports my theory but it really shows how the news can fake things just to make themselves look good. Although the movie is about the news, it's very concept can apply to all forms of mass media. Wag the Dog is a political satire. It's whole point is to show how manipulative media is and how gullible the public is. Barry Levinson has a knack for making feel-good movies, so there's nothing too outrageous. The movie is about the President of the US who has sexual misconduct with an underage girl and breaks into the public two weeks before election. We never do see or hear him. Excellent move by Barry Levinson. De Niro plays a spin doctor who is determined to make the President look like a hero by creating a fictitious war with Albania. Why Albania? Albania is a very tiny country who many people have not heard of. De Niro gets a Hollywood producer (Hoffman) to help create the war by using fake stories and fake footage. The public buys it all. While watching this, keep in mind that the movie is a satire. Kirsten Dunst is an actress who plays an Albanian victim in a battleground in the phony newsreel. Wouldn't her parents think: "That girl looks exactly like my daughter"? Wouldn't headlines break about Albania's proof of denial of the whole war? As a satire, no. The movie's main focus is to make you laugh. Sure it is unrealistic, but that is where my mention of gullibility ties in. The stories are convincing, the footage looks real as can be, it is the biggest story in the country, so why not believe it? The movie puts everything in perspective by having a wild crew make every little thing convincing. Make a Top 10 list of Hoffman and De Niro performances and movies, Wag the Dog would appear on all of them. Hoffman was nominated for an Oscar for his role as a smooth-sailing, flamboyant producer. De Niro (who I found to be just as good as Hoffman) plays a cocky spin doctor who is very admirable. Both guys are very funny. It is also funny to see just how realistic and possible Wag the Dog is. Who's to say fakeness isn't used to cover things up? This was released one month before the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal. Anybody that knows that scandal could see the connection between that and this movie. If I could change anything in this film, I would increase the clarity from Albania's side and add more to the news footage. Other than that, the movie is very real and gets you thinking. What is real and what is fake? How smart are we?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For my money, "Wag the Dog" is one of the sharpest satires in recent memory. The idea of a manufactured war to distract from scandal - this movie drags it to the limits of absurdity. It is astonishing how far spin doctor (De Niro) and producer (Hoffman) take this deceit. The two stars make a great screen pair. Hell, with the exception of Anne Heche (ugh, Anne Heche), it's wholly a pretty great cast.If you're shaking your head in disbelief when the final credits roll, the movie did its job beautifully. It does paint a pretty disparaging picture of the American public. But that's nothing. This is some well put-together stuff.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A political Satire at its best! I first watched this movie shortly after it was released and must admit I got much more out of it the second and third time. At the least it makes you think, even if you are not a conspiracy theorist. I did not give this movie a higher rating because the top rated cast - De Niro, Hoffman and Heche only gave average performances and the direction was also average; there was enough entertainment though to keep you interested until the end. Watch it and watch it again just to remind yourself that things are not always what they seem, which is the one truth illustrated by this movie. The rest of course is satire, we would hope!</fullReview>

Furthermore, the movie is a success in combining filming with politics. Other than these two aspects,personally I didn't find the film very interesting. This could be due to erosion of time on this movie. Other than that though, it wasn't very fun to watch because it was all too predictable and corny like the president's speech.

		<shortDescription>Very good satire of politics, Hollywood, the press and more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1997 film is billed as a comedy drama. A closer look reveals it to be a clever satire as well, and something of a tragedy. The tragedy is in the seemingly so-so attitude of Conrad Brean (Robert DeNiro) at the end, with the "elimination" of Stanley Motss (Dustin Hoffman). The satire is everywhere in the film ? from the realm of politics, to the make-believe world of Hollywood and film making, to the news media. The satire cleverly begs the viewer to ask some serious questions. As a society have we become as ho-hum about life and death as this film and others show we have? Have we become so arbitrary -- at least in some quarters ? about truth and justice? If anyone doubts the intended satire of this film, just look at the promo of the film and the cover of the DVD. They read: "A comedy about truth, justice and other special effects." The plot, in a nutshell, begins 11 days before a presidential election. Top White House staff, with private help, create a bogus war with many other phony side distractions. All this is to divert press coverage and public attention away from the accusation by a young girl that the president sexually abused her during a White House event. The movie is well-scripted and directed. It's full of action and has the audience guessing "What next?" And wondering at the guile of the two main anti-heroes, played by DeNiro and Hoffman. All the performances are very good, and I think Dustin Hoffman's was excellent. It ranks up there with the best of his roles ? maybe even better than his Oscar wins in "Rain Man" and "Kramer vs. Kramer." So, 1997 must have been one of those years when extraordinary politics may have been at work. I discount sentimentalism because the best actor award that year went to Jack Nicholson for his role in "As Good as It Gets." I don't mean to besmirch him, but can anyone ever think of Nicholson in terms of sentimentalism? Nicholson did give a good performance as Melvin Udall. But two other nominees had far superior performances in much more challenging roles. Robert Duvall in "The Apostle," and Dustin Hoffman in "Wag the Dog." I think Hoffman should have won that year for his wonderful job in "Wag the Dog." Once one gets by the Hollywood-added over abundance of crude language, this film is very entertaining. Yes, it is funny in many places. And, it's a real close look at the gullibility of people in many quarters. It's a nice satire on politics, the press and even the general public.</fullReview>

Yes, it is a satire on last years of Clinton, but politics of those days was connected to Slobodan Milosevic and his mad politics. Belgrade TV showed the film just before the NATO started air strikes on Serbia.Why do we have to wage war on each other? The answer is simple. There is disagreement always on about how people should live. Just a day before air strikes started I remember Jelcin warning Clinton on how he should not decide how people should live. I am so glad NATO bombed Serbia, but 9/11 was certain retribution. It is tit for tat and it always is. Just as the first kind of men beat each other with wooden batons, we today beat each other with bombs.Who has the bigger bomb, has the bigger dic*!

		<fullReview>The U.S, President has just been exposed in a sex scandal not long before the next election. Rather than resign or take responsibility, White House spin doctors(led by Robert De Nero &amp; Anne Heche) instead contact a Hollywood producer(Dustin Hoffman, quite funny) to direct an elaborate hoaxed war with Albania, in hopes that the nation will rally behind their incumbent president, and forget/forgive the sex scandal. Things get complicated when a "war hero"(Woody Harrelson) turns out to be a psychopath, and later on when the director insists on putting it on his resume...Ingenious satire by director Barry Levinson is extremely clever &amp; knowing, since it wouldn't be that difficult to pull off a hoax on the American people if handled properly, and had the complicity of the media behind it. Not many people to identify with here, so it is emotionally detached, but such a dead-on portrayal of media and government complicity that it doesn't matter. "Good Old Shoe" is a prime example of what I mean.Also appreciated it's non-partisanship stance, since this scenario would apply to either side.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's funny because it's true ... it's sad for the same reasons ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's fascinating how the September 11th attacks out-dated everything, making the first Gulf War as far in memories as the Vietnam one. People are less to blame than the media-centric system that knew how to deal with the public emotion, and the key thing is that emotion has a short-term memory. George W. Bush could get away with the second Gulf War on the basis of fallacious arguments just by exploiting the September 11 trauma, and any attempt to question his choices could immediately lead to anti-patriotic accusations. And this emotional exploitation is the basis of Barry Levinson's "Wag the Dog", a hilarious satire in the same vein of sharpness than such masterpieces as "Network" or "Dr. Strangelove", and as prophetic. In August 1998, Bill Clinton confessed of having had inappropriate conduct with Monica Lewinsky, a few days later, terrorist strongholds were bombed in Africa in response to the attack of the American Embassy in Tanzania. Replace "Monica Lewinsky" by a Firefly girl, "Africa" by Albania, "Clinton" by an unknown President, and you have the basic plot of "Wag the Dog", and by 'plot', I mean the story the way it is shown on TV to the American audience. Yet "Wag the Dog" is less about the plot than the plotters."Wag the Dog" starts with a crisis, the President has been caught with an underage girl and his opponents prepared an accusing videotape clip using 'Thank Heaven for Little Girls' as musical background, 11 days before the election, if the President's men, lead by a woman, Winifred Ames (Anne Heche) don't come up with an idea and quick, the President is screwed, and his lame "We don't change horses in midstream" campaign won't help. They call Conrad Brean, a spin-doctor; played by Robert De Niro. He comes up with the most likely idea to distract the audience from a scandal: a war, the easiest catalysis of sentimentalism and emotions through sheer patriotism. As long as people would be thirsty for magnificent displays of solidarity and humanity, incarnated by these "We are the World"-like songs, it would be easy to manipulate them. So let's start with rumors about a B3-bomber, "There's no B3-bomber", "Great, even deny its existence".Barry Levinson's film hooks us to Brean's smartness so well that we even forget that the President would indeed deserve to lose these elections. It already starts to work on us. "If the tail was smarter than the dog it would wag the dog", the dog is the audience, give them what they want and they will bite it. It's all a matter of storytelling. As a screenwriter student, I was taught that what counts the most in a story is the idea: the premise, then comes the plot, and then the storytelling, all count but it all starts with the idea. The war was the idea, but then the rest of the plot comes up very fluidly. In Albania, why? Why not? Who knows about it anyway? Who knew about Afghanistan, Iraq or Vietnam anyway? What matters is that a country shows as a potential threat, to what? To the United States, to its lifestyle, its values ? the plan can't fail, the whole storyline comes us so fluidly that the scandal is almost forgotten. But we live in a media-centric society, people need images, they can't rely their emotional involvements on rumors, on unseen stuff. Time for the second protagonist of the film to make his flamboyant entrance; it's Dustin Hoffman in an electrifying performance as Stanley Motts, the producer. He's as passionate, dedicated and enthusiastic about producing as Depp in "Ed Wood" except that he has talent, and this is why the team hires him. He constructs a war with archive footage, sound effects and a young actress to play an Albanian refugee (Kirsten Dunst). People need a gimmick, like the stray cat in Vito Corleone's hands: give her a kitten. Motts understands very well how the identification process works, it asks for symbols, for colors, for memorable stuff, like the raising of the flags in Iwo-Jima or the naked girl in Vietnam. "Wag the Dog" makes us laugh for the same reasons "Network" angered us.Yet, as funny and goofy as it is, the Oscar-nominated script (the second nomination along with Hoffman) never takes its original premise for granted and takes us to unexpected and realistic twists without losing this capacity to surprise. At one point, the CIA, bought by the other side, makes a surprising statement: there's no war anymore, and Brean suddenly abandons the whole plot because it's over, how so? He "saw it on TV", TV is the Alpha and Omega; the "Network" days are not over. This is where Motts surpasses his mentor, with his unforgettable catchphrase "This is nothing", the war won't be over until he says when it's over. The war was just a pivotal moment, but like every story, you need a second pivot: how about a hostage, a war hero, a man who was kept prisoner. Abandoned like an old-shoe, how about a folk song titled "Old Shoe", a soldier whose name starts with "Shoe", like William Schumann (Woody Harrelson), you would believe this is really nothing.The saddest thing about the film is that even after watching this, the tail still wags us as we allowed many pseudo wars to happen. So even if it isn't the first political film to highlight the connection between politics and media-manipulation, it's the most related to our time. It's also a remarkably insightful film about the creative process of storytelling and a job passion, Moss is too obsessed by his talent that he'll never accept the idea of not taking credit from it, while Brean is the straight man who takes everything so normally he reminded me of another expert from a same year's movie, Tommy Lee Jones in "Men in Black", except that Brean's underworld is much scarier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a satire, and a scary one at that</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the president is involved in scandal shortly before the election, a Hollywood producer is brought in to manufacture a war in Albania to distract from the scandal and that the President can end."Wag the Dog" has a great premise that was prescient; before the film was released, President Clinton was involved in the sex scandal with Monica Lewinsky, and he threatened military action in Iraq. The really frightening thing is that in one of the clips shown in the film, a young woman wearing Monica's beret can be seen. It reminded me a little of the situation when Alfred Hitchcock was filming "Notorious," and his Mcguffin was the uranium to make an atom bomb being hidden in wine bottles. It was entirely innocent on his part, but the FBI had him under surveillance for months wondering what he knew about the uranium stores in South America that actually existed..Dustin Hoffman is Stanley Motss, the producer brought in by political adviser Conrad Bean (Robert DeNiro) to produce the war. Anne Heche plays a presidential aide, and the film also includes William H. Macy, Kirsten Dunst, Andrea Martin, Denis Leary, and Willie Nelson.The sad thing is that I suppose all this is possible, despite some obvious holes in the David Mamet-Hilary Henkin script. The media can certainly manipulate, and why wouldn't gullible people believe what they are being shown? Maybe it's based on the premise that the American people are fairly dumb, and if you don't agree with that, you probably won't like it.Nevertheless, "Wag the Dog" puts forth a provocative idea and gets you thinking, and it's great to see Hoffman and DeNiro as two clever albeit sleazy people who believe the end justifies the means.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"... the administration's ambitions to manage the news knew no bounds..." --Frank Rich, The Greatest Story Ever Sold, writing about Condi Rice's attempt to keep bin Laden videos out of the media."Of course there's a war - I saw it on TV." --Robert De Niro, WAG THE DOG.WAG THE DOG is a movie. It's ostensibly a "satire" but as Roger Ebert insightfully observes, "It is getting harder for satire to stay ahead of reality."The U.S. President in a sex scandal. What can the American government do to atone for it? Not apologize to the public, or make amends, or even try to make the president a better man - but manufacture a fake war to take the focus off him, just two weeks before an election. He's termed a government spin doctor in the junkets, but Robert De Niro's character, Conrad Brean, is what mobsters would call a "cleaner." (And isn't the government just a legalized form of thug life?) He makes problems go away. He and the White House PR aide (Anne Heche) manufacture the "war" with Albania ("because no one knows where it is or what's happening there") with the help of a Hollywood producer, Stanley Motss (Dustin Hoffman, channeling Robert Evans). Aided by Denis Leary (facilitator) and Willie Nelson (composing a theme song for the conflict); bringing home a fake war vet, who happens to be PTSD to the gills (Woody Harrelson), and tailed by William H. Macy (CIA).CUCUMBER NOTE: To "wag the dog" comes from the saying 'A dog is smarter than its tail, but if the tail were smarter, then the tail would wag the dog.' It refers to purposely diverting attention away from something of importance, to something of lesser significance, catapulting the insignificant event into the limelight. In other words, to create a "straw man."I'm biting my tongue here on the real life parallels of American government. WAG THE DOG is an allegory of this Orwellian society sometimes called America... where government manufactures crises in order to solve them and pretend efficiency. Like the bailout crisis of 2008; like the debt ceiling crisis of 2011. Who caused them? Not us. Who "solved" them? Not us. But the taxes and fortunes of the oblivious American people were raided by the American government as excuse for the quelling of those crises.So the uncomfortable dichotomy in WAG THE DOG is its biting humor (for the audacity of the liars in this story) tempered with outrage (for the audacity of the liars in real life that this story bases itself on). Movie brings together acting legends De Niro and Hoffman, cheekily playing off each other like a devil against an atheist; De Niro's diabolical twinkle in his eye says, 'Do right by me or you will burn in a lake of fire' and Hoffman's cute obliviousness doesn't truly believe a lake of fire exists unless he produces the movie about it.Flooding the media with war images produced by Motss, Brean can safely proclaim to his CIA questioners who doubt the veracity of the war, "Of course there's a war - I saw it on TV!" And our minds again wander to the terrifying reality of Orwell's America: how the Bush admin flooded the media with "news conferences" that they engineered themselves as propaganda to showcase their murderous policies like Shock and Awe, and nonsensical programs like No Child Left Behind; to check off their ever-moving benchmarks in the fake War On Terror; to "prove" their transparency (ironically, by being duplicitous!). It's not just the felons in the Bush administration; every government finagles the media, but the Bush Klan were so hamhanded and arrogant that they blew it for everyone. Now we know it is common practice to hire PR companies like Burson-Marsteller to "re-brand" activities, entities, corporations, even policies, to repackage lies and malfeasance. In WAG THE DOG, as in real life, they plant "reporters" in press conferences to ask questions that they answer with their spin; they disallow legitimate investigative reporters into their midst for fear of diluting the message; they preclude unfavorable coverage by threatening the news networks with lack of access (i.e. either report the lies or report nothing at all; any "news" is better than no news)... Released in 1997 (when Clinton was prosecuting his own underhanded wars with little or no media coverage), whether this movie is satire or fact, it is undeniably prophetic, because in 2011, this is exactly how "war" is being prosecuted in America - via the media. If you plop a person anywhere in America with no access to media, they could live out their life oblivious to America supposedly involved in "two wars" and innumerable illegal skirmishes 'pon de side. If you did not turn on the news, would you ever know about drone attacks in Libya, or Yemen, or Pakistan? It's just a frivolous game that politicians think it's their job to play. Assholes. As Keith Olbermann used to say, "George W. Bush is having a war in Iraq - for the sake of having a war in Iraq." As Brean and his associates escalate the "war," they escalate the lies to unimaginably audacious proportions, the aide constantly wondering if the lies will "take" with the public. Of course they do. When TV talks, people listen. How many citizens of the indoctrinated United States of America will come away from WAG THE DOG knowing that it was a riotous satire once upon a short time ago, but has turned into a depiction of unethical real life political engineering? Only much tamer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can you save the reelection of the president of the united states when he is blamed in the media for having sexual contact with an underage "Firefly Girl" two weeks before the elections? That is the question which is asked in the beginning of the film "wag the dog". With the answer the director Barry Levinson achieved a nomination for the Oscar and the golden globe award. But this success is a result of the good performance of many great actors like Dustin Hoffman (as a star especially in the comedy genre), Robert De Niro or Denis Leary ,too.The U.S. president (Michael Belson) is hoping of a reelection. But two Weeks before the election a report of a sexual contact with him and an underage ?Firefly Girl" in the oval office is intended to print on the front page of the Washington Post. The adviser of the president Winifred Ames (Anne Heche) does one's utmost to prevent this. She invites the spin doctor Conrad Brean (Robert DE Niro) tot he white house. He is supposed to manipulate the media and publish rumors. He creates the following plan: The report oft he sexual contact has to be replaced by an bigger topic which concerns the whole country. So Mr. Brean invent a B3-Bomber and a entire war against Albanian and let a spokesman publish it. For this plan he gets help by the big Hollywood producer Stanley Motss (Dustin Hoffman) who creates for example video footage which is then shown in the media.The message of the movie is clear: The politician uses the media by manipulating and faking the truth to improve the image of themselves. Because thats the most important thing which matters in an presidential elections. And because of the great performance for example of Dustin Hoffman, who is perfectly cast with the role of Stanley Motss, as the producer who is always relaxed, funny but also focused on his work, the movie reaches to convey this message in a quite funny way. The movie is full of criticism of the own political system. Criticism of the movie is that it drift away from the imaginable reality. Some circumstances which are direct by the team are overdone and its not imaginable that the truth won't come out.Although I finally would rate the film with four out of five stars. It's a great movie and I can recommend it to everyone who like to watch how the media can be used to manipulate an image. For example in films like ?Thank You for Smoking ".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the U.S. President is implicated in a sex scandal at the White House, with less than two weeks to go before he faces re-election for his second-term in office, a professional "Mr. Fix-It" is called upon by a presidential adviser to do a fast spin on the problem; determining that the nation's attention must be diverted to more pressings matters, he enlists the aid of an experienced movie producer and his troupe to fake a media-covered war with Albanian terrorists. Acerbic political satire, one which blessedly doesn't condescend to its audience; in this universe, we're all wildly corrupt. The effect might have been rancid or tasteless, however the all-star cast is comfortably self-amused and most of the targets are detonated with witty aplomb. The screenplay by Hilary Henkin and David Mamet, from Larry Beinhart's book "American Hero", ingeniously name-drops real-life political figures without amassing needless newsreel footage or "Forrest Gump"-styled razzle-dazzle (the scenario simply doesn't warrant it). The President and his party remain anonymous throughout, a decision which gives "Wag the Dog" a great deal of non-dated cache as a relevant political skewering. Though the final act does go off the rails, the remainder of the film is extremely fresh--perhaps not for the ages, but certainly for this era. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty clever - just not especially entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't be less interested in politics generally. In recent years more and more politicians are being shown up as unbelievably corrupt, both financially and morally, and that leads me to doubt almost everything that most of them say anyway.Wag the Dog really doesn't help alter that belief.Incredibly this was released the year before Monica and Bill played "hide the cigar" Wag the Dog concerns the efforts of White House staff to conceal an "indiscretion" made by the incumbent President in the weeks before the Presidential election. Robert De Niro plays the White House equivalent of Mr Wolf from Pulp Fiction Conrad Brean, his role is to bluff the media for just long enough to get past the election, where the President (never seen in the film) had a massive lead in the polls at least before the incident.De Niro and his team never pretend the President didn't commit the act - only that they must cover it up - so Brean decides that the public will only be sufficiently be distracted by a misdemeanor this large by an even larger situation. So Brean and his team consult with a Hollywood producer, Stanley Motss (Dustin Hoffman) to see that they get one. They do this by spreading rumours through various sources that the US security has been threatened by another country, in this case Albania, and that America must band together to ward off this enemy.This comes as a surprise to Albania of course as no such peril exists, but I guess that for a film such as this an element of farce is required.Wag the Dog is never especially funny, there are a few chuckles to be had but the main pleasure is derived from some fairly smart dialogue and how the large team that is ultimately amassed deals with inconvenience and developments that aren't in their favour. Of course being a movie nothing runs smoothly, the CIA and the opposition party see to that, but it is how Motss and Brean adapt and react that provides the interest.Motss is initially reluctant to help, given that he won't get any public credit regardless of how the ploy works, but as things develop his relentless positivity is pretty amusing, it doesn't matter how bad things look, he is still there saying "This is nothing!" and coming up with yet another counter-move.De Niro plays the straight man for much of the film to Hoffman's egotistical Hollywood bigwig, but you sense he is not a man to be messed with and will do anything to make sure that his side wins.As the credits were initially rolling my wife said something along the lines of "Wow, everyone is in this", and indeed the cast does boast Kirstin Dunst, Denis Leary, William H Macy and Woody Harrelson, as well as Anne Heche as Brean's loyal yet seemingly a little naive aide.The final third of the film contains some plot points that seem a little bit too extreme even for a satire such as this, especially given the intricate planning and attention to detail given to early situations, but overall what I went away thinking was "well that seemed way over the top, but no more than the Lewinsky scandal", and in my mind that is probably the most scary part.Stuff like this probably goes on in America way more than we realise, and that we as the global public probably believe way more of what we are told than we should at times.Final Rating ? 6.5 / 10. OK as a film, this is more a necessary reminder to us all not to believe everything that we hear in the media. (Though while we live in a society that believes that the Osbornes, the Kardashians and Paris Hilton really live like they do on TV this seems a pointless reminder.)

		<fullReview>"Wag the Dog" is the blend of politics and media that may be true, but is generally accepted, ignored or disbelieved. Although the portrayal in this film is surely exaggerated, it is sadly probably not far from the mark.As is well-known now, this film came out around the same time President Clinton had a sex scandal of his own to deal with. Some have accused him of deflecting criticism by talking up violence towards Iraq. The fact this film was made just before such an event makes it even more important.With a great early performance by Kirsten Dunst, and the winning combination of William H. Macy, Dustin Hoffman and Robert DeNiro... can this film really ask for more? Oh, and there's Denis Leary! (Willie Nelson and Shooter Jennings, too!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WAG THE DOG (Barry Levinson, 1997) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite being an Oscar contender and its imposing credentials, I had missed out on this one back in the day. I can see how it may be construed as having dated in the interim ? dealing as it does with an attempt to cover-up a Presidential sex scandal (actually anticipating the official disclosure of Bill Clinton's alleged affair with Monica Lewinsky!) which, needless to say, could jeopardize his chances at the upcoming elections. Right now, I do not recall if Clinton's underlings came up with some fantastic ruse to divert attention from the incident but, this being the cinema, it is naturally taken to extremes ? since a Hollywood bigwig (reportedly based on Robert Evans) is actually recruited to 'produce' a fictitious war! Evidently, the key here is satire and the script (which received one of the film's two Oscar nods) certainly manages to be inventive throughout?but, somehow, the end result turns out to be a bit too low-key for its own good and, therefore, not quite as scathing as it could (and should) have been! We are left, however, with a handful of excellent performances led by an Oscar-nominated Dustin Hoffman as the diminutive but undeniably resourceful and confident producer (who comes with his own team of collaborators and ultimately grows recalcitrant when his 'baby' is taken away from him!), Robert De Niro as the 'spin doctor' to whom the White House turns for help when the crisis surfaces and who prompts the (obviously hush-hush) involvement of Hollywood and Anne Heche (who surprisingly holds her own in their company!) as the Presidential aide overseeing the elaborate hoax. Also on hand is country-singer Willie Nelson, assigned the task of concocting an anthem for this latest show of strength by the U.S.A. and there are nice cameos by the likes of William H. Macy (as a CIA operative who smells a rat), Kirsten Dunst (as an aspiring actress chosen to interpret a harassed Albanian in the make-believe conflict) and especially Woody Harrelson (as a would-be stranded soldier afforded heroic status but who eventually displays less-than-admirable qualities that hilariously prove his untimely undoing!). The film also gives one a rare behind-the-scenes look at the creation of visual effects ? it is at once interesting and amusing, but not necessarily coming across as a deliberate deconstruction of the movie-making 'magic'. Incidentally, Hoffman had won his second Oscar (for RAIN MAIN [1988]) under Levinson's direction; the two of them and De Niro had actually already worked together on SLEEPERS (1996; which I have yet to check out!), whereas Levinson and De Niro would eventually re-unite for the not-too-dissimilar (if decidedly inferior) WHAT JUST HAPPENED (2008; see my review elsewhere)?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Brother &amp; Thought Police</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interesting. I enjoyed this. The film's basic idea is that of a "shadow government" engineering the American President's PR during the critical days leading up to the election, and with the aid of a Hollywood producer (!) no less. The film wears out its basic premise in about the first 30 minutes. Really, you could very well stop watching it at that point ; from there it hammers the same points over and over : the easy manipulation of mass media and public, herd mentality, the general gullibility of people to believe whatever they are told to believe, the "conscious nihilism" of powerful men, blah blah blah blah blah.The first twist in the tale arrives at about the 39-minute mark, in the form of a CIA sleuth played by William H. Macy. This is the only twist in the whole film that makes sense, and Macy in his tiny role is very good. Barry Levinson is a thoughtful filmmaker, but he was not the right choice for this story. After a promising start, the film feels slow, plodding and predictable. Just imagine what Oliver Stone or Scorsese would have done with this material. They would have made the interactions so much more powerful.Just because De Niro produced this movie (Tribeca), does it therefore become inevitable that he MUST star in it ?? The guy does absolutely nothing here, its yet another you-don't-argue-with-me performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watered down Robert Altman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to like this movie but about 30 minutes in I just gave up. I had to suspend too much disbelief to buy the phony war scam the characters were pulling off. I don't know what a phony, computer generated war would look like but it would have to be more compelling that the image of Kirsten Dunst clutching a kitty. Part of my problem with this movie was casting; just too many actors that I find annoying. Robert DeNiro is just Robert DeNiro--the same Robert DeNiro he's been in his last half dozen or so movies. Dustin Hoffman is simply a chore to look at and listen to and then there's Anne "I'm a lesbian, oh wait, no I'm not" Heche. They even throw in the grating Dennis Leary for good measure. And why was Willie Nelson in this movie? It was around the time that Nelson was having the jam session with the black musician that I realized that this was simply Levinson doing a watered down Altman schtick. Silly and unengaging. Rent "Bob Roberts" instead.</fullReview>

It shows the potential for government to manipulate media during times of crisis, whether political scandal or war. This film has repeatedly come true since it came out, first during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and now in the War on Terrorism and Iraq.

		<shortDescription>An Intelligent, Visionary Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely in Hollywood cinema do you find a film so honest and critical of the media. Wag The Dog is a brutally dark comedy that touches viewers because, well, we suspect it's true. The idea that political figures would go so far as to invent a fictional war to distract the public from a personal scandal is not so far-fetched. In fact, the structure of our society is such that if this tale had been true, and the truth had been revealed that we bought into this fantasy as depicted in the movie, most people would secretly admire the mastermind of the plot just as viewers of this film can't help but admire Robert DeNiro's character. DeNiro and his co-star Dustin Hoffman are such masters that their performances in this film, although certainly not their most impressive work, are more than believable and entirely engrossing. Aided by a hilariously earnest supporting cast and concise, intelligent scripting, they make this film an entertaining and thought-provoking diversion. 7 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're a Hoffman fan like me, then this is a must see. He is simply magnificent in it! His character, an unappreciated (so he thinks) Hollywood producer is perfect for him ... he adds the exact amount of wit, uncertainty, spontaneity, and unease that one would expect from someone if this insane plot were for real. The President of the United States making it with a firefly girl? Come on .. maybe a girl scout, but even our Presidents have their limit! But Hoffman takes us to the limit in this movie and sends us back. He is so natural in this role, you forget it's him (but that's Hoffman at his best). The other characters are good. Really good. De Niro is great as the man in the shadows who cleans up everyone's messes. Heche is perfect as the somewhat nervous, but always forward moving, Presidential assistant. And even Denis Leary, with a bit part as a movie stylist or something (The Fad King), is a riot. I mean, with Willie Nelson belting out a made-for-cover folk song, how can you go wrong?Hoffman rules!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was absolutely one of the best movies of 1998</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was absolutely one of the best movies of 1998, and remains one of my favorites. It is a perfect example of a film working in all aspects, script, acting, directing...name it, it's all done right. The story begins during the current president's re-election campaign, and we are almost immediately swept into the behind-the-scenes look of things. We soon learn that the President has been accused of sexual assault on a young girl. Enter Conrad Breen(DeNiro). His job is to find a way of keeping the American public distracted from that story as long as possible. So, he goes to Hollywood super-producer Stanley Motts(Hoffman), and together they will lead America to war. Are you interested yet? Hmmmmm, still not sure. What if I were to tell you that the war they have the public believing is going on in Albania, is actually all taking place on a Hollywood sound stage? Yup. It's all been set-up through press leaks, gossip, and fake video footage, to make the President seem...well...presidential. And believe me when i say that that is just the beginning of this fast and funny flick. Dustin Hoffman received a well deserved Oscar nomination for his performance in this film, this being his second nomination under the direction of Barry Levinson(Rain Man). DeNiro is equally fantastic in this film, so funny and laid back, a way I hadn't seen him since MIDNIGHT RUN. You will, I promise, love these performances. Even the supporting cast, most notably Anne Heche as the frantic press secretary helping De Niro and Hoffman do what they got to do, is perfect. You can't take your eyes off it from beginning to end. Sometimes the film may seem a little impossible, but it just looks so serious and believable that you will be second guessing yourself the whole way through (much like the characters in the film). Even the final consequences leave you wondering about what goes on in your everyday life that you really don't know about. By the end of this film, you have not only experienced some funny, and unbelievable situations, but gotten to know the main characters in a personal way. You'll know exactly what motivates each one of these characters through this whole situation, and exactly what they plan on getting out of this cover-up. I think that by the end of this movie, you probably won't care much about the outcome of the presidential election, but more of what these characters must now deal with. I won't spoil it for you, but this film definitely works, and you will love it if you give it a chance. So don't shy away from the political twists in this plot, there's definitely nothing there you can't handle. I think that anyone over the age of 13, with at least some kind of sense of humor will dig this flick. Then again, even I enjoyed it:).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering that it was made BEFORE Levinski-Clinton laundry-cum-proof epic unfolded and BEFORE the actual Yugoslavian NATO farce took place, this movie looks like some serious prophetic stuff.Dustin Hoffman delivers a striking performance. The producer's passion, ambition, desire for recognition, emotionality and even a bit of naiveté are brilliantly convincing.De Niro is less perfect, I'm getting an impression that the only part the man has been getting to play lately is one of Robert De Niro Himself.Politically, Wag the Dog also makes a good point. In a country where public seriously believes a president elected thanks to multimillion donations from corporations to be acting for the good of the public, in a country whose foreign policy's major feature is an unthinking demonization of any nation that strays across the path of any member of the current president's corporate donors, this should be refreshing. In view of the latest Enron-Bush scandal I shouldn't be surprized if a small positive war is to be fought soon in the Middle East. Expect your Shoe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most people know the plot of this outrageously funny movie by now. A political spin doctor, Conrad Brean (Robert de Niro), and a Hollywood producer, Stanley Motss (Dustin Hoffman), both well endowed with chutzpah, set out to create the illusion that the USA has gone to war with Albania, as a distraction from a Presidential sexual peccadillo. Made and released before the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal broke, it is not clear whether the movie's makers had great insight, or inside knowledge; either way, that episode adds to the interest and relevance of the film. De Niro and Hoffman are both brilliant, though understandably the latter seems especially to relish lampooning a film-world type he must have encountered many times in his career. Anne Heche is just right as a Presidential aide who previously thought she was streetwise, but faced with Brean and Motss realises she's a tyro in the kidology game; and Woody Harrelson has a wonderful role as the man picked to play the war hero who just happens to be a psychotic convict. Willy Nelson is also in the movie, apparently playing himself, but in reality(?) as a character called Johnny Dean; he also wrote and performs some of the great songs, including the stirring "I Guard the Canadian Border (I guard the American dream)"!! Among the targets of the satire are clearly the US political establishment, the broadcasting media and Hollywood; but there is a danger that the primary target may be overlooked, and it is worthwhile remembering the derivation of the film's title. Normally, the dog wags the tail because the dog's smarter than the tail; but if the tail was smarter, it would wag the dog; and there can be little doubt that the dog being wagged by Brean and Motss is the viewing and voting public.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All combat takes place at night, in the rain, and at the junction of four map segments.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very wicked satire on Hollywood, politics and the supreme power of media. ****Spoilers**** Q: What's good about conjuring up a fake international crisis? A: it can distract the public from the real one and being fake it's very easy to resolve. Moreover, you can do it without any loss of American lives which is always a big plus if one is concerned about the presidential approval ratings. At first glance the very idea behind the movie seems ridiculous. However, it turned out to be so prophetic it's freaky. Mr. Clinton and his advisors probably watched it to learn from the masters. Of course instead of an Albanian village we had a Sudaneese medical factory which was elevated to the status of a chemical weapons plant and promptly destroyed just in time to help the president ease off the impeachment pressures. To be fair democrats weren't the only ones to engage in such practices. In fact, what probably inspired the movie was the invasion of Grenada conveniently launched while Reagan was taking a huge hit on account of loosing all those American lives to a terrorist bomb in Lebanon.One might think that a film like "Wag the dog" would be too much tied to the politics of the moment that it would loose all appeal a year past its release. However, I've just watched the film on TV and I liked it no less than when I watched in theater few years ago. In part this is due to a very snappy script and very good acting jobs by the lead actors: De Niro, Heche and especially Hoffman. Also, Woody Harellson is simply hilarious as a paranoiac convict who is enlisted to play a role of a war hero of the Albanian campaign.The movie is intentionally extremely cynical in the way it delivers its message and some people might find that offensive but I believe it to be one of its major strengths. My main complaint is that on a few occasions it pushes the boundaries of believability so far that it turns from satire to farce which I don't think it intended to be. Another drawback is that none of characters, good or bad ( well, they are all bad), is engaging enough to make you care at all about what happens to them. That's why nobody is going to shed any tears for Hoffman's character (the most engaging of them all!) who gets killed in the end when it becomes apparent that he wants to disclose the whole affair in his vain desire to get recognition.However, overall this is a pretty good film well worth your time to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The point of the film is by-and-large how gullible the mainstream media is. During the Clinton years, the Powers That Be could have said the sky was green &amp; anyone who said otherwise a right-wing conspiracist. And, basically, the lap-dog media corps would have marvelled at the spin. Now we see just how much the Clintonestas fooled the press, and this film seems more like allegory than fantasy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intelligent satire.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Critic Roger Ebert (oh, don't act like you don't know who he is) often speaks about comedy that doesn't give you belly laughs but has you smiling the whole way. Well, I thought that was a barrel of bull-crap until I saw Wag The Dog.The plot is almost prophetic: The president of the United States is caught with his pants down, only 11 days from the election. His aide (Anne Heche) hires a political fixer (Robert DeNiro) to cover up the scandal. His idea? To stage a non-existent war. He gets help from a big shot Hollywood producer (Dustin Hoffman). Together, over one night, they stage an epic war with Albania. (Why Albania? Heche's character asks DeNiro. What have they done to us? What have they done for us? he replies.) They film a scene with Kirsten Dunst as an Albanian refugee with a kitten, to rack up the sobs. Eventually, their idea gets more and more elaborate and they get a slogan... "The Old Shoe". (Wow, talk about an idea. I could be in Hollywood, if it were up to that.) They look for an army officer name Shoe something and they come up with this guy Schumann . But Schumann ends up being a psycho who's spent 12 years in jail for raping a nun.The rest of the story is basically a turning point so I won't reveal it. I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. There was just something about it that looked incredibly boring. Hah! This was a very funny movie, thanks to excellent performances by the always great DeNiro and the almost always great Hoffman (*cough* Sphere *cough* Ishtar). I'd say Hoffman was a little better than DeNiro because his character was more developed and had more potential to work with. David Mamet's script has some funny quips and is intelligent, but it moves too rapidly for its own good and gets bogged down into mumbo-jumbo at times. Anne Heche is also good and there are some cameos by William H. Macy, Willie Nelson, Woody Harrelson and Craig T. Nelson.Both the Hollywood and Washington satire aspects work, and the story moves along at a good pace. The fact that this is a fairly short movie means that there's very little time to be bored. A few minutes to flesh out DeNiro's character would have been nice, though. With Barry Levinson to direct, Robert Deniro and Dustin Hoffman to star, David Mamet writing and a strong supporting cast, Wag The Dog is a real winner. 8.5/10</fullReview>

As a result, you find yourself laughing at several scenes within the movie, which are completely dramatic to the audience within the movie. It was strange and interesting.My only quibble is that it seemed to end rather abruptly, and left a few loose ends dangling.

De Niro is good but he could act parts like this one in his sleep.Hoffman is great as the showbiz producer and this is one of his best roles in years. The movie itself is perhaps too knowingly clever and the humor does seem contrived. Then again David Mamet's screenplays or his stage plays are not exactly known for their laugh content.Part of the problem with this movie is that the main characters are so annoying you do not care what misfortune awaits them. Woody Harrelson's appearance late in the film adds greatly to the plot. Overall, not bad but when you look at the sum of the talent involved (Barry Levinson, Mamet, De Niro, Hoffman), a bit of a disappointment.</fullReview>

I don't think it showed that at all.Now, I'm not disputing one network couldn't try to make something up or get caught in a scandal about 'bending the news' (Dateline proved that a few years ago). But, theres a big difference between that and the government totally making up a war and 1000s of media outlets NOT figuring out its not really happening. I mean, what network WOULDN'T want to expose it. What network wouldn't want to make the other networks look bad for chasing a "fake story"? They only showed one networks "coverage" of the "war" in the movie for good reason I guess: cause thats about as plausable as it could really be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am generally a lover of dialogue driven films, and I must say that this film is up there in my satire favorites. I think most people who disliked the film attempted to see the film as mostly a satire of the Hollywood-Washington connection, or as a satire about the corrupting power of the "unknown handlers" of a president...on that score it is about a six...there are films that do that better...but I guess I saw it more of a satire of the sheer gullibility (if there is such a word) and blind patriotism of the American public. So much of what the handlers do is bought, lock, stock and barrel by the American public without question. The scene with the shoes being thrown on the basketball court, and all of the lines by DeNiro are just classic. Add to that the music by Willie Nelson, including one very hilarious, Lee Greenwood-esque nauseatingly "wrap yourself around the flag" song entitled "Guard the American Border, Guard the American Dream", and this film is just hysterical. Granted, I saw this film before the Clinton scandal broke and saw it more of a satire linked to Bush and the blind patriotism of the Gulf War, but seeing the parallels to the Clinton administration is just plain eerie. Even the brownie girl, with whom the President in the film is alleged to have molested, wears a beret as she gets hugged by the President. That is so weird, it makes me wonder if perhaps David Mamet and Barry Levinson (and perhaps Dustin Hoffman and Robert DeNiro) knew more about Lewinsky through their Hollywood buddies than the rest of us in the gullible public at the time of production. Nonetheless, this is a must see, and I gave it a 10, despite the annoying Anne Heche, who darn near ruins the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wag the Dog: rated R, 1 hour and 40 minutesA group of spin-doctors plan to create a diversion to turn the Americans' attention away from a scandal aimed at the president just weeks before the election. Robert De Niro plays Conrad Brean, the intelligence of this group of con artists, who produces the illusion, along with the help of an assistant (Anne Heche), and a Hollywood producer (Dustin Hoffman). Brean thinks of the ideas and Motss (Hoffman) puts them into action. Together they succeed in fooling America and rigging the elections.This movie has no doubt a very clever plot, with many smart, comical points, but it also lacks the image that makes a movie what it is. The characters are exceedingly shallow, and in general, it seems that all the trouble gone through to fake a war can be made easier if instead the efforts were put into helping the president make a new campaign slogan, which is repeatedly made fun of throughout the film. Overall, the ideas are acceptable, yet the execution appears to have failed.Though the movie seems full of humor and canny remarks, the actual message expressed in Wag The Dog is rather disturbing. This poses the question: If America can be deceived so easily at something as difficult to conduct as a war, how would America react to a small scam made up? The film proves how easily the news can be manipulated and controlled. In this movie there is no distinguishing borderline between fact and fiction. The idea that anything seen or heard on the news might be a hoax, the comical punch line of this movie, may not be so funny after all.Wag the Dog, directed by Barry Levinson, also starring Woody Harrelson, is a ?political satire', which becomes less than satisfying,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great political satire for anyone who hasn't gone brain dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wag the Dog is a funny and engrossing stylized political satire (see Bulworth) for anyone who has not killed all of his brain cells. I just saw the film although I had intended to see it during the theatrical release. For those of you who were expecting a slack jaw comedy, shame on you. Do your research before you fly off to see a film and maybe you won't be disappointed so often. WTD is not meant to be "realistic"; besides, that is fairly impossible when one's intent is absolute and biting satire. The only things that keep WTD out of the *** to ***1/2 category (out of ****) is the calculated use of Deniro and the disappointing finale.First, the casting of Deniro was a highly obscene use of box office drawing power. Because of the superficial way in which his character is drawn,which is to be expected in this kind of film, anyone could havebeen "wasted" as Conrad. More than anything, I suspect that Deniro was paired with Hoffman to increase ten-fold any draw that Hoffman would have achieved alone as the star of the film.But what killed this film and all of its note-worthy effort--so entertaining and thought-provoking a film on the cusp of greatness--was the unforgivably lackluster ending. The film is forced to end abruptly, leaving the unsatisfied viewer in a stupified haze wondering "After all we've been through. How could it end like this?" Unfortunately, the writing talents of this film ran out of steam towards the end.</fullReview>

The shot of Dustin Hoffman talking to the White House team from his tanning bed was very funny, as were the manufactured songs and the arguments about the color of the fake bomb victim's kitten.Still, boredom crept in midway through and by the end I had trouble concentrating. The movie lacked tension, and as a substitute told jokes whose punch lines we'd already heard. Craig T. Nelson's character, who was meant to be the opposition, was nothing more than an occasional inconvenience who was certain to be conquered.I liked the ending, (which I won't spoil), but I needed to feel that the stakes were higher. For the comedy to be entirely successful, it had to make me just a little nervous. This movie was just too comfortable and settled for the easy jokes. I voted a six, but I had gone in hoping for much more.</fullReview>

These further little additions add to an already witty and clever story.Clearly two type of "folk" here... show business-types and government-types. And the film pokes satirical fun at them both. DeNiro, recently (and unjustly) criticized for always playing the typical gangster, goes another way with a fine performance as a spin doctor selling a gig to a big-time Hollywood producer.Hoffman once again show his versatility as the big-haired producer seeing oncoming problems as part of the game.Heche does a great job as the on-site link to the White House.

		<shortDescription>Rises above recent political satires through great characters...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Political satires have become the rage in American movie-making and WAG THE DOG is clearly head and shoulders above the rest. First off: NOTICE the fact that we never see a president (when you see a glimpse, he is out-of-focus). This is important, because this movie is attacking the position of a president and what costs an administration may go to ensuring success and good PR. Director Barry Levinson and David Mamet have used the all-powerful media to wag us, and gives you the impression that we always have and always will be wagged.This film works so well because of the fantastic script, but also, because of the rich characters involved. De Niro and Hoffman have such juicy roles, their characters even have their own trademark lines: Hoffman- "This is nothing!", De Niro- "I'm working on that." Hoffman's producer is based on real-life producer Robert Evans allegedly, and judging by how he plays him (silly glasses, veggie shakes), they must not have seen eye to eye in the past. He deserved his Oscar nomination, and De Niro inhabits Conrad Brean, "the fixer", so well, you almost long to have a job like his. Create smokescreens from the hip. That is what he is always working on.The supporting cast is highly memorable. Heche is sexy and solid, and Denis Leary as the "fad king", spills out his dialogue like a runaway train. So many reporters, anchormen, etc. echoed this movie when Clinton's 'firefly' incident hit the country just FOUR months after its release. What the spin doctors do in WAG THE DOG cannot be that far off. I don't think they created a war, however, if they happened to do what Hoffman and co. do here, why wouldn't we fall for it? Our source is the media. We believe most of what we SEE. De Niro as Brean is quick to point this out. In one scene, he says the first draft of the Warren Commission says Kennedy was killed by a drunk driver. Would the public have bought it? Who knows? Probably.The film flows smoothly and the witty dialogue and situations make you laugh. It is important because of its slanted accuracy to our current presidency and also slightly eerie. I guess after seeing it, I won't believe ALL of what I see on the 6 O'Clock news.</fullReview>

Not to mention that it came out before gitalong Bill and thar' she blows Monica became such a popular item. It almost makes you wonder that maybe there is some truth to it all, and what we see is no way what it really is. Anyway, what we see in this film is the president getting in trouble with some young thing, and so all these cloak-and-dagger government types start thinking they got to do something because the election is soon, so they come up with the idea of a war, but there won't really be a war, just an illusion of one. So they hire this big shot Hollywood producer to make up this illusion, and they all get together and just hoodwink the whole gullible folks who are out there in American TV land.We got conspiracy theories, we got statements on the stupidity of folks like you and me, we got way too much similar stuff between the movie and reality, we got yahoos acting like VIPs, and finally we got the government being one big schemer, liar, deceiver, and doer of ill deeds.Almost three stars.

		<fullReview>I've heard a lot of talk about this movie being severely unfunny. This is not true. "Wag the Dog is an excellent look at the game of politics and how it filters into (and is filtered by) the film industry. Dustin Hoffman is the unflappable producer who is hired to avert the public's attention from a presidential sex scandal just before re-election, and he looks like he's having so much fun with the part. The dialogue is crisp and witty no matter how many times you've seen it, and the scene on the airplane (with Woody Harrelson as a psycho) is an instant classic; in fact, the entire film is an instant classic -- if you know how to look at it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what we were expecting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wag the Dog is a good movie. There are fine performances by Dustin Hoffman and Robert DeNiro, two of the best actors of our time, encompassed in it. The plot is perfectly believable. There is, however, one big problem with Wag the Dog.If you are anything like me, when you saw the trailer or the commercials, you thought, comedy. And Wag the Dog is a comedy. To a point. But after a certain part of the movie, it really ceases to have much comedy left and begins to drag.The movie is more of a black comedy than anything else, and often leaves you wondering why it isn't being funny. That is the problem with Wag the Dog: it's a good movie, but it isn't the movie you wanted to see, and it certainly isn't the movie you expected to see. The ending, too, leaves a lot to be desired.I give Wag the Dog a B. If they ever re-release it, I hope they'll promote it as the type of movie it is, and not as a movie that looks like an out -and-out comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is one of the best action comedies I have ever seen. The action begins from the first moment and keeps going throughout. De Niro is brilliant as Bream, the man with the plan who organizes the players from the start. Dustin Hoffman is the witty but self absorbed producer who is constantly talking about his own successes. Every scene is well thought out and believable, which makes it a wonderful mix of fantasy and reality. Anne Heche is a great foil for De Niro's character, Denis Leary is the pitchman, Willie Nelson is the singer-songwriter who is looking for the "back end" on his songs, and Andrea Martin is perfect as the designer. A political comedy that rings all too true in the world of today. A must for any lover of De Niro, and a must for the serious collector. Language, pill popping, and a lot of innuendo make this a no-no for the kiddies, but your teens should see it for their future knowledge of the term "spin doctor".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent, unique concept comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Wag the Dog" is one of those smart comedies. That's not to say it's an elitist brand of humor, but it certainly doesn't have a mainstream appeal like physical or situational comedy. It's a witty concept comedy, and the humor comes through characters and the humorous set-up. It doesn't exactly leave a profound impact on you either, but it's certainly a unique film.The great concept for the film is that a DC PR guy for the president and a Hollywood producer team up to distract the public from a presidential sex scandal that emerges just weeks before he is running for re-election. They decide the best way to do it is by creating a fake war between the US and Albania. This alone holds a lot of promise and that promise, in many ways, is delivered thanks to the minds behind it.First, there's one of the writers, famed playwright and screenwriter David Mamet, who gives the film its intellectual edge. Director Barry Levinson is much the same kind of director in his approach to comedy and certainly marquee actors Dustin Hoffman and Robert DeNiro don't team up for just any old jokefest (I'll pretend "Meet the Fockers" hasn't come out yet).Stealing the show is really Hoffman, whose quirky, "if you can dream it you can do it" mentality permeates the down-to-business attitude of the other characters and scenes. He keeps the humor of the whole situation in check with his requests for Calico kittens and patriotic songs from Willie Nelson's character.Most interestingly, you never see the president in the film. He's not a character at all--it's entirely about the people behind him. Whereas the film could be written so you identify with the public, it's written to give you a secret little viewing room into the world of spinning the media. It does seem a little exaggerated at times, but it's very unique among comedies. It's not supposed to make you laugh as much as grin sheepishly at the side of politics you're not seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This is politics at its finest."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just eleven days before the all-important election, the President of the United States becomes embroiled in a sexual harassment scandal involving a teenage girl. In order to distract the voting public from the Presidential scandal, Washington spin doctor Conrad Brean (Robert De Niro) hires Hollywood producer Stanley Motss (Dustin Hoffman) to orchestrate a fake war against Albania. Barry Levinson's 'Wag the Dog' is a biting political satire, and a well-humoured exploration of the manipulation of the mass media and public opinion in American politics. The screenplay was based loosely upon Larry Beinhart's satirical conspiracy theory novel, 'American Hero,' which asserted that President George H. W. Bush had completely concocted the Gulf War. David Mamet was originally claimed to be the sole adapting screenwriter, but Hilary Henkin took the film's producers to court, claiming otherwise. Ultimately, Henkin was awarded the top writing credit, and the two shared an Oscar nomination in 1998.Just a month after the film was released, 'Wag the Dog' received a massive boost of public interest thanks to a startling coincidence. In January of 1998, much like the Presidential character in the film, President Bill Clinton became involved in a disastrous sex scandal arising from his former relationship with 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Over the course of 1998 and 1999, the United States engaged in three military ventures: Operation Desert Fox, Operation Infinite Reach and Operation Allied Force, each during pivotal moments throughout the scandal. The events truly are an eerie example of real life echoing fiction ? but, then again, perhaps Clinton's advisers had just sat down for a screening of the film!The very idea of creating a convincing fake war is absolutely ridiculous, but somehow a great cast makes it seem almost believable, with De Niro once again proving his comedic talent as the no-nonsense, never-say-die Presidential schemist ("a good plan today is better than a perfect plan tomorrow") and Hoffman terrific as the rich, enthusiastic and credit-starved film producer ("did you know there's no Academy Award for producing?"). Hoffman would have been glad that, despite not being nominated for a nonexistent producer's Oscar, he did pick up a Best Actor in a Leading Role nomination for his excellent work here.Perhaps it is because the film is based on a singular implausible premise, but the film failed to entirely hold steam throughout its running time, never really managing to keep pace with the hilarity of the opening minutes, when De Niro and Hoffman's plan first begins to fall into place. The film finishes on a rather uncharacteristic downbeat note, perhaps Levinson's means of bringing the audience back into the callous world of political deception and corruption. After all, whilst everybody involved appeared to have a grand time orchestrating a fictional war against the unfortunate nation of Albania, none of it is really a laughing matter at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ten years on, and it was time for a return to check out this show. Still great to watch, and still great fun. A lot of people miss the point of the show, thinking it's somehow about the US political system when it's really all about Hollywood and American entertainment, the delusional hope of entertainers that somehow they are relevant and can make a difference, and the way reality can be time shifted into a strange, surreal landscape of sentimental schlock, tearful speeches, awful songs, and video tricks.But hey, that's nothing, this is by far Levinson's best film, and Dustin Hoffman manages to mangle Hollywood execs in fine style, and the screwball pace of the dialog is handled by everyone else with style. Everybody who rants about the political nature of the show seems to overlook the fact that we never actually see the President, it's his opponent who gets the screen time, and that's because the creative team want us to focus on Hoffman and his ultimate fate. The political system might shaft everyone in sight, but hell, he didn't get the credit. If you've been in the game, you'll know that's the thing that really sticks in the craw. Everybody knows politics sucks and is just a sub-branch of showbiz - that's old news for satire - but the real tragedy is that in showbiz you're never going to get the credit, at least if you're the producer (by the way who was the producer of the show? Did they have anything to do with it??)I look forward to seeing this show another ten years down the track, and having a subtle laugh or ten. If you haven't seen it, and have a nicely cynical frame of mind (and a passing connection to the entertainment game), what planet are you on, but please check it out ...About the only thing that has much political relevance is that it feels good some folks in the States can sometimes get to make a show like this or Thanks for Smoking. It's about the only time you get the sense that democracy and freedom of speech might actually be a working, workable concept ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poison in the media...in other words, a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this movie for a second time and it hit me at just how much poison there is in all forms of media. It begs the question of how much of what we see on TV is really a well-choreograpped whopper. I think this movie is one of the best and honest political films of the last decade if not of all time. It recalled the near five by ten squared days we spent listening to the drivel of that man's sex life. It shouldn't have been public knowledge anyway, it wasn't our concern. He should have admitted it and it would have gone away but that didn't happen and we have moved beyond it.Here are my reasons (and some spoilers maybe contained within): (1) The main reason this movie worked was the performance of Dustin Hoffman. He was astonishing as the eccentric producer and his was the best performance of the film. (2) I couldn't believe that I had seen both Willy Nelson and Denis Leary in the same film. Both of them did exceptionally well the songwriter and fad man respectively. (3) I never thought that Woody Harrelson could play a psychotic rapist. He was rather insane in the roll and he pulled it off. (4) David Mamet and Hilary Henkin both did an exceptional job in writing the screenplay. Both of them have a nose from nasty, poisonous tales (think "The Spanish Prisoner" and "Romeo is Bleeding"). (5) Barry Levinson is a good director (watch "Sleepers" for more proof). (6) The title of the film is a perfect description of how I feel when I sometimes watch the news or read the newspaper. We are fed loads of BS each day and we have become complacent to it. The government is the tail; it wags us everyday. (7) I think this film fits the definition of black comedy. It makes your defense laugh go off and it doesn't apologize for it (much like American Beauty does). (8) Even more than a black comedy, this was a nutty black comedy. The film had a very wacky feel to it. Dustin Hoffman kept using the defense line "This is NOTHING!" even in situations that obviously meant something. The plane crash is the best example for this line of thought. (9) This leads to the dichotomy of the film which I think was perfect. Black comedies have a poisonous feel to them. They get under your skin and are with you forever and you can't get rid of them. The poison or rather the remedy (depending on how one thinks; I believe remedy but all remedies have side effects) is social awareness about how the media screws with the public and how we have become complacent to it. (10) This was the perfect slam on our last head of state. I can still remember when he ordered those bombings on Iraq while the scandal was going on. This is the "Bob Roberts" for the other party. Ten reasons give a score of ten.Overall, this movie is scathing and caustic to say the least. It was wacky and nutty in a certain way but for the most part, it was poisonous. It was like eating mallow-filled nut roll where the center was filled with a large dose of strychnine. I may be embellishing my description a bit but it felt like it to me. This movie hit closer to home since I had watched "Bob Roberts" before that. They are both masterpieces about the art of political deception no matter which party is in power. Most of the news we get is imagery and nothing more. Things that lack substance disturb me greatly and that is why I flip the news off after hearing the headlines because they are the substance. If you want true substance, try the print media because at least it tries to spell things out. Anyway, if you can stomach the caustic flavor of "Wag The Dog". It is a perfect diatribe on mass media and political deception and it is best viewed along with "Bob Roberts". Here ends my rant!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Levinson, once such a fine, naturalistic director, seems to have come unstuck with this film. The signs weren't good with Sleepers, and Wag the Dog was a bigger disappointment. Whilst a good comedy satire such as The Player or Dr Strangelove allows the viewer to feel involved without being pushy, Wag' is relentless in making sure you get the joke - it's too claustrophobic. The visual style is too hurried and is trying to hard to come across as naturalistic and instead becomes intrusive and annoying.But, there are some good gags and Hoffman and De Niro do well with under - written roles. Sadly Heche, the most under used actress in Hollywood, struggles with dialogue that Mamet tries to convince us we all really use.Oh, and the ending (and this may be a ***SPOILER***, but probably not) is badly handled, with the tone and rhythm of the film disturbed. Not that I've got anything against shifts in tone - LA Confidential does it brilliantly, but Wag the Dog seems to stick the ending on for no important reason other than to tell us 'we're being serious'. 6 out of 10</fullReview>

Although I generally find dark comedy quite watchable, I had problems with this one. I think to really enjoy this movie you need to get over the selfishness and lack of ethics from almost all of the characters.

		<fullReview>Wag the Dog is a funny and engrossing stylized political satire (see Bulworth) for anyone who has not killed all of his brain cells. I just saw the film although I had intended to see it during the theatrical release. For those of you who were expecting a slack jaw comedy, shame on you. Do your research before you fly off to see a film and maybe you won't be disappointed so often. WTD is not meant to be "realistic"; besides, that is fairly impossible when one's intent is absolute and biting satire. The only things that keep WTD out of the *** to ***1/2 category (out of ****) is the calculated use of Deniro and the disappointing finale.The casting of Deniro was a highly obscene use of box office drawing power. Because of the superficial way in which his character is drawn, which is to be expected in this kind of film, anyone could have been "wasted" as Conrad. More than anything, I suspect that Deniro was paired with Hoffman to increase ten-fold any draw that Hoffman would have achieved alone as the star of the film.But what killed this film and all of its note-worthy effort--so entertaining and thought-provoking a film on the cusp of greatness--was the unforgivably lackluster ending. Unfortunately, the writing talents of this film ran out along with its credibility towards the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that this was a very good movie. Now, much has been made of its classification as a 'comedy'. It may not be a laugh out loud type of film (although I did on a couple of occasions) but it is witty, fun, and satirical. I have seen many movies classed as comedies where I didn't even crack a smile. People have also mentioned some requirement for genius IQ to 'get' this movie. I would dispute that, but at the same time, I would say that I may well have enjoyed this movie more because my degree and work is in politics. The story itself is uncanny. It was been a well known principle that wars are good for poor polls. It is just even more obvious nowadays. The degree of media manipulation may be pushing things a bit far, but it is scary that control of information and pictures(ie Desert Storm) colours our perceptions so greatly. Generally, this movie preaches that people will believe what they are told and hate whom they're told to hate. Unfortunately, there's a lot of truth in that. I thought the acting superb, especially Hoffman. Even Heche (whom I've thought poorly of since 'Six days, seven nights' - terrible movie) put in a classy job, and DeNiro was his usual quality actor. Lastly, anyone who thinks 'Primary Colors' a superior movie... well I will say no more except maybe you should stick to Van Damme movies from now on.</fullReview>

The sharp look at media manipulation is funny and a bit scary when you realize how true it probably is. If most people get their info from the TV what they show is the news. This suggests that audience manipulation is all you need because few need more than that. I enjoyed most of the movie until the end.

The acting in "Wag the Dog" was great but good acting cannot subsitute for a boring story line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right after this movie was released, the affair between Billy and Moni broke out and there were suddenly problems with the Middle East. Hum Hum... So, it may not be about that, but it's pretty close. When the President gets caught in a sex scandal, it's up to Robert DeNiro, Anne Heche and Dustin Hoffman, brilliant as the Hollywood producer, to create a fake war with Albania. It was very funny to see how the whole scam was planned in the very detail. For a great rental, I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Judging from the IMDb rating this movie has garnered, I can only assume that most of IMDb's raters are those who are easily bored if 10 minutes go by without something blowing up. If you're not one of those "action movie" junkies, then you might just love this movie.It has some of the best, and funniest dialog of any movie of the late '90s. The acting is fantastic - rare in an age when "acting" normally means trying to look frightened while staring at a blue screen where the special effects will go.This movie definitely isn't comparable to movies like "Independence Day" or "Airforce One," but fortunately, that means it isn't comparable to "Independence Day" or "Air Force One." Definitely not for the faint of mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent political satire with an all too realistic feeling.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Wag the Dog," is an excellent political satire that has an all too realistic feeling. It was shown on Dutch television one day before the new American president was elected in 2004. Of course this was a well chosen moment ... the movie is about how a spin doctor and a Hollywood producer make sure the president will be in office for another four years and they don't mind to spread some rumors 'for the good cause'.What makes this movie so special, is the fact that it isn't far from the truth. This movie was made in 1997, but it is so unbelievably relevant today that it almost makes you feel this producers could see the future. If you see what happened with George W. Bush (his failure to capture Osama Bin Laden before the elections, starting a war in Iraq to camouflage this failure...), you can only watch this movie with your mouth wide open. OK, there is a difference between the truth and this story of course, but in the end you really can see many similarities. This is how the story goes: The President is caught up in a sex scandal two weeks before the election and his spin doctor is brought in to fix things up. They decide to fake a war with Albania with the help of a Hollywood producer. They invent a story, start some rumors and studio footage is inserted into the news to create the illusion of a war, so the attention of the public is diverted away from the scandal. Of course things go wrong but time after time they know to make it work. I guess this movie will not be appreciated by everybody. I can imagine that most Bush adepts don't even understand the underlying message of the movie because even in reality they swallow whatever is served to them by the president's team of spin doctors. No, I guess it will be non-Americans like me and the Democratic voters that will see the humor in this movie. I know I had some good laughs and I reward it with an 8/10. This should be seen by all Americans.</fullReview>

De Niro was great in it as well (obviously) and I was surprised at the amount of people in the supporting cast: Anne Heche, Woody Harrelson etc etc...A good film, quite a witty humour, found myself giggling quite a lot - mainly at Hoffman's character.

		<fullReview>Why does a dog wag its tail? Because a dog is smarter than its tail. If the tail were smarter than the dog, the tail would wag the dog. So say the opening credits of Barry Levinson's political satire "Wag the Dog," one of the best bites at American politics ever made. Levinson ("Diner," "Rain Man") has made some great films in his career. "Wag the Dog" is one of his most charismatic and energetic.The film concerns itself with the media's close links with the government. In it, a veteran spin doctor hires a Hollywood mega-producer to help start a false war, in an effort to divert attention from the President's alleged underage affair with a "Firefly girl." The spin doctor is played by Robert De Niro. The bigshot Hollywood producer is Dustin Hoffman. Together, De Niro and Hoffman create one of the best teams in ages -- and Hoffman's performance in particular is scene-stealingConrad Brean (De Niro) is under pressure to resurrect the President's chances at being re-elected, so he and Stanley Motss (Hoffman) start using any means necessary to jump-start their phony war. Along with the help of an associate (Anne Heche) they travel around the country stirring up controversy about the war, creating false war heroes, alerting America of possible attacks by Albania (their false war target). In today's day and age, it almost seems uncannily close to reality.The movie has extremely funny scenes, all very realistic in nature. People who appreciate films will love "Wag the Dog" because of its Hollywood references. "Did you know there's no Academy Award for producing?" Motss asks Brean. Throughout the movie he relates unexpected and overwhelming incidents to his past. "This is nothing compared to when one of my projects had its funding canceled after four months," Motss says. Everyone rolls their eyes. They've heard the story before.Then there's the part where we meet up with the fake war hero that Brean has hired. He's played by Woody Harrelson and is a convict. "What did he do?" someone asks. "Murdered a nun," is the reply. Then we find out that the convict is running low on medication, which results in some very funny jokes.I have to admit that I'm surprised some scenes were present in the finished cut, such as the indication that a President's staff is corrupt enough to actually do such things as those we see in "Wag the Dog." The film is bold enough to actually use scenes such as this to its advantage. What might come across as rude or possibly irreverent becomes quite hilarious. In a film crammed with celebrity cameos (ranging from Denis Leary to Craig T. Nelson), Willie Nelson shows up and is hired to write a patriotic war song. "Albania, Albania," he croons. "Yeah, that rhymes," Motss says.Throughout the movie, Hoffman's performance is frantic and wild, resulting in a rather hyperactive character who is constantly talking, moving, yelling, or worrying. Although De Niro stole the show in "Analyze This," Hoffman does the same in "Wag the Dog," creating a very memorable character to add to his resume.The movie was written by David Mamet and Hilary Henken. Mamet has an ear for great dialogue, always has, and undoubtedly most of the solid dialogue in "Wag the Dog" could be attributed to his credit as co-writer. Mamet also wrote the script for De Niro's "We're No Angels," which co-starred Sean Penn, and was a fairly enjoyable and underrated comedy about two convicts who escape from jail and try to cross the Canadian border, only to be mistaken for Catholic priests. It wasn't a great movie but due to Mamet, De Niro and Penn, it succeeded as light entertainment. What was missing was the solid dialogue present in Mamet's other scripts, and there's plenty of it in "Wag the Dog." There are a handful of quotes from this film that I will probably never forget.Movies such as "Wag the Dog" don't come around very often, and when they do, they're usually a lot tamer. This is a film that I believe the majority of Americans will enjoy because they'll find themselves realizing how realistic, and yet also far-fetched, the jokes are. Personally, I also loved the little digs targeted at Hollywood. In a subtler way the film bites at Hollywood in the same way that "Get Shorty" and "Adaptation" did.With Barry Levinson's career now being harmed by disasters such as "Envy," "Wag the Dog" is good proof that he still can direct a very solid comedy -- he just needs to learn to turn down certain scripts in favor of better ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eleven Stars - Wag the Dog is a Modern Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock once said, "The audience is like a giant organ that you and I are playing. At one moment we play this note on them and get this reaction, and then we play that chord and they react that way. And someday we won't even have to make a movie---there'll be electrodes implanted in their brains, and we'll just press different buttons and they'll go 'ooooh' and 'aaaah'' and we'll frighten them, and make them laugh. Won't that be wonderful?" This movie, Wag the Dog, asks: "Is that...wonderful?"Beyond this motion picture, Wag the Dog has entered the national dialectic as a concept; some pundits have alluded to this movie Wag the Dog as being eerily prescient about U.S. domestic and foreign policy issues in the last half of the twentieth century. Wag the Dog depicts how media, governments, advertising, and political figures manipulate emotions to garner public support or make money.Regardless of the extent to which you, the viewer, think that a "Wag the Dog" scenario could occur, this movie encourages critical thinking and reflection about propaganda and the manipulation of emotion during times of war, the manufacturing of media, and yellow journalism.Robert Evans' "The Kid Stays in the Picture" docudrama (Evans was the model for Dustin Hoffman's Hollywood producer, Stanley Motss) led me to the movie "Wag the Dog" and both movies complement each other well.Too bad Motts wasn't given the line "Nothing beats good writing. Nothing." And writers often receive little more credit than producers (and are probably paid a whole lot less). So here's a thanks for the great writing, screenwriters. And thanks to the editors, director, and producers, too. : &gt; Eleven stars.The DVD version recommends other politically satirical movies and has other fun bonus features.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a super-cynical film that is incredibly entertaining, insightful and oh, so jaded! The problem is that although it's got a brilliant script, the film will only appeal to a small select audience. Die-hard Clinton lovers will NOT appreciate the film as it's a thinly veiled criticism of the Clinton presidency--particularly since the film is about some completely amoral spin-doctors doing ANYTHING to save the butt of an amoral politician. Clinton lovers probably can't admit the truth of this aspect of his personality. Die-hard Clinton haters will no doubt love the film. Frankly, I'm rather Libertarian in view and think the nonsense in this film could apply to ANY politician, so those jaded viewers (like myself) will probably appreciate the edgy and dark humor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off let me say: this is dark, black, black humor in this movie. But its very, very funny, I'll give it that. And its fun while its running, mostly due to Dustin Hoffman's performance.Its a performance dripping with irony and laced with bitterness to its core, and yet its somehow till fun to watch, not to mention hilarious. The De Niro/Hoffman pairing is definitely somewhat thankless for De Niro, but, surprisingly, he's a solid straight man.Wag the Dog is an extremely amusing movie. It suffers when Hoffman is off screen, and sometimes the plot holes gape. None the less, its thought provoking to say the least, and wickedly entertaining. On the other hand, I can't remember the last time I came out of a movie feeling worse. So go figure.</fullReview>

After working for Hitler , he was taken under the wing of the Pentagon to help them sell everything like Korea , Vietnam , Yugoslavia , Iraq I , etc . In real life , he was The Producer .Don' believe the lies that the TV is selling you ! Do your own research ! This is the TV they want you to believe is impartial : NBC (National Broadcasting Company) is owned by General Electric, ABC (American Broadcasting Company) is owned by Disney, CBS (Columbia Broadcasting System), is owned by Viacom, and CNN (Cable News Network) is owned by AOL (America Online) Time Warner.There is no free press . If you are against them they shut your whole life down . You can't go and say these for real and these facts must be disguised in movies otherwise any actor/producer/director might end up like Charlie Sheen .P.S.

		<fullReview>By that I mean, in real life, were the president to try to spin favorable poll numbers by creating a phony war in the media, the CIA would be in the loop. Indeed, the CIA would be the loop.That's the fascinating premise of this decade-old, Clinton-era satire of what the rich and powerful friends of the president can do these days if the president gets in trouble. In the movie the Clinton-like POTUS (President of the United States) is accused of enticing an underage "Firefly Girl" (a Girl Scout analog) into a room in the White House and taking unspecified liberties there.The president is up for reelection within two weeks and the media is already beginning to home in on the indiscretion. His opponent has ads playing Maurice Chevalier's "Thank Heaven for Little Girls." His handlers know he's in deep trouble and they need to generate a smokescreen to deflect all the attention from the voters. ...Isn't this lack of modern news organizations' respect for the facts reminiscent of Saddam Hussein and nuclear weapons... or the rather incredible concoction of 19 hijackers flying planes into buildings under direction of a cave-dwelling 45-year-old CIA operative hooked up to a kidney machine?

		<fullReview>Yes the dog needs to be wagged severely by the tail. If politics is nothing but a branch of show business, it is nothing but tall tales and scary stories. In this film they fantasize the re-election of a President based on a Hollywood secret production of a story that sounds truer than reality. The President is going to be accused of some sexual misconduct ? read my lips ? twelve days before election day, so his advisers invent a war in Albania which is deflated by the CIA who do not like, for once, what is not true. Then they go on with the invention of a US prisoner of war left behind and finally freed and brought home, a Rip van Winkle of modern times. Poor Schumann. A rape-offender who is severely psychotic and who tries to rape the first woman he sees through a diner's window in the middle of nowhere. He ends up killed by the husband of the woman and he is brought back home, directly to Arlington. Superb. Unluckily the producer turns psychotic in his turn and wants the credit for the super production that re-elected the President. So he dies of a massive heart attack on his way to Hollywood, picked by some CIA agents, or is it FBI, and does it have any importance at all? They could have really done the same thing with the war on Iraq. It could and would have been a lot more palatable than it is right now. The film is greatly done though it has little depth and as a comic taste and bitter after taste. Of course it is all a story and it has no truth whatsoever, does it not?

In this case the US go to war with Albania, which is all staged in a studio.The acting performances by Robert deNiro and Dustin Hoffman were brilliant and really keep you tuned in.

		<fullReview>Perhaps more than anything else, this film illustrates how technology and spin can change the world...if only for one day. The disheveled Robert De Niro as Connie Brean is the king of spin, with a supporting cast of a Hollywood producer (Hoffman), and in perhaps her best role, Anne Heche as Winifred Ames.2 weeks before the presidential election, the president becomes embroiled in a sex scandal, and Brean is brought on to distract the public for as long as he can. With only two weeks to go, it seems a daunting task.War is as American as apple pie, and war is show business. Connie must distract the nation using props and the illusion of war to steer public opinion away from the president and toward his phony war. With an array of co-stars, from Dennis Leary to Willie Nelson, the film moves from a comedy to borderline psychosis, and all of it seems reasonable. Which probably is both hysterical and terrifying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure anymore, as time goes by, if we actually landed man on the moon. Films like "Capricorn One" question that viably, but are foreseen as entertainments. I think a film like "Wag the Dog" might seem quite ludicrous to the average person, but who's to say that the right producer and strategist couldn't fake a war and get their President reelected? In Barry Levinson's marvelous(working form a sharp script from David Mamet)political satire, "Wag the Dog" the United States President has been caught in a sexual act with a youngish girl(a Firefly girl)and needs help from someone fast for if this flaw in his humanity lingers in the press and media, his slipping in the polls will become catastrophic to his campaign for reelection. Enter "Mr. Fix-It", Robert DeNiro who has the uncanny ability to get people(political and governmental)out of messes who, with presidential aide Anne Heche, coerces through smooth manipulation Hollywood Producer extraordiaire Dustin Hoffman to fake a war with Albania to bring America's eyes away from the controversial sexual act by the President.The film follows their tasks to do just this as they face lots of unforeseen crisis along the way such as their President's maneuvers to keep them from completing their mission due to the CIA probing, their having to develop a war hero(played by Woody Harrelson, great in his small roll)who is actually a convict, their working over certain individuals to get things done, and most importantly somehow smoothing out rough edges when it comes to faking a war with a country who has nothing to do with the US and keeping certain untruths secret.The film has a dynamite performance from Hoffman as a producer who can work magic with ease when it comes to keeping the spirit of an idea alive. Often, when they are faced with certain ordeals, Hoffman is able to concoct amazing scenarios out of the blue. I thought some of the early developments in creating a war torn Albania was hilarious such as finding a certain cat to be held in "refugee" Kirsten Dunst's hands and how Willie Nelson has to come up with that "just right" Albania song(though, the funny part was his bewilderment about Jim Belushi's being Albanian). The way the war hero Shumann is created is stunning to see develop and just shows how really terrific this screenplay is.Seeing the media tackled with a horse-collar through movie magic is really a hoot and I love this movie's way of showing people all over the place putting together an elaborate ruse to fool the American people just to reelect a man who was caught with his hands in the girl-scout cookie jar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A truly satiric movie about what goes on behind the scenes in American politics. After a resent sex scandal the President is loosing support. A movie producer is set to produce a television-war with Albania to cover up the scandal and gain the President popularity for the upcoming election.I just loved this movie and I think most people will. The story is seems simply wild and far-fetched, but when you think about it, how can you be sure this isn't the reality. It shows the power of the media and how you can use that power if you know the tricks of the trade. It may make you think twice about what you hear in the future. Now, these are all serious subjects, but this movie seems far from serious. The well written dialog delivered perfectly by the actors is just hilarious! De Niro does a great job as Conrad Brean, the most serious character. Hoffman and Willie Nelson delivers great and really funny performances as the producer and the songwriter. The rest of the cast is nothing less then good.The score is really nice. Knopfler gives the right cowboy feel to it and make is all seem so over the top American and the additional song are great clichés that fits like a glove.The cinematography does not have your average movie look to it. It looks more like a news footage with some shock zooming and hand held camera, yet it's just in some situations so it's not in any way annoying. It just reminds you, subconsciously, of news feed or something and it makes all this about them influencing people through the media even stronger. The cinematography is all in all good. There are some really nice shots and as for the rest it's nice.Wag the dog is a funny movie with a good and satiric story I think everyone can enjoy. I even think politicians can see the humor in it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An interesting satire on the media and the ultimate government control of it, the film has some things to say about the general public's conviction that news is unbiased truth, as well as how far political figures will go to maintain power. The film is in the end all a bit too silly and outrageous to work smoothly as a thought-provoking satire, but some of the concepts along the way are fascinating enough to make the film worth a look. The President is shown in a comical manner as a puppet figure with no power to decide anything other than the colour of the kitten, and we only ever see him from behind, or see others talking to him on the phone, showing just how unimportant he is. Such a notion does however leave the film a bit empty, as we have no idea who is ultimately in control of everything and what those in control want. This makes it difficult to connect with the empty-headed motivations of the characters. The film tries to compensate for the resulting void with some character study, but it does not really succeed, because the media/political commentary is much more intriguing than the characters are, as the characters are mainly stereotypes. It is also a bit too talkative, but even if not perfect, the film has a lot of good points. It is generally well acted, well written and full of good ideas. It becomes tiresome towards the end with its drawbacks, but there is still a lot in it to like, and it provides quite a bit to think about.</fullReview>

About 1 year after this movie came out, William Jefferson Clinton, on the eve of his impeachment hearing, ordered an attack on Iraq.Several writers, referenced the movie....with comments about "life imitating art." The truth was, Clinton did not have the votes to postpone impeachment. And the decision to attack Iraq was born on air force 1, as a means of buying some time. Heres an excerpt from one article.....actually using the title...."Title: President Clinton Attacks Iraq on eve of impeachment vote---Another 'Wag the dog' scenario to discourage American about their current system of government. Subtitle: Just as the script calls for an embattled President to go to "war" to save his presidency, Clinton orders a "massive" attack on Iraq just hours before the House of Representatives was scheduled to begin debate on the Impeachment. The objective is to so discourage Americans about our government we will accept a new one." This movie is brilliantly written, well acted and just plain fun to watch. Its a 10. Trust me.Doc</fullReview>

I remember that it was to deal with something political (duh, the movie) like about a lost soldier or something. Regardless, in my neighborhood there are shoes thrown up in the air and every time I see them it aggravates me something awful.Wow, I can't believe I need 10 lines of text to post this!

		<fullReview>i loved those scenes where they improvise. different people sitting in one room and creating a story. and the fact that they are doing it for the reality and not for some movie, is the best part about it. i mean just imagine THAT is the reality! Dustin Hoffman and Robert deniro built a wonderful team in this movie, especially Hoffman was just brilliant. the way he played that producer who seeks nothing more than recognition for his work was just a joy to watch. coming to the story, i've hardly ever seen something original like this before. and all this just because of Clinton. i think at last Clinton was a fabulous president. i mean he did his work in an excellent manner, and what he didn't do so excellent was his private life, but if i was an American, i just wouldn't care. but unfortunately so many Americans didn't think that way and blasted it into a big scandal. well, anyway, in that way we got this great movie.i thank everyone who worked on this movie for this fine cinema.raycasp.s.: why is it only rated 7??? you should be kidding...</fullReview>

Another lame "satire." Not even remotely believable; it scans like Mamet's speed-dream of what the White House is actually like. God, he sucks. And so does De Niro, whose name is fast becoming videoese for "don't rent this movie."Looks like it was filmed in about 3 days and the director was too lazy to do any editing, just threw the whole mess on the screen and figured the actor's names would sell the movie. If you're really into watching big stars putting in sloppy performances in what feels like a pet project gone to seed, this is the movie for you. If you want a show about White House politics that doesn't blow, go watch the West Wing. It makes Mamet's soggy dialog look like the bad joke that it is, the inane ramblings of a past-it playwright.Awful.RstJ</fullReview>

A good satire must have at least a marginal thread of credibility, but at every turn, this stupid movie is 8 billion light years from the magical formula of plausible satire with subtle exaggeration. Its totally conceited and jerky. It positively stunk to high heaven. Not one person in America, not even a illiterate rube living in a cabin with no electricity would ever fall for the hoax upon which this entire movie is founded. America flagellating itself as entertainment. No, thank you. I am positively astounded that the country loved this film as much as it did. And I rented it with positive expectations. I was expecting it to be good. Instead I got positively repulsed. To compare Clinton's attack on Iraq on the eve of his impeachment to the ridiculous premise of this movie is convoluted sophistry. A dreadful movie. A positive groaner from beginning to end. And Woody Harrelson's character was as badly conceived and acted as anything that has ever left the Hollywood lots.

		<fullReview>"Wag the Dog" starts out limping and finishes lame. Apparently written as farce, but directed as satire, it left me cold. I rented it to watch with friends, and so had to suffer their dirty looks and muttering for the duration.As a farce it fails because of its direction. Too straight and too slow. The viewer is given way too much time to see the stupidity of the situations which develop. It it was condensed into an hour with a dash of comic violence thrown in, it may have been fun.As a satire it also falls short, ultimately because there is nothing believable about it. The story lacks subtlety, and I got a real sense that the occasional unfinished sentence (ala Mamet I presume) was not for realism, but because there really was nothing interesting to say. The theme of a manipulative media is hardly new. Just go watch 'Network' or 'Broadcast News' again; they both go much deeper and you'll learn and laugh a lot more. The treatment of the media campaign in "Wag the Dog" is over simplified, telling even the most naive viewer what they already know.If you want good political satire, rent "Primary Colours". If you want self-referential Hollywood satire see "The Player" or "Get Shorty". Perhaps "Wag the Dog" is actually a farcical parody of the media's ham-fisted attempt to satirize itself. Whatever it is, I don't get it.</fullReview>

After reading reviews that were extremely high and hearing people recommend the movie, I definitely wanted to check this out.Don't get me wrong, I love comedies, and I thought that a political spoof would work beautifully. Unfortunately, it didn't. After watching nearly half an hour, I thought, "why isn't this film being funny?" I clearly don't understand why it was categorized as a comedy. It seemed like a bunch of chitter-chatter that went too fast for anyone to comprehend it.It's weird; I learned more about the plot from reviews than the actual movie. As a totally incomprehensible mess, this movie would only appeal to those with incredible brain capacity or to those who want to give themselves a comprehension test. The ending too, left me scratching my head in disbelief. Overall, this movie is disappointing. It didn't come close to being funny, and the extremely fast talking clouded up the plot. The acting was ok, but that's about it. Should you want to see this film, be sure to turn your brain up to full power. But who knows, you may get bored at any given moment. MY RATING: *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to concur with the many here who were disappointed. There were a few good scenes here and there, but they were WAY too few and far between. Maybe the whole premise kept some other people going, and maybe its like some people said, where it is not "Laugh out loud funny", but it washardly even for me "whimsically" funny. The other thing is in any movie you have to either (A) care about at least 1 character or (B) really hate a character. I didn't have either in this film. I didn't care about the three major players, (Deniro, Hoffman, Hache), any joy from the film came from the side characters (Willie Nelson &amp; Woody Harrelson, but even they were not very inspiring). It was kind of like a documentary almost, except that it was fiction, so it lost that are of it as well .I was really trying to enjoy it, but it just didn't work for me.For my money, "Primary Colors" was the much better political film of 1998.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One-joke Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a political satire. Done right, these can be hilarious, but "Wag the Dog" is not done right. Granted, this might have been made as a response to the Clinton sex scandal, but if it was done better, it could have been a stinging comment on the Bush Administration (or any corrupt government entity) as well. However, "Wag the Dog" doesn't take any risks and all the potshots that it takes are broad and tired.Twelve days before the election, The President is caught in a huge scandal. To find a way out and still keep the Presidency, he asks Conrad Brean (Robert DeNiro) for help. Brean decides that the best way to get past this is to distract the public with a phony war with Albania. To accomplish this, he hires big-time Hollywood producer Stanley Motss (Dustin Hoffman) to pull it off.The problem with this movie is that it's a one-joke movie, and it's really not that funny. The joke is that politicians are full of crap, and the public is too stupid and easily distracted to pay attention to anything that's not in the front page headlines. I won't necessarily disagree with either of those comments, but both have been done to death, and the way Barry Levinson chooses to meld the two isn't very interesting, and certainly not funny.Hoffman and DeNiro are two of the most celebrated actors around, but this movie just isn't a good use of their talents. They play their parts well, but it's all for naught. Anne Heche is good as their political liaison, but again, the movie is below her talent level. Woody Harrelson is amusing in his small role, but little else.The film isn't a total waste; there are a few amusing bits here and there, but certainly not worth a recommendation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've come across any of my other reviews of Barry Levinson movies, you'll know that I'm not a fan. So it probably won't come as a surprise to you that I didn't think much of "Wag the Dog." A good cast -- Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman and Anne Heche are the three principals -- is assembled for a vague and unfocused satire on American politics and movie making. Hoffman received his 7th Academy Award nomination for playing an eccentric Hollywood producer -- by most accounts a parody of Robert Evans -- but it feels like an inside joke that the vast majority of the movie-going audience isn't going to get. The movie's not funny enough to be successful as a laugh vehicle, not sharp enough to be effective as satire and not compelling enough to work in any other way.Grade: C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happened to the Third Act?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Log line: "A Hollywood Producer. A Washington spin-doctor. When they get together, they can make you believe anything." Produced and directed by Barry Levinson and written by Hilary Henkin and David Mamet, this film is best known for its timing. By a stroke of luck (for the producers and distributors) its release coincided with the outbreak of hostilities against Saddam, following hot on the heels of the revelation of President Clinton's involvement with Monica Lewinsky. Spooky. The blurb on the video box reads as follows: "When the President of the United States is caught in a scandal just two weeks before the election, it's up to his White House adviser Ronnie Brean (Robert De Niro) to clean up the mess. Ronnie joins forces with Hollywood producer Stan Moss (Dustin Hoffman) to divert the country's attention from the President's crime. They decide that what is needed to stop the media spotlight is a war, but lacking a real war, they fake one. Actresses play pretty refugees and rock stars record stirring hit songs about freedom. Soon America is rallying round the President. But trouble arrives when and rough and tough Senator gets wise to the pair's tricks. Meanwhile, Election Day gets closer and closer?" Very odd. It's a perfectly reasonable summary until the penultimate sentence. Having just watched the film I can say without fear of contradiction that there is no "rough and tough Senator" who discovers what's going on. Was this an alternative plot-line that was abandoned? This wouldn't surprise me because the last Act is rather weak. The CIA wrecks the war story by announcing an end to the imaginary hostilities but Hoffman and De Niro, undeterred, come up with a soldier trapped behind enemy lines. It's from this point on that the drama flags. "Schuman", the imaginary soldier, turns out to be a psychotic military prisoner. The plane, supposedly carrying him home, crashes (a very odd sequence because one minute they're flying through a storm and the next our stars are standing, apparently unharmed in the middle of the wreckage ? I don't think so!) and then Schuman tries to attack a girl at the farm on which they end up. The farmer shoots him and the plan has to change again ? he'll be brought home in a coffin with full military honours. Then, in the end sequence, Hoffman decides that it's all been so successful that he has to have a credit. As far as he's concerned, this is the greatest thing he's ever produced and he wants everyone to know that he did it ? as he points out, there's no Academy Award for producing. He's insistent and, as he leaves, we see De Niro indicating to the security men. The next thing we see is the TV announcement that Hoffman has died from a heart attack "at the age of 58 or 62, depending on the buyout". Nice gag, but it's not really a satisfying payoff. I suspect that the real problem is that lack of a Third Act. The end of Act Two should really have been the discovery of the truth by that "rough and tough Senator", with Act Three posing the really big problem of how they get out of that mess. As structured here, each complication is only ever an Act Two build-up ? the problems change but they don't really advance the plot. It's like the same joke told in different ways. It would be interesting to find out what happened to that elusive Senator. An afterthought: this makes an interesting comparison with "Primary Colours" which, although less overtly funny and farcical, did at least try to make some kind of intellectual engagement with its subject. Never at any point in "Wag the Dog" is the subject of lying in politics for "the greater good" ever brought into focus. On the video box the Times in London is quoted as calling the film "a treat, bright and intelligent". But surely it's not. I've reached the conclusion that film critics only refer to the intelligence of a film in a direct and inverse proportion to their own knowledge and understanding of the subject. In other words, the Times critic knows nothing about White House politics so, to him, obviously, it appears intelligent. Or am I just being cynical?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid Pet Tricks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may have been a clever idea, but Wag the Dog is not a clever movie, no matter what its creators think. Instead it's tedious and insulting. Would that it were not so.Robert DeNiro as a political fixer, Dustin Hoffman as a Hollywood producer and Anne Heche as a ninnyish White House aide create a hoax war to distract the nation from a presidential sex scandal in the run-up to Election Day.Despite some snappy dialogue here and there, the movie fails because it it can't decide if it's a political slapstick like Woody Allen's Bananas, or a chilling indictment of political system gone wrong, like The Candidate or Bob Roberts (a vastly better movie).The cast take a variety of approaches to this problem. DeNiro plays confident but never chooses a route, Hoffman goes slapstick and saves his own skin. So does Woody Harrelson, who wisely plays his role as a dangerous convict as if he's in Police Academy XIV. Heche appears confused, directionless and not up to the task.It looks as if Barry Levinson wanted to use big names and slapstick to lure in the masses, so they would see how they are being manipulated -- to expose political fraud for the benefit of the presumably benighted, while satirizing it for the amusement of the presumably clever. No wonder it's a guaranteed box office flop: the public doesn't want to be told how idiotic and gullible it is -- especially when the perpetrators of the elaborate hoax are shown as such incompetents. If Hollywood can't make a convincing movie about a fake war, how are we supposed to believe it could make a convincing fake war?The reality is that the people running the real show in the US are sometimes scarily competent, and they have more resources at their disposal than are shown in this movie. As DeNiro's character points out, the US invaded Grenada less than 24 hours after the disastrous truck-bombing in Lebanon which more than 200 US Marines were killed.They don't throw phony wars -- it's easier to throw real ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wag the Dog, a film by Barry Levinson (Bandits, Rain Man &amp; Good Morning Vietnam), has an original concept however fails to deliver the poignant and dynamic effect it should create on the viewer.When the President of the United States becomes involved in a sex scandal just a week before the election, a 'spin doctor' (Robert De Niro) is called in to fix the problem. He sees that the only way to divert the publics and more importantly the media's attention away from the President's scandal is to create a fake war. However creating an artificial war isn't an easy task, so De Niro's character, Conrad Brean, goes about finding a famous Hollywood movie producer, Stanley Motss (Dustin Hoffman). Hoffman and De Niro are both brilliant as usual, however as the film unfolds the tail becomes more and more unrealistic while the script fails to captivate the viewer and produce the strongly compelling effect which the plot should create. All in all Wag the Dog is an original, quirky, well acted and slightly funny film however is nothing brilliant. 6/10</fullReview>

Studio footage will be inserted into the news to create the illusion of a war so the public's attention is diverted from the scandal.And that's it, that's the whole movie except for the execution of the plan (which isn't anything spectacular). The movie peaks way too early and they flog this simple idea for the last hour or so. And "peak" is a generous term because the comedy level never rises very high. De Niro isn't funny - he doesn't understand the timing of comedy. Hoffman is good but he can't carry the film because his character is one-dimensional.The whole thing is just plain dull. Skip this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good idea, badly executed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amidst the accusations of President Clinton's sexual improprieties with intern Monica Lewinsky and others, I cautiously hoped that the media frenzy and eerie parallels between the professional spin doctoring in this film and current headlines wouldn't jade my review. I can now rest assured. This film is mediocre no matter when you watch it. Strip away the hype surrounding this exercise in hype generation and you have basic, unchallenging fare. And it's a shame because Barry Levinson has so much to work with. He even announces, through Robert DeNiro's character, his sources early in the movie: Reagan's attack of Grenada, the secrecy surrounding the Gulf War, the symbolism without substance surrounding the images of Iwo Jima, Vietnam and Latin America. With heightened technology, our world is more abstract. We have very little tactile connection with global events amid the talk of a smaller world. However, this abstraction is hardly new. Theater has always presented the foreign in a tactile, believable, but frequently misleading way. Before television and even mass printing methods, many people were insulated to their own villages, ripe to believe that the world was flat, Jews had horns, and "everyone else" were barbaric buffoons. Our myths are essential in shaping our world and ourselves.With such an intimate issue, how could Barry Levinson go wrong? Perhaps his producer Robert Evans mirrored the Dustin Hoffman creation in his weaselly persona exuding a detached nonchalance while demanding ultimate control. Either too many cooks were watering down the broth or an inexperienced chef was given the ladle. Hoffman, DeNiro and crew are trying to pull off the perfect crime, treating the rest of us as accessories. "The President" needs a popularity boost in time for re -election day after allegations surface regarding his private shenanigans with an underage "Firefly Girl." Needing to respond quickly, the president's closest advisors (Anne Heche, Andrea Martin and others) employ the services of strategist Conrad Brean (DeNiro), who calls on a higher power in Hollywood producer and general superman Stanley Motss (Hoffman). They concoct and film scenes from a fictitious war in Albania, and push America's collective buttons by evoking patriotism, resolve, bravery and all things presidential. To bolster the "war effort," their friend Johnny Green (Willie Nelson) writes and records a generically patriotic war anthem and convicted felon Willie Schumann (Woody Harrelson) is recruited to pose as the P.O.W. left behind. A faceless populace provides massive support for the war effort and for Schumann's rescue mission. The joke here is that Hollywood is ultimately controlling America. That's why politicians frequently exhort filmmakers to clean up their act for the children's sake. Less than half of eligible American citizens vote in the presidential race, but nearly everyone goes to the movies. Movies dominate our culture and shape public discourse. Problem is, the joke's inaccurate and not even that funny. Democracy still reigns, as diluted and imperfect as it is. If you don't get enough popular support or make enough money, you can't attain gain acceptance in Washington or Hollywood, respectively. Americans may be gullible and occasionally downright stupid, but we always question authority. Levinson apparently believes that no one would bring up conspiracy theories (in this scenario, the conspiracy buffs would be drooling), no one would contact anyone in Albania or Canada to verify facts, no one would leak any information, no reporter would probe deeper for the full story and no one would grow impatient with this spin team's stalling. America may be led by producers and spin doctors, but it's not controlled by them.If this film is truly a mirror-image of society, the apocalypse is closer than we think. If this is meant to be an artistic representation of society, it falls short. Either way, it's a dubious footnote to America's political history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Mamet is a master writer, and his script (co-written with Hilary Henkin) for Wag The Dog is a great one, filled with the rapid fire dialogue that anyone familiar with his work would expect. Where the film goes wrong, I think, is in Barry Levinson's tone, who opts for a light and comedic approach to the potentially biting satire of the story.The plot revolves around a spin-doctor and Hollywood producer who team up to fake a war in order to distract the nation and get the President re-elected. This is a topic that is ripe for sharp social and political commentary and the script goes in that direction plenty of times, but I feel like the tone of the picture takes things far too easy on the potentially brilliant themes of it all. They go for comedy so often and I didn't even consider laughing once during the film, but instead was just hoping that there would be more dramatic scenes.With actors like Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro in the lead roles, the opportunity was right in their palms to make something edgy, intelligent and razor-sharp, but they just...didn't go for it. What came out was a lackluster comedy with no laughs. Hoffman adds more weight to his character than the rest of the film has going for it, imbuing his producer with a vanity and remorseful quality that is interesting to watch, but he only gets the opportunity to really do anything with it once (and it's easily the finest scene in the film).De Niro is someone I've never been a fan of, but I didn't mind him much here, mostly thanks to his chemistry with Hoffman. The two work well together and Mamet's script has the opportunity to sizzle, if only a stronger director had gotten the reins of it. I can only imagine what the film could have been if Mamet himself had sat behind the camera.</fullReview>

I was expecting satire but not silly slapstick. They could have done so much with this movie and this cast. A lot of time was spent drilling down on minute aspects of the "scheme" and I felt they were flogging a point endlessly. For example, the producer wanted a kitten in a scene and several minutes was spent on him complaining until he got the kitten he was looking for. The movie develops very slowly, almost painfully so. The conflict between the conspirators and the CIA was very artificial with a conclusion that made no sense. I am guessing the idea was to make all government agencies, as well as politicians, look foolish.The movie succeeded in doing so this but in the end, the whole story was pretty foolish and lacked anything that would maintain interest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The President is up for reelection and he gets caught in a sex scandal with a young girl. What to do? After a lot of talk among his staff, they rope in Hollywood people to create a completely phony war in Albania to distract public attention, using artificial media.Sounds hokey? Well, yes. The movie refers to Reagan's military invasion of the island nation of Grenada shortly after a terrorist bomb killed hundreds of US troops stationed in Beirut, the claim being that Reagan was trying to distract the public from the troops being killed. Never mind that the Grenada invasion was real, and certainly did not distract the news media from the Beirut bombing. Also, even in the days when the Internet wasn't widely used, there's no way a completely fictional military action would not have been exposed shortly afterward.But the movie does allow for that. They then use a convicted dangerous felon to play a soldier left behind in the supposed war, which would distract the public anew.If you can believe that a completely fictional military action would be widely reported in the major news media and somebody not quickly reveal the hoax for what it is, this movie might be for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wag the Dog isn't a well made film. Barry Levinson never went beyond his work with Rain Man and Good Morning, Vietnam--that's a given. Now he is stuck making half-films that fall apart quicker than they come together. The Natural was like that and so is Wag the Dog, except the Natural never clicked to start with.On the positive side, Mamet creates an articulate script that's enjoyable to hear and flows from the many actors with such precision. My only complaint with the writing is that once the movie gets going, it trips, falls, and careens into the end. Other than that, it is a nice satire with more than it's share of dumb moments and points of wisdom.Notice all the different efforts gone into making the phony war look real, this is exactly how reality TV works. Create the fake, drag in some X variables to silence any plot holes, and fill the gaps with loopholes so you can always fall back on them. Smart thinking, huh?Overall, I generally respect my 2-star ratings more than 3-stars (I don't know why). As a drama, 'Wag' doesn't work, as a comedy, 'Wag' sputters about. I'm sure the Coen brothers could've done better. A solid 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the second viewing this films weaknesses are openly exposed. The first time around it was fair, the second time, quite a bore. The main problem is in the characterisation of the leading players. They are Dustin Hoffman as "Stanley Motss", Robert De Niro as "Conrad Brean" and Anne Heche as "Winifred Ames". Fair enough, so far.In a kind of vague reference to the "Rainman" character, Dustin Hoffman takes neurosis to some reasonably and irritatingly high levels. I understood what they were going for here, but he just kind of took it to one place and left it there. Besides which, he wasn't greatly convincing; and his "spasm" at the end seemed to come out of nowhere... "Conrad" is potentially one of De Niro's most interesting post-nineteen-seventies characters. However, he drifted to and from the original portrayal so badly that I was confused as to what he was going for. I sensed some muddy direction for him. However, he did save this picture from being as dull as it might of been. Typically, he is convincing and a pleasure to study.And, Anne Heche as "Winifred Ames" was annoying-to-the-max. (I wondered after watching this is she ever has or does have a fan base. As easy as it might be to look up on site such as this, I still cannot be bothered to even check).Like some very good films, the story element is very simple. However, like most terrible films too, the story is very simple, and the narrative is mostly delivered through a million overheard phone calls. It makes it's point fairly early on, which is appreciated, but it just keeps running with that for the 97 mins. And yes, I DO believe that a government would do certain things to preserve it's authority. Thanks for enlightening me, Barry Levinson.</fullReview>

But apart from a stellar performance from DeNiro and a good one from Dustin Hoffman, nothing seemed to click. The supporting cast is more or less wasted and portions of the film are so over the top that the movie lurches from satire to farce and back again. I saw the ending from a mile away. The worst sin is that, for me. none of this was for one second credible. Although outsde events may have had something to do with my reaction, the principal problem was that the opponent isn't even near to being a threat to us on their best day! I buy the conspiracy theory, but I don't think even H. L.

I hope Kubrick hunts you down and punches you in the face).This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.As for plot, it is essentially the same thing as Canadian Bacon (2 years prior, imo infinitely times funnier and smarter than this). Which is not necessarily a bad thing if it weren't so haphazardly thrown together.The movie begins a bit in medias res, and awkwardly introduces you to the situation and this Albanian idea without a single laugh. Robert Di Nero (who I usually like) is clearly just playing a poorly developed caricature of himself; Dennis Hoffman (who I love) is occasionally good for a chuckle, but the whole "producer" persona and dialogue just gets old, boring, and unrelatable after the first scene; and then there's this 'who are you?' Anne Heche character who's only purpose in the story is to praise Di Nero's character for his brilliance (cause he's not actually brilliant! O trolololol that's hilarious....) Then these characters (who we could not care less about or relate to) go on a bunch of farcical adventures, which would usually be a dynamite recipe for comedy, but again, we just don't care about or even understand these characters and their motivations? Overall this movie might not be the worst satire ever, but it certainly is an awful movie ? proof that good actors and a good idea cannot make up for a hideous screen play.</fullReview>

His answer is to create a fake war with Albania.Lest you think this is the rarest of all Hollywood films - anti-Democrat, or even politically impartial story - no, it stays true to form by making disparaging remarks only about Conservatives (Reagan, Bush, Nixon, etc.). There is nothing said about Liberals/Democrats, of course.

		<fullReview>I saw this on video after finally giving credence to the barrage of hype and popular reviews.This film is an utter disappointment and I hope Mamet, Beinhart and Henkin are never allowed to contaminate celluloid again. Mamet's cardboard approach to character development was evident back in the unwatchable "The Untouchables".From talking to people who liked this at the time of its release, the thing that touched a nerve was the topicality and fortunate timeliness. Subtract that and you have a dreary satire-by-numbers.The Heche and Hoffman characters are ciphers and only De Niro engages the interest. Everything else is simple wallpaper. De Niro's dialogue is mildly interesting, but it's easy money to mine his past films and roles for meta-ironic lines, as "Rocky and Bullwinkle" and "Analyze This" (or even "Meet The Family") proved most recently. "Analyze This" was truly funny but in general after twenty years it's a well-tired device.(*Tiny spoiler*) To wit the point when Hoffmann is agonising over the choice of animal prop, and the the president interferes with creative input, and Hoffman mutters a curse about how typical this is. Gratuitously unsubtle, are-you-getting-our-point-yet posturing.A better straight satire is Eddie Murphy's "Distinguished Gentleman". I honestly can't recall seeing a decent two-dimensional political drama since "All The President's Men", which was when Hoffman must have been taking more professional pride in the scripts he accepted, and that was back in 1976.Frankly I would love to have seen the massively underused genius John Lithgow cast in the De Niro role. He does not get out enough in satirical mode these days. ("A Good Man in Africa", "Traveling Man")And substitute Frances McDormand or Sigourney Weaver for Heche. But Heche's dialogue was not her fault. And Keanu Reeves for Hoffman (it's a one-dimensional role, requiring the ability to say 'uhhh' and 'why?'). Or even Denis Leary. Or Jar-Jar Binks for that matter.Hyperironic and self-commenting do not necessarily equal clever or amusing. I fancy the Wachowski brothers could handle it with more levity.VERDICT: A terrible waste of a potentially clever concept which died on Mamet's too-clever typewriter.</fullReview>

Just evaluating the movie as a movie, it is too silly to be interesting as paranoid fantasy and too serious to be funny.

Kubrick masters black humor in this movie whereas Wag the Dog only circles inwards around the starting point.The story only gets duller as new elements unfold to make the movie longer and we never care about this stuff supposed to occur in the final days leading to a Presidential election.

		<fullReview>It's not that I necessarily disagree with the politics, it's more that Levinson's film is proof that satirical films should be left to people on the fringes of the film industry. Don't even get me started on Hoffman and DeNiro's performances. Hoffman especially radiates an unbecoming smugness only rivalled by the director's own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't be fooled, this movie is not nearly as clever as some would have you believe. Whilst the basic plot is interesting, especially in the light of events over the last 4-5 years, "Wag The Dog" just doesn't deliver anything you are likely to believe would actually happen. This lack of credibility makes this film fail as a satire.To make matters worse, the acting is at best irritating. De Niro plays that scruffy, self-satisfied character he plays when not cast as a gangster (tedious), and Hoffman hobbles about like a man recovering from recent bilateral hip replacements (whatever talent this guy had as an actor has long since deserted him).For me the ending couldn't come soon enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They could have titled this movie "Watch A Bunch of Jerks Talk on Cell Phones All Day" and it would have been just as effective. The pacing of this movie is all screwed up, like the characters' inane dialogue is more important than the structure of the movie. Could have been much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a boring movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie really sucks. In spite the good actors, I almost fell asleep while watching it (and I wasn't tired at all). This is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen! It sounds great when you read the plot, but the movie itself sucks. The idea is great but the movie isn't even close to that. So, if you're thinking about renting it, don't! Unless you're having sleeping problems...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>unless you want to see some good actors totally wasted on what seems like an interesting premise, but ends up entirely homogenized with a mediocre script.Seriously inane generalizations abound, and after the movie was over, I not only felt jipped, but I wanted the nearly 2 hours back of my life that I lost to this movie.Remember though, this is but one opinion, people waste countless hours doing worse stuff other than watching a bad movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has got to be one of the worst films I've ever paid to see. I almost fell asleep watching it - Do NOT watch this rubbish. No basic story line and ham acting throughout. I'm sure Mr. DeNiro and Mr. Hoffman would like to forget this one. One question : Why make such meaningless drivel when the performers have done so much better and Mr.Levinson again why ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has got to be one of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune to watch. It is so boring. The only time I had a smile on my face was when I placed it back in the DVD case. It was more interesting watching the time counter than this load of rubbish.If you thought Batman and Robin was bad you wait until you see this. You have been warned!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is an absolute DISGRACE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another one of those movies that people insist is clever and politically astute, and isn't. The number of big stars in the film doesn't make it any better, and quite frankly i'm ashamed of them for being in it - I say this as a tremendous Robert DeNiro fan. This is the type of film that only Hollywood elite's find clever. The types that think everyone between L.A. and New York are a bunch of rubes picking lice off one another.A brief outline of the plot. The president is caught in a sex scandal!!! - this film was released in 1997 mind you. One of his spin doctors(Robert DeNiro) seeks to save face. He enlists the help of a eccentric film director(Dustin Hoffman) to produce a fake war. They pick an obscure country that most Americans have probably never heard of, Albania. The presidents popularity surges, the phony war helps bury the scandal and gets him elected - before us rubes find out. I don't want to get political, well the film tries to so maybe I will.Let me start out with one of the tremendous flaws of this film. It views Clinton's air-strikes of Iraq as a cover for his sex scandal. I need to introduce a big problem with this and how overly concerned with political correctness Clinton was. He also could have ordered the C.I.A to take out osamba bin-laden, yet cowered to political pressure of the possibility of looking bad for attacking people. If he had the same types of people would have levied the same criticism on him, not realizing how important it would have been.If you want to say this is revisionist history fine hindsight is 20-20, but I hated this film when it was released. I felt it was insulting and inaccurate then for other reasons. News coverage over the past ten years is rampant. CNN reports on deployments of U.S. military everywhere when ever they move, wrongly in my opinion. The concept of a fake war that the American people will believe just because it's on TV is ridiculous. The only time the U.S. uses immediate force without debate, negotiations, U.N votes, Congressional votes, etc, is when it's doing so covertly. Think about the large anti-war build up and protests for the current, or second Iraq war. The makers of this film have to much faith in government and not enough in the common man. This very republic was founded on a revolutionary concept elective representation. I just have a little more faith in us lice picking the world is flat rubes.Aside from the political and back to the film. To its credit it has two fairly memorable performances Dustin Hoffman and Woody Harrelson. It's a highly watchable film with good dialog and bits of comedy scattered throughout, but you can see all the stars in much better films. I really think this film is vastly overrated I hope some people will look back and realize that it is. I like most of the actors and recommend them highly, in other films. If you're interested films that are politically astute and deal with real situations instead of pseudo ones, I recommend All The President's Men(a good Hoffman film), The Candidate(slightly dated but still better than this), or Hotel Rawanda(a great film).</fullReview>
