		<fullReview>First Blood is simply one of the best films ever made. I think it transcends the action film genre and has stood the test of time. Stallone was immensely popular back in the 80's and if it is true that he hated the first cut of the film, then one can only say that he is lucky that he didn't get his wish to scrap the entire thing.John Rambo is first introduced to us as he is walking into a small town to look for a friend of his that he served in Vietnam with. Upon discovering that he contracted cancer coming back from the war, Rambo wanders aimlessly into town. He is greeted by a small town overzealous sheriff named Will Teasle, played wonderfully by Brian Denehy. He at first tells Rambo that he will help him out and give him a ride. When Rambo asks if he can find a good place to eat, Teasle directs him to a diner about 10 miles up the highway. Rambo asks if there is a law against him eating in the town, Teasle, says yea, me. This sets up the premise as Rambo begins walking back into town. Arrested for vagrancy, Rambo is taken to the local jail and we meet some of the local redneck officers, notably, a young David Caruso, who seems to be the only one who empathizes with Rambo. Finally, he escapes the jail and takes the entire small town sheriff department and the military on a hunt into the local "jungle." First Blood has strength of character. It has frenetic action scenes and every actor in the film is at the top of their game. Samuel Trautman, Rambo's mentor and former Colonel in the war, is played by Richard Crenna as a no nonsense but empathetic man. He knows Rambo has pushed back a little too hard but he understands where his plight comes from. He wants to avoid more bloodshed but at the same time he doesn't completely agree with how Rambo has been treated. He is obviously a law abiding citizen, but he knows that not all the laws were upheld when dealing with Rambo.Sylvester Stallone is RAMBO. There is no one else that could play him. Just like Harrison Ford embodies Indiana Jones and Bruce Willis is John McClane, Stallone is about as good as he has ever been here. He is quiet, he is strong and his physicality creates a character that many of us can empathize with and eventually root for. David Morell wrote a different character in his book but Stallone paints him more as a sympathetic character. He is correct in doing so. While Morell's vision is still present, this is more of Stallone's creation. Rambo is about as unique a character present in film history.First Blood is a film released in 1982, but in my opinion it set a new standard for action film stars. I think James Bond was pretty much your standard action film star before that. He was smooth and debonair and nothing went wrong for him. Rambo, at least in First Blood, is realistic. He bleeds, he cries, and he wears his emotion on his sleeve. This is someone that many of us could and can relate to. The sequels made him larger than life and that is fine, but this small film done by the Carolco guys is about as perfect a film as you can get.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stallone is the most underestimated actor of his age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is certainly not the greatest film ever made. in fact, it's plot is predictable and formulaic, and every character is two-dimensional.having said that, this is a film that is often dismissed as a macho action flick with no redeeming feature. these are opinions i would defy.while the only imagination put into the film seems to be the various ways in which John Rambo can kill people, the basic theme is nevertheless a pretty strong one. this is not meant to be a Fellini-esque commentary on life, the universe, and everything.the three most important characters in the film are all played by pros. you have Stallone's John Rambo, Dennehy's Sheriff Teasle, and Richard Crenna's Colonal Trautman.Brian Dennehy hasn't missed a beat in his entire career; he's been a superb character actor since i've been watching movies, and - like Michael Caine - he always puts everything into each performance. his Sheriff Teasle is menacing, bigoted, and protective. he comes across like a man who's marked his territory and won't permit intrusions. i won't say he's brilliant, but he is absolutely believable as a small-town sheriff faced with a situation so far out of his own experience that he cannot figure out why he can't solve the problem.Crenna is a patriarchial character, such as he often seems to play. he gives the Spec Ops Colonal Trautman enough soul to make him seem human, and enough blood and guts to make him seem like a veteran soldier.of course, the centrepiece to the film is Sylvester Stallone. Stallone always suffers from the perception engendered by his appearance. he is a somewhat short fellow with a body of bulging unpronoucable muscles, and a sad bassett-hound face that looks like it was designed by someone out of "Oliver Twist."but the man can flat-out act. he gives John Rambo depth and reality. he comes across as far too fit and far too silent because Rambo is far too fit and far too silent. like his character in "Copland," Stallone is playing a guy who pretty much wants to be left alone and is caught up by a bunch of people around him who are overly enthused by their own status.while i can understand the dismissal of this film as just a patriotic action sop, i cannot also accept that Stallone does not give a good performance. the man has been characatured; he's an easy target. he's a really built short-guy. but Stallone's intelligence and creativity drove his first film, "Rocky," and neither quality has deserted him since. like Michael Caine, he does seem to take any old lame role offered to him. but he always gets paid, and he always puts everything into his performances.i'll never campaign for this film to be considered a "great" film, but i think i'll always defend it's star as a guy who works too hard too often to get the such little credit.i guess the best way i can put it is, i watched "First Blood," and i believed him. i believed Stallone.last time i checked, that is what an actor is supposed to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything about this is brilliant. From Goldsmith's rousing score to Stallone's perfect performance. Yes, you heard me. Stallone does act in this movie. I feel so sorry for Rambo. People are real nasty to him. Especially the deputy with the moustache. He was a real jerk. The scene in which Rambo finally explodes in the jail cell is way cool. The music that goes with this scene is SO intense. I highly recommend this movie and the soundtrack. This is a proper movie by the way. I know that the character of Rambo became a 'little' exaggerated and silly in the sequels but do not let that alter your opinion of this movie.The Pacific Northwest scenery is also very beautiful and atmospheric. The sound design seems to be crafted so that dialogue sound natural like it would in a mountain forest or in dead cold environments where the air cannot carry sound so well.See this movie in widescreen to appreciate how cool it really is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hell of a film.* * * * *</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The character of John Rambo became more popular in films such as "Rambo:First Blood,Part II" and "Rambo III".The character were treated like a comic book hero spawning action figures and a short lived animated series which lasted only a short while.There are not that many people who has heard of the Rambo character.He's well known through out,but today's generation would have been lucky to catch him on VHS or DVD.Back in 1982 when the character of John Rambo was introduced to movie screens,filmgoers were dealing with a character that was not displayed as an action icon,but a man who had a lot of demons within him.The best thing about "First Blood" is that John Rambo is not portrayed as an action hero.He is portrayed more as a man.A man who is haunted by memories of the Vietnam War.Sylvester Stallone plays the character of John Rambo very convincingly and Director Ted Kotcheff brings out the story to an effective scale allowing us to see the action through the character's eyes.Violence in films are the main aspects in film today.Or at least one of.It's fun to watch a violent film,but the violence in this film was not filmed to thrill the audience,but to make us understand what John Rambo is going through.I have these memories of first watching this film twenty years ago when I was twelve."First Blood" doesn't deal with CGI nor does it deal with special effects.It deals or tries to deal really hard on what is real.I like "First Blood" because I understand the character.He feels that society is against him and he is angry.A lot of films there is only one villain where as in this one society is the villain.That is according to Rambo.Actually,there is one villain named Sheriff Teasle played by Brian Dennehy.He and Rambo seemed to clash against each other and Ted Kotcheff let's us experience these two men go at it.I liked how the film shows Rambo trying to survive out in the woods while the guards are in hunting him when in turn he is hunting them creating these traps putting these officers in painful situations.The best thing about "First Blood" is that we know that John Rambo was in the Vietnam War and was trained to kill,yet,he doesn't kill a single human in the film on purpose.The killing of Galt was accidental and was deserving according to my eyes.This film is the best in the Rambo series because I understand the character and I understand why he is acting violent."First Blood" doesn't bring us John Rambo,the action hero but John Rambo,a regular man with a lot of demons he must face."First Blood" is the best of the Rambo series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The adaptation of this novel to the big screen is a great accomplishment. The film is not only the beginning of one of the greatest action trilogies of all-time, but it charts the developments of its characters, something rarely done by an action movie. "First Blood" is a moving story about the realities of post-Vietnam America and is very underrated as a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A taut exercise in suspense that bears little relation to its silly sequels...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surprise, a "Rambo" movie that tries to say something profound about the plight of its main character and his mental state. For the most part it succeeds. Not for this movie the ridiculously oiled pectorals of part II, where Rambo is transformed into a grunting, soul-less killing machine. He actually begins the movie as a fairly nice chap, someone we can sympathise with, and it's his unnecessarily rough treatment at the hands of small-town sheriff Dennehey and his crew that is likely to shift audience sympathies firmly in the direction of the 'misunderstood' Vietnam vet. Here, Rambo is also a character who is reluctant to kill unless he absolutely has to. A far cry from the eventual homicidal maniac he was to become, who is seemingly responsible for more death than World Wars 1 &amp; 2 combined. So, to those expecting bucketloads of gore and senseless killing, you'd probably be better off watching the news. "First Blood" is actually more akin to those 'survival in the wilderness' programs you might see on the Discovery Channel; with Rambo having to rely more on guile and cunning than brawn and an M-16 to get him out of tricky situations. That's not to imply that this is boring. Far from it. Director Kotcheff shows a keen awareness of pace, it's never by any means certain that Rambo will survive (if you discount the other films, of course!) and the supporting characters are all wonderfully unsympathetic. Even Trautmann, Rambo's supposed mentor, has a touch of the villain about him for being complicit in the ultimate dehumanisation of Rambo during the war. By far the best character here is played by Dennehey; always watchable, but Stallone too is good; nicely restrained, more "Cop Land" than "Cobra" Not an action film as such, it sits better as suspense. In that sense, it does exactly what it says on the tin; rendering John Rambo a far more interesting character here than his incarnation in the other two films. That is basically just wet-dream material for inadequate, spotty faced adolescent boys everywhere. This Rambo is recognisably human. Having said that, neither should you view expecting a solemn Vietnam protest movie in the vein of "Platoon" or "The Deer Hunter". It's different in tone and style to the both of those movies, but in my view at least, is better than either of them. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only good rambo movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How people can call this the worst one of the series or just a bad movie in general is beyond me. The action is actually believable and not something out of a video game. And the storyline is good and paints a good picture of life in America after the Vietnam war. Following the tale of the best of the best it is certainly not the best but very good. Better yet is the laughs that come from watching the bad cops get theirs. The only I have to complain about this movie is that the sequels were atrocious and painful. This is often looked over excellent movie that puts many other in the genre to shame. Many of you who find it boring are just gore junkies who thrive off of cheap explosions and a plethora of bullets in the air. Take it for a man trying to survive, not bringing down a whole army.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sylvester Stallone achieved amazing heights during the 80's, along with Arnold Schwarzenegger, especially as a movie character synonymous with the muscled guy who is a pure fighting machine?In Ted Kotcheff's "First Blood," John Rambo (Stallone) is a highly decorated Vietnam veteran who was trained specifically as a killing machine? He has come to a quite little town in Oregon, only to visit one of his platoon buddies? He was told that his friend has died, last summer, of cancer? Disheartened, Rambo continues to walk the streets of Hope when he is annoyed by the local Sheriff (Brian Dennehy), and booked for vagrancy and resisting arrest? Beaten, kicked all over, treated like trash, and pushed too far by the other cops in the Sheriff's office, Rambo is taking back to traumatic flashbacks, to the enduring torture in POW camp? Rambo, by that point, fights his way out and wages a one-man war against the police force that escalates out of control... Rambo is seen as a one man army overpowering all the sheriff's deputies and escaping into the surrounding woods? "First Blood" communicates the rage, the depression, the frustration and the psychological wounds of one Vietnam soldier that fought for his country and was then hassled by it upon his return? But what makes Rambo such a dangerous hero is Brian Dennehy being incredibly efficient as the cruel officer who doesn't like the looks of Stallone... Sure he's the abusive sheriff who is the victim of his environment, but he's also arrogant and incessantly underestimating a man who was 'the best, with guns, with knives, with his bare hands?'Dennehy got a presence of his own pushing an 'expert in guerrilla warfare' at the breaking point?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After almost a quarter of a century it's still a great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I totally agree with the comments of a previous reviewer who said that Sylvester Stallone is greatly underestimated as an actor. I wouldn't go as far as calling him the best actor that Hollywood has ever had, but he IS so much better than a lot of people say that he is. In my opinion Stallone shouldn't make comedies, but when it comes to action movies (Rambo, Rocky, Cobra, etc.) he's definitely one of the best! Rambo was a sensational movie in the 80's, but every time that I see it nowadays I'm amazed by the fact that it is actually a very good, original story. Brian Dennehy really shows his acting skills as well, leaving the audience confused whether to have sympathy for the character that he plays or to hate the character. First Blood is a movie filled with action. Like all the action movies from the 1980's "First Blood" also tends to become slightly over the top in the end. Still I gave it a 10/10 for the simple fact that I wanted to compensate for the people who "underrate" this movie. Normally I would give this movie an "8". If it had not been for the action scenes that are over the top this movie could even have scored a bit higher!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a truly unique movie that quickly became obscured due to the later sequels. It tells the story of a man who survived one hell, only to return home despised and forsaken because of it. There was a time when America didn't quite know what to think of the lost war, and so it was forgotten - and the men who came out of it as well. Rambo finds he cannot survive this war, because it is still going on within him.Finally, pushed too far by a small town sheriff, Rambo returns to the only thing he can relate to. War. Yet it is a war he almost mercifully wages on the macho egotistical deputies and week end warriors that pursue. To potentially misquote Rambo :"I coulda killed them all, I could have killed you. In town you're the law, out here it's me. Let it go..."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ultimate action film and the ultimate psychological thriller! 'First Blood' was among others like 'Die Hard' as being one of the first action films I saw when I was younger, I even owned it on VHS. This film has Sly showing off his acting ability (which is saying something for an actor with such little capability of "acting") as the iconic John Rambo in the film that sparked off the eponymous film franchise, whilst the sequels were heavily classified as flops, 'First Blood' is a daring and thrilling survival adventure that follows a Vietnam Vet and the post-war trauma he suffers from. A dark yet sensitive film that follows one of the great action stars as he fights to survive, a mesmerising action masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-written adaptation and film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure,"First Blood" is known by people who have not seen it as a "bang,bang,shoot 'em up" action film. Yet,don't let what others think of it trick you. As said by another reviewer,"First Blood" is a classic.Based off of the 1972 novel by David Morell,"First Blood" is about a former green beret of the Vietnam War,John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone). Despite the fact that John Rambo gave a strong service to America during the years that he fought in Vietnam,lately,Rambo finds his life falling apart. This is something that has personally torn John Rambo apart.And then,one day,things take a turn for the worse. This is when John Rambo is arrested by a sheriff in a small Alaska town(Hope),Will Teasle(Brian Dennehey)for vagrancy. Shortly thereafter,before John Rambo knows it,his patience and mental state are being put to a test. The result? John Rambo escaping from the police and launching a one-man war against them and the national guard. The only person who can help everyone get through it all? Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna),a close friend of John Rambo who served with Rambo in Vietnam.Let's talk about "First Blood" on the whole. Similar to 1988's "Die Hard" and 1993's "The Fugitive","First Blood" is one of the most well-written and adapted films (despite the several differences between the film and the novel). Not only is the action in "First Blood" perfect for any action film,it is quite suspenseful. It is not in the script just for the sake of being there. It is in the script because it needs to be there. The action in "First Blood" works well into the script,and is only to be found where it belongs.There is a lot of good drama and chemistry in "First Blood",as well. On top of everything that John Rambo has gone through in his life being richly executed drama that fits in well with the action in "First Blood",the scenes with the action are not just action scenes. They are scenes that contain action,drama,and chemistry. This is due to viewers of "First Blood" being able to watch John Rambo fight the Police and the National Guard with not only his weapons,but at the same time,his mind. The acting is in top shape,also. All of the actors in "First Blood" succeed in understanding their characters and bringing their characters to life with their performances. Especially Sylvester Stallone. Will Stallone ever have the presence and respect in Hollywood that actors like Paul Newman,Al Pacino,and Robert De Niro,plus several others,have earned and achieved? Surely and probably,no. But,in his performance as John Rambo,Stallone executes the drama that his performance requires. At the same time,Stallone does not fail to let the action in "First Blood" to be entertaining. He gives it the kind of action you would expect to see in any film that is reminiscent of "First Blood" ("Lethal Weapon","Die Hard",etc.). All of this is what helps "First Blood" fully come together,and make it the great film that it is.Overall,a must see-film for fans of not only action films,but for fans of crime drama films,as well.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that though aged, is still as relevant as ever... *Very minor spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My father served in the Vietnam war at the age of 21, much like John Rambo would have had he been real. In real life, my father endured a hell hole, a place he to this day, will rarely speak of without tears in his eyes, stories have been told to me about watching his friends die over there, of seeing atrocities done by both sides, a horrible horrific situation that no man woman or child should ever have seen.He spoke to me once, of returning to Australia, to a country he loved, called home. He spoke to me of feeling proud, in his uniform, having completed his tour, of stepping off the plane.And then he told me of the ridicule and scorn he received from the general public upon his return. A return where he was called a baby killer, despite never having actually killed anyone himself surprisingly, where it was simply assumed he was the one at fault, that the public would scorn him, forget he was human, treat him like a social outcast. Treat him, like an animal.Which is part of the reason he and I bonded so well over this movie when we first watched it. Sure, it's an agrandised tale of a badly treated Vet, a man forgotten by his government, much like my own father.When we see Stallone performing as Rambo in this movie, he's not fantastical, he's not superman, he's a man who's been wronged, who fights back the only way he knows how.When you see this movie, understand that this is, despite the fantastical elements in this film, a very accurate portrayal of how our veterans are treated. They're forgotten, they're given over to an ill equipped health system, be they in Australia or America, they're treated like outcasts.The beautiful thing about First Blood, when you watch it, is it's so easy to identify with Rambo, so easy to see he's just a good man, having a bad time, who reacts in possibly the worst way to whats happening to him... but that worst way, is the only appropriate way. The torture he endures under a biased prejudiced sheriff, the lack of respect for serving his country, the health system that should've picked up on his quite obvious PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder), none of it was there for him.When it hits the fan, and Rambo goes on his escape, ask yourself, is he really hunting them? If they had've let him go, wouldn't it have been better for them? Didn't he just want to be left alone after all? The one message this movie, less than subtly puts across, is something we all need to learn. Whether its WW1 or 2, Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm 1 or 2, you're not expected to agree with the war, you're not expected to support the war. But for gods sake support your troops. Next time your national day rolls around, like in Australia for Anzac Day, take the time to show a veteran, no matter if they're 25 or 95, show them they're appreciated, let them know they made a great sacrifice, that you respect what they did.Rambo succeeds on this level, especially Stallones final speech to Richard Crenna, which absolutely tears you apart, realising this man was plucked from obscurity, trained to be a god amongst normal men, then, when the machine of war was done with him, tossed out like a little spring from the machine, useless, unneeded and no longer wanted... where was he to go? What was he to do? It's a realistic situation that many, many veterans go through, google War Veteran Suicide rate sometime, it's an eye opening somewhat depressing look at the reality of the situation regarding our beloved Vets and the torturous return to mundane civilian life they have to go through...Don't respect the war, don't necessarily respect your government. But never, ever, disrespect the men and women who fight for your right to freedom. When you disrespect our soldiers, you disrespect everything our nations stand for. And that, is criminal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We're not hunting him, he's hunting us?First Blood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I'm going to see the fourth installment of a film franchise, I should at least check out the one that started it all. That fact brings me to finally seeing the 80's classic First Blood. It wears its decade on its sleeve with the acting, broad humor at times, and cheesy credit song "It's a Long Road." Despite all that, though, the movie lives up to the hype and fires on all cylinders. I had no clue that the story pitted one Green Beret against a hick town of bigot cops. When I thought Rambo and I had visions of one-man wars versus countries or platoons of soldiers, not civilians out with a vendetta. Rambo just wanted a friend in the world that saw him fight for his country with honor and return home to heckling and protest. All he did overseas was spit on by his return and he became a stereotype drifter, an untouchable to society. The truth of that comes out when a Sheriff in Oregon sees him crossing the street and escorts him out of town, refusing to allow him to even have one meal. He kept pushing and pushing, enough so that Rambo just couldn't take anymore.As far as the premise goes, this one is quite effective. Based off a novel, I can see where the story would be strong despite the subsequent sequels for which I hear are horrible. To have a man beaten, on the brink of giving up on life, find his way back to the horrors he has been trying his hardest to forget is a clichéd setup for sure, but it is all we need to set this thing in motion. With some nice quick cuts, we are shown the torture he endured in Vietnam juxtaposed with the handling by the local authorities on a trumped up vagrancy charge for looking unclean. They drew first blood and it is up to him to get himself out, with or without taking other people with him. Rambo understands that these people are civilians and decides to only incapacitate them rather than kill all in his wake. These are not the Viet Cong, they are like him, however, they know nothing about what he has gone through in order to allow them to sit back at home feeling free. If nothing else, this film is here to show people that no matter what your views on a war may be, no matter how much one thinks it is not our fight, if our troops are there, they deserve our full support. They are doing a job and a service that we are not willing to do ourselves as we sit and watch TV feeds, shaking our heads that it is all for nothing. If we give even one inch, they will take a mile, you can't lay down, ever. They fight for us and deserve to be treated as heroes.With all that said, can one really condone what John Rambo does in this film? No. Not even his old superior Colonel Trautman, brilliantly portrayed by Richard Creena, can accept what he is doing. He doesn't come in to set his boy free; he arrives to get him into custody so the fight will stop. The private war that has commenced needs to come with consequences. The punishment just needs to fit the crime. Rambo does nothing wrong except to hope for some shred of decency from humanity. That idealism is what causes all the trouble. Sheriff Teasle happens to be the straw that breaks the camel's back and all hell breaks loose. It is a matter of survival at first, but with the unrelenting pace, it soon turns into a search for justice by a warped mind doing the only job he knows how. I laughed when I heard the stats that the character kills just one person in this film. I mean how can Rambo, the ultimate badass, kill just one person? The laugh is on me, though, because I don't even count that one as his, it was the helicopter pilot's fault for jerking the aircraft. Rambo may destroy an entire town, but a cold-blooded murderer he is not?at least not until part two (with the great name of Rambo: First Blood II, a dual title that confuses the heck out of people on what the original truly was called).First Blood has become so entrenched in popular culture and the lexicon of cinema that even though I had never seen the film, I could swear I knew Creena's monologue about Rambo verbatim. I'm sure it was parodied multiple times and probably shown at sporting events or something, but I just knew the entire speech?pretty crazy since I had never seen it before. Besides his nice turn during and after that sequence, we get a powerhouse performance from Brian Dennehy as the sheriff. This guy is good and it is too bad he was never used to full potential in the industry. Sure he did a lot of films, but nothing that he stood out from the pack with. As for the star, Sylvester Stallone shows why he was pound for pound the best action star of the 80's. Between this series and Rocky, he was stellar. From the charisma and shy modesty with which he begins the film, searching for his friend, to the stoic killing machine on the warpath, to the broken man unable to believe what has happened to the world around him, Sly runs the gamut effectively and perfectly. By far one of the best action films I've seen, First Blood stands the test of time and delivers on the cult status it holds. Surprisingly, I am now really looking forward to Rambo (part four) and definitely checking it out in a couple of days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Criminally underrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people know the Rambo series as a ridiculous 80's action series. But what a lot of people tend to forget is that the first movie in this series was not a ridiculous action movie. It's a serious, dark, thriller that has a very somber tone and a sympathetic lead character. Almost everything that Rambo is known for nowadays is completely absent in this movie. From the multitude of explosions to the high body count to the unrealistic action to the ridiculous story line is completely absent. There are only 2 or 3 explosions (not to mention they are realistically done) and only one person dies throughout the whole picture. and the action, while there isn't a lot, it's realistic. Even the story line you believe can actually happen. It's for these reasons that make this my favorite Rambo movie. And not to mention the fantastic and heart breaking performance given by Stallone. Why the Academy didn't nominate him for Best Actor at the Oscars is beyond me. If you didn't like the other Rambo movies because of their ridiculousness and haven't seen this film, I highly recommend seeing it. It's one of my favorite post-war movies if not one of my favorite movies of all time.Final rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of people would likely classify this film as an "action movie." While there is certainly some great action sequences to be found here, it is really so much more than that. "First Blood" is something more than the typical shoot 'em up action epic, as it has the undertones of some very definite political themes and societal messages that most mere "action movies" never do.Aside from Rocky Balboa, John J. Rambo is without question the most iconic character in Sylvester Stallone's long career. And of the two, he is certainly the more emotionally complex. A man of deep loyalties and convictions, he is also easily able to shun aside the moralities of the supposed civilized world and, when provoked, become little more than a killing machine. It is this duality of a man who simply wants a quiet place for himself in the world, yet who is capable of committing some of the most outrageous acts of violence ever seen, that is what make the character so compelling.But it isn't simply Sly's performance as Rambo that gives the film such resonance. Equally adding the this potent dramatic brew are veteran actors Brian Dennehy and Richard Crenna. While Sly spends most of the film running through forests and slogging through tunnels, the interaction between Dennehy and Crenna's characters brilliantly encapsulate the clash of political views at the story's core.As noted the action scenes are very well done here. They almost make you believe that Rambo could single-handedly take down an entire town. They never go too far, or become too outlandish, with things. They keep it feeling just realistic enough to add the much needed tension for the inevitable showdown at the film's end. Adding to this is the stellar musical score by Jerry Goldsmith, which is just the perfect compliment to the story unfolding. It never distracts you from what's occurring on screen and, in fact, enhances the emotions of the situations even more. Just what any good score should do.What more can be said about this film, that hasn't already been said a thousand times before? The film would create a cultural icon that would embody the decade of the 80's, as well as inspire sequel films for over 20 years. But while those sequels would easily up the ante in terms of non-stop action, they would never attain the same level of emotional drama that this film does. "First Blood" was a film that asked a lot of hard questions about a war, and it's aftermath, that had no easy answers. And that, above all else, is what makes it more than merely "another 80's action movie." It makes it a classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Blood: Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a classic. A great action movie and a movie that really showed you what vietnam soldiers went through when they came back from the war. Stallone plays John Rambo perfectly and he is physically excellent for the role as well. He proves at the end alone that he can act and show emotion with the best of them. The first time i saw this i was very emotional at the end because Stallone really gives you a taste of what the soldiers had to go through when they got home. The action is classic, The acting is classic...RAMBO is Classic. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First Blood is that rare film that is not black and white instead it deals with areas of Gray. Stallone's Acting is Very Good maybe the Finest he's ever done outside of F.I.S.T. And Yet while his Rambo is a compelling portrait of a man slowly going insane trying to find something resembling peace. Rambo never finds it. All he finds is hatred and fear aimed at him and that makes them hostile towards him. The Main Villain in this if you can call him one is Police Chief Wil Teasle wonderfully played by Brian Dennehy. The interaction between the two is tense and that's before the shooting starts. But this is Stallone's movie and his Tour de force as he creates a complex character that many have a hard time separating from the Real Stallone. Richard Crenna Steals the Show as Colonel Sam Trautman United States Special Forces coming all the way from fort Bragge to come get his boy. Crenna underplays his role cool as anyone has a right to be. Together this cast sets off a match headed towards Kegs of Gunpowder and dynamite First Blood does not disappoint and it will stay with you long after you've seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Smart, well-plotted, action-filled, ultimately moving war film about a mentally unstable Vietnam vet who returns stateside to find another war raging - one against veterans.Stallone gives a very good, understated performance - his action sequences are so realistic that it's hard to believe that no one got hurt during the filming. Dennehy is also superb as the chief pursuing officer, whose ragtag bunch of cops includes a small role for David Caruso.I really did like this movie. I liked the overarching social message, and the unexpected twists and turns that follow a pretty routine event - a sheriff rousting a drifter, getting much more than he bargained for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Blood (1982)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, like many, have probably grown up with Rambo being a part of popular culture. From all those references to such an iconic character I was expecting some war film centered around an unstoppable killing machine. I was completely wrong, and thankfully so. Rambo is the story of a dark and troubled man. Rambo isn't a hero, but he should have been. He's a man that came home with no one to welcome him. He drifts from town to town, antagonised wherever he goes. One day a police force pushes him too far. Rambo's mental instabilities take hold and he pledges a war against these men in authority. There are no clearcut villains, and certainly no heroes here. We empathise with Rambo, and understand the police action taken against him. As well as being a commentary on the treatment of Vietnam Vets, it also shows how war isn't an excuse for such violent actions. Dennehy's wonderful character is shown (very subtly) as a soldier that managed to find his path. At the same time Dennehy doesn't know when to quit, his pride getting in the way. This is an action film with real substance, real issues, and real discussions to be had. It also never fails to deliver on the action, and Stallone's final emotional breakdown will relate to anyone that's been pushed too far. A film focused mostly on understanding, not excusing. I regret waiting this long to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most memorable action series began with this drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the things that surprised me the most when I watched First Blood for the first time was that it wasn't an action film. Yes it had a lot of stunts and some action sequences but it wasn't the blow things up, in your face, guns blazing action that you might associate with Rambo films. Instead First Blood had a story...an important story...with a character that instilled itself into pop culture infamy forever and its easy to see why and how. First Blood is about stereotyping, profiling, exclusion, war and watching it nowadays makes it even more important than it was then or later on. With eye opening Vietnam films like Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Casualties of War and so forth First Blood did something that those films weren't able to do...take the exact same message and bring it to the mainstream public with one of the biggest stars of the day. In a way First Blood is almost shocking because essentially John Rambo is NOT the hero. I suppose he could be considered the 'anti-hero' but his actions are not saving anyone, and in fact hurting innocent people who can't possibly fight him but try to no avail anyways. Still the message is clear and it's a very story driven film with the creation of a movie icon.I'll argue with anyone, anytime...Sylvester Stallone is a very talented actor AND a very talented writer. No one could ever touch the character of John Rambo the way he did. Stallone went way beyond the action genre and actually created John Rambo from personality and history and his movements, everything. In this first installment he laid the groundwork for Rambo. Quiet, brooding, scorned, angry, unstable, haunted, deeply emotional but buried beneath all these other emotions. I think that's a hell of a performance in my books. Brian Dennehy is Stallone's rival and does a terrific job playing the conceited and determined small town sheriff who will stop at nothing to bring Rambo down. The two of them have a terrific on screen chemistry and Dennehy is a first rate actor. Richard Crenna adds to the cast as Rambo's only true 'family' and the one person he trusts. Crenna doesn't give a lot of variation to his performance, he's just kind of there to inform everyone of what Rambo is capable of. He is sort of monotoned and straight faced but he's a Rambo series staple and the character he plays is very important.Watch the end of this film closely for John Rambo's break down in the Grocery store when Traut (Crenna) tells him "It's over." You know the infamous line "Not that it's over." Watch the scene that follows and then tell me that you're not moved and blown away by Stallone's performance. It's real and it's important. First Blood by some will be considered untouchable by the rest because they see it for what it was likely meant to be...a drama...and important drama with a message but the film makers created this incredible character and by the time the film is done you're thinking one thing; I want to see this guy in his element in the action that they speak of and then you have the serializing of Rambo (which you will see by my review is NOT a bad thing.) I suppose I'm judging First Blood on it's merit of being considered an action film because as great as Stallone is and how interesting the film is...I didn't find it mind blowingly entertaining. Still the film is well made an absolute classic and definitely worth seeing. If you're a huge Rambo fan then you can find a lot of hidden details about this mysterious man that Stallone created. It's a must see on any list. 8/10 **************** NOTE Yesterday on Tuesday January 22/2008 star of big screen hits Heath Ledger passed away in his home. I just want to wish his family, his daughter, and Michelle Williams and all his friends my deepest sympathy and I always believed he was destined to be a big star. I will most certainly miss his work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My first impression: flawless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I pressed play expecting mindless happy violence and hilariously bad acting. If I had of said it out loud I would have had to eat my every word. The acting is first rate; Stallone delivers a performance that perfectly portrays a victim of a post traumatic stress disorder. The action is great while still remaining mostly grounded in reality and necessity. Moments that could have been cheesy manage to avoid being so.What is more is that it is very real. Returning to a hostile country upon repatriation is a degrading experience all to many Vietnam veterans had to live through, to the point that the war itself could be favourable by comparison. The style and tone of this movie never trivializes this important reality, nor is it exploited.To say that this movie deserves a nomination for the best movie of all time would be premature on my part, as such a statement requires sober second thought while I have seen the movie only once and last night at that. None the less, this film should never be marginalized.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a Great Great Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is sad that the image of Sly Stallone has become what it has become. He is mocked and used as a punchline by more than a few comics. As a result, many of his films are seen in a less than favorable light. This is very unfortunate, because in "First Blood," Sly made one of the great all-time action films. However, it is more than an action film, and if the final scene does not make your skin tingle, well, you are not human. In many ways, First Blood captures, more than any other film, the difficulty many returning Vietnam Vets had when they returned to America. They had so many friends and so much responsibility in Vietnam. Back in America, they were isolated and slow to readjust into the peacetime way of life. As a result, many were sent wandering about, or worse, heading to jail. First Blood tells the story of one American hero who you should not push too far. In John Rambo, you have a hero from a war nobody wanted to remember. However, the town that persecuted him will remember him, for a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John J. Rambo(Sylvester Stallone) is arrested for vagrancy and then mistreated by the police force so after an excellent action sequence depicting his escape, Stallone turns the tables on the cops and gives them a taste of Vietnam. However not keen to let it go at that, the National Guard is sent in and at the end Stallone decides to single handedly destroy the town and take out his vengeance on the world. First Blood did inspire the Rambo movies which then became an icon and turned it's star into an icon however First Blood is far more fascinating and respectable then the guilty pleasure brought on by the later chapters. The movie itself doesn't depict Stallone as a good guy but rather as a sympathetic psychopath and at the end he's pretty much killing everyone who gets in his way. Indeed here is where most of the interest is found in this genre classic. At the end Stallone does do an impromptu speech about his injustices inflicted upon him but all of his rage is better expressed in the action sequences near the end where Stallone has gone berserk. First Blood is well worth watching.* * * out of 4-(Good)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:Why this endures why the others fade is not a mystery. It was directed by a real director: Kotcheff, who had many action movies under his belt, does well here. What stuns you, if you were unfortunate enough to start with the sequels, is how understated this one is. The whole movie takes place in some frozen Northern town, the woods and the river. He is not trying to fight the Vietnam or Afghanistan wars over again here. Also, Stallone is best when he is as laconic as he is here. Quiet, short sentences with inflection is the pattern. Remember the end of First Blood 2 where he gives that oratory for five minutes? Dennehy never gave a better performance; he is such a loathsome, snobby creep here you will love seeing it boomerang on him. Little touches of levity, the weekend warriors in deeply over their heads showing you why they are not quite on Rambo's level. The realistic in-fighting among the deputies; look for a very young David Caruso here. This is what makes this the classic along with his first Iconic Rocky: small, down to earth realism, no save the planet hyper macho crapo. We do not see him shoot up and entire prisoner of war camp standing out in the open with, apparently, an invisible shield surrounding him. The speech about Vietnam, at the ending, is well done. Stallone barely speaks but a few words up to this point. Most of the movie he is quietly surviving as we watch from afar.Durning was great but Galt steals the movie. This really makes you sympathize with Rambo because Galt hates him at first sight and causes the whole nightmare. Trautman creates the legend in descriptive form: "trained to kill period, ignore pain, to live off the land, to eat things that would make a billy goat puke." I admire Stallone, he is a good actor, but when he directs it doesn't go well. True, Cosmatos did the second one but Kotcheff raises this one a mile above the rest. The opening scene where he is coming to see Delmar and finds out Agent Orange killed him, watch how quiet and small the scene is. Stallone does what Russell did so well in Soldier; he acts non verbally with facial expressions and body language. Rocky had made him a star; this was the on ramp to becoming an Movie Legend. Rambo gets injured here, cut up, falls from trees, stitches himself; it is not a comic book rendition of the character that wrecked the sequels.His silence endears him to us. We watch as these bumpkin crap-heads mistreat him and go out of their way to provoke him. Who will forget Will's little helpful ride out of town? Yes, food is fifty miles that way, "Hope this ride helped you out." The problem with the second one is that it is temporally bound in 1985; we even hear one of the rescued prisoners announce it. Also, as time passes, the Vietnam War loses its temporal salience; this movie is as time relevant today as it was back then. The stranger coming into a small town where he is unwelcome. "I get paid to keep it boring; pretty soon we have a whole town full of guys like you, that's why." After Rocky, this is the second best of all of Stallone's movies. A great unknown work of his, also directed by a good director, Norman Jewison, is F.I.S.T. It is a thinly veiled look at Jimmy Hoffa without all the hero worship of DeVito's hymnal of a movie. Goldsmith does his usual great job with very well written music. Young people, if you have only seen one of the dreadful sequels don't be put off from watching this first one. It really does not belong with the comic book histrionics of the following crappy ones. A Great Movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Rambo is a Vietnam war veteran (a former Green Beret) who arrives at a small picturesque mountain town to find an old friend but then gets into trouble with the local sheriff's department. The situation escalates and Rambo escapes into the nearby wilderness to start a one man war against them.Although many people may think of Rambo as some guy who walks around with a machine gun and blasting away everything in sight, this film is certainly not that. It is a tale of a mentally unstable man pushed to the limits and unfortunately for his enemies, killing is what he does best. What is great about the conflict between Rambo and the police is that you can't really point a finger at someone who you can easily blame. Both helped escalate the situation into what it turned into and the film isn't a black and white good versus bad story but both sides have their reasons for doing what they do. Its also a very realistic film with no over dramatization and it is also very brutal.The film, directed by Ted Koetscheff is quite well directed. Good use is made of the beautiful scenery. The action isn't over the top but very in your face and brutal. Fortunately this was the time before the 'shake the camera and use very fast cuts' style of film-making came into widespread use so you can actually see what is going on. And of course, there is an excellent soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith.An good film. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those films that will always be remembered as a classic film, but is marred by the unnecessary sequels that follow.Make no mistake, if you haven't seen this film because you think in any way its like Rambo 2 and 3, please give the film a chance.Stallone does well here as the tormented Vietnam Veteran who is hassled by the local Police force, which ultimately leads to him being arrested on a trumped up charge, and them trying to humiliate him which leads to some flashbacks that send him over the edge.So is First Blood just mindless violence? No, its quite thought provoking in many ways, not least because of the hostility shown towards a lot of soldiers who served in Vietnam by their fellow countrymen, although First Blood is a slight exaggeration on the consequences of one of this soldiers fighting back.Music is particularly good, direction is taught, especially the stalking scenes in the woods when Rambo decides to even the odds against the Police.Stallone is perfectly cast in the role, not acting the meathead that he saved for later roles. Richard Crenna is slightly grating as Colonel Trautman, his delivery is too stiff and some of his lines are just hopeless "I know Johnny, and thats all I need that gives me the edge." In the film it just sounds stupid.Brian Dennehy is perfect as the local Sheriff who bites off more than he can chew, though it would have been good to have had Rambo and him have a bit of a sound off at the end, which ended up being between Rambo and Trautman.A good solid classic action film, that is only spoilt by the sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Rambo is an ex-Green Beret who has become a drifter and drops by at small town in Oregon to see a Nam buddy. Only discover he's too late as his pal had died of cancer. While, walking through town, the sheriff doesn't take to kindly to drifters and escorts Rambo out of his town. But when Rambo ignores his advice and tries to head back to the small town for a meal, the sheriff arrests him as a no-good vagrant that was resisting arrest and carrying a concealed weapon. When in prison the authorities were roughly cleaning him up, and through that, he has flashbacks of the torturous ordeal faced in Vietnam. This leads to him beating up the cops and escaping into the nearby woodlands. The sheriff wants his man, so they organise a hunting party, but shortly enough they find themselves becoming the target.Watch the bullets fly by and booby traps spring up in this slam-bang and quite thunderous action flick that at times does actually have a mild temperament compared with the overblown and outrageously silly, but fun comic book sequels. This was the first time I watched the original. I've seen the sequels plenty of times, but I was more than surprised about the quality of this one. The action is there, but unlike the sequels its got interesting facets. Plot-wise it's taken off David Morell's novel, but there are certain changes, especially the ending. It seems to show a little more meaning within its character's motives and hard-edge action sequences, which are very well executed. There's really no superhero display in Rambo's attitude, but more so an emotionally unstable man coming to grips with a society he can't figure out and fit in with. So, this becomes his little private war and the film's soul.The script can get a bit corny, but at least it has a little more weight to it. While, it's Sylvester Stallone's tremendously tortured performance that makes you cheer him on. His raw character has a little more ground and plausibility in his mindset. Brian Dennehy chews up the scenery whenever on screen as the determined local Sheriff Teasle. Also making appearances is a sturdy Richard Crenna as Colonel Trautman and a young David Curuso as one of the sheriff's men. One factor that hits you is that it doesn't take too long to fold out, as it swoops right into its engaging detail and gritty vigour with very little in the way of intro. Jerry Goldsmith trumps in with a well-integrated and harrowing score that paints the perfect mood to what's happening on screen. Andrew Laszlo's competently earthy photography manages to get right amongst the thick wilderness and director Ted Kotcheff makes perfect of the surroundings and slow rising tension.One of the better action yarns of the 80's. Mission over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."First Blood" (1982) is a great picture. Saw it 5 or six times, most of them when i was 10-15 years old, i owned a VHS. Now revisiting after 13 years, i found one interesting aspect of this picture. Althrough "Rambo" associates with action, physical force and weapons, "First Blood" isn't about the action at all. Action in this movie is never forced, it is logical consequence of the actions. Later movies became super action flicks, but this was always more about the character - it's actually a superb character study.Sylvester Stallone shines in one of his best acting works, creating unforgettable character. 32 years have past since this movie saw a day light, and it still looks great and most important feels real. And the ending - still one of the most powerful speeches in cinema, Stallone is absolutely brilliant in there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing is over! Nothing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First Blood is based on a novel which, although I have never read, differs greatly from the film version. Stallone is John Rambo, who enters a small pacific northwest town as a grizzled looking loner in search of an old army buddy from Vietnam. After learning of the death of his friend from Agent Orange the previous summer, Rambo wanders into town looking for something to eat and is instantly confronted by the local sheriff, Will Teasel, brilliantly portrayed by Brian Dennehey. Teasle personifies the iconic small town sheriff, bullying, arrogant, drenched in ego. Teasle sizes up Rambo as a transient, taking particular offense to the flag on Rambo's army jacket, and makes it clear his kind is not welcome in the bucolic little hamlet he is charged to protect. Aside from his past in Vietnam, little is known about Rambo at this point, but Stallone does do an admirable job of capturing the psychological instability of his character which becomes more pronounced as Teasle pushes him harder. What ensues is an escalation of tensions resulting in Teasle arresting Rambo, ostensibly for nothing more than challenging his authority to dictate who can come and go in his one horse town.After his arrest, Rambo is treated brutally by the local deputies. Each is eager to impress the sheriff and lack the moral and intellectual capacity to function outside of their little world. They see Rambo as an opportunity to reaffirm their own power over someone who clearly, by virtue of his size and self confidence, has power over each of them. Their tactics to subdue and interrogate Rambo border on torture which pushes Rambo over the edge, setting off the warrior instinct he cultivated in Vietnam. He quickly overpowers the deputies, and Teasle, and effects an escape into the nearby mountains. It is here where Rambo sets the stage for his one man war, on his own terms.After igniting this firestorm, and after Rambo proves more than a match for his poorly trained and incompetent deputies trying to hunt him down, Teasle learns who Rambo really is, and what he has just gotten himself into. Rambo is a former Green Beret and recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor. Later, after the state police and national guard are mobilized to apprehend Rambo, Colonel Sam Trautman arrives at the behest of the army to defuse the situation. Trautman was Rambo's commanding officer in Vietnam, and provides a little more insight to the man Teasle considered nothing more than a psychotic drifter. Trautman recruited and trained Rambo as a member of an elite group of soldiers. Trautman, seemingly bragging, informs Teasle just who he is messing with: An expert with guns, with knives, with his bare hands, trained as a perfect killing machine. He adds "I didn't come here to save Rambo from you. I came to save you from him." Several explosions, spent shell casings, booby traps, and a couple million dollars worth of property damage later, Trautman convinces Rambo to surrender. But not before an impassioned monologue from Rambo revealing the tortured, conflicted soul of man haunted by his past, living without purpose in a world which doesn't want him.First Blood remains a favorite of mine although much more could have been done with it. Stallone does a good job with Rambo, but he would not have been my first choice. Stallone is a limited actor who made his mark as Rocky Balboa; a noble yet two dimensional character. Rocky works well for Stallone given the lack of emotional and intellectual range, but Rambo required a little more depth and nuance to really sympathize with him. Stallone's portrayal comes off as a little rigid and icy, although is not unclear that Rambo still struggles to retain his humanity. At the end of the film he lets loose his rage against a contemptuous society than neither understands him nor appreciates the sacrifices he made for them. Rambo is in many respects a hero, a man molded into an instrument of perfection for a single purpose, to fight and win for a greater purpose. Now that the war is over he has no place, no identity, and only the lingering pain of the past. His tearful rail at the end encapsulates the pain of a soldier no one cares for after having fought a war no one wanted. Stallone remarked in an interview recently that his monologue at the end of First Blood was probably the best acting he's done on film. I would tend to agree.In a greater context, I think the story, while at times totally unbelievable, is a commentary on America's attitude toward Vietnam and the way it handled the soldiers who returned. In a microcosmic sense, this small hick town represents the scorn and apathy of a culture which was, at the time, confused and angered about it's own identity and struggle to regain the power it relinquished to defeat in Vietnam. Rambo too is angry and confused, yet he never turned against his country until they turned against him. Then he gave them a war they could not believe. "It was YOUR war! You asked me, I didn't ask you!".An interesting side note: In the novel Rambo dies at the end. The film was to have ended the same way with Rambo asking Trautman to shoot him rather than letting him rot in a cell for years. "You made me, you kill me. You owe me that." But it was changed, for a variety of reasons most notably sequels, to allow Rambo to live. This ending was filmed and can be seen on Youtube as an alternate ending. It's actually pretty good.An excellent film. Thought provoking, engaging, well acted and well directed. I recommend this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Violent movie that launched the Stallone career and his Rambo episodes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sylvester Stallone as Rambo is a previous Green Beret who is forced to save himself from a redneck sheriff ( Brian Dennehy) and deputies ( Bill Mckinney , Jack Starrett, David Caruso ). Rambo is falsely accused as vagrant and wrongfully jailed and he pull off the break-out . The authorities set off in pursuit and he lead them into all type of dangerous , booby traps in the woods and mountains of the Oregon State . Rambo appears threatening , lurking and harassing to his enemies pursuers escaping of innumerable risks and dangers . Former colonel (Richard Crenna) will attempt to stop and detain him .From the beginning to the end the comic-book action-packed and extreme violence is continued and it is fast movement for that reason the picture is quite entertaining. The outdoors are spectaculars , the landscapes have been filmed in natural parks . Stallone is enormous as the tough and rebel ex soldier and Richard Crenna is top notch as the anterior trainer officer. Appears unbilled Bruce Greenwood (JFK in Thirteen days ),almost extra ,and screen debut from David Caruso and Chris Mulkey . Awesome and exceptional cinematography by Andrew Laszlo filmed on location in Golden Ears Provincial Park,Hope, North Vancouver, Pitt Lake, Pitt Meadows, Port Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada. Splendid and magnificent musical score by the great maestro Jerry Goldsmith. The motion picture is followed by Rambo series : ¨First blood II¨ in which Rambo returns at Vietnam to rescue American prisoners of war and ¨Rambo III¨ against the Russians who control a particular sector of Afghanistan . The trilogy was a completed by the recent ¨Rambo¨ , a definitive improvement, with Julie Benz and directed by the same Stallone in which Rambo fights enemies in Thailand . The quartet was a complete success though the best considered is the original . The film will appeal to action enthusiast and Stallone fans ; it's a movie for adrenaline lovers . Rating : Good , entertaining but violent . This exciting and moving motion picture is professionally directed by Ted Kotcheff. Although the movie has some aspects a little tough to take , this intelligent film still has its agreeable moments. This large-scale and lavishly produced picture attempts a special atmosphere with spectacular results. Two thumbs up</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Rambo,, a man pushed too far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this movie takes u to the events in the life of a Vietnam vet John.j.Rambo who is back to his own country after having a disturbing and haunting experience in Vietnam. Here he wanted to meet his last surviving old buddy , but is met with utter dismay and dejection to learn that his last friend from his military days has also passed away due to cancer. saddened by the news , Rambo walks in into a nearby small town where he s met by the local sheriff will teasle. Teasle didn't like the presence of Rambo in the town and drops him out of the town , but Rambo tries to walk in back as he didn't committed any crime. Teasle arrested him on the charges of vagrancy , resisting arrest and carrying a concealed weapon. He then delivers Rambo to his deputy galt, who was more overslept than his senior and friend. when he along with his deputies started to brutalize Rambo, the haunting memories of torture and persecution in the p.o.w camp in nam revealed back to him only to make him remind that he s back again where he started and these people are also like the same vietkong and n.v.s which he encountered there. At one time when they forcefully try to shave him , Rambo have had enough of that and begins to retaliate with force. He escapes to nearby mountain side in the forest. When he is spotted , galt tries to kill him but is killed accidentally. This makes teasle more aggressive and infuriated. He and his fellow officers kept on pursuing Rambo in the jungle regardless knowing about his outstanding military record, his fight skills and guerrilla warfare techniques. Instead they are easily stalked , trapped and overpowered by the man they were pursuing. Rambo let them live and Scot free by injuring them in the traps laid down by him. Now the sheriff calls for assistance from the state police and a few army national guards men. At the same time colonel paul.s.trautman arrives on the scene who had trained and recruited Rambo in Vietnam.I saw this movie some 24 yrs ago , the 2nd of stallone after rocky 3 and stallone again fascinated me very much as he did in rocky. He portrayed an excellent character of of a disgruntled war veteran who is now at war with his country fellowmen and also at war with his own self for what he got by spilling his blood and an important time of his life on a foreign soil just for his nation. In this movie i liked the scenes of Rambo deliberately jumping form a very high cliff in order to save his life from galt ' s bullets. The other one in which trautman tells teasle," you send that many against him, don't forget one thing , a good supply of body bags. The one in which Rambo remembers of being given a knife cut in prison camp when he is tried the same tactic by local policeman. And the end when Rambo is met by his former commanding officer trautman and their is argument between them, Rambo openly speaks about the humiliation and misbehavior of his own people then he breaks down and sheds into tears remembering his friends, narrating down his horrific experiences of war. This the best in all 3 sagas in Rambo trilogy. In the end the single song in movie sound track itself speaks the language of the film. The plot and acting are better than its successor films. I would recommend this movie to all stallone fans , especially Rambo lovers. This is an action flick with a better concept and understanding</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dubious Moral Stance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a thriller similar to SOUTHERN COMFORT this movie works very well . Okay FIRST BLOOD is by no means a work of art but it's far better than its ridiculous right wing sequels which involve a thread bare plot of a killing machine getting sent to kill loads of reds . There are one or two technical problems with this original , for example motivation is skipped over : Sheriff Teasle sees Rambo , doesn't like his type in town and decides to give him a lift out of the county . Rambo for some reason decides to head back and is arrested thereby setting up the story . Is there any reason for Rambo wanting to go back to a place where he's not wanted apart from setting up the story ? Brian Dennehy is excellent as the sheriff but Richard Crenna is almost a carichture of an army officer as Col Trautman though he was cast at very short notice so I guess he shouldn't be judged too harshly . Unfortunately Sly Stallone is a hopeless character actor and watching him spout his angst ridden lines made me laugh out loud when in fact we're supposed to burst into tears listening to the experiences of the Vietnam vet . A terrible performance from Stallone in arguably his best filmMy major criticism of FIRST BLOOD isn't down to the acting - It's down to the dubious morality of the screenplay . We're supposed to feel sorry for John Rambo and granted he must have had a terrible time in the 'Nam followed by coming home to be called " Baby killer " or being met by indifference and Teasle and Trautman discuss Vietnam but at no point does anyone point out the obvious fact that politicians were to blame for the conflict . Worse still Teasle is painted as being some kind of bad guy for the audience to dislike . Let's see now Rambo killed one policeman , injured several others and is running around the North West wilderness with a gun and Teasle is trying to capture him at all costs which makes the sheriff is the bad guy for upholding the law ? I've never been convinced that Rambo is an anti hero good guy in say the way James Bond is and this might have something to do with the franchise being vilified by moral guardians who blame violent movies for high crime rates . I do recall newspaper campaigns in Britain trying to ban this movie and the sequels because at one point it seemed every violent nutter had a Rambo movie in their video collection when arrested by the police . I doubt if this movie caused one single crime but it does seem bizarre when cinema makes heroes out of violent killers in morally dubious movies</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stallone's Finest Hour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never disliked but never really rated Stallone:First Blood is the only time I've witnessed Stallone perform in a moving acting performance. This is throughout the whole movie but climaxes in the closing scene where Rambo breaks down in the arms of Trautman, the finely- tuned killing machine of his labours that despite his best efforts is still in possession of the mess of human emotion that you might call a soul. The movie begins with Rambo making his way into a small town to find his former comrades only to find that they're all dead, this opening is essential to setting a scene for the action of the movie which is brought on by Rambo who becomes a dangerous man as he walks into town on a downer, having lost those closest to him and clinging to very little; he is hassled by the despicable Sheriff Teasle. Who decides to assert his petty authority by abusing Rambo's right to move freely about the town in absence of any legislative backing. Rambo stands by his principles however and when ordered to leave the town flaunts Teasle's authority and marches back in to which Teasle pulls out his gun and arrests Rambo on trumped-up charges. The character of Teasle and his behaviour throughout the film really say a lot about the creeping in of Big-Government following the Vietnam war. In the opening scenes of the movie we see Teasle leaving the station, saying a hello to all the town's people, who greet him cheerfully as he herds them like cattle. They basically love their captor, and present no challenges to him as they rely heavily on him to maintain order in the town. Teasle however soon crosses paths with Rambo, who doesn't care for his status as Sheriff and offends his(Teasle's) masculinity. The cops in this story depict Big-Government perfectly, they're for the most-part fat, out-of-shape, out-of-touch amateurs who in the absence of any real civil unrest have taken to simply picking on citizens for not bathing regularly or cutting their hair(literally). Their incongruity to Rambo, a battle-hardened, battle-scarred even, witness to atrocities of war explodes into a chain reaction of events that spiral beyond Teasle's control. Enter Colonel Trautman who proposes to Teasle to swallow his pride and let Rambo "slip through". A prominent underlying theme throughout the movie is male pride, ego, in short. Rambo stands his ground as a man on the edge of society with nothing left to lose, Teasle abuses his position and in-turn Rambo's rights in order to hold onto the stature that the town's people hold him in. Trautman offers sound, sensible advice to Teasle on how to minimize the casualties only because he feels he has the upper-hand in that if Teasle persists in pursuing Rambo then Rambo(the manifestation of his own ego) will obliterate Teasle and his men(which he readily says to Teasle). Towards the end of this movie as Rambo corners Teasle in the station, basically humbling the king in his own castle you can't help but side with Trautman's advice, having seen the whole town brought to it's knees by the stupid pride of Teasle. What underwrites all the action and drama of this movie are the emotional scenes; the first when the pursuit of Rambo begins and the cops venture into the woods in hot pursuit. Where Rambo camoflauges himself and the forest springs to life on Teasle and Rambo holds a knife to his throat. Followed by tears from Teasle; it doesn't take much imagination to know he would be crying because he'd literally peed his pants. And secondly Rambo's tearful confession to Trautman, who for all his showing off to Teasle is I'll-equipped to provide the emotional support that Rambo needs then and there. One major issue of this movie is the treatment of ex-vets, I'm not pro- war, the opposite in-fact. But the majority of people in western societies just simply don't give a damn either way. However, when it comes to unjustified wars a lack of objection is all the support it needs. That said, the same don't give a damn either way attitude is certainly lacking in compassion, something returning veterans are often in desperate need of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rambo Gets His 'Blood' Up in this Wickedly Enjoyable Action-Thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'First Blood' follows John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone), a green beret who had a successful and violent career in Vietnam but has terrible memories from the war that plague his life. He is also trying to find a way back into society and recover from the hell he experienced. When he wanders dazedly into a small town called Hope in the Pacific Northwest, he falls foul of an over-zealous hick, the town sheriff. Soon the local law enforcement officers detain him and harass him to a breaking point, giving him flashbacks of the torture he experienced in Vietnam. Rambo snaps and goes on the run, hunted by the authorities who don't realize how dangerous he really is.At this point the film turns essentially into a chase movie with Rambo foiling his pursuers at every turn. Hiding in the dense woodland and mountainous terrain, he fends off the local posse using guerrilla methods he learned in Vietnam. Described by his former commanding officer as "a killing machine", we soon learn that Rambo isn't a cold-blooded killer. He's almost a Boy Scout, and a phenomenal Boy Scout at that, who concentrates not on revenge, not on unmotivated mayhem, but on survival in the wilderness. The violence continues to escalate through the movie, all leading up to an apocalyptic conclusion.Boasting some of the best use of rugged landscape seen in years, First Blood is an effective, if outlandish, picture that offers several big-screen thrills. The plot may seem preposterous, but as directed by Ted Kotcheff, the movie has a crude but undeniable momentum. He knows how to stage an action scene with flair and keeps the film moving along at a rapid pace. The emphasis is clearly on toughness and versatility, as a battered, bloody Mr. Stallone demonstrates a wide range of scouting skills, from building traps to exploring a pitch-black cave; he also slaughters wild animals and gives himself stitches. He barely says a word in the entire film, save for one long and laughably pat speech that comes up at the end, about how Vietnam has affected him and why he has lashed out against the small town, which has him sounding even more incoherent than the screenplay warrants. But as a powerful, silent, hollow-eyed presence, he is unexpectedly commanding. He makes sure that Rambo is seen as a tormented, misread, amazingly resourceful victim of the War, rather than as a sadist or a villain, by allowing us to look into the disturbed psychological head-space of a lone man, bent on survival.Call it macho crap. Call it mindless escapism. Call it Sly's grand posturing. In fact, call it all of the above. First Blood is still a captivating and wickedly enjoyable action/thriller, with a degree of intelligence and substance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Engrossing action thriller about John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone), a Vietnam vet and Medal of Honor recipient, who is now a drifter haunted by his experiences in the war. While traveling through a small town in Washington, Rambo is arrested by Sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) for being a vagrant. When a sadistic deputy abuses Rambo, he lashes out violently and escapes custody, fleeing into the mountains. As a manhunt is underway to capture Rambo, his mentor and former commanding officer Colonel Sam Trautman (Richard Crenna) shows up to try and prevent a bloodbath.Probably the best Stallone movie behind the first Rocky. Great action, yes, but also a terrific script and some really good performances that elevate this above so many other action movies. I've read David Morrell's original novel and I have to say this is a case where the movie adaptation is just superior in every way. In the book, the Teasle character is more of the good guy and Rambo is a psycho killer that has to be put down like a dog. So kudos to Michael Kozoll, William Sackheim, and Sylvester Stallone for making the changes they did to the plot and for all the quotable lines their script gives us. As for the acting, there isn't a bad note anywhere in this. Even the supporting players are excellent. Stallone and Dennehy knock it out of the park. Richard Crenna has arguably his most famous role here as Colonel Trautman. He gets many of the best lines.Great score from Jerry Goldsmith with a memorable theme song. Ted Kotcheff's direction is solid. The action is fantastic but, as I said, it's so much more than just a popcorn movie. It has something to say about the Vietnam war and how the soldiers were treated when they returned home. This won't sit well with all types but I appreciate what they were going for here and thought they did very well with it. Had there never been another Rambo movie, this one would still be a classic. But there were more sequels to come, all action movies of varying degrees of quality but none quite as good as this one.</fullReview>

I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. And, like Rocky, the main character is played so well by Sylvester Stallone. Obviously it isn't as good as the likes of the godfather or the green mile but for the whole 89 minutes it was on I never got bored, and considering I'm not a patient person that's quite an achievement.

		<shortDescription>An Action Tour De Force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Making the perfect action film is no easy task. There have been very few movies in this genre that I deem to be truly flawless. However, as much as it means to me to call a film a masterpiece, I don't hesitate when it comes to calling this particular film a masterpiece. First Blood is a milestone in action movie making that is equally suspenseful as it is emotional and a definitive moment for Sylvester Stallone's career.The plot goes as follows. John Rambo is an ex-Green Beret who travels the country visiting old friends from Vietnam. He goes to see one of his old comrades only to learn that he has passed away. With a bleak future ahead of him, Rambo goes into a small town and is immediately harassed by a local sheriff for being a drifter. He's arrested, escapes from the police station, goes into the woods and begins a one-man war with the police and national guard.With a plot like this, you'd expect it to be a bullet-fest with no real feeling, but instead it is an intense experience because of the audiences' emotional investment in the human story embedded within whilst the violence and body count is kept to an appropriate minimum (There's only one death and it's unintentional). First Blood is not about the action, it's all for suspense, character development and how viewers respond to it.The reason why the suspense works so well is because of how connected we feel to John Rambo. We witness his response to hearing about his friend's death, get a glimpse into the horrendous things that he experienced in the war and we see the unethical treatment of him at the hands of the corrupt cops. These effectively establish him as our protagonist and we really wish to see him succeed. The rest of the movie sees him put into a series of life threatening situations that we wanna see him overcome, but we aren't entirely sure. That's the genius.Sylvester Stallone gives a performance that is equally as phenomenal as his Rocky performance. Anyone who still wishes to discredit Sly really should examine these films before jumping to conclusion. He clearly is a talented actor. The greatest moment that Stallone gives us is a powerful monologue at the end in which Rambo releases all his built up thoughts. His cries all come out as being genuine. These dramatic moments are far more powerful than any sort of explosion or special effect.Outside of Stallone, I feel the need to give my compliments to Brian Dennehy and Richard Crenna. Their performances as Teasle and Colonel Trautman are very strong and they are great supporters of Stallone.The movie also has several other positive points. The pacing is perfect and the hour and a half running time doesn't come off as short nor does it drag. The atmosphere of every location is evident and reinforces the suspense. The music by Jerry Goldsmith is absolutely wonderful and contributes to both the suspense and emotional impact. Lastly, the overall direction of Ted Kotcheff rightfully should be commended.Whilst the series did lose its serious tone after this and just went for straight forward action, they are entertaining and they certainly don't hurt the true power of the original movie.First Blood is a movie that hits in all the right places and then some. It has earned it's place as an endlessly rewatchable action classic that is definitive of its genre. The fact that this is not in IMDb's Top 250 list is a crime. Action movies do not get better than this.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classic 80's action movie with descent acting. It is predictable as most action movies are, but if you like that kind of entertainment then First Blood surely satisfies. Stallone doesn't say much, which aids to his role as a disturbed army veteran, and the movie is fairly quick, which leaves little time for drawn out scenes. The movie has a fair amount of violence and blood display which should be taken into discretion. It is also currently adding a 4th sequel due to its past success in satisfying fans of this genre of movies. Fans of Chuck Norris and the Die Hard sequels will surely enjoy this flick. Overall, it delivers its share of entertainment and serves as a great Sunday afternoon movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is a Vietnam veteran. Rambo finds coming back home to American is a difficult task and he never really recover from the trauma, he suffered on Vietnam. Rambo finds himself being the only man left in his platoon, when he tries to meet his last contact. Who just recently died from getting cancer from Agent Orange. Rambo is living the life of a drifter, While he tries to stop in a small town for food. He's stopped by a small town corrupted Sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) and he wants Rambo out of town immediately. When Rambo tries to walk back to town, he gets arrested by the Sheriff. Things get worse when Rambo is taking in the jail, he gets unfairly brutally tortured by a sadistic Deputy Sergent (The late Jack Starrett) and fellow police officers. Rambo finally escapes to the Mountains and hiding from the police. When Rambo kills the Deputy Sergent from defending himself. He finds himself in even more worse situation, when he becomes the hunted. Now he sets traps for these officers. While he tries to find a way to get out of the U.S. Northwest. The sheriff makes an personal vendetta to capture Rambo, dead or alive. Now Colonel Samuel Trautman (The late Richard Crenna), who is a former boss and friend to Rambo. Who tries to help Rambo before things get worse. But Rambo is slowly planning his personal revenge to the sheriff as well.Directed by Ted Kotcheff (North Dallas Forty, Uncommon Valor, Weekend at Bernie's) made an tough action drama that become One of Stallone's best films. Which this film is based on a novel by David Morrell. Stallone certainly become an classic character for this picture, especially most audiences at that time seen him mostly as "Rocky Balboa". Stallone is terrific in the role. The film has strong performances by Dennehy and the late Crenna gives fine support to the well made picture. The action sequences and Canadian location in the movie are first-rate.The Ultimate Edition of "First Blood". DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good Digitally Remastered-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD includes an fairly interesting commentary track by Stallone. Which Stallone admits that the movie was difficult to make, the filmmakers and Stallone panic after seeing the long rough-cut of the movie. Which Stallone thought it was a terrible movie at first. He was willing to buy the negative and destroy the film. Thanks to smart editing in the picture, Stallone felt the movie was saved after seeing an perfectly first 40 minutes of the film. He also talked about that Trautman character was originally cast for Kirk Douglas. Who actually came on the set of the film but before his scenes were going to be filming. He really wanted the Rambo character to die as Rambo did died in the novel. He wanted many changes in the script as well. Then Crenna was cast after Douglas left the production.DVD also has the alternative ending, where Rambo does died by killing himself. DVD also includes an deleted scene and an outtake. The oddest feature on the DVD is the "Groundbreaking Military Special Operations Features". This might find some amusement for the die-hard fans of the series. But it's quite silly, despite some cleverness on that feature. This is the third time that "First Blood" got released to DVD. On the original and second DVD edition had an fascinating commentary track by novelist Morrell. Which this third DVD edition doesn't bother to include the original commentary track as well. In the first movie about Rambo, he turned into an icon anti-hero. Like Snake Plissken character in John Carpenter's Escape from New York. But Rambo character turned more into a Action Hero in the sequels. A couple of familiar faces like Bill McKenney, Chris Mulkey and David Caruso appears in small roles. This is a classic action/revenge/drama that has an good looking cinematography by Andrew Laszlo (The Funhouse, Innerspace, The Warriors) and classic music score by the late Jerry Goldsmith (Alien, The Edge, The Omen). Don't miss the original film. Screenplay by Michael Kozoll (The Hard Way), William Sackheim and Stallone (Rocky Series, Cobra, Cliffhanger). Panavision. (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a great similarity between "First Blood" (1982) and "Lonely are the Brave" (1962). A cowboy (Douglas) is imprisoned by a small town sheriff. He escapes and and flees to the mountains on horseback. He is pursued by the sheriff's men and a helicopter which he shoots down. He runs rings around his pursuers and almost completes his escape when he reaches a highway. It grows dark and begins to rain hard. This film has a sadder ending. Douglas and his horse are struck by a truck (driven by Carroll O'Connor). The horse is destroyed by the sheriff and Douglas is taken away in an ambulance. The last shot shows his cowboy hat discarded on the rainy highway.</fullReview>

No matter how many times you view it, it remains interesting and delivers on the goods.It is what it is. Like an old Chuck Norris movie or Roadhouse for example, it is not academy award material. Its just a great flick you can enjoy time and time again.

		<shortDescription>Rambo is more than a cartoon character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rambo is more than a cartoon character. He is the alter-ego of a generation. However, they could just as easily have dressed him in a suit and written nearly the same script. In that way, 'Rambo' perpetuates the stereotyped Viet Nam War veteran as a semi-literate, underemployed drifting soul. Many of the clichéd expressions used to describe John Rambo in the film are metaphors for the way real-life Vietnam War veteran were regarded: "Crazy," "psycho," "loser," to name a few things that the character was called in the film. He added a few, (they called me)"...baby killer," "In Nam I was somebody, I was in charge of million dollar equipment, I could drive a tank, fly a chopper. In the end, that he cried was out of character. Nonetheless, the character, 'John Rambo,' did what many of us wanted to do, and many did in their own way: Smack society down for using us and throwing us away, scorned. The interesting thing to note is that the character, Sheriff Teasley, is played by Brian Dennehy, an actor who lied about serving in Viet Nam when he did not. Among veterans, lying about service in Viet Nam is a shameful act. Yet the many who have done so in some way supports the idea that Viet Nam, in the national conscience, was a heroic venture. It was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Rambo (BAFTA winner Sylvester Stallone) is a fairly reserved and sensitive guy, a man who has seen and lived the horrors of the Vietnam War. He returns to the good old United States of America to find his only friend has died. You can sympathise with him and when small- town sheriff (Brian Dennehy) takes a needless dislike to him and his heavy handed deputies mistreat Rambo you can see why Rambo is sent over the edge.In retrospect, unfortunately the sequels turned John J Rambo into 'Rambo' the icon who relies more on an M-16 to get him out of trouble. In First Blood Rambo utilises the teachings from Col. Trautman (Richard Crenna) his war training and combat skills to stay alive and outwit his pursuers.With less guns and explosions director Ted Kotcheff competently builds the tension and suspense and you get the feeling Rambo may not make it till the end. The locations are wonderfully atmospheric - foggy, earthly capturing the true outdoors. Stallone, Crenna and Dennehy are on form and the movie has a strong supporting cast that includes David Caruso in an early role as Deputy Mitch. Underpinning all this is Jerry Goldsmith's memorable score.Rambo First Blood is a grounded drama and action must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An action cinema's masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Rambo's character, played by Sylvester Stallone, is that of a volcano under layers of snow until somebody 'pushes' it to erupt.This is more than just a thriller action film. This is a story of a mentally disturbed man wanting to find solace, a man who has had a troubled past, a man who is lonely and has a pointless life and his unending mental agony.This also a film about a man who is arrogant and pushy; the Sheriff played by Brian Dennehy, who misuses his position to push unworthy people. He plays a brilliant negative role that justifies Rambo's hell flare.The supporting role of Connell Trautman, played by Richard Crenna has defined Rambo's stature. He speaks highly of Rambo, he defines Rambo as a fighting machine who gets better with bare hands, otherwise implausible and fears hell would break lose if circumstances weren't controlled.The movie shows raw action, has fewer dialogues but pungent and precise. And a deep background score that portrays loneliness. This is one of Sylvester Stallone's best movies. This is also the time when he was looked for his macho physic which also has greatly helped Rambo's character.This is one of those films which cannot be ever made again .That time, that era won't come back and such performances cannot be repeated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sylvester Stallone is John Rambo, a mentally scarred Viet-Nam Vet, poorly treated by an idiot cop, while in search for the last of his Viet-Nam buddies. After flashbacks of his torture suffered during the War, he snaps and declares a new war on this once peaceful town.With some great gorilla warfare tactics and some good stunts, the movie transpires to be a very entertaining action flick, which i have to say is pretty cleverly done. Just think for a minute, here is guy who starts this war on the grounds that he is p**sed off at the way he was treated, but we all route for him and want him to continue hurting people who are innocent.Anyway, its a good film and is worth watching, although Stallone overdoes it a bit at the end.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting observation of the post-Vietnam American consciousness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Giving the decades action hero his (or hers) raison d'etre, John Rambo became the ultimate right-wing icon, and, through the First Blood sequels, exacerbated the one-man-army excesses that became so pervasive in action cinema. But before the hyperbole of Republican jingoism, - where the scars of the Vietnam war were refreshed and revised when Reagan, quoting from Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985), stated that; "This Time We're Gonna Win" - Rambo, or more specifically, the Vietnam veteran, was persecuted in American society.Sylvester Stallone's "John J." drifts through the American landscape searching for the remnants of his Green Beret troop, but finds despair in their absence. The veteran often came back to from the war unable to adjust to civilian life, left with the trauma of warfare, they were subjected to dehumanising abuses by the hippie generation, the middle- class students of the anti-war protesters (as Rambo says "They call us baby killers"). Rambo represents the American working class, the bottom of society, who were abused by foreign policy, trained into machines of death, and forgotten about. Unable to hold a job in the negative climate, Rambo wanders, like the Western outlaw, attempting to find his retirement. Much like the conventions of the classic American Western, the lone outsider enters a small town (not the sun blistered West, but the cold, isolated North-East), finding the antagonistic Sheriff Teasle (Brian Dennehy), who's only concern is containing the status quo.In Rambo and Teasle there are two souls damaged by late 1960's American politics. Rambo has been reduced to an angry outsider, whilst Teasle, who clearly continued as Sheriff during the war, would have seen the United States reduced to civil disobedience. Rambo enters town with long hair, he is unwashed, and displays the stars and strips on his jacket, a flag that had lost its meaning in the hearts of men like Teasle. So when this nomadic person, a post-war hippie, drifts into his territory, he is myopic in his attempts to get rid of him. In creating this vacuity of an idealised America, the sheriff protects from the transient generation. The two characters are the different generations, and the divide between these different ideologies. They have both been trained by US authorities, and each, like the country itself, only foresees victory and survival.The structure of First Blood is very simplistic. After being arrested and taken to the local police station, Rambo makes a spectacular escape, making his way on a motorcycle to the rocky, and heavily wooded mountains. After which Rambo is pursued as the authorities, and the audience, begin to discover his exceptional survival techniques, and he wages his own personal war against American small-town hypocrisy, including the inept national guard, made up of local hicks, too young to have any knowledge of war. Unlike the similarly themed action films that proceeded First Blood, Rambo does not actually kill anyone intentionally (Galt (Jack Starrett) falls from a helicopter after a rock hits it, only because he unfastens his seat belt), which actually adds corners to an otherwise one-dimensional character.Rambo's final outburst of violence is directed at the buildings of the small town. The symbols of progress, and the inscrutable institution, the machine of society, of which he is a small, expendable component, a government trained killing machine. Originally to be played by Kurt Russell, Col. Trautman (Richard Crenna) is the military, the superior and trainer of this broken machine. As Rambo's only exterior relationship, he acts as his father figure. The two characters become human when sharing the screen. An often lampooned scene in First Blood is the emotional outpouring by Stallone, which is at times incomprehensible, as his character finally has a voice, but this scene is pivotal to his redemption.Based on a 1972 novel by David Morrell, the film makers thoughtfully toned down the more extreme book. It is a competently made action film, the more ridiculous elements of the one-man-army aspects of the narrative have since been diminished by the more over-the-top action that followed. First Blood sits comfortably within the transition from '70's anti-heroes to the machine-bodies of the '80's. It looks back at Clint Eastwood and Travis Bickle, whilst moving towards a Schwarzenegger. It has muscle and explosive action, some thrilling stunts, and a squeamish scene of Rambo sewing his own gashed arm with a needle and thread. But with this comes an interesting (if slightly over the top) observation of the post-Vietnam American consciousness, the barren psychological landscape, and the harsh effects of war on the individual, what we would call Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War Against War: No Innocent Civilians</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had forgotten about this, about what it meant and how it affected many of us when it was new.The reason I had forgotten was that I have seen many of the following Rambo movies. There, the characters are not people, but collected concepts of institutional evil (always nonwhite) and violent justice. People, even Rambo, appear in the things as part of the motion, icons to show us that the battle is ongoing. Sly himself has become a cartoon, a buffoon who (we suppose) is no more in control of himself than a bullet in flight. We come to the Rambo sequels ? and similar movies ? when we need a visceral shot of self-approval for rooting for the good guy. Justice has always been affirmed by this feeling, this notion of post- testosterone-overflow rightness.In many cases, we even speak of it as if it were connected with blood, even the blood of your god. I understand those later films, but it was a shock to be reminded that this first one is ? or was ? something quite different.The nation was divided in a profound and lasting way that endures (and is actively sustained) today. There were many factors, but the Viet Nam "police action" became the focus. I think this is because Hollywood during and after WW II ended up helping Americans define the narrative of what it meant to be an American. It placed a packageable notion of goodness in a suitable situation of nationhood. Because the US had no single racial identity that others we defeated had, the notion of a "real" (meaning white Christian) American was fabulated, together with a notion of collected "values," that previously were incidental and unrelated. Hollywood's war gave understanding and thereby meaning. People felt good about themselves. The economy flourished; racism became more vile; political movements were born. So when we ended up in Viet Nam without thinking, these "values" polarized a people. One group clung to this notion of honor in the blood, the other reacting to it, mostly just as a reaction. But one group had the guns, the White House, the lies and a resurgence of fundamentalist Christianity. This film marks a major shift in that public meme. Watching it, I am amazed at how incoherent it is, how slapdash, how poorly made. No one involved would make a decent film afterward. But the viewers of 1982 were so hungry for some resolution of a divided nation, we imposed our own irrepressible narrative on this and found peace in a different sort of broken narrative.On one side, you have the "family values" small town real America who wants things simple. Half of America thought of this as "Wonderful Life" America and half as "Deliverance" America. Here we have the Deliverence variety. Into this walks the guy that until that moment in history would have been a walking icon of their ideals, a backslapped god, a paragon, a hero. But he is rejected. When he turns on the town, a whole cosmology of self-identification shifted. (Incidentally, the action movie was born.) The polar opposites until then had been stable.On one side: valor, Jesus, war, small town goodness, order in law, Caucasian simplicity, competence, the flag. On the other side, let's just simply say opposition.In the film we now had on one side the small town, the law and exclusively white faces. But all the value was sucked out of it. Now the opposition had the competence, the justice, the flag (in an ambiguous way), and racial diversity (at the beginning in a safe way). The film when new was this radical inversion, and audiences went nuts cheering for Rambo. He actually kills no one, carefully so and we all took note. Everyone in the nation was affected by this relatively incompetent thing.Interestingly, the meme collection snapped back more strongly than ever. Today we have the very same polarization, stronger than before. The same clean division, driven by the coherent narrative of religion, fundamentals, flag, whiteness, violent justice with demagoguery, active wars and TeeVee networks.We need a "First Blood" film for our times. One that will stick. One that will help people understand what drives them. One that will not simply produce a new, useless genre.Incidentally, so powerful was the icon of Rambo's knife-of-justice, that Paul Hogan was able to make his own blockbuster movie "Crocodile Dundee" based on one scene with that knife.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people fail to notice how important this landmark film is when exploring subjects like intolerance and police sadism. John Rambo gave his life for his country and in turn his country not just treated him like a piece of crap but also tainted him. The intolerance and preconceived notions of certain folk, their unwillingness to hear Rambo out, and his subsequent vilification after the death of one policeman purely do to self defense, are portrayed excellently within this film. So do not mistake this film for brainless action. The attitude of the people in the movie is truly disturbing. While the next two Rambo movies do not have such a psychological factor, they do succeed as the greatest action films of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seen by many as just another mindless action flick, this goes deeper than most films of its kind. Yes, it is a classic 'one man army' movie, and although i feel its sequel deals more with the disillusionment of veterans, it is an effective look at a man trained only to kill-destroyed by his government, forgotten by his people. Small town exclusiveness, fear and small-mindedness are exploited to the full, and if you give it a chance, this is actually a highly satirical movie. But if you want to see explosions, guns and killings, which is what first brought me to this film, then you can't find many better.Stallone dispatches of the 'bad guys' using every inch of his Rambo's training, and yes, from the start you know the cops don't have a hope. The few roles which call for any substantial acting are done well, the action is of a high quality, the music is memorable, and the script sufficient. if you want deep characterisation then watch The Deer Hunter, but for action, watch this. 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything about this movie was brilliant and it also featured an iconic stars in the form of Sylvester Stallone and two other fantastic actors in the form of Richard Crenna and Brian Dennehe. The emotional performance given by Sly Stallone in this masterpiece is nothing short of stunning. Stallones' acting is fantastic and the story romps along with one outstanding scene after another. This film portrays the way that American society shamelessly shunned, spat at and castigated the returning soldiers of the Vietnam War.John J. Rambo walks through the wrong town at the wrong time and walks right into an ignorant, small time sheriff, excellently played by Brian Dennehey. What happens next is probably one of the greatest, violent, emotional and very political manhunts in cinema history. The disturbing thing is that at the time ( 1982), you can imagine it really happening in America. That is what makes this work of art so captivating. This film is an absolute must! Overall rating: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Rambo is a Vietnam Vet, hitchhiking from town to town to see friends from the war. A sheriff tries to make him leave town and when he refuses, arrests him for vagrancy. Rambo escapes and takes to the woods as the sheriff and deputies try and find him in his element. Things get out of hand as Colonel Trautman, Rambo's old commander, appears to shed light on the situation.........There isn't really much to say about First Blood that hasn't been said a thousand times before. After Rocky, it's Stallone's most famous character, and aside from having a bad case of sequleitis, Stallone never made a film better than this in the eighties. It's groundbreaking stuff for sure, merging action, drama, and an element of horror effortlessly in its short running time, and thank goodness the makers didn't stick religiously to the source material, because it would have been such a very different affair, making Rambo an abhorrent psychopath.Stallone, whatever you may think of his role choices, has been given a really bad rap for this film, because his acting is sensational in some scenes, especially the opening scene when he discovers that the last of his squad has expired.Crenna turns up halfway through as Trautman, and although he is brilliant, he really does nothing more than talk Rambo into more of a rage, and be sarcastic to Dennehy, in arguably his finest role to date.He horror element is the stalking scene in the woods, and although the fact that the Sega game Golden Axe stole a lot of the sound effects, it doesn't detract the films tensest scene.Although the first two sequels were over the top propaganda, seeing this with the 2007 Rambo is the best way, because it gives us the gritty element to Rambos tortured soul.Essential viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sylvester Stallone's best movie ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this action flick and I'm not even a big fan of Sylvester Stallone (I prefer Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger). I mean the only movies that I like by him are this, the first Rocky and The Expendables (particularly the second one). But if Stallone starred in movies more like First Blood than just cheesy action movies more about violence than a story, I would watch them more. It tells the story of John Rambo, a veteran who is a former member of elite group of soldiers who fought in the Vietnam War. He is still traumatized from his war experience and doesn't have a home or any friends (since all the other elite solders are dead). Sheriff Teasle then arrests him for vagrancy. But when things get out of hand, Rambo flees and starts terrorizing everything that stands in his path (even without killing them). But his former commander, Colonel Sam Trautman tries to talk some sense into him and stop from what he's doing. Not only is this one of Stallone's best movies, but it also helped the launch of action movies during the '80s like The Terminator or Die Hard or Lethal Weapon. But I think it's pretty underrated as well, I mean it didn't even get one Oscar nomination. And in this, we actually see Stallone give a big emotional speech about Rambo's hatred for war and watching his friend die right in front of him.If only Rambo had died (which is what happens in the book) we probably wouldn't have the silly and unnecessary sequels that have nothing much to do with the original</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that introduced us to John Rambo.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to believe when First Blood was released in 1982, this movie would spawn three sequels and cement the character John Rambo as a cultural icon. Rambo would also be a term used to symbolise a reckless person who solves problems with violence. First Blood would also prove to be a successful movie for Sylvester Stallone and adds another famous character to his filmography, alongside Rocky Balboa from the Rocky series.The film starts with John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone), a Vietnam Veteran who is drifting across America to locate a former Vietnam buddy. He is saddened when he finds out that his friend died of cancer after being exposed to Agent Orange. Rambo passes through a small town called Hope, Washington where he is met by the town's Sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy). Sheriff Teasle arrogantly proclaims his dislike for drifters and troublemakers in his town and automatically perceives Rambo as a drifter due to his unkempt appearance and his old Army jacket. Teasle drives Rambo to the edge of town and refuses to let Rambo buy something to eat. Angered that Teasle has insulted Rambo, Rambo defiantly turns around and starts walking back. Teasle spots Rambo and arrests him for vagrancy, resisting arrest and carrying a concealed weapon (his knife). While in custody, Rambo is beaten and humiliated by Deputy Art Galt (Jack Starrett) while the rest of the deputies such as Mitch (David Caruso), Ward (Chris Mulkey), and Preston (Don Mackay) are either too weak, ignorant or even partake in Rambo's mistreatment. This also causes Rambo to have flashbacks to his time as a POW in Vietnam where he is captured and tortured. Rambo then snaps and violently lashes out at the deputies, assaulting them. He manages to escape from police custody with his knife and heads for the nearby mountains on a motorbike he has commandeered. Teasle spearheads a manhunt to find John Rambo. Little do they know, John Rambo is a highly decorated Green Beret who is an expert in survival and guerrilla warfare and the deputies have taken on a lot more than they bargained for. The situation deteriorates and the Washington State Police and National Guard are brought in to assist in the manhunt. Also joining in is Rambo's former commander in Vietnam, Colonel Sam Trautman (Richard Crenna), who's warnings about Rambo as well as pleas to let him go fall on deaf ears. Colonel Trautman finds himself to be Rambo's only ally and must convince Rambo to surrender. Rambo maintains that the sheriff drew first blood and continues his one man war through Hope, symbolically waging war against society who has turned his back on him.Although Sylvester Stallone has endured a mixed reception with the Rambo series, without a doubt First Blood is one of the best movies of the series as well as one of Stallone's best movies. The rest of the sequels, although enjoyable, turn John Rambo into a one-dimensional action hero and as a symbol for the person who can wage a one-man war on the enemy. Sylvester Stallone has never been better.Brian Dennehy does an excellent job as the overzealous and arrogant Sheriff Will Teasle who although wants to maintain a boring and peaceful town, has bitten off more than he could chew by looking down upon John Rambo as just another drifter and dismissing all warnings from Colonel Trautman on how dangerous Rambo is.Richard Crenna is perfect in his role as Colonel Sam Trautman, an honourable and respectable man who has taken on an unofficial role as a father figure to John Rambo.While there is a lot of action scenes that have become famous (or infamous) throughout the Rambo series, the ending where Rambo pours his heart out to Trautman has remained imprinted into my memory. Rambo rages about the horrors of the Vietnam War and the unfair conditions and treatment he came home to where he and many other soldiers were abused and spat on by protesters as well as the inability to adapt to civilian life let alone hold a job. As Rambo says he was a respected war hero in the Army with loyal comrades and be responsible for million dollar equipment, back home he can't hold a job and nobody respects him . Rambo weeps as he recounts a gruesome incident where a friend was blown up which still haunts him. Rambo is revealed to be a broken man suffering from the effects of PTSD and his mistreatment at the hands of the sheriff's deputies pushed him over the edge. I'll never forget Trautman fighting to hold his own emotions back as he consoles Rambo, both of them having gone through the same experiences and injustices of the Vietnam War. Though First Blood was set in Hope, Washington, filming took place in Canada throughout the province of British Columbia and Hope, British Columbia is actually the name of the place filming occurred. The scenery featured in First Blood is beautiful, and the backdrop was perfect for the movie. I've always admired Jerry Goldsmith's works as a composer and his score was an absolute delight to listen too. His score gives the movie an energetic and thrilling feel, yet there are times his score emphasizes the tranquility of certain scenes, particularly the opening of the movie.First Blood is also notable for being the Rambo movie in the series with a body count of one, unlike the rest of the movies in the series notable for high on-screen deaths. First Blood is still an enjoyable action movie today, and easily one of the best Rambo movies. It's also not just a one dimensional action movie with well rounded characters and a great story. First Blood is also one of Sylvester Stallone's best movies besides Rocky (1976) and Cop Land (1997). A definite must see movie for all lovers of action and fans of Sylvester Stallone.9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An action film with a message and a purpose.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that just about anyone, of any generation or gender should understand. It's a story that's simple yet so solid it draws you in and has you on the edge of your seat, then leaves you lamenting the pain of the films main character. A lone man, home from a war that nobody understood, hated and despised by the people who should have welcomed him home a hero. Rambo finds himself alone, his friends all dead and gone, haunted by the horrors of Vietnam and left with nowhere to turn. One simple decision to enter a small town brings him face to face with a hard nosed bigoted Sheriff who insists on thrusting Rambo into a whole new war. A war on his home soil and a war that will certainly lead to his death, but Rambo sees no other choice. With no way out, nowhere to turn and no idea how to ever really "go home", Rambo decides to make his last stand.This is a film that speaks volumes to just about anyone willing to listen. It speaks to the pain and torment of those sent off to war, those who feel like outsiders no matter where they are and those who just want to be left alone to live in peace but always feel as though society just won't let them do it. From the comments about how Rambo wears his hair to the remarks about his jacket, just about everyone can identify with some part of this character. The hard nosed Sheriff (played brilliantly by Brian Dennehy) is a character practically everyone has run into in their lives. Be it a cop, a teacher, a coach or even a father figure we've all met or known this type of jackass. The type that can never look past the surface to stop and think maybe there's a reason a person looks the way they look and maybe a little understanding and compassion would be better than a firm hand or outright violence.Regardless, like many of us Rambo try's to move on peacefully. Try's to co-operate and even almost begs for an end to the rapidly escalating situation being pushed by the Sheriff. Other characters in the film, other police officers and even Colonel Trautmen (Rambos former commanding officer) all try to diffuse the situation as it gets worse and worse but the Sheriff just refuses to back down.The movie is so well written, so well paced and so well put together that by ten minutes in, your already on Rambos side and by the end that certainly doesn't change. I can't express enough how in love with this film I am. Stallone shines as Rambo, Dennehy and Crenna (Colonel Trautmen) are amazing in their roles and I quite seriously couldn't complain about a single part of this film. The musical score is brilliant and the theme song to the movie played during the films final moments reaches into your heart and grips it tightly. The filming locations are astonishingly perfect as well and the direction and editing are simply top notch.People can argue whether or not the war in Vietnam was justified and whether or not the world had any business trying to stop a communist takeover of South Vietnam. But the one thing no one should ever argue is whether or not our soldiers are to blame. They fought that war because they were told it was justified. They fought that war because they wanted to defend the innocent and defeat the evil of communism. In many cases they fought because they were drafted and had no choice and then, even when they could have won they weren't allowed to because the war wasn't publicly popular anymore. Many of those soldiers never came home, countless died on the battlefield and countless more were taken prisoner, tortured to death or held in prison camps never to be seen or heard from again. As the story of Rambo points out, even those that came home never really did. They came back forever traumatized facing a hostile public, no jobs, no work skills and next to nothing in their pockets. It's a sad, disgusting state of affairs that we've seen repeated again with the Afghanistan and Iraq wars of our times.I apologize if I'm getting off track and perhaps emotional, but it's an issue that touches me deeply for several reasons that I won't go into here but I felt the need to express myself in this review. This is not only a fantastic action film but it's also a touching portrait of the living hell that a soldier goes through, not only during a war but after and more often than not for the rest of their lives. To lighten up a little, this is quite simply a dam good movie that certainly should appeal to any guy and a lot of women as well. It's just an all around great action movie loaded with drama and some amazingly poignant moments. I have a collection of movie memorabilia and in amongst it are the knives from First Blood and First Blood II. I own this film on DVD, BluRay and in digital format. I've watched it again and again and if all that doesn't tell you this is a good movie, just watch it for yourself. Ditch the rowdy friends for a night (you know the type I'm talking about) shut off the phone and just sit down and take this film in, uninterrupted and let yourself feel every moment. I seriously defy you to dislike it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there's one character that Sylvester Stallone will always be remembered for besides Rocky Balboa, that's this guy - John Rambo. The character of John Rambo may be an exaggeration of what kind of a struggle many war veterans live through everyday after being combat, but it represents them in a way that allows the audience to have sympathy. No matter how well decorated a war veteran is, if they suffered a traumatic event, it will never leave them. The memory will replay over and over again until their very last day. For most, the event is only strong enough to physically paralyze the veteran leaving them immobilized. However, there are some that suffer from and still can live and move around with it in their subconscious. John Rambo is one these and unfortunately, he gets pushed to far.After arriving into a small town to visit a war buddy, John Rambo (Stallone) is pressed by the local sheriff (Brian Dennehy) to keep moving and not return. This however, makes Rambo become defiant and return back to the town, resulting in his immediate arrest. Things only get worse once in the sheriff's building, where Rambo is treated like the worst criminal they've had in the last century. To be honest, I think they were bored - but they picked the wrong person to be bored with. With all the instigating, John Rambo is finally pushed too far with many of his memories replaying over and over. It's at this point he breaks free and begins to fight for himself as if he was back in the war.Stallone's acting is great here. His doesn't say very much for a lot of the movie but when he does, his emotions portray an accurate description of what post traumatic stress victims have to deal with on a daily basis. Also, he gives audiences a better understanding of what it's like to be a soldier and then return to world that's totally opposite from what one is used to and how alienating it can be. Brian Dennehy as the obsessive town sheriff is also convincing because of his stance on drifters. His mindset is understood but his morals aren't up to par. Yet Dennehy's character still isn't fleshed out enough. His motives are given some explanation too but not entirely.Attempting to help the sheriff understand who he's up against is Colonel Trautman played by Richard Crenna. One of the best things about Crenna's character is how he understands John Rambo and is able to see anything coming before the rest of the authorities. Crenna also has some very good lines. Let's also not forget (just for a little fun) that David Caruso (Horatio Caine - CSI: Miami) has a small part in here too. He's extremely young and is one of the better cops in the local town. He at least tries to give John Rambo the benefit of the doubt that he's not some punk off the street looking for trouble.The action is fun to watch here too. Retaining gorilla warfare is an interesting trait to maintain. Don't forget those survival skills though, he's better than any boy scout I've seen. Adding to that is Andrew Laszlo's cinematography where he captures some very wide angle shots of the mountainous landscape of which Rambo must survive and live off of. Surprisingly though, Jerry Goldsmith's score isn't as prevalent as some may expect it to be. It's certainly constructed better than some of his previous scores, but it still lacks strong action cues besides its main theme for Rambo. It does carry emotion but not a tune that's extremely memorable. It's not bad though. Definitely an entertaining action film.This is one heck of a survival film. It has big action and respectable performances that portray the psyche of war veterans with a perspective that many people today do not consider.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite action movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of my favorite action moviesThe movie has a well told story of a drifter that came back from Vietnam. The police kick him out of a small town and that pissies him off so he starts a rebellion getting the whole police force involved. I really enjoyed this film, for the story, the action, the characters and the movie has an emotional touch. It's very rare in an action movie where the main character breaks down. The acting is really well done and then that music by Jerry Goldsmith is amazing, one of my favorite movie soundtracks. If you are gonna start watching the Rambo Series, start off with this one, it's a good watch. it's in my top 20-11 films</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When, for no apparent reason, A small town police chief arrests a vagrant hitch-hiker. Little does her realise that he has set in motion, a catastrophic series of events. The vagrant in question is in fact John Rambo, congressional medal of honour winner and Vietnam war hero. Responding to the harassment of his captors with sudden ferociousness, Rambo makes a daring escape from the small time jail, steals a motorcycle and roars off to the shelter of the nearby mountains. As the manhunt begins Rambo is in his element preparing himself for a ONE MAN WAR.This film stars: Sylvester Stallone, Richard Crenna &amp; Brian Dennehy. In my opinion this is a class film, Stallone is an absolutely fantastic actor(one of the best) and in this film Brian Dennehy was also fantastic in this film. I highly recommend this film to all you Stallone fans.****/***** Very Good film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John J. Rambo is a Vietnam veteran, medal of honor winner and last survivor of his group. Back in a small town in the USA he finds himself an enemy in his own land. Cornered by local police who hunt him down, while he hunts them. Little do they know they're hunting the hunter and messing with the wrong man who is ready to start a one man war. This film was originally going to follow the novel and have Rambo killed by Trautman, the man who created him, trained him and led him into Vietnam as he becomes too savage to co-exist in the normal everyday life of society. This version was going to star Kirk Douglas as Trautman who kills Rambo. However, in the end the producers decided to have Rambo live to fight another day. As Rambo says himself, "Nothing is over, nothing!"This film was the first major success of the film producers Vajna &amp; Kassar and the Carolco company. They went on to produce the Rambo sequels, Red Heat, Lock Up, Total Recall, Terminator 2, Universal Soldier, Basic Instinct and Cliffhanger. The best of the 80's action hero's were influenced by the Rambo character and First Blood stands head above shoulders above the rest as the best and most original story. A very enjoyable action flick that kick started the 80's action revolution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Such a well made film, and yes Stallone was great in it. I think he set a new standard for action stars from that time forward.Even though Hollywood did make sequels, this film still feels like it stands on its own, and maybe should have.Unlike the next two Rambo films that follow, this film has a more realistic and heart felt feel to it. The character is forced into a defensive situation to no real fault of his own. The final scene where Rambo breaks down and recalls violent tragedies while in war gives the audience a sense of how hard it must have been to return from Vietnam to civilian life.One of Stallones best movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The OTHER Rocky.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey, all you skatepunks and facebookers and under-30 neo-hippies: you know that word "Rambo" that you toss around to describe tough guys? It's an unquestioned part of modern English vernacular: you use it as sarcasm, insult or deflective compliment; newscasters use it to sprinkle their reports with humor; sociologists use it to identify unnecessary brutality; the word is in the Oxford English Dictionary, fer chrissakes! Rambo. This is where that word came from - FIRST BLOOD.It didn't originate with any of those misnamed sequels sporting the "Rambo" dog tag. It originated in a novel by David Morrell (First Blood, 1972), subsequently made into this effective, primal, unlikely hit.FIRST BLOOD would not only augment Sylvester Stallone's existing tough-guy career (by this film's release, he was already up to ROCKY III), it was a tectonic cultural ground slam, spawning the sequels that would bear the "Rambo" moniker and entrench the archetype in world consciousness. "Rambo" virtually wiped out the other metaphors for tough guys: Hercules and Tarzan.Viet Nam is over. A bedraggled ex-Special Forces operative, John Rambo, (Stallone) tramps into a hick American town, searching for long-dead friends and a hot meal. The antagonistic sheriff, Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) wants Rambo to keep walkin.' When Rambo refuses, Teasle (that name just kills me!) hauls him to jail, where all the small-town redneck officers (including Bill McKinney and David Caruso) beat, berate and bully the compliant Rambo to his breaking point.And then all Italian Stallion breaks loose.It is established that Rambo is a "war hero" (whatever that means - maybe that he has big muscles) and the movie is a slight nod to post-war trauma and the difficulty in assimilating back into society - especially redneck Amuuurican society that is the least likely to accept you, that you are most apt to have come from. But that theme will only surface towards the end, when Rambo gives his Grand Soliloquy. For the most part, FIRST BLOOD is an adrenalin punch in the face, appealing to our primal revenge instincts.Escaping the police station, Rambo flees into the forest, Teasle on his tail (I kill me!) and the whole sheriff's department as posse. Like a baleful wolf blending into the forest, Rambo stalks the namby-pamby officers, putting them out of commission one by one. And as surprising as it may sound, Rambo actually "kills" no one! Though this movie has a violent reputation (garnered in retrospect by its sequels), in FIRST BLOOD, only one officer falls from a helicopter and dies accidentally. Body count: 1! This sends Teasle into revenge mode - even though he was the one who started the conflict by provoking Rambo. The story ignites our sense of perverted Justice very well indeed. We're on Rambo's side from minute one.I'm sure David Morell did not intend to rip off CHATO'S LAND (1972) - Bronson's Apache picking off his white pursuers one by one - but that is the brutal template FIRST BLOOD is fashioned on. The hunted becoming the hunter.After Rambo puts his infamous gigantic hunting knife to Teasle's throat and warns, "Don't push it...or I'll give you a war you won't believe!" - the military are called in. Hoo-rah! With them comes Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna), who was Rambo's trainer, therefore someone who can presumably hit Rambo's PAUSE button. Unfortunately, Trautman can only talk in clichés and dynamic one-liners that involve doing a camera-turn before he exits the room; he overacts so much that five extras got their SAG cards.Trautman can't do much with Rambo over the walkie-talkie, except cause more flashbacks for him. Rambo maintains to Trautman that he didn't start this fracas - that "they drew first blood!" After destroying the whole town, Rambo comes face to face with his beloved commanding officer and cries like a baby. He's trying to fit in - he says - but the society that he fought to preserve refuses to conform to his new PTSD lifestyle. Oh, so it's OUR fault the military trained the humanity out of you and lied to you that you could one day return to humanity psychologically unscathed...You gotta respect Stallone for his business acumen, and how he turned two shallow movie characters into worldwide phenomena. But it was here, in FIRST BLOOD, where we also realized what a grand orator Stallone is, when he gives an impassioned monologue in the finale, on the death of innocence, that went something like this: "Nothing is over! Nothing! Yucan swish it oohh Wozen my Waar I didn't ask you And the Wooma Gooma maggots protesting and the Waahoouy baby murderer code of honor! You wash my back, l wash yours! Heahh, there's nothing! All dese gray guys Chevy Convertible we wanna drive until the tires fell off And the Woouy Mogam Oosh body parts flying everywhere! Ouuuy l wanna go home, Johnny!

		<shortDescription>A dignified intro to an increasingly mindless action quadrilogy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Rambo wasn't born a franchise, he was initially just a Vietnam veteran back in the United States, faced by a country that didn't seem to welcome his sacrifice for his nation or appreciate the lengths he went to protect their way of life.John Rambo was insecure and eager to please, to be reintegrated back into society. Accepted. Struck with the realisation that many of his returned vets have already died, Rambo is headed North on foot when he arrives at the outskirts of a town called Hope.And this is where 4 movies chock full of cinematic violence really start.The local Sheriff is named Will (Brian Dennehy), he spots what appears to him as a long haired troublemaker wandering into his town and immediately offers him a lift.The other way.This over-zealous act isn't appreciated by Rambo, who immediately turns back and starts to trudge back towards hope, Will takes this as personally and immediately takes him into custody to teach this unkempt loner a lesson.Now mere unpleasant treatment rapidly takes a turn for the worse when a couple of cops with something to prove start seeing Rambo as a personal challenge, deciding that breaking his will should somehow teach him a lesson. Not even the obvious scars that cover this quiet man's body alter their misguided mindset.But then the mistreatment triggers some 'Nam flashbacks in Rambo's fragile brain, and his years of combat training and instinct kicks into gear. Rambo escapes in a whirlwind of physical violence and hightails it to the mountains near town, where heavy bush should provide him with sanctuary. Will though has now officially lost the plot and summons the entire force of about half a dozen (it's a small town remember?) to what essentially equates to a 'good ole boy' hunt.Things again escalate when Rambo reacts negatively (but understandably) to being shot at not once, but twice, the second such incident leading to the unfortunate death of his primary tormentor from earlier in the day.The tone of the hunt becomes decidedly less jovial and from this point on Rambo reverts to the 'old' ways? The final hour or so sees the genesis of certain recurring plot elements that become more and more familiar to action fans ? not always Rambo films either ? the army gets involved and the lone man is significantly outnumbered and seemingly at the mercy of the elements with a big storm coming in.Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna) appears midway through the film as something resembling Rambo's publicist. He is the guy who pops up in each and every film that warns anyone dumb enough to not know yet (including the audience) of what to expect, reeling off Rambo's credentials before ending with a carefully chosen brief one-liner that removes all doubt as to his intent? I think in this film it was "God would have mercy. He won't." In later films he made sure to include Rambo's name, it must've looked better on the promotional materials. First Blood is actually a superior film to all of the sequels even if it perhaps didn't garner the box-office or teen audience. It is pretty well acted, very fast paced (for the 80s anyway) and boasted an exceptionally strong low key soundtrack. The violence is also mis-remembered, by my count only one fatality in the entire film ? but before we think it is a Care Bears type film it would be fair to say that many men would be limping permanently after the credits rolled.Final Rating ? 8 / 10. The first film in the series is actually the most atypical in the bunch (and the best). And if this is too slow and non-violent for you consider it an intro to the guy who will go on to kill hundreds of foreigners in the next three movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have no shortage of esteem for "First Blood" as an action movie. Once it gets rolling, it's off like a speeding train. A lot of that is thanks to Goldsmith's terrific score (a favorite): tense mournful, patriotic. But it's also down to casting. Crenna and Dennehy are electric playing off of each other, with Rambo looming large in absentia. And as for Stallone, well . . . for me, this is some of his best work, full of barley suppressed rage and contempt for abusive authority. You can just feel the guy seethe. When all is said and done, this is a character study, and we don't get to really see that until Stallone's agonized tirade in the movie's closing moments. There's depth to this movie, and Stallone really makes it work. But even as a piece of entertainment, there's more than enough firefights, jungle warfare and explosions to satisfy.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the best in the Rambo Series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ted Kotcheff is the best director, far better that the ones that directed Rambo 2 and Rambo 3. In fact he should have directed 2,3 and 4.Stallone's a stud throughout the film. Showing us his toned, muscular physique. Nice one Sly.Richard Crenna gives us great comedic relief in the film when required. Such as: "he can eat things that can make a billy-goat puke" and "don't forget, if you send that many men, don't forget to send an ample supply of body bags". Brian Dennehy to me is the star of the film. He is also one of the central characters in the film along with Sly. You can literally feel the tension in his character all the way till the end of the film.Full Plot: Rambo is searching for one of his friends from his unit, Delmare Berry and soon learns that he has died from cancer due to Agent Orange exposure. The scene cuts to Rambo entering the small town of Hope on foot. With his long hair and military-style coat, he is quickly spotted by the town's overzealous and paranoid sheriff, Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) who quickly drives Rambo out of town, noting his strong distaste for "drifters." Rambo heads back toward town immediately, to the dismay of Teasle who arrests him.Rambo stands his ground against the officers at the station and is brutalized and harassed by Art Galt (Jack Starrett), the sheriff's cruel head deputy and closest friend. While being processed, Rambo has flashbacks to his time as a prisoner of war. When Galt and two other officers (Chris Mulkey and David Caruso) attempt to dry-shave him with a straight razor, Rambo has a flashback to being tortured in a North Vietnamese P.O.W. Camp back in 1969 and loses control, escaping on instinct using his military training. He fights his way out of the station, assaulting most of the officers, throws a civilian off a motorcycle and steals it and is pursued into the nearby mountains. The deputies are eventually forced to search for Rambo on foot and he climbs down onto a steep cliff to elude capture. After spotting Rambo from a helicopter, Galt blatantly disregards protocol and attempts to shoot him in cold blood. Rambo drops into a mass of trees and cornered, throws a rock at the helicopter in self-defense. The helicopter pitches and Galt falls to his death. Teasle, who did not see Galt's attempt to kill Rambo, vows to avenge his friend's death.Teasle leads his deputies into the woods in an attempt to capture Rambo. The deputies are inexperienced and bicker, particularly after learning over the radio about Rambo's combat experience and status as a war hero. Rambo quickly disables the small, disorganized team using guerrilla tactics and booby traps, severely wounding but not killing the deputies. In the chaos, Rambo isolates and confronts Teasle with a knife to the throat. "Don't push it or I'll give you a war you won't believe. Let it go" he warns before disappearing into the woods. A base camp is assembled near the site and the National Guard is called in. United States Special Forces Colonel Sam Trautman (Richard Crenna) arrives, taking credit for training Rambo. He is surprised to find any of the deputies still alive and warns that it would be safer to let Rambo go and find him after the situation has calmed down. Teasle refuses to give in.Rambo is eventually cornered by the National Guard in a mine entrance. The novice guardsmen fire a M72 LAW rocket at him, collapsing the mine and trapping him inside. They assume Rambo is dead. Unbeknownst to his pursuers, Rambo has escaped into the tunnels of the mine. Rambo finds some old fuel and makes an improvised torch. After wading through waist&#x2011;deep water and fighting off rats, Rambo cleverly uses the flame of the torch (as an indicator of air flow) to find an exit near a main road. Rambo hijacks a passing M135 2? ton cargo truck and returns to town, crashing it into a gas station. He blocks the highway to anyone in pursuit by igniting the spilled fuel. Now armed with an M60 machine gun, Rambo destroys a sporting goods shop and a few other businesses in an attempt to confuse Teasle before making his way to the police station, where Teasle awaits on the roof.Eventually Rambo enters the police station. Teasle spots Rambo and fires at him but misses. Rambo shoots back at Teasle, injuring him. Teasle falls through the roof onto the floor. Rambo steps over him, prepared to kill him. Before Rambo can shoot Teasle, Colonel Trautman appears and tells him that there is no hope of escaping alive. Rambo, now surrounded by the police, rages about the horrors of war and the difficulties he has faced adapting to civilian life; he's tired of being misunderstood, and how in the army he was a war hero but back in America he could not even hold down a steady job. He weeps as he recounts a particularly gruesome story about witnessing his friend dying by having his legs blown off by a booby-trapped shoeshine box. Rambo then turns himself in to Trautman and is arrested. The credits roll as he and Trautman exit the police station.First Blood was released the same year as E.T, Tootsie and Porky's. All the latter films performed better in the Box Office.Films similar to Rambo: Delta force 1,2, Missing In Action1,2,3, Passenger 57,Commando, Zero Tolerance, Sudden Death, Die-hard 1,2,3, True Lies, The Running Man, The Great Escape, The Dirty Dozen, Red Scorpion, Eraser, Universal Soldier, Soldier, Surviving The Game,Sniper 1,2,3,Hard Target,Cyborg,Predator,The Terminator,Day Of The Jackal,Total Recall,Executive Decision and Invasion U.S.A.

		<shortDescription>A spectacular plot. You can cry and laugh at the same time whilst watching "Rambo".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never thought I'd see an action film that would top "The Rock", but from the word go of "First Blood", I was immediately thrown back at the stunning screen writing that Michael Kozoll and Sylvester Stallone (the writers) presented director Ted Kotcheff.We are introduced to John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone), a retired Vietnam veteran from an elite Black Ops team. Within the first ten minutes, weaved in with incredible cinematography, we are already weeping for the character. For the whole 93 minutes, we get to experience an almost heart breaking plot, portraying the cruel attitude of close-knit, isolated American villages to outsiders. What begins as a simple, though awkward encounter between Rambo and a police chief, ends as a private war of emotions and personal grudges. Although this is upsetting, as the majority of audiences will side with Rambo, it's also disturbingly great fun to watch, with the well crafted dialogue and suspense. Watching Rambo execute his survival techniques is exciting, and educational. Sort of an every-boys-dream thing. Amongst all of this ? there is more! Rambo's experiences in Vietnam come back to haunt him, further causing us to understand his situation and sympathise with him, and hating the police forces. Yet despite so much going on, so much meaning, so many messages, it has been cleverly written so we're not overwhelmed by the tons of events. It's cleverly all merged to make it fun to watch! This is one of the cleverest scripts written to date.The characters in this are some of best characters written in the history of action. Although some may describe Sylvester Stallone as wooden, regardless of your personal opinion of the marvellous action actor, I could think of no better person to play the emotionally scared John Rambo that one of the most iconic and revolutionising actors in history. Rambo is so easy to sympathise with, and we naturally enjoy following this marvellous character through the film, learning of his experiences in a very emotional ending. Then we have the heartless police sheriff, Teasle, who is blinded by his hate for Rambo, willing to stop at nothing to catch the veteran dead. To follow, there is the conflict in the police department as one of the officers doesn't agree with Teasle, and to finish there is Rambo's ex-general, caught in between the law, or protecting his old friend. Amongst others, a fine serving of well developed, believable characters who all have good points to make, is dished up for us.Director Ted Kotcheff wanted nothing but perfection from this magical masterpiece, and that's exactly what he got. With minimal special effects, Kotcheff directed the cast and crew to present a brilliant and effective film, with an explosive ending.Need I go on? It's filled with explosions, suspense, emotions. There are scenes which make us cry, laugh, feel anger, and cheer at the screen. This makes the perfect movie to watch whenever. Many-a-time have I seen this movie, and I never get bored of it. Perfection. This is how films should be. You have not lived until you have seen this film.</fullReview>

I will point out many of the things that I liked about the film.The music composed by the excellent Jerry Goldsmith was once again well done. I enjoyed listening to the music that he composed for this film.I think as always, Sylvestor Stallone does a great job of acting out a tough, rough war hero taking on over 200 men.And the storyline is perfect for a guy who has just come out of hell. Besides the shooting scenes I enjoyed the quick knife attacks/deaths and the beat up in the jail was excellent too.10/10 :D</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 80's was the decade for action movies. We had Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, Beverly Hills Cop, and now Rambo. Rambo does not have that much action but it certainly does tell a great story.This is about a Vietnam War vet who is trying to find old friends of his. When he refuses to leave a town, he is thrown in jail where he was abused. He eventually escapes and he has to dodge the sheriffs who are after him.Sylvester Stallone is a very good actor that no one gives him credit for. I loved him in Rocky, this series, the recent Expendables, and even Spy Kids 3.This is a great film from the eighties. Jerry Goldsmith created a legendary score. The cinematography was awesome.

		<fullReview>First Blood, the first of an almost legendary legendary series of films. This is my first IMDb review so it my not be well worded, but i'll try my best. It is basically the story of a man who is mistreated by a small town sheriff. Rambo starts of as a fairly nice guy, but a scarred one. He is going to live with an old friend but finds this man to be dead. So he goes to a small town where the cop mistreats him. The main thing that sets this apart from the other Rambo films is he is reluctant to kill. Also Rambo is not a "hero" or an "anti-hero," but an angry guy who was again, treated unfairly. All and all a great movie.10/10 Probably #6 in my top 10 favorite movies.</fullReview>

Like Rocky people immediately think the Rambo films as over the top action films. The 3 sequels that followed were like that, but this first one is an action film, but dosen't go so far as to be over the top like a lot of other Stallone films. In fact there is a lot of drama in this movie as well. Stallone co-writes and stars as a Vietnam veteran named John Rambo who has just come home from the war. He finds out that all his friends from Vietnam are dead. He walks into a small town and gets into a fight with a police officer and put in jail. He breaks out and goes on the run. It starts out like a small feud and then comes in a way a small war with the entire police chasing this one guy. This movie is completely different than what you expect. In a way the character of Rambo is sort of an anti hero. Stallone doesn't speak too much suprisily. Despite not being as good as Rocky I think this is Stallone's best performance ever and he gives one of the most dramatic monolouges i have ever heard in a film. This is a good movie and one of the best action films of the 1980's. Overall a good film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie remains to be one of my favorite movies of all time for several reasons. It's an emotional, gripping, thrilling tale of a Vietnam veteran who comes 'home' to nothing and finds another war on his hands. He gets treated poorly by the local police squad and is forced to act out against them. It was at first shocking to see the way they were treating Rambo, especially because they knew that he had gone through so much from Vietnam. Sylvester Stallone is brilliant and gives Rambo this well known face and personality. In my opinion, he should have been nominated for an Oscar. This movie greatly surpasses the sequels and the most recent release. I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sylvester Stallone shines.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First Blood tells the story of a man trained to kill who like so many returning soldiers is unable to adjust to the day to day sameness of everyday life.I realize people see what they want to see but I didn't find this movie overly patriotic or jingoistic. You could actually make a case that it is anti-war because it was one of the first movies of the 80's to tell of the difficulty of returning to civilian life by those who have been in a war zone.John Rambo simply wants to find something to eat but is out of place in a rural NorthWestern town with his military jacket and long stringy hair. The rest of the movie deals with his dealings with the town's provincial sheriff &amp; his men.Sylvester Stallone shines here as he gets to show his acting chops and is able to bring depth &amp; soul to the Rambo character. He's not just a killing machine as others have said. Spoilers Ahead. As a matter of fact he doesn't actually kill anybody in the entire movie but for those of you who like action &amp; explosions there is plenty of that here for you. A solid 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that gave birth to the greatest war hero ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film that started the movie franchise that is Rambo. Although this film isn't necessarily an action film, it still has some decent action in it, and has plenty of potential for future action films. This film is more of an emotional drama, that being said, it's still entertaining as crap, and definitely worth checking out.John Rambo, (Sylvester Stallone) is a former Vietnam Green Beret who returns to the states to find that all his friends from the war have died. He stumbles into a small Washington community, where a sheriff busts his butt and sends him out of the town. Rambo gets ticked off and confronts the cop. After getting unfairly arrested and physically abused at the station, he escapes into the forest where he's hunted down by the police force and the National Guard, using his Vietnam survival skills at his wits against them. As the plot forms, it officially continues when Rambo's colonel from the war, Colonel Trautmen, shows up and offers to help catch Rambo under the condition that he's released all the charges, and leaves with him.The film is pretty much Rambo on the run, that being said, it progresses rapidly, and never really gets slow. You're always rooting for Rambo to get the upper hand, which makes it feel great when he takes advantage of the situation. The action scenes are small and rare, but again, not really an action film, and it still manages to entertain the audience. The study of the Rambo character is explained through Trautmen, explaining what makes him so persistent.One thing I might say is that the story doesn't really go anywhere new, most of it is just him being chased by the National Guard. The cause of the story is great. Rambo is irritated by the cop for mistreating him simply because he's a soldier, which a lot of soldiers experienced at that time, but after the abuse at the station and him escaping, it's basically an adventure/action film with not as much action.It's still a very entertaining film, not high in the action but definitely a very interesting character study, focusing on the true terror and impact that the war had on soldiers. If you're looking for more action, the next film in the franchise will have that for you, if you're looking for the better film, look no further.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A underrated 80s action flick which is clearly better than the sequels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Rambo film before he became known as a one man army as shown in the sequels, Sylvester Stallone plays John Rambo who is a Vietnam veteran who gets pushed too far by a deputy sheriff who hates drifters coming into the small town. Rambo gets into trouble by not doing as he says and gets arrested, he was forced to have a shave but the knife used for shaving reminded him of the torture and pain that occurred in the war camps of Vietnam so he pushed his way out of the police station and went to the woods to hide with the cops following him in there. A fun underrated action flick which is clearly better than the sequels which I love too but not as good. Before Stallone accepted the role as John Rambo, the role nearly went to Steve McQueen (who really wanted to play Rambo), Clint Eastwood, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino (who nearly got the role but turned down because he wanted him to be psychotic), Michael Douglas and Dustin Hoffman. Luckily, Stallone got the role and became another big known character of his along with Rocky and Cobra.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best stories ever written</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First Blood is a flawless action thriller. And the great success of film also comes from the plot, exciting. Rambo is not cup of tea of critics, but they must be fair and candid. I don't know exactly why, but may be they suppose to be intellectual, so they suppose to like intellectual movies. You know, according to critics, every movie is ideological, carries political or social messages and they are interested in messages, not movies itself. First Blood has a very engrossing and exciting plot. As I know, the first single army movie is this one. I have seen the movie since my childhood more than 30 times approx. and every time I excited, enjoyed as if watching it for the first time. This is the best one in the series. Each time, I wanted to enter the screen and tell the sheriff let him go! Sylvester Stallone is like he was made for Rambo (and yes Rocky too) and his acting, performance is outstanding, yes, he is not one of the best actors of all time, but. By the way, as I learned, Kirk Douglas who would have played Trautman left the set so that Rambo does not die at the end of the movie. Well, I like Kirk Douglas very much, but this news made me frustrated. And critics agree with him, don't they? They hate Rambo, so they don't want to (have to) watch him more. As for Trautman, it is like he was made for this role too. There are some unforgettable moments. For example the scene that Rambo sutures his wound himself. The jump scene is unrealistic, but no problem. Direction is stylish and no flaw. The final was touching, very effective and different from other action movies, thrillers. And if there is one more thing legendary, it is musics. This is talent! First Blood is about a war veteran who comes to a town in order to eat somethings, but a sheriff does not like him with no reason and does not let him go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starring the one and only Sylvester Stallone, "First Blood" introduces the world to the legendary action hero John Rambo, in the first of four confusingly titled films. Directed by Ted Kotcheff ("Weekend at Bernie's") and co-starring Brian Dennehy, Richard Crenna and a young David Caruso, the film is as notorious for its extensive action scenes as it is for the intense and iconic performance put forth by Stallone, who is also credited for writing the screenplay.Ex-Green Beret and Vietnam War veteran John Rambo is passing through a small town after learning of the death of a member of his unit, and all he wants is something to eat. The local sheriff (Dennehy) doesn't take too kindly to him, however, and after he breaks out of jail, a strong disagreement turns into a full-scale war, with Rambo at odds against the town's police force. Not only does he make a fool of the sheriff, but in his wake, leaves a trail of destruction all on his own that only serves to match the amount of rage and alienation built up inside of him.Despite laying the violence on a bit thick, the film never cheapens or lowers itself to average action-filler. At the heart of it, it's a story about a man's mental disintegration following a failed attempt at re-entering society. Stallone's speech during his breakdown towards the end of the film not only shows significant range for the actor, but also marks a rare occurrence where an action film attempts to address a painful but all too true reality. "Rambo" is not only a great action film, but a gritty and raw one that feels real and human at the same time. Action films just don't get better than this, although the three sequels that followed sure did try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heavy spoilers ahead.You might know John J. Rambo as the muscular dude with the bandana who suffers from chronic Arthritis in his index finger, thus creating a never-ending trail of mutilated bodies, widows and orphans, which gave rise to the use of the word "rambo" for a violent person and the treatment of the character as a modern monster (I have a book about movie monsters that has an entry on him). Now I don't know about the 3 sequels, I only recently watched the first movie, but this reputation must sure come from the follow-ups. In the first movie, Rambo doesn't even kill any PERSON. He only throws a stone at a helicopter causing a jerk-face police-officer to fall out to his death who tried to shoot him unnecessarily because Johnny had roughed up his sorry butt a bit before. Then again, Rambo has to kill 3 unfortunate search dogs who are sent to assault him. The only trail he leaves behind is that of wounded police butt-faces and destroyed buildings (seriously, he blows up a gas station, a weapon supply store, destroys a convenience store and a police station; all, except maybe the police station, for, I'd say, reasons I do not understand). The best scenes are the one where the police officers try to find Rambo in the woods and he takes 'em out one by one (look out for David Caruso as a whiny cop who gets stabbed in the leg - awesome). The ending, which displeased Roger Ebert, as I read, is awesome, too.All in all, this movie is a psychological masterpiece: a rejected Vietnam-vet on a hike through the States goes nuts when he is abused by policemen in a small, snobby mountain town and keeps seeing flashbacks of Nam when he was a prisoner of war. He makes a stand against the police force and the National guard, only aided by his former superior Colonel Trautman.One of the greatest movies ever.PS: You couldn't ever discover Rambo in the woods even if he were doing the twist in front of your sorry nose...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"First Blood" is the kind of picture I like to come back to from time to time, one that doesn't wear out it's welcome with repeat viewings. It comes at you from some sort of primal level, from that area within that makes you want to lash out at dimwitted neanderthals that only judge a book by it's cover, and not by it's content. The kind of film that examines bigotry and narrow small-mindedness, and then proceeds to exact it's revenge on all the conventional arbiters of power that reside in a single individual who deems himself the lone authority on right and wrong.I must say, Brian Dennehy does a splendid job of portraying that kind of character I love to hate. It's there in his mannerism, his speech, the condescending way in which he looks at others unlike himself. Then, when faced with the consequences of his own actions (deputy Galt's fall from the helicopter), he ratchets up the tempo instead of recognizing his error. One failure leads to another, and then another, until the snowball effect destroys an entire town. And then when it's all over, there's no recognition on the part of John Law that this could all have been avoided with a little more discretion and a lot more tact.Sylvester Stallone has come under a lot of heat for portraying seemingly one dimensional characters like Rocky and Rambo, but his pictures have a way of hitting you where you live. For dedication to his craft he's come under fire for being simple minded and formulaic. Maybe that says more about the critics than about an audience that finds Stallone's characters to be average Americans who want to be left alone to pursue their own goals and ambitions without interference by self important arbiters of authority. I'm sure there's some sort of political corollary in there about where we are as a country today, but I don't want to go there in a movie review. At least not today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, here we have John Rambo. He is a Vietnam war veteran and is going to meet his war buddy. Unfortunately, he finds out that he has passed away. So he goes to a nearby town where a local policeman questions him and ends up taking him to the station. This is where everything starts. Rambo remembers the horrors of the war he went through while he is being messed around with in the station and goes on a destruction rampage.This movie is executed beautifully. The action, the drama, the message, it's all there. We actually feel for our hero because of all he's gone through, especially after his outburst in the end. It shows what a war can do to a person.There might be a few silly moments in the movie but all is forgiven thanks to the aforementioned positive points.First Blood is not a shoot em up like it's sequels. This is a classic action movie and must not be missed by any fan of the genre. It is also by far the best in the Rambo series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good Vietnam movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sylvester Stallone has by many been seen as a brute or muscles without brains because of the movies he has made. In particular the Rambo or First Blood series has given him this reputation. Also the entire First Blood series has, due to the sequels to the one in question, been seen as over the top, right wing propaganda, that shows the world exactly what happens when you mess with the United States of America...you get your ass kicked by relentless killing machines such as John Rambo.Nothing could be further from the truth, and the original story of First Blood has a much deeper element than violence for the sake of violence.The main character John Rambo is a former Green Beret, who, after having served in the Vietnam War, returns to America and finds it difficult to reenter society. He becomes a drifter who still carries his duffel bag from the army in which he has all his possessions. When entering a small mountain town he is approached by the town Sheriff Teasle (Brian Dennehy) who takes one look at him and decides that he is bad news. Rambo is escorted out of town, but decides to go back into town, despite Teasle's warnings, because he is exhausted, hungry and refusing to be bullied around. Rambo is arrested and tortured in the holding cell by some idiot deputies and escapes into the mountains having maimed all of the deputies.Rambo's next goal is to stay alive and the only way he can do this is by reentering the role of the soldier, the killer, whom he has tried so long to discard. This is basically the whole message of the movie. How society deals with those who have done nothing but answer their nations call to arms, and then find that all they have done gets marginalized and ignored. First blood is a very good Vietnam movie in the lines of Deer Hunter and Jackknife because it shows the problems that come along with having seen and done unfathomable deeds on the order of the establishment and then finding the same establishment unwilling to commemorate these actions.What is in fact the most amazing about this movie is the level of intensity with which Stallone conveys the emotions of this battle weary man. Stallone proves with this that he is one of the best actors of his generation and the scene in the demolished sheriff's office where he finally succumbs to the emotional strain of what happened in Vienam, and as a result suffers a complete mental breakdown, is painstakingly beautiful to watch, because it is so real and authentic. First Blood is a must see film as it both has some great acting, but also because it is a window into a time of recession and collective amnesia towards a dark period of American history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know it is something kind of funny, to say about a movie which is more than 25 years old, but It is my first time seeing it for in -may be- 20 years.. When I was a kid, Rambo knife was so famous that almost everybody has a similar one as if they were all going hunting every day, and we, children used to love wearing head bands like Rambo's.. And last week, I had bought the DVD box set since it was on sale, for having some nostalgia. I watched it and I loved it. The movie was not about just a war machine who we loved when we were children, it was about a troubled man mutilated by the memories of war..And the ending was so good! Stallone shocked me with the great performance. I must have seen most of his works but never witnessed like this one -and I don't even remember a word of the scene from the past, being a child is something like that :)-.It was a great experience to see "First Blood" as an adult,too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was the one that inspired all action movies to follow. Everything until the Matrix was in one way or another inspired by First Blood. The characters are brilliantly portrayed, Stallone is seriously good. The movie is 95% action, and the other 5% is very touching drama. It's a message mostly lost on audiences who aren't American, but the humanity of the story is there for all. Trautman is an oxy moron - you either love him or loath him. Personally, the cheese factor of "I didn't come to rescue Rambo from you. I came here to rescue you from him" makes me smile and makes me very happy. I love him. I wish I was that cool. And Rambo is under his thumb! He's like the master puppeteer! Brilliant. Put plainly, no respected movie lover would miss this. It's a masterpiece. There are many criticisms the people could pull out of it, but to do so would miss the point. The end scene with Rambo's speech is magnificent. Stallone is magnificent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High Noon for the Reagan Era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To his Mum he's John, to his Dad simply J, but to the rest of us, this one man fighting machine is known only as... Rambo. Based on David Morrell's Novel, and directed by Ted Kotcheff, First Blood sees Rambo back from Vietnam and searching; searching for answers. Rambo has become a vagabond, a Green Beret in a country that doesn't care and doesn't want him there.First Blood is Kotcheff's Reaganite response to High Noon, just as Rio Bravo was for Howard Hawks, only this time we have moved forward 30 years and small town America isn't like it use to be. Brian Dennehy stars as the Sheriff Will Teasle, hell bent on keeping the peace, being Gary Cooper. But this is post Vietnam, Reagan era film making, the establishment can no longer be Gary Cooper, the Establishment turned into Lee Van Cleef. Rambo is the one man army, he doesn't want to kill, he doesn't want to be pushed around, he just wants to eat. But the Sheriff and his establishment soon find out what happens when you stop a wild animal from eating and this is where Rambo replaces small town America for Small town Vietnam. After some one-sided scuffles we realise the Establishment can't handle the starving beast, the beast who seeks peace. So an unwanted visitor arrives, promises to help, knows Rambo inside out, taught him everything he knows, can put the beast back on the straight -and-narrow, in comes Colonel Samuel Trautman; but in classic fashion they don't want to listen to Uncle Sam, small town Vietnam can handle their own problems and small town Vietnam want to handle their own problems. The small town forgot it was Uncle Sam who created Rambo and its Uncle Sam who must stop Rambo.First Blood is action, it's gung ho, it's sentimental and at times it's absurd but it is Rambo at his best. Before Afghanistan and Burma, before the pen was truly replaced by the sword and Rambo became invincible, First Blood is a great tonic to these heady times. Sit back, enjoy and watch Uncle Sam control his beast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The dangerous and unstable war vet makes for a great action movie focus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept of war in their own backyard is a foreign one to most Americans. With two tragic exceptions, no blood has been shed on American soil in wartime since the Civil War. "First Blood" is a thrilling fantasy in that regard, turning the Pacific Northwest into the Vietnam jungle and introducing a character so deadly and skilled yet so mentally unstable that he manages to elicit both sympathy and total fear.John J. Rambo (Stallone) is a dangerous case of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder drifting his way toward Portland after learning that no one who survived Vietnam from his unit is still alive. At first he's quiet and complicit -- a perfect role for Stallone -- but when he starts getting lip from a small-town sheriff (Brian Dennehy) who arrests him out of pure dislike, his abuse by the police awakens painful memories and he violently escapes, using the wilderness as a hideout from the relentless and prideful sheriff, declaring "war" when they draw first blood.Stallone creates his second iconic character in Rambo, a role fitting for his limited acting range: He must either say nothing, be violent or act completely insane. Still, the character is cool, intimidating and his unfair treatment in the film manages to win our support and sympathy. He is terribly misunderstood and completely dangerous; an exciting combination for a main character."First Blood" is not a great example of suspenseful and exciting film-making, but Rambo's raw, untamed survivor-man appearance and the fact that at some point in the film you know he's bound to go berserk, keeps the film interesting. That and the fact that the colonel who trained Rambo (Richard Crenny) keeps dropping these giddy one-liners such as "I didn't come here to rescue Rambo from you, I came here to rescue you from him." The acting is mostly sub-par, with even a young David Caruso giving some of the worst and most awkward line deliveries I've ever seen. Dennehy is good but his character is so completely stubborn and ignorant that he hardly counts. Regardless, the acting does nothing to enhance the movie -- it's success is all about a great, simple concept.Rambo is completely uncomplicated, not even delving into Rambo's Vietnam experience other than a few quick flashbacks and his one monologue to Colonel Trautman. It could have made the film better, but a dangerous war vet taking out small-town American cops when it wasn't even his fault is genius fodder for an action movie and even some food for thought.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite some controversy in the middle of his career, Sylvester Stallone most definitely began his fame with two of the most memorable and iconic films of all times which not only started a series of sequels, parodies, and rip-offs but created characters and role models for movie-goers. The first was 1976's Best Picture-winner "Rocky" (1976). The other was "First Blood". And while the former is the better of the two, "First Blood" and the Stallone character of John Rambo is undoubtedly more famous, more influential, and more sympathetic and respectable.I should revise that. I'll say that Rambo, from the very first film, was an icon. When the first sequel, "Rambo: First Blood Part II" came out in '85, Rambo was transformed into an icon unworthy of such fame because it was all blood and guts, needless killing and violence and no story. Yes, in a way, that also applies to 2008's "Rambo", even though I did like the fourth film. But still, there is really only one really great film to the four-part saga and that, naturally, is the first one."First Blood" is based on a 1970s novel of the same named by David Morrell. A book I highly recommend for readers. Like many, I saw the film before I read the book and I will say this to anybody in the same position as me: read the book, but prepare to be surprised. After the opening third of the story, and a few similar scenes, there is no resemblance and the overall way we perceive the two?and their characters?is vastly different. And this is the rare case where the movie is actually better than the book.For those not familiar with the story, "First Blood" revolves around a Vietnam veteran named John Rambo, who after being unfairly treated and discriminated by the local police force, who have arrested him for vagrancy, unleashes his rage, escapes into the woods, and after inadvertently causing a police officer's death, becomes the target of a massive manhunt led by the enraged sheriff played magnificently by Brian Dennehy. Rambo's former commander, played in another famous performance by the late Richard Crenna, arrives in hopes of saving lives. But it's not Rambo whom he wants to save. It's anybody who stands in Rambo's way.Like "Die Hard" (1988) and "Commando" (1985), "First Blood" is the classic one-man army scenario, but unlike many of its mimickers, manages to blend the spectacular and jaw-dropping scenes with a story and characters and a moral message. And it's because of these last two items especially that the movie overpowers the book.The characters are vastly improved from David Morrell's original text. In the original book, Rambo was a personification of the evil of Vietnam: a killing machine that took joy in causing pain and suffering and caused vast amounts of it. Stallone's interpretation is a far more sympathetic and human version: a tortured soul in a nation that no longer wants him, improperly treated and far less lethal. In the film, Rambo kills nobody directly and although he is shown at times to be brutal, is also merciful. And at the end, we see how truly torn-apart he is by his experiences in the war. Also, I liked how the character of Teasle (Brian Dennehy) was changed to serve as a better antagonist and have fewer subplots which I felt only got in the way in the novel. And more importantly are the changes made to Col. Sam Trautman (Richard Crenna) who in the film plays a father figure to Rambo and the only sign of friendship the veteran has left while in the novel, there was no real relation and I often questioned what exactly was Trautman's purpose in the story. Don't get me wrong. The book is good and so are the characters. But in the film, it's just a lot better.Returning to the character of Rambo, I want to focus a little more on the film's vague, but nevertheless powerful allegorical message about the veterans of Vietnam, the torture they went through, and the hatred they were "rewarded" with by their people when they returned. "First Blood", unlike its sequels, shows this. Not with as much authority and tear-jerking power as say "The Deer Hunter" (1978), but still powerful when we see a rather meek and humble sympathetic figure come out of this never-say-die, unstoppable one-man army, who unlike his novel counterpart, is weakened by his country's sudden and unforgivable conduct against him.But of course, there is in "First Blood" was people want from it: action. Lots and lots of action in this well-crafted story. Aided by a great music score I believe by Jerry Fielding, the film presents oftentimes implausible actions scenes that nonetheless put a lot of grit and punch behind themselves. But what works, at least for me, in this magnificent film are the characters. Not for their icon status, but because of the way they are molded into three-dimensional human beings instead of stock characters with only a lot of macho to hold themselves up. And the allegory, while not as efficacious as it could have been, is leveled at just the right point because that's the kind of film this is. It's not meant to be heart-stopping in its intensity or tear-jerking in its symbolism. But an effective blend of entertainment and sympathy. And it works.</fullReview>

Stalone is amazing in the fact he is peak physical condition acting a role that really suits him. Easy watching for me - My wife hated it on release and still does so there is no more a truer saying in that " We are not all the same " especially when it come to our different tastes.I like this movie - Give it a go again or if you have not seen it, its dated but OK to watch, its not a waste of time. Not a fan of the rest of the Rambo's though.It was good to see a very young David Caruso. He has definitely has come on with age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Blood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This impressive action classic is a pared-down, bare-bones affair. There isn't a frame wasted, and the result is a visceral, exciting suspense thriller and one of Sylvester Stallone's best films.His performance is a good one, and he's ably supported by two class acts - a memorably vicious, clueless Sheriff Brian Dennehy and a paternal, wised-up Colonel Richard Crenna - who provide their fair share of the film's considerable tension as they try to hammer out a solution.The direction is solid, keeping things moving at a fast pace, and Jerry Goldsmith does fine work with the score.Significantly more intelligent than the subsequent larger-than-life sequels, First Blood sees Rambo use his brain more often than his muscles, and the script frequently borders on the ingenious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Stallone's best....a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW** First Blood was the beginning of the Rambo franchise, as everyone knows. However, although the Rambo name was later seen on action figures and cartoon shows, and the back end of tireless jokes referring to his weapons and seemingly superhuman abilities; the John Rambo character that was originally introduced to us was complex and intriguing. The message behind First Blood is a familiar, yet engaging one....which made the film great. Very low-key in its approach, it gets straight to the point: Vietnam veteran returns to the country he fought for and loved, only to be looked down upon and chastised. The characters in First Blood take it to another, more despicable level; namely picking on him for no reason and driving him to the point where he snaps (understandably) and wreaks havoc on the town. What I love about First Blood is how realistic it is.... everything that happens is in the realm of possibility; no suspension of disbelief needed here. It's more of a drama than the other two sequels; the pacing is great. Stallone turned in a great performance as the withdrawn, spooked Green Beret vet who just wanted to live a normal life and try (albeit impossible) to forget about his horrific experiences in the war (Vietnam). You can't help but feel sorry for him throughout the movie. He first tries to reach out to the only thing that he knows 'back in the world' (his good friend who he fought with in the war), only to find out that he's since died of cancer. To make matters worse, its suggested that he died from the gases consumed during the war.....even at 'home' Rambo can't get away from the war. With nothing else to turn to he wanders, minding his business when he's pushed by the local police to the point where he snaps and goes on a rampage. The last scene between him and Trautman is beautifully depressing, as Rambo finally breaks down. It's a wonderful story, helped by Stallone's great performance. He was able to balance the killing machine side with the helpless, sensitive side of the character flawlessly. Definitely one of Stallone's best films, a classic in my eyes. ***1/2 out of **** stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You just dont turn it off! A brilliant film ,why is it that most action and horror films from the 80s are always the best.Stallone plays this part truly well ,this film covers areas that at times are quite deep in human emotion,good solid story line, basic but they are the ones that always work the best. Richard Crenna is great, he plays the colonel, serious dude but sarcastic and humorous with his comments towards the police officers that are trying to catch Rambo.If you have not seen the film i will give you a rough idea of the story line.Rambo goes to a small town in America somewhere, to visit an old war buddy, a close friend from Vietnam. He finds out his buddy died, one of the last group members of the elite group. To compose and consume his grief and loss he just carries on walking and eventually ends up in a small town. This is were the local sheriff makes the biggest mistake of his life. He tries to escort rambo out of his small town because he did not like the way he was dressed,following this Rambo was physically and mentally abused by the officers and this is when the story starts to get really good. Wicked film, genuine. The good guys are the bad guys and the hunters become the hunted if you have not seen it buy it and watch it and then watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vietnam vet Sylvester Stallone won't be pushed around by cop Brian Dennehy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"First Blood" is a near perfect action-adventure movie. The special effects and stunts are absolutely outstanding. There are explosions toward the end and machine gunning sequences that look completely real. There's a stunning scene on the granite face of a cliff. There's a sequence in which Stallone moves through an abandoned mine/cave that's simply amazingly done.There are some choice bits of dialog that script writers would die for. Stallone is perfect in the part, and so are Brian Dennehy and Richard Crenna.The movie is probably classified as an exploitation movie because it deals in topical themes, but it rises way above the ordinary exploitation movie. It deals in themes of the psychologically damaged returning Vietnam vets, the vets damaged by chemicals and warfare, the vets cut off from society, society's rejection and abandonment of the war and the vets, vets as heroes, and vets who cannot find anything back home approaching the codes and solidarity in war. It also deals with the killing codes prevalent during the war. This is a tight movie without excess verbiage but one that still manages to address important themes.Besides being an action movie, "First Blood" is an adventure movie because Stallone has to face challenge after challenge and this is analogous to what people face in adventure movies. The difference here is that he's facing both nature and pursuers.Dennehy is outstanding as the hard-nosed sheriff who won't give in, and the depiction of his men covers a wide and interesting range, from the sadist to the ineffective and innocent. Crenna scores as the avuncular leader who trained Stallone as a special forces killer who was the best at what he did.The locations chosen (in British Columbia) are perfect for the story. The cinematography of Andrew Laszlo is faultless.And then there is the ending monologue, of which a snippet: "Nothing is over! Nothing! You just don't turn it off! It wasn't my war! You asked me I didn't ask you! And I did what I had to do to win, for somebody who wouldn't let us win! Then I come back to the world, and I see all those maggots at the airport, protestin' me, spittin', callin' me a baby killer and all kinds of vile crap! Who are they to protest me?! Huh?! Who are they?! Unless they been me and been there and know what the hell they yellin' about!"I'd like to clarify one line of dialog, an important line. Dennehy asks Stallone what he hunts with his knife. Stallone answers rather softly "Name it." This is a foreshadowing that is true. Apparently the original script had the word "Everything". "Name it" is far superior as dialog because Dennehy's actions do the naming, as they cause Stallone to take up the hunt for him. Did Stallone alter this line himself? Whatever, it is a significant improvement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before Rambo turned righteous Reaganista and became a quasi- patriotic icon, he was simply a misunderstood vet trying to readjust to post-muddyblood life. On a similar note, before CSI guy David Caruso was an ice cold, pun-peddling alpha man, he was little more than a Joe Ginger nobody who followed the more blood-thirsty cops into battle. Rambo rolls into a small pacific northwest town with olive skin and a green jacket. The problem is that this town is obviously of German Irish stock and Rambo's look is a little too Mediterranean for these Kraut Paddy cops. Nevertheless, they decide to show Rambo some good ole' northwest hospitality and try to give him a bath at the police station. Unfortunately, Rambo is in no mood for bacon burn. He resents the spa treatment and rams his way out of the pig pen. He does a John Conner and speeds away on a dirt bike only to wipe out when he tries to go up a hill. Then it's off to the woods where nature boy Rambo lays a beatdown on these hicks and Caruso can supply no pun for the violent maelstrom of mud and blood that ensues. The country cops decide that they're gonna hunt Rambi like he's Bambi and things get downright rambunctious and dirty as this veteran shows the tan shirts that he has feelings. Even after politely asking them to "let it go," they decide it's time to call in the big guns. Enter a rabble of trigger happy weekend warriors representing the national guard of lard. And after Rambo goes caveman, these guys are ready to bury him in his new underground dwelling.It's wham, bam, thank you Nam as things go boom, dogs get dead, baby boomer bastards fly out of helicopters and Stallone sews himself a shirt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was a bad time for everyone, Rambo. It's all in the past now.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First Blood is directed by Ted Kotcheff and adapted by Michael Kozoll, William Sackheim and Sylvester Stallone, from the novel written by David Morrell. It stars Stallone, Brian Dennehy, Richard Crenna, Bill McKinney and Jack Starrett. Cinematography is by Andrew Laszlo and the music scored by Jerry Goldsmith. Locations for the shoot were in British Columbia.John Rambo (Stallone), ex Vietnam war veteran, wanders into small town Oregon and is met with hostility by Sheriff Will Teasle (Dennehy). Arrested for a trumped up charge of vagrancy, Rambo is subjected to rough house treatment by Teasle and his staff. Fuelled by the haunted images of his time in Vietnam, Rambo breaks out of custody and makes for the hills, with Teasle and the force in hot pursuit. But this is terrain made for Rambo, an expert soldier trained to survive and kill, it's a war, Rambo versus the rest.The character of John Rambo would slip into pop culture and forever be associated with cartoon excess. By his own admission, Stallone himself felt they dropped the ball after the original film, and he's right. However, First Blood is often wrongly lumped in as part of that excessive package, because it's a film well worthy of revisits to see just how well it holds up as a taut and tense thriller. A film led by the bold theme of showing just how badly some of America's soldiers were received upon returning from Vietnam. First Blood delves deeper into the psyche of one such soldier whilst casting a caustic eye over small town Americana. The makers rarely let up on the troubling thematics at work, developing Rambo with clinical strokes as the plot unfolds, the trick in the tail being that the audience are firmly on his side as he goes about bringing his Vietnam to the picturesque place the locals call home. By 1982, it seems, America was on the side of the soldier.Stallone is a perfect fit for the role, his physicality unquestionable, he brings the brood and pain to Rambo like few actors of his ilk ever could. The sarcastic may point to his lack of dialogue hardly constituting a great acting performance, that's rot, because this is a fine character portrayal by Stallone. Dennehy is on fine form as the brutish bully Sheriff who just couldn't leave Rambo alone, while in the support ranks McKinney and Starrett leave good impressions. The interesting casting comes with Crenna as Rambo's "maker", Col. Samuel Trautman. The role was Kirk Douglas' hook line and sinker, but he wanted a different script and insisted that the film end the same way as the novel. In the end the makers just couldn't give in to his requests and he walked at the last minute. In stepped Crenna to put a bit of father figure pathos into Trautman, and subsequently earning himself a three picture deal and a place in pop culture in the process.It's also a film that's photographed with great skill by Lazlo. He captures the British Columbia mountains and forests with beautiful scope, but in keeping with the tone of the film his colour palette is suitably grey and green. Goldsmith provides an effective score, particularly when the narrative is focusing on Rambo's alienation, while the stunt work is very impressive. Even if we drift away from the theme of the piece, it still works extremely well as an action movie drama, be it motorcycle/helicopter pursuits, or jungle warfare, First Blood pumps the blood frequently. All neatly constructed by the director of Weekend at Bernie's! On release it grabbed the attention and became a monster box office hit Worldwide, today it still stands as a damn great movie, and you know what? Stallone and co were right and Kirk Douglas was wrong. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of Stallone's best films....PERIOD! Why? Well, there are no big, bloated CGI bull in First Blood, they stuck with the gritty, risk-taking, and at times life-threatening realism that I think every good action film needs("Are you listening Jerry Bruckhimer and Michael Bay?")when dealing with cliff jumps and deadly trek in the woods. The characters are bold and actually hold your interest for more than two minutes. First Rambo discovers the last of his old Vietnam combat buddies has died of cancer(from exposure to Agent Orange)and enters an almost autistic state of depression. Then, Rambo is left alone to roam the highways without a direction or a care...until he came into the town of Hope(which is anything but hopefull)The town sheriff William Teasle for reasons unknown kicks him out of Hope. Rambo protests quietly asking why and gets a surly response. Rambo then calmly returns over the town line only to be locked away in a cell while being harassed by Teasle's men especially Galt(who was a brutal monster cop) Eventually, Galt's abuse, Teasle's accusations, shower torture, and etc has brings Rambo's sanity to its breaking point. His psychotic break re-activates his training as a Green Beret in Fort Bragg. Suddenly, he mops the floor with the arresting deputies and escapes into the woods. I have to admit it was the best car chases I've seen in a Stallone movie. But there's more! Once Rambo escapes into the forest his survival skills take over. Now it's cops' turn to beg for mercy. The best part is when our hero sets up a series of booby traps using sticks, stones and a 9-inch Bowie knife. It's non-stop action and suspense, as several officers are stabbed, lynched, and impaled on the said booby traps. The part that had me jumping for joy is when Rambo takes on a helicopter with a rock causing Galt to fall to his death. "Well for someone that was a borderline White Supremacist/Bullying- pig cop from hell he deserved it!" Attacking cops is not advisable, even when they are brutish assh*les. But if you think about it, Rambo is going through the same experience that P.O.W's and minorities go through when encountered by overzealous authority figures which makes the audience(myself included) relate and feel sorry for the guy. You want the protagonist to take on the National Guard and the State Police and Teasle hick-dick department. Normally, the ending of action movies are dull, cheapened, and disappointing. Well, as low-budget as this feature is...First Blood is not one of them. In a thirst for combat and blood-lust he destroys a gas station with a cigarette lighter! Then destroys a sporting goods store with gun powder! Last but not least, Rambo lays waste to the Hope Police Station with an M-60..what a trip, whereas Teasle is shaking in his boots on the roof. In a series of shots Rambo takes him down, not before he comes to his senses in an emotional tirade. You still have feelings for such a person...just destroyed by war. I wish Hollywood still made movies like this, because First Blood did not have hype to sell tickets and DVDs! First Blood did not rely on CGI nonsense! This movie had originality, guts, and a sense of resolution. However, they could put a little more emphasis on why did the Sheriff hold so much animosity towards Rambo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First Blood (AKA Rambo: First Blood, or just plain Rambo) is a fun action movie, and probably one of Stallone's few enjoyable movies of the eighties. It's entertaining and interesting, and generally exciting right up until the end.But I'm sorry, Rambo's final monologue (About ten times the dialogue he speaks in the rest of the movie) is just a load of incoherent drivel. The man just isn't making any sense. I get some of the words, but a lot don't sound like English. I don't know if it was the added effort of trying to act emotional that he lost control of his mouth, but regardless the reason, the scene had none of the emotional impact it should have, and it was mostly his fault. The fact that the Colonel acts shaken (his lip quivers) adds a huge unwanted laugh to a scene that is very unintentionally funny. Still, you have to give the guy credit for acting that moved by a speech that unintelligible.Still, the movie's pretty cool, Stallone's pretty buff (and he really doesn't say more than 3 consecutives words until the end), and the Colonel's character has some real juicy scenes with fun dialogue. Now if we could only get some subtitles during that last speech...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John J. Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is a former Green Beret. He goes to find his Nam buddy Delmar Barry but he's dead from exposure to Agent Orange. That makes him the sole survivor of his team. He walks into the town of Hope, Washington. Sheriff William Teasel (Brian Dennehy) picks up the drifter and drives him out of town telling him to get a haircut. Rambo turns back towards the town and the sheriff arrests him. He flashes back at the cruel treatment as a POW and battles his way out of jail. The manhunt turns deadly when deputy Galt tries to kill Rambo for revenge but instead falls to his death. The manhunt escalates and Rambo's former c.o. Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna) arrives not to rescue Rambo from the cops but rather rescue the cops from Rambo.This starts as a great tense suspenseful drama. Stallone is great as the drifter loner Rambo. He is emotionally damaged. It's a great character. The last act does try to go bigger. I don't think the big action is necessary or particularly fitting. I expected Rambo to stay in the woods. I do like the fact that the climax turns out to be a heart-to-heart with Trautman. It's the most fitting way to bring Rambo in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Warrior</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In First Blood Sylvester Stallone introduced his second enduring screen character John Rambo, Vietnam veteran of the Special Forces. Those hick law enforcement characters from the Pacific Northwest really didn't know who they were messing with. Even though Richard Crenna did try to steer them straight.It all begins innocently enough. Sheriff Brian Dennehy the local law where Sly was traveling through gives him a ride out of town and tells him to keep going. Dennehy just doesn't like Sly's looks, not that he's done anything. All Stallone was there to do was visit a Vietnam War buddy whom he finds out has died from cancer most likely gotten from Agent Orange. Not that it was any of Dennehy's business because Stallone wasn't breaking any laws.But when Dennehy sees him start back to town he then arrests him on the usual charge of vagrancy when they can't think of anything else. But the treatment and disrespect he's shown by the town police brings back memories and he snaps. He injures about six cops breaking jail and Dennehy's hot to get this guy no matter what it costs.The best I can say for the rest of the film is that Sly makes them pay plenty.Richard Crenna was Rambo's colonel in Vietnam tries in vain to tell the local and later the state law just what they're up against. Rambo's been trained in survival and killing techniques with or without weapons. He's a pure warrior and even normal fear has been driven right out of him.For some of us who've had bad experience with the law First Blood was a film we could identify with. Just citizens who get arbitrarily pushed around for one reason or another. I remember wheeling a heavy shopping cart with groceries and laundry on the sidewalk of one of the main thorough fares of my city and a police car just drove right up and blocked my path. When I protested the man in blue threatened to run me in for obstruction of justice. I know exactly how Stallone felt when being pushed around. I suspect many in the theater audiences knew as well. Stallone makes a lot of mayhem in the Pacific Northwest, the location cinematography for First Blood is just great, it can't be anything else in that part of the country. And Sly Stallone introduced an enduring cinema hero in John Rambo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rambo Film with Something to Say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"First Blood" is the neglected episode of the Rambo trilogy, or, as we should now perhaps say following the belated release of a fourth instalment, the Rambo tetralogy. The character was made notorious by episodes 2 and 3, "Rambo re-fights the Vietnam War Single-Handed and Wins" and "Rambo Ignores Détente and Wipes Out the Entire Russian Army Even Though the Cold War is Nearly Over". (Yes, I know those weren't the official titles). So notorious, in fact, that the very name Rambo became synonymous with a sort of aggressive, bloodthirsty kick-ass nationalism.To anyone familiar with the comic-book antics of episodes 2 and 3, episode 1 must come as something of a shock. When we first meet John Rambo he is not a musclebound warrior intent on killing commies for Uncle Sam, but rather a down-on-his-luck Vietnam veteran, an aimless, homeless and jobless drifter who drifts into a small town in the Pacific North-West. The local sheriff, Will Teasle, takes an irrational dislike to him (he seems to harbour a prejudice against the Army) and arrests him on a trumped-up charge of vagrancy. In the police station Rambo is beaten up by Teasle and his officers, which causes him to go berserk, turning on his tormentors and escaping from custody. Most of the rest of the film is taken up with the police's increasingly desperate attempts to recapture Rambo and his equally desperate attempts to fight them off.An important character (who was to reappear in episodes 2 and 3) is Rambo's former commanding officer from Vietnam, Colonel Samuel Trautman. It turns out that Rambo was no ordinary soldier, but a highly-trained member of the elite Green Berets (the regiment eulogised in John Wayne's film of that name) who won numerous decorations for bravery. Trautman wants to be allowed to try to persuade Rambo to surrender peaceably, warning Teasle that his men are taking a huge risk in taking on a man who is capable of killing them all. Teasle refuses to listen, but the more he tries to prove Trautman wrong, the more Rambo seems to prove him right.There is plenty of bloodshed and destruction in this film, but it does not glorify violence in the way that episodes 2 and 3 were to do. Violence is the preferred solution of the mentally unstable Rambo and the arrogant ignoramus Teasle, whereas the wise and honourable old soldier Trautman tries to find a peaceful way out.That is not to say, however, that the film is uncontroversial. Even if it does not glorify violence, it does tend to contribute to the myth of the special forces as superhuman. When Rambo goes on the rampage he seems less like an angry ex-soldier than a deranged Superman, minus the cape and the underpants worn outside the trousers. Even more controversial is the film's attitude to the Vietnam War. A number of other films from this period, such as Scorsese's "Taxi Driver", featured mentally unbalanced Vietnam vets, but "First Blood" does not blame Rambo's mental breakdown on his combat experiences alone. It also blames the North Vietnamese, who tortured him while he was a prisoner, and those elements among the American public who met returning soldiers with indifference or even with outright hostility. (Rambo himself blames the "hippies" who demonstrated against him and his returning comrades at the airport). This position was a controversial one, especially among those who had opposed the war and in some cases had glorified the Communist regime in Vietnam. Such people did not like the idea that they might have been partly to blame for the problems encountered by many veterans in returning to civilian life or that they had wilfully ignored the brutality of the enemy.Despite the controversy, "First Blood" is a film with something thoughtful to say about war, about social attitudes to war, and about the roots of violence in society. Stallone manages to convey something of his character's mental anguish and Richard Crenna does a good job as the voice of reason Trautman. The contrast with the macho heroics of the two sequels is striking. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not many action films actually make you cry but this may be one that does it. Stallone plays one of his greatest roles ever as John Rambo, a Vietnam vet who is mistreated by a police force. The viewer asks immediately why is the police so arrogant? It seems that the police knows what kind of man Rambo is even if it later becomes clear that he didn't know.Since John Rambo cannot live a normal life he starts to fight like he was again in that war. What follows is guns' blaze and screams of dying people - the prize what the people have to pay for destroying Rambo's life that was once like anyone else's life. The army special force soldier is a killing machine and property of the army, he's not a human anymore or so they say to him. Rambo is therefore not actually responsible for the killing and the damage he did, quite paradoxically.Rambo is pure fiction - it's not a story from this universe because it makes too grand generalizations, but it however offers us a viewpoint into differences between soldier's and civilian's values.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John, a Vet, looks for his friend and that is when the trouble begins.He finds his buddy has died a sad death and walks to the town for a little rest.Sheriff Will picks John up and gives him a ride but does not like his haircut or hide! He asks John does he have no pride? Anger, shock, and sadness fill his eyes. Will drops him off at the edge of the town and what do you know? John turns around. The Sheriff sees and makes an arrest and charges him with vagrancy at best.This man gave himself to keep our country free and then treated like this. How could that be? A Green Beret and Medal of Honor winner, looks to me that Sheriff Will is the sinner.Back to the story, we have John now in jail, his big sharp knife taken to no avail. His experiences there remind him of 'Nam, then he decides to drop the bomb. A daring escape is next what happens, took a bike from a kid, went up in the mountains.Now we have Will, with all his men, go to the mountain and let a search begin. John is a man who knows how to survive, sets many traps but keeps them alive. All except one, who goes past the line, shooting from a chopper, neglecting all signs. John, left handed, throws a rock, hits the window...the deputy falls to his death, far below.Will is so mad, all of his men have failed. "Weekend Warriors" are what he brings to prevail. Colonel Trautman also comes in to give a hand, little do they know he is really John's friend. The Colonel's suggestion to Sheriff Will: "A good supply of body bags" cause they will be filled.John is the best! the Colonel says, he knows how to fight with knives, guns and his head! Will ignores this and continues to flow, even John warned him, "Let it go".Finally a soldier lets a rocket fly. All that he says in turn is "Bull's-eye". They thought they had got and blew him away. John just went deep in a cave, he was OK! Using his training, his way out he found and jumped on a truck that was town bound. After the cleanup, the Sheriff, he went home too, to ponder the question, what did he do?John in his truck with an M-60 in the rear, he was ready to bring a world of fear to the Sheriff who was so elite that he harassed a man who just "wanted something to eat".What follows is the destruction of a town and a Sheriff who acted more foolish then a clown. And of a man who was no average Joe, a US soldier, he was Rambo!If you do not like my poem and on it you pee, just remember, "You drew first blood, not me"!Sylvester Stallone plays John J. Rambo, a Vietnam Vet who is way down on his luck. The story is that of survival, revenge, and in the end, redemption. First Blood mainly takes place outdoors and I found that this setting was captured very realistically?you can actually feel the dampness and dirt soak into your clothes as you watch. The action also has a raw and believable nature to it; nothing too over-the-top or stylish. Rambo is serious and brutal in his methods, and he simply takes care of business in a most militant fashion. There is gunfire aplenty though, and quite an exciting chase that pretty much fills up the whole middle of the movie. Then, simply put, Rambo rampages the town! The score is memorably rousing and the acting (Richard Crenna and Brian Dennehy) is excellent. Personally, I could watch First Blood anytime. The book (much more violent) is worthwhile too.</fullReview>

An amazing trilogy ! " FIrst Blood " is the character's damnation phase.I don't wanna explain you the story of this incredible movie.The legend of John Rambo begins in this flick,then it develops in "Rambo :Fb part 2",finally it arrives to the glorious climax in "Rambo 3" . All the three movies were hits. Both "First Blood" and "Rambo 3 " grossed about 55 millions ( "Rambo 3" was a real success in America,despite the fact it was a HUGE HIT only overseas !!!!!!!!),so they both were hits."Rambo :Fb part 2 " grossed 150 at the domestical box-office,it can be considered the headlight of the series. Together they have grossed over 600 millions in the late eighties. (Now,OVER a BILLION) . People loves Rambo.Critics hates Rambo.But nothing can refuse the fact Johnny made history.And not only the movie history. Long life to Johnny !!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget the cheesy sequels, this grimly realistic film is the best of the original trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not content with creating one hugely successful film franchise with the iconic ROCKY series, Stallone joined the burgeoning ranks of '80s Hollywood action stars by bringing the character of Rambo to the screen. Of course, the muscle-bound ex-soldier soon became one of the most famous movie creations of all time, so it's interesting to go and look back at his roots in FIRST BLOOD, an adaptation of a dark action novel by David Morrell. Some things were altered in the transition from book to screen, namely the transformation of Rambo into a good guy instead of a misunderstood anti-hero.Anyway, FIRST BLOOD is a great flick, another fantastic movie made in a very good year for film. When mentioning Rambo, most people think of the two sequels that turned the franchise into a cheesy, over-the-top guns-n-explosives fest along the line of Arnie's COMMANDO. FIRST BLOOD isn't like that ? it contains a modicum of realism, even during the pyrotechnic-heavy climax. It's a thoroughly engaging storyline, about a drifter who finds himself up against a corrupt police force, and it's scarily real ? as each plot twist plays out, you realise that human nature has never been put so well on screen. Stallone is excellent as the psychotic soldier, and he's given great support from the cast which includes a career-best Brian Dennehy, a hammy Richard Crenna, and many others.The plot is packed with suspense and achieves a level of primal fear and tension in the woodland setting, reminding me of the similarly-themed SOUTHERN COMFORT in some places. There are many great moments to enjoy as Rambo tackles a totally hateable enemy ? the corrupt, bigoted small-town mentality of a police department. His initial prison break is the stuff of legend, while the subsequent stalk-and-slash pursuit in the woods is one of the best portrayal of jungle traps and survival I've seen. What also hits home is how sad the story is ? Rambo finally reveals his motivations and reasoning at the climax, and it makes for all-too-real drama. While the fourth film in the series, Rambo, is still my favourite, FIRST BLOOD is nevertheless a fantastic film that's up there with the best and definitely the best of the original trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kind of classic 80's action movie, but.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah, like It as an 80's icon movie, with Sly performing good as the hunted Vietnam vet, who battles more with himself than his opponents. Catched in on cable here in Sweden yesterday, some kind of late night entertainment....Legend actor Steve McQueen were interested in an early script of this in the late 70's, but failed to find enthusiasm from himself and others involved, so the concept disappeared temporarily.The cast is all good and credible. The conservative sheriff of one Brian Dennehy is a character you want to really bark on after appearing only five minutes on screen. (And that's meant as a good rating for B.D.)The development of the movie is kind of strange to me, though. OK. Soldier John Rambo isn't wanted in the town. Go on, then. Hitchhike with a truck and try the next village. But no, be stubborn as hell, feeling huffy and misunderstood. He really got himself to blame for the mess that follows...Brought back to the Police Station, after rejecting departure from the small town, he freaks out and are pressed to an escape, after being violent to some officers. Stealing a motorcycle on the street, a multi-minute chase out of town starts. OK. He doesn't know the environment, but why not stay on the road until a more handy vehicle as a car turns up, or jumping on a passing truck, instead of seeking himself into the wild woods with the bike?Yes, I'm too critical to the script. I know. You can't be that way nowadays to a 34 year old movie. The first half is the best, besides the cliff-jump who is too incredible for me. The middle part with - among others - the mine scene is kind of tiring and slows down the show. (He's now taken for dead after an explosion in the mine's entering.) Richard Crenna does it good as the colonel, "father" to the last man standing of his former Vietnam crew, who tries to talk him back from the madness.The ending is a pure Hollywood fabrication. John Rambo dies in the novel by David Morrell, who is the stated background to this movie. But Sly wanted to keep the door open for more, and way out-of-spaced adventures. (Compare that to the first episode in the Rocky saga, when he's losing the epic battle with the champion, with a full 15 round match, which none before him had managed. (Losing it on referee judgment.))(The movie match was - as I among many others think - inspired by the Ali-Wepner fight of 1975, in which the opponent to Ali were 19 seconds away to endure the whole match, being called out by a TKO after a count to seven. NOTE: Stallone always denies that match was an inspiration to write the "ROCKY"-script. ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Made Stallone the action start we all know!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First Blood was an adaptation of the 1972 book of the same name, but lets be honest we know the movie, which as action films go is awesome, grounded and open the career of Stallone to the action genre ,no some say that was wrong , but the volume of amazing flick born of that decision like Demolition Man ,Cop Land ,Tango &amp; Cash and Ants, makes me think was worth it.So to the uninitiated the film follow John Rambo, a Vietnam veteran who tries to find his comrades from his platoon, but when the police mistreats him ,he is forced to fight back and unfortunately for the cops, a trained green beret is better than some police officers. What you were thinking , he is a commando, not a bump, he clearly has more experience in fighting back. The important thing however is not the intense scene, which are really good (bonus fact: the movie was made with only 15 million dollars!), it is that Rambo wasn't looking for trouble, he only wanted to be left in peace and the reaction of the society forced him in the defense.That fact is very real for the veterans coming back for literally the other side of the world and after the pain of war brinks ,they are called names (not the nice ones) and put on the side by their countrymen for whom it was said to them they were fighting. Personally both the Vietnam War and the Irak War were quit mismanaged endeavors and the soldier on the ground ,altough they were many persons who deserve court martial for their actions, the majority went their because they believed that what they did it was for the greater good. So to treat them like jerks ,when they return home is to say it polite bad karma!First Blood is no doubt a awesome flick ,with well written character story and good action and suspense . Is a rock solid 8 out of 10, if only didn't make sequels it would have been better, although Rambo (2008) wasn't to bad at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Blood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason why First Blood is so popular and people love it so much it's because in reality maybe just maybe something like that could happen since the whole police station is run by a bunch of idiots that even a 3 year old could kill. Rambo benefits from the strong performance of Sylvester Stallone as the title character which is still a mystery why he hasn't won an Oscar for his performance especially in the ending of the film where he totally kills it. Maybe if the film ended how it supposed to do maybe people would like it even more but Rambo became an even much more bigger Franchise than anyone could ever thought since Sly returned 3 more times after this.

		<shortDescription>First Blood Review (Spoilers... Maybe)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First Blood ReviewFirst Blood is an action movie that came out in 1982. This movie follows the story of John Rambo, a Green Beret who is pursued in the woods by the police force from a small town. In my opinion I think that First Blood is a pretty good movie. Although many people seem to think this movie is a prime example of 80's action cheese. I can agree with that, but I think that this movie has a much deeper meaning to it than explosions witty dialogue. Speaking of dialogue, there really isn't much dialogue in this movie. John Rambo is a very quiet person who is only doing what he has to do to survive. He speaks with his actions telling everyone to back off, as he is truly more skilled in the art of combat then the police officers are. I think that is what sets this movie apart from something like Commando or The Terminator is the main character. The 80's were a great time for action movies as they really developed into what they are today. But First Blood had something different. The character John Rambo was a Green Beret in the Vietnam War. He was scarred with the things he went threw. This really gave the character a, not-exactly relatable character as many of us have never been in a war, but relatable as in the sense that he had human emotions and was a flawed and hurt human. This humanized the film for me and made the experience that much better.Now although the movie Is really good I still think that it has it's fair amount of cheesiness throughout. For the most part I really only found myself on the edge of my seat when the action was set in the woods. The first time the police officers are ambushing Rambo and they are getting taken down left and right really gave me a rush. This ONE MAN was destroying everyone. I think that sense of epic action really dies out around the end of the second act and the beginning of the third act. By that time Rambo was just a ramped machine that was destroying everything, and that's where I think the movie was a little disappointing. Some of the action sequences were a little underwhelming during this time and I felt that the movie's pace lacked a little for me. However the closing sequence to the film where Rambo is in the city and is running around with a machine gun really brought back that action I was looking for. Although it was not balls to the wall action it was well paced and suspenseful. Watching the sheriff running around on the roof while he frantically looked for Rambo was very suspenseful. The Final thing, which I think really made this movie excel, was again John Rambo. By the end of the third act we find out why Rambo was the way he was. He had a mental condition, PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). This plot point made the machine he was into a human that most could relate with. It sent out a strong message to me and made the movie all worth while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War veteran parable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Academy Award winner Sylvester Stallone is well cast here as a decorated Vietnam War veteran who takes a detour through a small town where he is mistaken for a vagrant, abused and mistreated by the local police until breaking point. While Stallone's now iconic character of Rambo is often associated with unrelenting violence, the body count in 'First Blood' is refreshingly low as the film is about Rambo's quest to survive rather than avenge; he even asks his antagonists at various points to desist, but of course, the local police are too arrogant to listen. 'First Blood' does not have the likeliest of stories as Rambo soon proves superhuman and indestructible, barely suffering a scratch for all of his ordeals, but for what the film lacks in credibility, it makes up for in intelligent, dark satire. As Rambo points out in a poignant speech near the end, "back here, there's nothing" for him and no "code of honour". Rambo represents all the soldiers who returned from Vietnam to be called killers and murderers rather than heroes and freedom fighters and his struggle is symbolic of the struggle of all Vietnam vets to reintegrate in a society that does not want them. There is also a curious irony of sorts in that the US trained to Rambo to be such a good soldier that he is nearly impossible to kill. What if Rambo (or any of his fellow soldiers) suddenly snapped and decided to use all their training for ill-purpose on home soil? While 'First Blood' is an exciting, well-paced thriller on face value, it is the film's screenplay, full of such thought-provoking ideas, that really makes it tick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When growing up as a kid back in the 1980's there were some big action names that was impossible to not have heard about or having watched their numerous movies, and Sylvester Stallone certainly was one of those action stars.The 1982 movie "First Blood" has always been a very memorable movie to me, and it was a great start to the Rambo franchise. And director Ted Kotcheff did manage to create a good movie which really helped shape the action genre back in the early Eighties."First Blood" is about an ex-green beret who returns to USA after having served in Vietnam. And on his trek into a small town, he is bullied by the local sheriff and deputies. However, little do the bullying authority know that they are meddling with a highly trained and efficient killer. When John Rambo flees into the forested mountains with the police in hot pursuit, the game changes, and the police find themselves out of their league.The story is interesting and well-paced, and it doesn't take much time for director Ted Kotcheff to kick the movie into a high gear and take the audience on a very entertaining ride. And the characters in the movie were really well-fleshed out on the screen, a fact that applies to both the protagonist and antagonist.There are some familiar names and faces on the cast list, especially if you were watching movies during the 1980's and 1990's. The cast list includes Sylvester Stallone, Richard Crenna, Brian Dennehy and also David Caruso.While "First Blood" is not Shakespearian cinema, then it is still a good and wholeheartedly entertaining movie, whether or not you like Sylvester Stallone or not. I have been a fan of the Rambo franchise since 1982 as "First Blood" saw the light of day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'd forgotten what a great movie this is and hello Hope B.C</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hadn't seen this in quite a few years and enjoyed it immensely in my re-watch. It is slightly dated now but the movie is 30+ years old so now I guess it should be. Still a great story and Sylvester Stallone is excellent as John Rambo; quiet, strong, tormented. He doesn't say much throughout the entire movie but still manages to convey a lot of emotion. This also makes his final speech when all the hurt &amp; anger and PTSD comes out even more powerful and heart wrenching.The story follows is a Vietnam veteran and drifter John J. Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) who wanders into a small Washington town in search of an old friend and is met by intolerance by the local sheriff who arrests him. When the sheriff and his deputies try to restrain and shave Rambo he has a flashback to his time as a prisoner of war and freaks out, escaping jail and sending the entire town on a manhunt for this former green beret. It will now take former commander (Richard Crenna) to save the hunters from the hunted.Brian Dennehy is suitably hateable as the sheriff who keeps "pushing" John, forcibly moving him on when all he wants to do is get a bite to eat. Also worth a mention is Jack Starrett who is so rednecky and horrible that you might cheer if he were to say fall out of a helicopter onto some rocks. A young David Caruso also turns up as a sympathetic officer. I can't say I was overly impressed with Richard Crenna as Rambo's former mentor he seemed very wooden.Great music here too, haunting theme by Jerry Goldsmith, sorta sad The Long Road I think its called.On a personal note I really enjoyed all the shots of Hope B.C, where this was filmed. A town I've been to many times. Hasn't changed much really, the bridge is gone now but they do still have a First Blood museum, complete with a Rambo signboard that you can stick your head through the top of and take pictures. Cheesy but fun. 12/8/15</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stallone Finally Gets A Hit Away From Rocky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Continuing my plan to watch every Sly Stallone movie in order, I come to 'First Blood'.Plot In A Paragraph: John Rambo (Stallone) is a former United States Special Forces soldier who fought in Vietnam and won the Congressional Medal of Honor, but his time in Vietnam haunts him. As he came to Hope, Washington to visit a friend, he was guided out of town by the Sheriff William Teasel when Rmabo tries to return to the town he is arrested. As he escapes to the nearby woods, he goes on a rampage, as Teasle and his deputies pursue him.Stallone had two hit movies in 1982, for the first time in his career. This was also his first hit movie away from 'Rocky'. Sly gives his best performance since 'Rocky' in this movie he is totally absorbing and brilliant. That's not to say his performances have not been good, as I have enjoyed them all. This is also his best movie since 'Rocky'. All the supporting cast are superb here too!! Brian Denehey is fantastic and Richard Crenna is wonderful as Rambo's Colonel who is condescending and patronising in the delivery of his lines to Denehey's Teasle. Jerry Goldsmith also hits a home run with his score. As does the Dan Hill track "It's A Long Road"I honestly believe this should have been considered for some Oscars that year, as its a 10/10 from this reviewer.</fullReview>

Saddled with certain genre baggage, I'm still not sure it gets the respect that it so richly deserves.The environment is a character of its own, and highlighted by Andrew Laszlo's gorgeous cinematography, its harsh beauty is the canvas on which director Ted Kotcheff paints his near masterpiece.Featuring exceptional performances from its three key actors; Sylvester Stallone, Brian Dennehy and Richard Crenna, 'First Blood' remains the high water mark for the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Quintessential "One Man Army" Action Extravaganza!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The quintessential "one man army" flick, a classic action extravaganza, and a powerhouse of first-rate direction, taut screenplay &amp; remarkable lead performance, First Blood is one of the most exhilarating examples of its genre that didn't just inspire &amp; influence numerous action films of the 1980s &amp; '90s but is also notable for introducing the world to one of the greatest action heroes of all time who has, since then, become a prominent part of pop culture.Set in a small American town, First Blood tells the story of John Rambo; a Vietnam-war veteran who is in town to visit an old comrade but is intercepted &amp; driven out of the place by an arrogant Sheriff who considers him an unwanted nuisance. When Rambo attempts to re-enter, he's arrested, insulted &amp; abused by the local cops following which he snaps, escapes from the jail, flees into the woods &amp; later unleashes an all-out assault against the town's law enforcement.Directed by Ted Kotcheff, First Blood opens on a calm note which was nothing but a deep breath before the plunge for when the main plot takes over, the film turns into an edge-of- the-seat thriller for the remainder of its runtime. Kotcheff's direction is really impressive for he maintains a steady balance between the action &amp; drama moments, and paces the whole narrative amazingly well. The script is consistently focused on the character of Rambo and without much exposition, tells us all we need to know about him.Using the countryside surroundings to its advantage, First Blood utilises all the available resources in an efficient manner and puts on screen some of the most daring stunts ever filmed. Cinematography encapsulates the whole picture with an overcast feel and concisely captures all the unfolding action with correct implementation of camera angles, movements &amp; lighting. Editing is immaculately carried out for every scene in the final print is relevant to the plot and its 93 minutes of runtime is perfectly paced. And also complimenting the story &amp; uplifting the entire drama is Jerry Goldsmith's fabulous score.Coming to the performances, First Blood features a capable cast in Sylvester Stallone, Richard Crenna &amp; Brian Dennehy and all of them do a brilliant job in their given roles. Stallone, who also co-wrote the screenplay, is the real strength of this film for he delivers a performance that's as rock solid as his character and it's his contribution only that turned Rambo into a cultural icon. Without any words, Stallone is able to convincingly express all the emotions Rambo goes through and that final monologue from him is an instant classic moment in itself. Also, both Crenna &amp; Dennehy chip in with strong supporting work as Rambo's mentor &amp; the town's sheriff, respectively.On an overall scale, First Blood is a fascinating portrait of a troubled soldier who still finds himself haunted by the horrors of the past and covers not only his continuous struggle in readjusting to the normalcy of civilian life but also his hatred for the society he doesn't understand anymore. Rambo is much more than the highly skilled, self-sufficient &amp; extremely lethal assassin for he represents those who had a hard time adapting to the life they weren't familiar with anymore for the addictive taste of war had already altered their identity. Plus, the film also focuses on the lack of understanding between them &amp; the society they're trying to be a part of, which results in their alienation. All in all, First Blood is a timeless masterpiece that will forever be ranked amongst the greatest action films ever made. Strongly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic action movie the film that started Stallone career right after success of Rocky Trilogy and the best one in the series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Classic action movie the film that started Stallone career right after success of Rocky Trilogy."First Blood" was Sylvester Stallone's first non-Rocky movie which didn't bomb. In fact, it arguably saved his career. The same year that Rocky III come the same year First Blood come out. Still today is one of the best action movies ever made they don't make movies like this anymore. First Blood is based on novel by David Morrell about a Vietnam vet who come home from Vietnam War and is pushed by American anti?Vietnam War activists and has to run and fight for his life. What I love in this film is that Rambo is a human been with feelings and not a fighting machine like people are saying. A lots of kids these days are partying,getting high, dropping high schools, landing in prison and do all kind of bad things with their lives! Rambo did everything with his life, he fought Vietnam war and did everything he could to win in Vietnam war. But they didn't let them win and for the past 3.years he served tour of duty in Vietnam and won medal of honor. I guess the life treated him well that time during 70's. But when he finally got home from Vietnam tour of duty he got into the real nightmare and he saw the hell and that was nothing back home for him,nothing! But been spited in his face and been pushed and treated like criminal instead been treated like hero with respect. Rambo quote to Col. Trautman: "For me civilian life is nothing! In the field we had a code of honor, you watch my back, I watch yours. Back here there's nothing!" The movie portrays how really Vietnam War Vets were treated Home by their own fellow Americans instead been treated like heroes they were treated as animals and baby killers. They loved their country the country didn't love them back. Americans lost Vietnam war and those young boys who were sent in the Vietnam Tour of duty and come back lost their lives,friends and even their health. And couldn't even got or keep a job in America. I watched movies and even realistic TV Show Tour of Duty. And those maggots on their airport didn't know what they were yelling about they didn't know anything about it. That is why I love First Blood. That's how really was happening in America back in the 70's and 80's. Stallone portrayed his character with awesome dramatic human performances an Oscar for him. The most positive of the character is he doesn't kill anyone he could have. Their was one cop killed but it was his own fault he didn't buckle up on the helicopter and he fell down by his own stupidity. David Morrell's Rambo character was heartless, cruel,sociopath and evil. In this movie he is a human been with a heart who is confused,very angry of how he is treated and he suffers from distillation of the symptoms of the PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder).In the DVD commentary for the film Sylvester Stallone recalls an incident during filming where a girl in the town bar pretended to be a fan of his in order to try and wheedle a free round of drinks out of him. He later includes just such a scene in his film Rocky Balboa (2006). Very human Vietnam realistic anti war movie. It was my favorite childhood movie and today right beside Rocky, First Blood is still best of best Stallone movie that he ever made. Also Great performances by Richard Crenna as Col. Trautman and Brian Dennehy as Sheriff Teasle.First Blood is a 1982 American action adventure film directed by Ted Kotcheff. It is co-written by and starring Sylvester Stallone as John Rambo, a troubled and misunderstood veteran who must rely on his combat and survival senses against the abusive law enforcement of a small town. It is based on David Morrell's 1972 novel of the same name and is the first installment of the Rambo series. Brian Dennehy and Richard Crenna also appear in supporting roles.I love this film to death and I love the human film character Rambo portrayed by Sylvester Stallone. I love the main theme from Jerry Goldsmith and I love the awesome action flick. 10/10 Grade: A+ Studio: Orion Pictures Starring: Sylvester Stallone, Richard Crenna, Brian Dennehy Director: Ted Kotcheff Producers: Buzz Feitshans, Mario Kassar, Andrew G.

Even if you don't end up loving it as much as I do its still worth a watch. It might not be everybody's favorite action film but, I believe this movie deals with real life issues that other great action films don't. Back then there was a lot of Vietnam veterans that went through a lot of the same problems that John Rambo did in this movie. Now, grant it they didn't go to the extreme's that Rambo did but, I bet a lot of them felt like doing that after being mistreated by people who have no idea what fighting in Vietnam was like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sylvester Stallone is an actor that many times is criticised, but here he is at his near full best, doesn't talk an awful lot but his emotion carries and you really start to feel for what he says(well, if you can at times make it out). I liked Richard Crenna and his calm demeanour in the film, even in the most dangerous of times he still seems to keep a straight face and mind and the actor really knows how to make himself look like a father figure.It is directed quite well and same goes for the writing, Ted Kotcheff I feel maybe didn't need to do much in scenes as Stallone just knows it all anyway but is hand is steady throughout the movie. Stallone is among the writers and he does well too, although with the 3 and the dialogues sometimes kept at a minimum, it is easy to see just how easy this was to write really. I liked some stunts but I felt more was needed in that area and more things like big jumps and run chases would have been appreciated as well.My main critical points focus on the slightly dull dialogue and parts seem a bit rushed in honesty, it doesn't hurt the film badly as I have already said, it is a pretty good movie, but it definitely makes some scenes seem rubbishy. I wasn't too keen either on the way the film has to keep pointing out Stallone is hard to kill and a seasoned veteran, it got on my nerves because we hear it 20 times when Richard Crenna arrives, and even more after just a few minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest action movie...ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that's a bold question, but considering how well acted this movie is and how interesting the story is, it's worth asking. The movie is about a green beret named John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) who returns home after the Vietnam war, only to find that nobody has any interest in befriending him due to all the negative press from the war. This cold reaction to Rambo escalates when he walks into a small, Pacific Northwest town to reunite with one of his buddies from the war, only to be told that he was killed by Agent Orange when he came back to the States. While feeling dejected and somber, Rambo wanders into town and is eventually identified by the town sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) who, like many other Americans, didn't approve of Rambo's presence and insisted he leave his town. The plot escalates further when he's unjustifiably arrested for vagrancy and brutalized at the police station repeatedly by other deputies. As Rambo is getting harassed and beaten, the officers show a noticeable pleasure from inflicting pain on him. As you continue to watch this misconduct unfold, you begin to crave some sort of retaliation against this oppressive police force from Rambo, but he remains docile. That is, until he just couldn't take it anymore. It's at this point where this becomes one of the greatest action movies ever made. If you haven't seen this movie yet, you're in for a treat!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frustrated veteran reaches his breaking point after being harassed by a sheriff (Dennehy) and his deputies in the small town of Hope. Neat to see forests of the Pacific Northwest turned into a jungle of combat, but characters suddenly disappear from the story without explanation (Caruso and Mulkey, for example); and the ending is abrupt that the narrative arc almost seems absent, it feels like they just ran out of ideas and decided to stop. Stallone is great as Rambo, but his delivery is so bad that even a heartfelt monologue has to be deciphered through closed-captions and replays.&#x2605;&#x2605;? (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director Ted Kotcheff depicts the amazing fight of an innocent man against a corrupt system.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American film 'First Blood' concerns the fight of an innocent man against a corrupt system.It describes how corrupt practices continue to prevail within certain American police stations who would abuse their powers in order to discriminate against people whom they choose to term as outsiders.The pace of the film is fast and no time has been wasted to convey the message that a powerful innocent person would retaliate with ferociousness once he is challenged by thugs.By making 'First Blood',Director Ted Kotcheff has been successful in showcasing the frustrations of a former Vietnam war veteran whose strength was underestimated by brutish police force in a small American town.It is true that 33 years after its making,this film continues to be praised as one of the best action films.However,there are other reasons to watch 'First Blood' as it was also instrumental in revealing Sylvester Stallone's acting abilities.Lastly,the survival of a former army veteran in harsh nature is one of the unique facets of First Blood.This is something which has not been depicted by many action films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rambo is a force to be reckoned with.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sylvester Stallone stars in one of his most iconic roles, playing Vietnam Veteran John Rambo, who uses his combat skills to go against the group a sheriff officers who arrest and abuse him after accusing Rambo of being a drifter and resisting arrest.Stallone as Rambo proves he is a force to be reckoned with, mercilessly kicking the sheriffs' behinds left and right as he displays a very formidable set of fighting and survival skills. It was interesting seeing Rambo roaming about the wildness like a lone commando in a war zone.Brian Dennehy as Sheriff Teasle plays a very formidable antagonist to Rambo, somebody who appears determined to protect his town from Rambo's wrath, yet, somebody who is also a somewhat arrogant, enraged instigator.Just about the entire movie consists of Rambo trying to evade the lawmen's pursuit, which doesn't have much of a solid plot, but results in a very fast-paced script and an enthralling story to see how Rambo attempts to survive his ordeal. The action may become slightly over the top as the movies progresses, but it's still one wild ride! Grade B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Entertaining.A Vietnam veteran, John Rambo (played by Sylvester Stallone), is run out of a small town by fascist Sheriff. Coming back he is arrested, breaks out and then is the subject of a massive manhunt.Starts off very well. Initially a story of injustice, then a survival movie. Looked set up for an interesting final act.However, it then loses away. Cue explosions and gunfire merely for the sake of it. Ending feels a bit tame.There was a lot of potential for making something incredibly profound. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and how badly Vietnam vets were treated when they returned home are covered, but not in much depth. The sum total of the exploration of these themes is some flashbacks in the beginning and a short speech by Rambo at the end. Ultimately, a decent action-drama, but had the potential to be great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Action film with an Action man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First Blood is an action film that not only has scenes with purely well made well action, but also a performance from an actor we don't always see the best of. With it's quiet feel the film can really jump into life at any moment and you won't find many films that can pull this kind of thing off and still keep you entertained until the last few moments. I felt First Blood was a solidly pretty good action movie, and here is why below.The story is thrilling yet has a slight dramatic depth to it to say that most of these type plots usually end up all guns blazing and deaths constantly. This film manages to avoid the over the top amount of kills and settles for a slow pace that really does work. I especially liked the start when Rambo is pushed over the edge emotionally, it brings the whole film to a thrilling start and even the most hardened veterans of action films will still feel their heart beating faster.Sylvester Stallone is an actor that many times is criticised, but here he is at his near full best, doesn't talk an awful lot but his emotion carries and you really start to feel for what he says(well, if you can at times make it out). I liked Richard Crenna and his calm demeanour in the film, even in the most dangerous of times he still seems to keep a straight face and mind and the actor really knows how to make himself look like a father figure.It is directed quite well and same goes for the writing, Ted Kotcheff I feel maybe didn't need to do much in scenes as Stallone just knows it all anyway but is hand is steady throughout the movie. Stallone is among the writers and he does well too, although with the 3 and the dialogues sometimes kept at a minimum, it is easy to see just how easy this was to write really. I liked some stunts but I felt more was needed in that area and more things like big jumps and run chases would have been appreciated as well.My main critical points focus on the slightly dull dialogue and parts seem a bit rushed in honesty, it doesn't hurt the film badly as I have already said, it is a pretty good movie, but it definitely makes some scenes seem rubbishy. I wasn't too keen either on the way the film has to keep pointing out Stallone is hard to kill and a seasoned veteran, it got on my nerves because we hear it 20 times when Richard Crenna arrives, and even more after just a few minutes.I think those who love good action and a story pieced together actually quite well, you will enjoy it, has a good back story but also doesn't focus too much in the past, stays in the present story. If you like massive explosions and car chases etc, this may not be for you really, lacks in that department but if it had them in the film, it would have ruined it and made it so much more unrealistic and rubbish.Overall it is Solidly Good and although not quite straight good, still is moving there by the end. It just needed a little more time I feel and it could have rated even higher, worth a watch though for anyone who likes film. One more thing, if you like Stallone and his many movies that include fighting and shooting etc, you should have a blast with this, this could be Stallone's best action thriller film he has ever done(and he does a lot of them), a great watch for you guys and with so many sequels too, why not watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stallone's first movie as Rambo and I wasn't disappointed at all. His acting is superb, as he perfectly manages to blend in with the role of Vet war veteran and even without much talking to do ,he creates a great character. Equal importance I would give to Crenna for his brilliant portrayal of Trautman. And a Thumbs up to good background score, and guerrilla style action sequences, though they are few, which is one of the flaws of this movie. Rambo goes on blowing half of the town, for revenge against the sheriff. This time could have been used in the forest,where he escapes about 200 soldiers with very less action.Despite these minor flaws I would still give it a seven, for being a decent thrilling ride with a deep psychological impact, and a good ending, where Rambo says all about his predicament , and the treatment meted out against him in USA.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did anyone knew this movie takes place on Christmas? i sure didn't know about it and who knows this might be the first action movie to be taken place around Christmas. Anyway, now to talk about "First Blood", This is in my opinion the best action film. why? because, it has a great story about a mistreated Vietnam veteran who decides to open world war 3 on a small town or maybe America, you might be thinking that's the plot? but, there is a lot more to it than just that because, in the past when the Vietnam war was over, all of American soldiers were mistreated by civilians and not being able to fit back in America so, this movie has a good message on never treat soldiers like dirt, they do everything they can to make America proud. I like the fact there isn't really a main villain,the sheriffs don't act like villains there more like bullies to Rambo,i like that,it brings something new to action movies. The acting is great, the cast do there jobs very well. The action scenes are not shaky cam, it keeps the camera still,even though not a whole a lot of action but, when there is good. The soundtrack is really good, done by the late Jerry Goldsmith. The ending is great, It's emotional and it's pretty rare to see an action hero break into tears. I really wish That Stallone will release the 3 hour cut because, as a fan i really want to see the deleted scenes that did not appear in Theatrical release and home video release. This is a great action film, I highly Highly recommend seeing this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rambo: First Blood (1982) Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"We don't want people like you in our town. Drifters. It's quiet, some would even call it boring, and I get paid to keep it that way". Sheriff Will Teasle tells John Rambo as he escorts him out of town for no good reason. Little did he know he was messing with a ticking time bomb. Rambo (played by Sylvester Stallone) is a Vietnam war veteran who, shortly into the film, learns he is the last remaining of his friends from the same unit in the war. After being mistreated by the local police force of the fictional town Hope, Washington, Rambo, tortured by flashbacks of his time as a prisoner of war, finally snaps raises hell on the once peaceful town.What Rambo: First Blood gets right is the action. Guns, knifes, helicopters, explosions and even jungle booby-traps. It's exciting. What Rambo: First Blood doesn't get quite as right is the script. The story starts off strong but slowly takes a back seat and becomes as bare as it can be for the action to carry the rest of the film. When Rambo is placed under arrest and taken to the police station early in the film we witness him being the victim of unfair treatment which in turn results in memories from his troubled past. I feel they could have developed his character better with more of these flashbacks and even full length scenes to see his relationship with his war friends and truly understand the reasons for his extreme actions.The film features a chase scene early on where Sheriff Deputy Will Teasle is driving after Rambo who has stolen a motorcycle. It was an exciting chase scene that slowly turns from a chase on the roads to a muddy off-road scramble. I keep referring to this movie as exciting and that's really the best way I can describe it. It's consistent with it's action and at 93 minutes long, it's just the right length. When the movie's finished your adrenaline will be pumping, but you won't be as emotionally attached as you might have hoped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Until the climax...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First Blood is such an excellent action movie that it's disappointing to have to point its flaws. The movie is very, very well made, and very, very entertaining, and could have been as perfect an action story as Rocky was a people story. John Rambo (played by Sylvester Stallone) is a US Army Green Beret returning home from Vietnam after the horrors he had experienced, only to find that he is hated by the country and that his friends are dead. He finds a small town where he hopes to find something to eat, but the Sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) denies him this privilege, as he believes that Rambo is a white trash drifter. When Rambo tries to come into town anyway, he is taken into custody, and Teasle tortures him. Rambo escapes, and goes into the mountain forests near the town, trying to merely get away from the police, but in the process starting a war of one man vs. an entire police force. This premise is an excellent one. We all like to see one man go up against an entire force (another example of this would be the James Bond films), and the way it is carried out here is even more fascinating. A police force is trying to capture Rambo, and yet he is a Green Beret, one of the toughest groups in the US military. The movie is filled with thrilling situations and action sequences. The action sequences are all real, with real stunts using both men and cars, real truck chases, real explosions. There's a scene with Rambo hanging onto a cliff face with a man in a helicopter shooting at him. Stunts like this are amazing, and they are enhanced by the wonderful score and beautiful locations. Sylvester Stallone is perfect as Rambo. He will not be messed with, knows how to survive, and takes action when he has to. But he is also reckless and at times vengeful. A lot of this comes from his suffering. After his horrible experiences in Vietnam, he is prone to violence, and distraught that his work is unappreciated by the country. At the end of the film, he finally breaks down, sick of all his misery. Stallone is backed up by Brian Dennehy and Richard Crenna, who both give excellent performances. The climax, however, is a shame. It's not terrible by any means, and Rambo's speech at the end is powerful, but it's still very anti- climactic and undramatic. Things just happen, with no dramatic quality to them. It's a shame, but it's still a model action movie. A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First Blood was the first film in the series of 4 films which center on a Vietnam war veteran named Rambo. Its cool action and adventurous vibe is great as well as great music and epic stunts. It was so good it spawned 3 sequels which I will also review. This film is enjoyable to watch and brings us iconic moments and much more films with a familiar tune. This film is parodied in Hot Shots part 2. After his first Rocky films, Silvester Stallone made a great choice by signing on to play the role of Rambo. This is him in his prime time when he knew which movies to make, now he should just quit... While he's ahead! No pun intended by the way...

		<fullReview>The only movie in the series . the others should all be burned. This is one of the best and most understated movies of the eighties. One of Stallone's best performances so much is said without dialog. This movie had such an impact on me that later on when I became a police officer I always tried my best to treat every person that I had contact with, with tact and respect because I really had know idea what kinds of problems the other guy was going through. My problem only with the movie is that he should have died at the end by the police officers. It would have really driven home the point of the film. The action and violence of this movie set a whole new standard for action movies. I wish that they would have spent more time developing the character of the sheriff. If this movie is ever re maid it should bring more of the sheriffs personal stuff into the story. and yes it is an anti war film! The government spent all that time and money training Rambo to survive in war only to have him come home and not get the help and respect that he so desperately needed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rambo gave the fans a war movie that they couldn't believe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh John Rambo-- how much you have become to represent the testosterone full adrenaline action star who just shoots at anything that moves around you. John Rambo is too much a cartoon character like Flippy the green bear from Happy Tree Friends. Yes, I push it, Rambo. Before the over-kills, glorious violence that First Blood Part II and III gave us, there was First Blood. A movie with violence, but also very smart written with dark tone somber subtext message. First Blood was based on the book by David Morrell inspired by real-life post-Vietnam war era backlash against veterans. The movie by Ted Kotcheff seem like a modern day PG-13 version of the book. I'd love to see them remake First Blood in a contemporary setting and make it a little bit more hard core like the novel. Plus the ending to novel is shocking. Still, it's a good rated R film as it is. John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is a Vietnam vet whom comes upon the town of Hope, looking for some food after mourning the lost of his war-time friend. Seeing him as a drifter on the road, Hope's sheriff, Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) confronts Rambo offers him a lift to the town limits, hinting strongly that drifters aren't welcome here. Note in the U.S., some local officials encourage vagrants to move away instead of arresting them so it's a common theme here. While the movie wants to put Teasle as the bad guy guided to that conclusion by the storyline, if you pay attention to what Teasle is doing, you can see he isn't. He knows his citizens by name. He is a man of law and order. He doesn't back down to Rambo even though he knows he is superior to him. His motives are to keep his town peaceful and he thinks he is a threat, which somewhat came true. So he was justified in a way. He doesn't arrest him, at first. He knows Rambo might be trouble so he even gives him a lift out of town where he would be out of his jurisdiction. Will Tealse was doing his job. When Rambo politely declines Sheriff Teasle's suggestion by showing back into town, Rambo finds himself under arrest. While in custody, he isn't really treated right by the cops. Teasle says if he had a problem, Rambo could come to him and he would of reprimanded the officers. The police officers may have gone over board after he was in custody like trying to shave him. The sheriff officers weren't even that bad. David Caruso's character was the "sympathetic" cop too, but he's still an idiot. Just waiting for him to put on glasses and the CSI Miami music kicks in. It sent Rambo off, due to reminding him of Vietnam torture flashbacks. He then escape, commits several felonies batteries, grand theft auto twice, kidnapping, animal cruelty, speeding wreck-less and endangerment innocent lives with an automatic weapon and arson. All that because Teasle wouldn't let him get a cheeseburger in his town, gees. Rambo heads off road, with the entire police department on his trail in the forest. When his skills prove to be too much for Sheriff Teasle's men, the military arrives - led by Rambo's former commander in Vietnam, Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna), whose loyalties are divided between the man he trained and those seeking to bring him down. Colonel Trautman is treated with all the best one-liners in the film, but Sylvester Stallone does have his collection of one-liners too. Plus a speech, that is sad, but incoherent due to Stallone's slurring voice. I think the real message of the movie is that we need to treat our veterans better. All Rambo wanted was to get a cup of coffee and mourn a friend who died from cancer. Instead he got arrested by cops wanting to be a bit crude. The movie tries hard to make sure that Rambo will be seen as a tormented, misunderstood, amazingly resourceful victim of the Vietnam War, rather than as a sadist or a villain. Still, I wouldn't call Rambo, a victim. He still went overboard. While the film, tries to say away from the theme of Cop Killer by having Rambo didn't kill anybody still I think he might has cause a death or two somewhere in the film. The film is undeniably violent and features its share of grisly moments, but First Blood is more thought-provoking than its high death toll body count sequels, at least acknowledged that viewers might have functioning brains. The script was smart enough to recognize that Rambo's appeal was not limited to his big muscles and ability to mow down legions of bad guys with a really big gun yet it was tailored made for Stallone's macho, action-oriented persona. Stallone even help write the script. The music is stunning and both 'It's a long road' by Dan Hill and the theme song by Jerry Goldsmith tells the story of being alone. The movie inspired such works as 'The Park is Mine' and the 'Hunted' both with Tommy Lee Jones. Without First Blood, we might not have gotten Solid Snake and the Big Boss from Metal Gear Solid. So to think, the whole Rambo saga and a lot of movies wouldn't happen if had he just gotten some food. Check it out, and draw the first blood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although it took David Morrell's superb action novel "First Blood" about a decade to reach the screen, "North Dallas Forty" director Ted Kotcheff, "Sky Commando" scenarist William Sackheim, "Hill Street Blues" creator Michael Kozoll, and Sylvester Stallone, have done a sterling job adapting it as a film. Indeed, Morrell has gone on record and called it "not a bad picture." You know you're watching a good cinematic adaptation when the author likes what Hollywood did with his masterpiece. Morrell confides a lot about the differences between his novel and the landmark film on one of the two commentary tracks of the "First Blood" DVD and Blu-Ray. Indeed, he drew inspiration from Kirk Douglas' superior contemporary oater "None But the Brave" (1962)that co-starred Walter Matthau and Carol O'Connor. In fact, Morrell has described "First Blood" a veritable western with the motorcycle substituted for a horse. Essentially, the novel "First Blood" constituted Morrell's protest of the Vietnam War. Ultimately, the protagonist John J. Rambo racks up a double-digit body count in this novel and winds up dying from rabid bats. Kotcheff and his gifted scribes have revised Morrell's narrative and characters so that the hero survives everything that the villainous sheriff's department hurls at him in the wilderness as well as the city. The film departs from the novel in the lack of characterization given to the villainous Sheriff Will Teasle who struggles to make life difficult for our heroic protagonist. "First Blood" was one of the first movies about a misunderstood Vietnam veteran who found it impossible to assimilate back into society after the horrors of combat. Remember, "The A-Team" did arrive on NBC-TV until the following year, and it concerned a group of Vietname vets who were still wanted by the law.Sylvester Stallone of "Rocky" fame plays a former Green Beret who received a Congressional Medal of Honor for his valiant service. John J. Rambo has returned from from Vietnam, and is hoofing his way around America, trying to track down his old friends. He discovers that his last friend, Delmar, has died from the cancer that he developed from Agent Orange. Rambo arrives in a Northwestern town of Hope where the intolerant sheriff, Teasle (Brian Dennehy of "10"), decides to escort him out of town before he can enter town. Rambo accuses Teasle of pushing him, and Rambo takes on the entire sheriff's department, making them look like clowns. Not long after Rambo is arrested and taken into custody, he experiences flashbacks about his imprisonment in Vietnam at the hands of the enemy and goes berserk when Ward (Chris Mulkey of "Cloverfield") tries to shave him with a straight razor, while Galt (Jack Starett of "The Born Losers") holds Rambo and Mitch (David Caruso of "CSI: Miami") watches. Rambo overpowers his captors and escapes from the jail, seizes a motorcycle, and tears off into the woods like Steve McQueen. The sheriff, his posse, and the National Guard comb the forest for Rambo. Gradually, our lone wolf hero whittles down the opposition. The National Guard corners Rambo in a cave and uses a rocket launcher to seal the cave shut along with Rambo's fate. Naturally, this obstacle doesn't stop Rambo from finding a back door. He jumps onto a truck transporting an M-60 and shows up back in Hope to battle Teasle. Rambo's former superior officer Colonel Sam Trautman (Richard Crenna of "Wait Until Dark") arrives in the nick of time to talk Rambo out of an impossible predicament. The State Police escort Rambo from the sheriff's station in handcuffs.Stallone found two signature characters during his rise to fame in Hollywood. Rocky came first, and Rambo came second. "First Blood" ranks as one of Stallone's top ten movies. Jerry Goldsmith's orchestral score is impressive and underlines all the dramatically important moments. The stunts, especially the guy falling from the side of the mountain while a helicopter hovers nearby is unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The birth of the franchise and my favorite of the Rambo movies. Sylvester Stallone is not the super vet in this film, at least not physically. (He gets bigger and bigger as his career moves forward, check out The Expendables.) The acting in this film is straightforward and honest. The deputies are locals who don't have a lot of experience in dealing with violence, the sadistic jailer gets his comeuppance soon enough, and Brian Dennehy is the sheriff who realizes he probably screwed up, but doesn't want to admit it. How dare some drifter challenge him in his town! Stallone is the lost soul, the disenfranchised loner who returned from a war to be met with protesters instead of open arms. Richard Crenna (R.I.P.) portrays the would be mediator who tries to defuse the situation. Underneath all the violence, you have to remember that the character Rambo has done nothing wrong, and is being pursued unjustly. Underlying the movie is a statement about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and the way returning veterans are treated, even today. So while the adrenaline junkies among us usually praise the action in this film (and there is certainly some worthy action), most people tend to forget this film is a political statement that simply lays out the facts and lets you be the judge. Rated R for violence, language, and some disturbing images, this film is a collectible for any serious collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sylvester Stallone, Richard Crenna and Brian Dennehy star in this 1982 action film based on the novel. Stallone (Rocky) plays John Rambo, a rugged, Green Beret veteran who visits one of his team members whom he learns is deceased. Rambo realizes he's the last of his group and wanders until he meets a small-town Sheriff, Will Teasle (Dennehy) who is about to make a mistake when he pushes the wrong man. Will arrests him for vagrancy and has his men treat him like an animal. Soon, Rambo escapes starting his own personal war with Will, his men and the national guard. Crenna (The Real McCoys) plays Rambo's Colonel, Sam Trautman who helps Will find him before he goes too far. This is a great action film that's one of Stallone's best, He, Crenna &amp; Dennehy are great in it and who can forget Jerry Goldsmith's excellent score. I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was still a kid when this film came out and saw it on cable. I thought Rambo was a true ass-kicking American who you did not want to mess with. This film really makes u hate the small town sheriff's office that treats Rambo with what almost seems to be racial prejudice (despite that they are all white). This was the first time in my life i saw that as a society, we can treat each other very badly for nothing more than a war in which many soldiers didn't want to fight in the first place! When i asked my dad and uncle how accurate this behavior was to returning G.I.'s from Vietnam, they said at times it was even worse. It made me cry because now you see how we support our troops and only want to see them come home safely, a very stark contrast to 30-35 years ago. I can see how it would cause him to snap and defend himself the only way he knows how!If you have any family members that fought in Vietnam, please watch this movie. The dialog he gives in the film's finale gives you an understanding to how many were treated in society.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Blood: One Great Action Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During his current run of the Rocky series,Sylvester Stallone released First Blood,also known as Rambo: First Blood,in 1982. It was an is action thriller about a troubled and misunderstood Vietnam War veteran.Stallone played the lead role of John Rambo.It also stars Richard Crenna and Brian Dennehy.The movie was based on the novel of David Morrell's novel of the same name. It was the second successful movie franchise that Stallone starred in together with Rocky.The story was about an ex-Green Beret John Rambo,who is targeted for persecution and abuse by potbellied Sheriff Will Teasle,played by Brian Dennehy.When he can stand no more, Rambo goes bonkers, killing a deputy and heading into the surrounding hills, armed to the teeth. Only after Rambo has picked off practically every law enforcement officer within a radius of 50 miles do the local authorities bring in his former commanding officer, Trautman,portrayed by Richard Crenna,for advice. Trautman's response -- that the locals had better get a lot of body bags ready -- is hardly encouraging. Since its release, First Blood has been a critical and commercial success and has had a lasting influence on action films.The film is notable for its psychological portrayal of the after-effects of the Vietnam War, particularly the challenges faced by American veterans attempting to re-integrate into society, something not deeply examined in subsequent Rambo sequels.First Blood has definitely is considered one of the most memorable ones in film history.Stallone has proved himself to be a great action star and one of the best physical actors in history with his portrayal of John Rambo.Aside from that,this film has created some sort of a benchmark about what action movies will be all about in the years to come.Also,it was the first of its kind to portray Vietnam War veterans that have had psychological problems which was first of its kind during its release. Overall,it was one great action movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ludicrous sequels burned the image of shirtless, oiled-biceps, rocket launcher-toting, bandanna wearing Rambo so deeply into American cultural iconography, it's understandably easy to forget how very different the first film was, and that it was in fact a fantastic little movie with real credibility and a real message (or that Rambo doesn't have ammo-belts on until the last twenty minutes or so). Not that it's not filled to the brim with excellent action scenes - but it's also darkly realistic, with a lot less explosions and a much lower body count, with a depressing anticlimactic ending and, most importantly, with a strong and bold anti-militaristic message. A lot like Rocky, it's a very worthy classic that was damaged by too many sequels and too much studio greediness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why, Yes, It Is a Long Road</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes "First Blood" so bizarrely effective is how it works on more than just a literal level. Fans of simple shoot-'em-up action can revel in the film's near-implausible carnage, but underneath it all is a metaphor that feels more genuine than anything seen in a long time. Rambo struggles to survive via violent, chaotic clashes with the bullying police and the comically inept National Guard that represent something deeper and more common: the struggle of Vietnam survivors to readjust to life in the United States. As he wails and screams in his climactic monologue about the war, he finds himself having his freedoms and rights taken away by the very people whose freedoms and rights he went to Vietnam to protect. It's a brilliantly complex analysis of the war and its tumultuous, far-reaching effects, one that defies politics and platitudes. I've never seen such a seemingly over-the-top action extravaganza done with such a convincing and shatteringly powerful "ulterior motive." Shot in British Columbia, the movie has a dingy, foggy, where's-that-bright-yellow-thing-from-the-sky look to it. There are certain visual parallels to "The Deer Hunter," but "The Deer Hunter" this ain't. Stallone gives what is arguably his one great performance, a sobering blend of anarchic physicality and perfect on-cue histrionics-- combined with a level of articulateness that mercifully takes this character in the full opposite direction from Rocky Balboa, which I was not expecting. And while the music score isn't one of Jerry Goldsmith's best, the main theme is one of his best individual compositions, and the music is well above average for both building suspense and evoking sincere emotion. Though it doesn't have the character name in the title, this may be the only "Rambo" movie that was actually about Rambo-- the real Rambo, not the human action figure-- and as such it is vastly under-appreciated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you can win a war you can win, then you can beat anyone in the war. But, in a person's mind, can they fight a battle they couldn't win? That is the set-up in First Blood, an action movie that ask that question and tells it very perfectly. After the Vietnam War, Vietnam veteran John Rambo, played by Sylvester Stallone, is traveling in the United States, lonely and very quiet. In America, Rambo decides to see a old-war buddy of his that died after the war of cancer. After the bad news, Rambo decides to drifts into a small town called Hope, located in Washington. The sheriff of the town is played by Brian Dehenny and he is very strict about drifters coming into his town. Like all movie's bad guys, Dehenny harasses the lone veteran. Soon after booking him for vagrancy and carrying a concealed weapon, Rambo is arrested, but not for long. He escapes from the jail and runs into the woods, where the police soon catches up with him. Soon enough, the police and the National Guard gets involved. Now, it's a massive manhunt to take down Rambo. Richard Crenna's character is Rambo's mentor and he plays a very good role as the colonel, who knows about Rambo. First Blood has a good cast and some good action sequences. Stallone's performance is very superb. Even though he is playing a tough guy who acts like Rocky and portrays a worn-out person, Stallone's character is very well said as a man who can't seem to win anything except the war in his soul. An good action picture. &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; 3 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First Blood is a great action packed film that shows how great of an actor Sylvestor Stallone is. Other than the original "Rocky" film, this may be Stallone's best acting job.Stallone plays a Vietnam war veteran named John Rambo. After hearing of the death of one of his former companions during Vietnam he heads to a nearby small town. A cop then takes him into custody after he tries to take Rambo away and Rambo keeps refusing to listen to him. At the police station, mentally unstable, Rambo is given a hard time by the cops and so he beats them up, and escapes and starts a one man war against the entire police force.Rambo is a great character with a lot of depth. YOu can really sympathize with him when you understand the horrors that he has been through. Stallone does a great job portraying Rambo, the veteran from Vietnam who returns and finds many did not appreciate him.There is plenty of action in this film, but not an over abundance of it. It is not a non stop violent shooting fest like the Rambo sequels tend to be at times. There is a message that is trying to be sent and a lot of emotional scenes to even out all of the action packed scenes.Of particular awesomeness is a scene where Rambo escapes from the police station.Stallone also gets to show his range towards the end where he gives an emotional monologue that probably hits close to home for many Vietnam veterans.Great film. Go see it.</fullReview>

The first of four action classics, First Blood set the standard for action films to come.Set after the Vietnam conflict, John Rambo returns home to seek out old friends who he lost touch with. When no one is left, he continues he lone road into the unknown. He is harassed by a local sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy in a excellent performance) into leaving but Rambo ignores him. He is arrested for being a vagrant, and the other police tried to abuse him, but Rambo unleashes the beast within and beings his one man war on them.Filled with action, adventure, and suspense, First Blood is a action classic that never lets up when it takes off. It also has stellar performances from Stallone, Dennehy, and a iconic performance from Richard Crenna as Colonel Sam Trautman, Rambo's mentor and best friend.I give it a 5 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First Blood tells an interesting story of a soldier who is unwanted and haunted. He finds himself in an unpleasant situation which escalates out of proportion. He refuses to give in as long as he has fight left in him. This dramatic core is what makes First Blood a stand out film.As a piece of film, First Blood stands out as a very down-to-earth sort of film. The escalating manhunt for John Rambo in a sense depicts a very sorry fate for those who served in Vietnam, while at the same time it may stretch one's suspense of disbelief. However, the moral ambiguity of the film is what makes it intriguing to watch.As a movie First Blood really falls short of being amazing in either story, setting or structure, but it's the kind of movie you have to watch to the very end once you start. Also it's by far one of Stallone's finest performances on film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like this movie very much.All the actors do a great job. Dennehy and Stallone of course are the most visible but a lot of credit to all the supporting cast as well.Many people think of it as an action movie.I happen to disagree.In many ways it is a tragedy. John Rambo can't cope with civilian society and society can't cope with John Rambo. What little communication there is soon breaks down and death, fear and sadness follows.Despite the shooty parts (or maybe because the action takes place to illustrate the helplessness of Rambo's rage and desperation as well as society's failure to care for their abandoned soldiers) I find it a though-provoking film an could perhaps even be called as a modern classic.The movie is good.So is the book.They are different, of course, but still: See the film.

		<shortDescription>An extremely well done action movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most deep and sensible of all the Rambo movies, no doubt about that. Sylvester Stallone stars as John Rambo, a man who has returned from the Vietnam war. In his past lie the horrors of the war. The long days when he was tortured by his captors and his body bears the scars of all that was done to him. He comes home to find that he has no friends left. And all of a sudden he finds himself in the hands of a cop who provokes all the war that lay deep inside him. And then, having been trained to kill and destroy all that came as a threat, Rambo wages a war as a one-man army on the whole police force. One of things I admire about Stallone's physique is that he looks like a soldier toughened up and built up because of his experience as a soldier. His muscles don't look like they have been subjected to artistic and systematic development. This gives him a tough look like that of a man who fought the toughest of battles in his entire life and the body came as a side product of it all. He does not fail to convince you that he indeed is a Green Beret who has done and seen it all. Like all action movies, Stallone's character does things that are humanly impossible. He jumps off cliffs and wages war on the whole city. While that does impress you as to what a war can do to the psyche of a man it still leaves you wondering how a man can do all this. But it does not matter. Action movies are meant to show things to you that do not happen in the real life and can happen in the reel life alone. These exaggerations can be easily forgiven. All in all, Stallone manages to deliver all the goods that are essential for an action movie - a bike chase, plenty of guns, strategical attacks and a lot of fireworks. But there is an emotional element to the movie as well. At the end of the movie, Rambo gets a chance to talk to his superior back in the war operations, the only person whom he can look upon as a friend and a guide. He breaks down and explains to him all that he has been through and how he has been left with nothing, how his life has completely been changed by the war and all the years spent fighting and getting tortured , living in a place where he witnessed the dark face of the human race. A highly recommended movie from my side. One of the best action movies of all times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rambo: First Blood was an amazing movie! As the movie started I was sitting on the edge of my seat not knowing what to expect from the extremely talented Sylvester Stallone. I was also extremely frustrated with the Sheriff not letting Rambo in his town all the poor guy was looking for was a hot meal to eat. Anyway I thought this movie also portrayed the strength of the United States Military by showing a Vietnam veteran trained in such a way where he was invincible to any situation he would encounter, throughout this epic film from stitching his own wounds to making bow and arrows. May I also add that this movie also had a well balance of both violence and bullets. Many times we see movies mostly military movies without plots and excessive amounts of unnecessary violence and bullets not in this movie, in this movie there was a plot a reasonable amount of violence and a marvelous conclusion! ~ Overall Rambo: First Blood is a must see for any movie lover! ~</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Thriller With A Hard Hitting Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give First Blood 7 and half stars out of 10. First Blood is the beginning of the Rambo character before he turned into a cartoon character with the other three movies, but the recent Rambo movie is less cartoony. First Blood is a good thriller, I don't really think of it as an action movie, although it is considered that, I just don't really think of it as an action movie, but there is action in it. It is mostly a thriller and a drama. But the other Rambo movies are pure action movies, and they deliver lots of it. This movie has a very powerful ending that is very hard hitting, when Rambo breaks down into anger and tears and reflects about his harsh time in the Vietnam War to Col. Trautman. It is very sad, and you feel very sorry for the Rambo character, you feel his pain. Very heavy stuff when he talks about what he went through in Vietnam with his friends getting killed over there, and Rambo gets nothing but hate when he comes back to America, and he starts to go to war with the people who hate him. The movie has very good characters, and there is interesting debates between them all, especially with the scenes between Brian Dennehy and Richard Crenna. The Brian Dennehy character is great at being the angry sheriff along with his other deputies. I like the jail scenes where they are treating Rambo badly and he then beats them all up and escapes. And Rambo is very quiet throughout the movie until the end. And there are some good stunts and action, and some cool explosions. It is sometimes kind of violent, but not too bad at all. I also like the scene where Rambo is hunting down the deputies one by one in the forest, its a creepy scene and I like how many different ways he takes them down. I really like the Col. Trautman character, and i like him in the other two Rambo movies. He is a good guy that really understands Rambo, and he is like a father figure to him, he is a good friend to Rambo. Its really interesting seeing Richard Crenna on screen doing his performance. And I like the lines he delivers too. And the movie has one of the best music in a movie ever, it has one of the most famous theme's, and that is the Rambo theme. I think First Blood is a good movie, but its not really a movie I would watch over and over again. I like all the Rambo movies, although they do have some weakness's, they are just very enjoyable to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is not like your average 80s action comedy, a la one-liners and an "action hero" type character.First Blood is more intelligent than that. While I love those type of action films, this film proves to be much more deep than that. Here we have a character whose emotions extend beyond one-liners. We have Rambo, a seriously disturbed Vietnam War veteran. Rambo is bad ass, but he has emotions, and that makes him very real.Another thing that is so nice about this film is how the "Vietnam vet vs. American citizen" issue is portrayed. While the audience is inclined to side with Rambo, the cops in this film aren't as ruthless as I expected. They are bad, but most of them don't appear to be ruthless.First Blood is entertaining, bitter, and overall one of the better action films ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going home from a war should be a happy homecoming. But not for John J. Rambo(Sylvester Stallone). He mentally unstable, and when the town began to abuse him, he goes off the deep end. Why did they do this? It's because of the local sheriff(Brian Dennehy). He made sure that no Vietnam veterans come here. One member of the police force admired Rambo. Others consider him a menace to society. The reason why most veterans come to the U.S. homeless is because of the stress from war. Rambo uses his combat smarts to take out the town. The only person who would understand him is Col. Trautman(Richard Crenna). The chase scenes was amazing. I liked the parts where the dirt-bike and the police car make the jump over the railroad crossing. The army truck scene is a classic. I liked it when the truck jumped the roadblock, and when the truck crashed the gas pumps and Rambo blew it up. The town should have know better than to ban Vietnam Veterans from coming home from the war. Goes to show they were being completely UN-American! Good movie, great role for Stallone!2.5 out of 5 stars!</fullReview>

You will also find a connection that you would want to be like him as a lonely guy who is starting hes own war in the Forrest because the police in a small town wouldn't let him in because they didn't like his face.

		<shortDescription>First Blood was only the start of it....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the 80's, a film was released that would change the way action movies felt. The film was First Blood and it made a little known actor called Sylvester Stallone into an international action star.Based on a novel about a disgraced and out of place Vietnam veteran by David Morrell, First blood tells the story of John J. Rambo who returns to America after a torturous tour of duty in Vietnam. His friends are gone, killed in action and he returns to a world where he is treated like either an alien or a criminal by the Police force. You see he's an outsider and they really don't like outsiders. Thus follows a brutal and torturous assault on Rambo by them. I felt that as i was watching the film, they were just as brutal as the Cong were in Vietnam. Finally something snaps and Rambo becomes a one man army who no-one can control. When push come to shove, Rambo has no mercy. he becomes unhinged and unstoppable. Relentless in his goal he will destroy anything or anyone who gets in his way (or severely hurt them if they're lucky). If you pose a threat, prey Rambo never comes for you. There is a poignant message in First Blood. Rambo is one of the many Vietnam war Veterans (whether fiction or factual) who returned after slugging their guts out fighting a losing battle that was the Vietnam war. Only to return unappreciated, unwelcome and unheard even ignored. The ones who lost their limbs or worse for a war no-one cared about. What hell these people must have gone through. I mean it makes you think, What was the whole point of fighting for a country that never cared? Why bother risking your life and body on the line only to have your neighbour spit back in your face and not give a damn? I have always felt sorry about these people since i decided to research the Vietnam war, it was a horrifying time. The things they did to people doesn't bear thinking about. So i was feeling sorry for Rambo from the very start. To go through all that and then get the treatment he got from the cops, he just didn't deserve it. He wasn't even hurting anyone for the first half of the movie, THEY were hurting him. I never felt sorry for the cops at all in this film, as far as i was concerned they deserved everything they got. They didn't deserve my pity, they bought on themselves. They really made angry off a vicious one man army so basically justice was served.First Blood contains great performances from Richard Crenna as Col. Trautman, Brian Dennehy as Sheriff Will Teasle, David Caruso (who found fame in NYPD Blue and CSI Miami) as a wet behind the ears deputy and of course Sylvester Stallone as the main character who became a hero to Vietnam vets and the American citizens by playing John J. Rambo. First Blood is easily a film that can be watched again and again and will stand the tests of time."What you call hell, he calls home"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best action movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Note: I plan on putting only one or two minor spoiler(s) in my review.Not only the best in the Rambo series, but one of the top action films ever made. In my opinion one things my the other Rambos were good, but not brilliant, was there lack of reality. Sure First Blood is in some places unrealistic, but at the time there were a lot of stories about Veitnam vets losing their heads a bit, so tormented by what they had seen. So the film made sense and felt real. The other films though, were a bit to much like Terminator and other films. While killing hundreds of people in a fiction film like Terminatior wouldn't bother you, it didn't work well for a supposedly realistic Rambo.Now on to the actual film. It's not about how many things you can blow up in an hour, this film is based on suspense. Just seeing Rambo setting up the traps tells you your in for a treat. There's a line in the film where Rambo's master tells the police force that they are the ones being hunted, which kind of makes you realise, how hard for Rambo to fit into normality again.The acting is superb, with a notably performance near the end where Stallone breaks down and tells how sad his life is. Sorry about the poor quilt of this review, I just can't be bothered to try and make it great, but I hope you can understand my appreciation for just an amazing film that still kind of holds up today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why doesn't Hollywood make such action movies anymore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie as a kid and simply loved it. Ever since I have been watching action movies in particular and now I find that there aren't such classics anymore. I considered if its because I grew up but realised that wasn't so. Because I watch this movie again whenever it shows up on television. It survives test of time I think for the following reasons. This doesn't need spectacular special effects. The stunt scenes weren't conceived first and then a story woven around it(Matrix Reloaded style). There is no unnecessary female lead. There is real heroism and characterisation. The characterisation of John Rambo is perfect. All through the movie you can relate to John Rambo. Rambo is a trained killing machine who returns home after serving in Vietnam. Yet he is soft at core and would never hurt an innocent person for his own survival. He carries grief of loss of his friends and hostility of his own country men. He would never surrender if you try to push him to corner. It is evident in the scene when the police fail to make him utter a single word inspite of all their bullying. The cops have no idea whom they are dealing with and the way they try to bully around Rambo is amusing. Two scenes involving John Rambo's mentor and the sheriff are my favourites as they sum up what John Rambo and the theme of the movie. The army man tries to explain the cop how fighting in war is different from enforcing law but the the cop fails to understand. Watch this on big screen or buy the DVD and watch it over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First blood has got to be one of the most ignored titles, but yet one of the best action movies of all time. a lot of people refer to it as Rambo 1, or just Rambo, but then again, that could be misleading, because of the new Rambo movie, which was released today, and that was titled Rambo.OK, enough with the rant about titles. let's talk about this movie. so we have a Vietnam war veteran who suffered 3 months in a Vietnamese POW camp and escaped to go back to the army, and win a congressional medal of honor. how awesome. soon as he gets home, people spit on him, call him a baby killer, and hate him. this guy keeps America the land of the free, and people are hating him.so there's no explanation as to why he's broke, and that he has no home (i'm sure that soldiers back in the 60s and 70's got paid as well as the soldiers in the modern time) but he doesn't. he wanders from town to town, living off the land, until one day, he arrives in hope (which is a real town. i know, because i've been there.) and is immediately pushed away by the leading policeman, which sends John. J Rambo into a series of events, which lead to the truth about most modern day veterans.I mentioned this before. this movie was filmed in Hope, British Columbia, and thats only a few miles from where I live. pretty much all the scenes were filmed in that location. and some of the places, such as the hope bridge, are well known, because thats where good old Sylvester Stallone (who still is one of the best actors of all time) drove an army truck through a roadblock. the town also has it's signature Chevrons and dairy queen (which are still there.) and it indeed is a small town.However, the movie is awesome, i suggest you go rent the new ultimate edition (because it has no trailers in it) but really, avoid the survival mode in it, because thats actually kind of lame and it makes you watch the same scene twice. plus, the lack of subtitles in the menu is kind of annoying (but this can be solved with the help of a Closed-captioned TV) 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior to Commando</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first in Sylvester Stallone's action franchise, First Blood is a good 80s actioner, managing to avoid the campness of similar genre films as Commando. Vietnam veteran John Rambo escapes from police and hunts them in a jungle. Stallone does well in both the action sequences and the drama; he manages to portray the traumatised man sympathetically. The horror movie staple of being tracked through the woods is cleverly reversed, although the tension does not have time to build and thus results in a missed opportunity - similarly, brief flashbacks to Rambo's time in a POW camp look interesting but are not expanded upon. Overall, a solid action film with good enough acting, but it doesn't include that extra something.3 / 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rated R for Language and Some Violence. Quebec Rating:13+ Canadian Home Video Rating:14AFirst Blood is the first movie in the Rambo trilogy.Now Rambo First Blood Part 2 and Rambo 3 are pure entertaining action films.But First Blood on the other hand is a drama/thriller mixed with a bit of action.This film has a good storyline and good acting.The movie is about Vietnam veteran John Rambo who just found out his army buddy died.He just walks into town minding his own business when the local sheriff of the town doesn't like the look of him and asks him to leave.Rambo comes back and is arrested for vagrancy.When he is being cleaned up, he has disturbing flashbacks of his Vietnam days and this causes him to snap,beat up all the cops and escape into the woods.From here on the movie turns into a police standoff.First Blood is a great movie but its my least favorite in the series.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best action/drama's ever made. The story is actually quite good if you like these kinds of movies. I think that it is realistic because of that. First Blood is full of action, drama, and lots of thrills. I think that Sylvester Stalone gives his best performance ever in this. This was a very good movie. The action is really good. The story and script are also really good. This movie is one of my 50 all time favorite movies. It is also one of my top ten favorite of all time in the action/drama genre. So, in the end, I liked this movie. You might not. I loved this movie and I hope that you like it as much as me. So, in the end, I loved it. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By no means the smartest but one of the most effective return-of-the-veteran movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akin to or rather an influence on other major action movies from the Russian 'Brat' to, lately, 'Apocalypto', 'Rambo: First Blood' is your by-now ordinary story of a simple man left alone to try and survive the day in defense of his individual good cause. It also fits into the series of post-Vietnam era veteran return movies, to where it belongs together with great films that are of course in a much higher league in many dimensions, take 'The Deer Hunter' for an example. In one dimension 'Rambo' may overcome those films, however. Specifically on the gut-instinct level it can out-power them. The unwelcome hero who just never really managed to return home after all those years, comes to be harassed and assaulted by the reckless local police of proverbial Swampville. You'll identify with him even if you yourself actually can't make, say, hand grenades out of milk and chocolate. You'll want to smash Swampville together with Rambo. Brian Dennehy, playing the local sheriff in the movie, does so well in the hated part that I guess he's fortunate if he hasn't met popular fury in some way in the period after the film was released.The film's power was enough to make me check on news stories about the Iraq veterans of nowadays - something I haven't done after films like 'The Deer Hunter', 'Jackknife' or 'Born on the 4th of July'. Of course, what one reads of in the papers is possibly only a small number of atypical cases, with the rest of the soldiers going home probably not being doomed because of having been over there. Still, there was enough horror in some of those stories. The difficulty of reintegration after an extremely formative period in one's life, spent in a faraway land, having brought life and death decisions every now and again. But I wouldn't want to emphasize the perceived link between Iraq and Vietnam, veterans share similar problems all over the world. For a change of perspective you may want to see the Iranian film 'Talaye sorkh' ('Crimson Gold', 2003), about a veteran of the Iran-Iraq war (the real First Gulf War). But firstly, of course, check out Rambo, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An action thriller to view absolutely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is clearly one of Stallone's best movies to date, and I like it a lot. It shows very well a situation that happened for real after the Vietnam war: soldiers who weren't welcome in their own country and who were simply rejected by everyone like outcasts in a elementary school. John Rambo lived this nightmare, and he had his own psychological war in the film. After all he endured you can feel pity for him, and it adds a touch of sadness to the plot, which is very good.Also, First Blood contains suspense unlike its 2 sequels (who are rather mindless and repetitive action films which I less like), and it makes this movie a classic to view and to enjoy.Steve Baillargeon</fullReview>

Excellent cast of characters, and Brian Dennehy was made for this role.Good story.....a bunch of small town cops that have nothing better to do than harass a drifter ( Very believable ) Excellent acting ( although Stallone is always questionable )and excellent rugged scenery.I suppose I'm a bit biased due to the fact it was filmed 45 minutes from where I live, but none the less very good. Just so you know, there are no wild boars here.....ha ha...but there are lots of things that would make a Billy Goat puke.......!It might get a bit carried away at the end, but all in all a good movie, and worth watching.

When he goes to a small town to get something to eat,he is taken out by a dirty cop who thinks he is king turd from S**t island. When he attempts to come back into the town the policeman beat him when he has visions of his torture in Vietnam, he easily beats them and escapes to the mountains,where his one man war begins...This is a Drama/action movie that is both funny(such as the bit where he blows up the shops or obtains the machine gun), or moving(such as his speech at the end,which is also funny due to Stallone's stuffed up voice) and is a classic,that should be watched by any fan's of the action genre. However,even though the storyline is bad,the second movie,First blood:Part II is way better in action scenes,and in my opinion is funny and at times and is possibly the best example of an action movie ever.</fullReview>

A sheriff does not like him and tries to make him leave town, Rambo refuses, the sheriff arrests him. In jail he is abused of. Rambo escapes showing us his fighting skills and takes to the woods as the sheriff and deputies try to find him in his element. Things get out of hand as Rambo's old commander appears to shed light on the situation. I remember there was a massive craze about this film when it first came out, it was such a hit.

		<fullReview>Rambo First Blood is the first and my opinion best movie of the Rambo trilogy, this is because he is a fugitive, rather than a hired hit-man. He is on the run firstly from the local police, then state police and finally the national guard gets called in. There are some humorous moments in the film for example if you have watched the film you might find the "bazooka" scene funny as the part time national guardsmen don't want to get themselves killed looking for one man. Overall i have to say it is a brilliant film with good acting and a very good setting in the mountains of the pacific north-west. I would recommend it to anyone who is into action/fugitive movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome one man war action flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First Blood tells the story of John Rambo, a Vietnam vet who has returned to the United States haunted by the horrors of war. As he passes through a small town, he is arrested by the Sheriff for drifting. Rambo's mistreatment in prison brings on terrifying flashbacks of his treatment in a POW camp, and he escapes from the jail house and flees into the surrounding mountains. The police hunt him, and soon he is forced to fight a one man war against the town to stay alive. This may seem like your average cheesy, brainless action film, but it's awesome action and suspense puts it above the others.This movie is about a man who, even though he's back home, hasn't left Vietnam. He is haunted by memories of his time in a POW camp, the deaths of his best friends, and the way he felt when he returned home to a far less than warm welcome. When he is arrested and treated badly simply for passing through and having long hair and a 5 o'clock shadow, he snaps. At first it's a fight to get away. Then it becomes a fight to stay alive. I liked how John Rambo didn't have that many lines in the movie. The movie allowed his facial expressions and the other characters to get the point across. The action scenes are fantastic, particularly when Rambo uses army tactics and camouflage to subdue the police that are hunting him. I didn't mind the father/son relationship between Rambo and his former commander and trainer, Col. Trautman, but I felt like Trautman was just there to say a few corny lines about how deadly Rambo is.The acting isn't bad. Sylvester Stallone plays Rambo the same as any other 80's action character he's played, but he does make a cool character. Richard Crenna is good as Col. Trautman, but the best performance comes from Brian Dennehey as the headstrong Sheriff Teasle.Overall, it's another 80's action movie, but with a cool story and some amazing action.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He Could Have Killed All of You!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"First Blood" has been crucified by the critics, but I totally disagree. Taken for what it is, its an excellent action film with memorable characters and plenty of excitement.John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone), a Green Beret special forces member, has returned from Viet Nam. He goes to visit the only other surviving member of his unit only to learn that his friend has died of cancer, caused by the chemicals he had been exposed to in the war. Now Rambo is truly alone. Trained to kill, his expertise is no longer needed as he tries to fit into society.While walking towards a small town, he encounters the local sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) who takes an immediate dislike to Rambo and winds up arresting him for vagrancy. When taken to the police station he refuses to cooperate and gets roughed up by sadistic deputy Galt (Jack Starrett). Rambo explodes and manages to escape into the wilderness.Rambo goes into the forested hills as Teasle and his deputies Ward (Chris Mulkey), Lester (Al Humphries), Shingleton (David Crowley) and Mitch (a very young David Carouso) pursue him. Rambo with his guerrilla training, takes each of them out in turn, injuring but not killing them except for Galt who plummets from a helicopter to his death.After Teasle believes that Rambo has been killed, he is greeted by Rambo's former commanding officer, Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna) who doubts that Rambo is dead. He tells Teasle that "he could have killed all of you if he so chose". Traupman manages to contact Rambo by radio and tries to talk him down. Rambo refuses and manages to make his way into the town where.................Stallone made an interesting statement in his DVD commentary. He likened Rambo to the Frankenstein's monster running amok in the forest attacking anyone whom he encounters. The monster was created by science and Rambo by the army. Both are thrust into an alien world and are seeking to find their place in it. That comment to me, puts the whole story in perspective and gave me a better appreciation of what the Rambo character is all about.Stallone like the monster, has little to say except for a soliloquy at the end. The casting of Dennehy as Rambo's chief protagonist, raises the film up a couple of notches. Crenna has little to do but give his famous looking down the nose stare. Starrett is good as the brutal Galt but he exits much too soon. Thet could have lost the unnecessary weekend warrior sequence without losing anything in the story.Followed by two sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Blood is not first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read "First Blood" I told everyone what a tremendous movie it would make. Imagine my surprise when I watched the movie "Ruckus" starring Dirk Benedict. (You may remember him as "Face" in the A?Team or as Starbuck in the original "Battlestar Galactica"). The hero's name was different but there was no doubt that this was the same story. Linda Blair had been added as a love interest but the battle against the small town sheriff by a disturbed Vietnam vet was definitely the story of John Rambo later made famous by Sylvester Stallone. I have spent years trying to convince others that this movie existed. It didn't help that I forgot its name. Fortunately I did remember it starred Dirk Benedict. Although not a great movie, it does satisfy the "machismo" ethos. In a way, Stallone's version was a let down. The book has a much grimmer ending than either movie. If Stallone-Rambo had suffered the fate portrayed in the book there could have been no sequels.</fullReview>

The movie has a very simple plot, marine returns home after war to find there's another war, minus the artillery.Even though I find the relationship between every character that comes in contact with John J. Rambo unforgettable.I have no experience with being any type of war as depicted in this film but I still feel his emotions and reactions towards the people he returns home to. Although the movie depicts the dark side of a Vietnam Vet returning home from a highly protest war I believe that it will serve as a reminder to those who don't have to go through such misery, that war in general always has its losers on both sides.But in Rambo's case he's justified because of a individuals stereotype.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First Blood (1982), more famously known as Rambo, is a film starring Sylvester Stallone in one of his two more well known roles - as the title character John Rambo (the other being Rocky). This film was made only 7 years after the end of the Vietnam War and was one of the first films to address the issue of the conditions of Vietnam Veterans. Although this film resembles the movie Deliverance (1972) (the hunting in the forest and mountains), it is an average action film that makes a point about Vietnam Veterans. Even though most of the film is average, a true gem happens to be the late composer Jerry Goldsmith's classic score (the theme is very memorable), as well as the late Richard Crenna as Rambo's former commander, Colonel Trautman Rambo's. A 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

Watching "First Blood" was a great experience for me, and I still remember the first time I watched it with my older brother almost 20 years ago.The movie is about a Vietnam Vet named John Rambo(Stallone), seeking up old Nam buddies after he returns from the War. This quest brings him to a quiet town with a sadistic Sheriff. The Shefiff named Teasle(Dennehy)is harassing Rambo and takes him into custody for nothing. Rambo manages to escape into the mountains were he prepares for his own "private war"...Rambo became a trademark in the 80ies and still is, the movie is action packed and well directed.

		<fullReview>One of my favorite Sylvester Stallone movies. It's exactly what America does to its very own. Judging people and seeing only what's in front of their eyes and making face value judgement right on the spot. America wants heroes that are defined by some fantastical criteria or fantasy standard that is ridiculous because it cannot be for people come from endless walks of life and many, many, many, different circumstances. America seems to identify with a fantasy hero like Superman, but that is only an ideal and that seems to have gone beyond that, Superman was created by two teenagers in the late 20s(I think. Joe Shuster and I can't remember the others name,I'll post it when I get it) Back to my point, people judging from appearances and stopping right there. I see this happening at work, especially at work, and in public places. I myself do not have a harshness on the homeless, for I have some insight that they the individual is already dealing with something that is too overwhelming for them to handle. First blood is definitely one of my favorite movies on the one of many subjects but the one about judging a person beyond the contact of the eyes. The eyes don't give you ALL the information. But, I see this far too many times in this country and the people in it from all races and ethnic groups. It's the real pasttime of America and people in general. Indeed, 'Never judge a book by its cover' but the very opposite of this saying is what is practiced in America.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sylvester Stallone knows how to pick his roles because this role was meant for him. Here he plays a troubled Vietnam War veteran who cannot adjust to a civilian society that rejects him for the very service that he rendered on behalf of his country, and now treats him as if he is the enemy. One can reasonably ask: Is this any way to treat a soldier who simply did his job? This question is implicit throughout this movie. The poor guy is hounded, harassed, mistreated, humiliated and ultimately spurned for no reason other than "he was passing through" and looked like he could be a "troublemaker." And what's even worse is that even the U. S. Army itself ignored him. As Rambo himself complains, he called his Colonel but was told the Colonel wasn't in. And when the Coloenl finally does respond, it's too little too late. Rambo has reverted to his soldierly ways in order to defend himself - this time against his own country.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sylvestor Stallon gives one of his greatest performances ever as war vet and green Barret soldier John Rambo. The story is told that Rambo walks around to the middle of the mountains to meet up with an old war buddy who he finds out died of cancer. When he is picked up by a small town sheriff, the sheriff mocks him and tells him not to come to his town again because it's his job to keep drifters like him out of it. Rambo is dropped off but he goes back to the town. The sheriff arrests him and takes him to jail. After being assaulted by officers and having horrible war flashbacks, Rambo goes nuts and destroys anything in his way. He escapes the station and goes into the hills for a war of his own. Now Rambo is a action icon! He is rough and tough, all violence. Richard Creena is just as great as Colonel Trautman, the man who trained Rambo. Brian Dennehy is superb as Sheriff Will, the mean law man who mocks Ramob. The story is both depressing and powerful as you see Rambo fight for his life for something he didn't do. The acting is not perfect but it succeeds in tension. The explosions are excellent from Rambo destroying the whole towns power grid to Rambo crashing cars. If you love hardcore action, you need to pick up a copy of Rambo. Rambo gets the big 7, depressing and sometimes slow but it works up a sweat to perform an excellent film. Recommended, enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First Blood, starring Sylvester Stallone, is a fast-paced, grab-on-to-your-seat-because-this-is-going-to-be-a-bumpy-experience, rush-of-blood-to-the-head action title.

The powerful message at the end of the story nearly made me weep. War vets come home, get booed by people, are rejected by job employers, and end up living in the streets begging for spare change. I mean, these troopers fight for our country, get whacked by high-caliber bullets, get their asses blown off by explosions, and possibly die for us, the Americans, and yet we do nothing but shun them away from our society when they return. This movie has a spectacular storyline, skilled actors, great visual effects and delivers quite a punch. WATCH THIS MOVIE! Or you're a fool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there is one character for which Sylvester Stallone will always be remembered,it is John Rambo.In this film,the first part of a very well-made trilogy,Rambo comes back from the war,only to discover that one of his army buddies,the last one he thought to be alive,has succumbed to cancer.He is in a depressed frame of mind and walks into a small town called Hope,when the local sheriff confronts him and tells him to get lost,because he and the townsfolk don't like drifters like him.He drives Rambo out of town,only to find that Rambo is walking back towards it.It is here that the trouble starts.Rambo is arrested(we wonder why)and booked for vagrancy.He then falls into the hands of a sadistic bunch of cops who mistake his indignant silence for defiance and torture him without any clear reason whatsoever.Rambo realizes these apparently 'peaceful ' people are actually as brutal as the Vietnamese he fought against in the war,and deserve to be dealt with the same way. He lets loose the ruthless,invincible Green Beret inside him,and wages a relentless one-man war against a whole army,till his former commander in Vietnam,Col.Trautman steps in and makes him see sense.Rambo decides to give up,but not before he delivers a stirring speech that reminds the audience that the Vietnam war was a very real war,fought by patriots,and not something to be easily forgotten.Sylvester Stallone delivers one of his best performances in this film,while Richard Crenna as the Colonel is convincing enoughto make us understandthat Rambo is a hero and not a psychopathic maniac,and deserves the full respect of the American public.The last lines Rambo speaks before surrendering are directly aimed at the people who harbor anti-Vietnam war sentiments.Director Ted Kotcheff does a great job exposing the fact that people as dangerous as the Vietnamese are lurking within America itself ,people who would kill an innocent man just for the fun of it.This film goes way beyond glorifying Vietnam war veterans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"First Blood" - A necessary action film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...That got bogged down by the monosyllabic and ridiculous action set-pieces of its later sequels. "First Blood" saved star Sylvester Stallone's then-fledgling career and in doing so, created an American action hero icon that would eventually come to rival the likes of Schwarzenegger and Norris in later years.But, people today may look back at this violent film from 1982 and laugh at the fact that Stallone was involved in its production; probably the stereotypical images of the later sequels drag down the experience. (Why, oh, why did the world's political climate play into this character's demise in the '80s?)"First Blood" is also very easily one of Stallone's best and most skilled acting performances, being that his dialogue is kept to a minimum (at least until his dramatic and emotional tirade at the end), and instead allows his character's motivations and violent actions speak for themselves.Adapted from the novel by David Morrell and deftly directed by Ted Kotcheff, it tells the story of disturbed Vietnam veteran and ex-Green Beret John Rambo (Stallone), who arrives in a small town in the Pacific Northwest looking to reunite with an old buddy from his days in the service.While walking down the road, he's approached by the town's no-nonsense sheriff, Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy), and from their first encounter, Teasle and Rambo immediately don't like each other. Teasle then demands that Rambo leave the town and is willing to escort him to the town's limits and forget any misunderstandings that may have come between them. But because Rambo knows that he has broken no laws and is being treated unfairly by the sheriff, he then takes this small town sheriff and the National Guard to war.Using his expert combat training, Rambo is able to successfully elude his would-be captors in several suspenseful and climatic action sequences set in the Pacific Northwestern wilderness. Teasle becomes obsessed with capturing this wanderer who's turned his town into a war zone. It seems that Rambo can only be stopped by Rambo, or some thoughtful coaxing by his former colonel, Samuel Trautman."First Blood" has already gained a reputation for being a tension-filled and skillful action movie that surprisingly has very few explosions and a low body count. You would think that a movie dealing with such tumultuous subject matter would be splattered with wall-to-wall with action, wouldn't you? That's what I thought at first, but again, this is a movie that apparently likes to keep things to a minimum, and that could include action scenes.Under the film's surface, however, it tells a story of a man so deeply affected by his wartime experiences that he has difficulty separating his battlefield nightmares from peacetime stability. Stallone gets all of this just right and in healthy doses. Dennehy is also quite menacing as the obsessive sheriff, a 'Nam veteran himself, who makes the terrible mistake of setting off a brutal war that eventually, no one ever wins."First Blood" is a definitive and (dare I say it) marvelous action film that should be separated from its sequels and negative pop culture influences. Instead, it should be viewed on its own, without any outside intrusion, and let it stand alone as a testament to a horrific war that destroyed more lives than it ever saved.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rambo was a vet from 'Nam, all his buddies were dead, for Christ sake all he wanted was a bite to eat or maybe a shower and a shave. But what did they give him instead? I'll tell you what they gave him, non-stop harassment and bullying. He didn't like that though, made him kinda mad. So he went AWOL! And I mean AWOL! Rambo was a man on the edge you see, really volatile and quite a loose cannon. He didn't take kindly to the cops messing him around. So he went on a wild killing spree, into the forest of course, with the whole police force on his tail! They shoulda stayed at home mind, those who got close ended up dead, because Rambo didn't dig prisoners. Sure he only set traps at first, but they kept on coming, so what else could he do? Rambo is cinematic brilliance, a non-stop action ride with countless shootouts, explosions and fights! Watch out for Sly's incoherent monologue at the end, truly hilarious. I could barely understand a word he bawled out! Go see this film if you haven't already, if you have, go see it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb action film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people will damn this one on the reputation of the name Rambo - but it didn't earn it. Rambo II was dire, and Rambo III was even worse. But Rambo : First Blood, the first of the series, was wonderful - and like some of the best first-films followed by awful sequels, it was based on a book, while the sequels were just moneyspinners. Stallone, unfortunately, went on to do too many of these sequels - and because of those embarrassing sequel films, people will likely overlook the good films that started the whole chain off.Rambo is a superb example of just what an action film should be. The characters have enough depth to carry the story - they aren't very deep, really, with the possible exception of Rambo himself - but it's an action film, not a character drama, and they STILL manage to be much more interesting people than many, with more believable and interesting emotional motives than most of the characters you'll find in more recent Hollywood action flicks.This film has one element which, for me, really makes some of the best action films work as well as they do - tension. The tension is most effectively delivered in a fairly limited environment, and you see it in some of the best examples of the genre. This film has the town and its surrounding woods and hills. Die Hard has its single, inescapable building. Predator has its forests. The people are, in one way or another, completely tied up in that environment, too - Rambo can't (or won't) leave, because he is pursued, and he's driven to revenge. John McClane's wife is in the building in Die Hard. And in Predator - how can you escape from something you can't see, in an environment that stretches out so far? The tension is driven home, because you focus on the way the characters all interact, as they're caught up in this captive environment, rather than flashy, exciting chase-scenes.If you haven't seen this film yet (and you either enjoy or can tolerate Stallone in films), then go down to your local video store, dig out a copy, and pay the three bucks it'll cost to rent. It's worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good story, told very well. What really makes the movie work is the antagonistic relationship between Brian Dennehy's sheriff character, and Richard Crenna's Army Colonel character. These are exceptional character actors, who shine in this. They are the characters who explain and flesh out the story, while Stallone acts it out. Very effective character played by Stallone, a troubled, haunted Vietnam vet, mistreated by small-town, small-minded law enforcement. These guys feel justified in abusing strangers and drifters who wander into their town; probably because the town feels exactly this way toward outsiders. The movie has something significant to say about who people really are, regardless of their appearance or dress.Well done portrayal by Stallone; of enragement and vengeance, and pain, suffering and emotional disturbance. The man won't win any acting awards but, given the right character, he can act.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can be harsh about a lot of things, but not this movie. By far one of Stallone's best performances, with Sly becoming a battered vet who you must emphasize with. John Rambo is a truly tragic hero, who is desperately tring to find peace in a world where men like him are disrespected and hated. The police see him as a vagabond, a shiftless reminder of all the things that are wrong with their society. Trautman considers him a failed project, indeed it is his grief more that Rambo has been caught up in this war with the authorities than that the man himself is struggling with demons of the mind. A must see for everyone, and nowhere near as violent as people think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FIRST BLOOD is an true action classic from the 80s, and the story behind the movie would be worthy a document any day: from a best-selling novel the production spent almost a decade in various stages of development hell with different people- 6 directors had been attached to the project as well as Dustin Hoffman starring! Finally it got made with executive producers Mario Kassar &amp; Andrew Vanja (taking the risk of their lives) and the reluctant Stallone starring. Even then it got wrapped behind schedule and way over budget. But like a Phoenix it rise from the ashes and blew everyone away! The movie introduced us both THE action icon of the decade, and a new sub-genre (one-man army) in action movies. Kotcheff did a brilliant job with long shots (the slow opening scene is a classic!) and pacing, and Jerry Goldsmith got robbed at the Oscars!PS. Makes me wonder - if a similarly GREAT movie gets made today with similar problems, it can just kiss box-office goodbye. Back then people were more interested in the product and willing to take chances, now it's all about the image. SIGH, the good old days... :)</fullReview>

That idea fits better to its sequels (especially R3). Here I found the story of so many anonymous war veterans who came out of Vietnam disaster ignored (or even hated) by their own country. The real story of people going mad after the violence in enemy field and hate and scorn in own. In fact, finding that hard strong man who fought on his own against so many men well armed and prepared, breaking down and crying in the final scenes with the Colonel Trautman, telling him the bitterness and pain of having lost all of his friends in the war and feeling insulted and offended by the people he fought for (calling him "child murderer" and other worse things) makes this movie worth watching once and once again. So don't only look at the combative &amp; violent surface of this movie ('cause it won't probably tell U a thing) &amp; take a look at what lies underneath. Then you'll also find it great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Top of the line story and action, refered to as the Father of Modern Action Films, First Blood is still flying off video shelves, and it was released in the fall of '82. Everyone caps on Stallone and calls this movie cheezy, but he was blowing up the box office for 5 years before while Shwarzenegger was having 10cc of Winstrol and Dianabol for breakfast. Here's a HUGE secret Arnold Redefined cheezy, not to forget Chuck Norris. But back to First Blood. It's only 96 min. with a great story, and a knockout cast. Richard Crenna is superb as Troutman. The oustanding fact of the movie is that Rambo didn't kill anyone. I must also ask has anyone seen The Hunted? O.K. Del Toro: Trained killer*, U.S. Army*, ends up Portland, Oregon*, ends up in jail wipes out a guy or 2 the escapes, and is on the run from cops, and the man who trained him. In the mountains, Tommy Lee Jones hunts him down and kills him. Which is what was supposed to happen in the original cut of First Blood, and IS* what happened in the novel First Blood. Get the facts people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FIRST BLOOD (1982) spoiler alert((( In the early 80ties we hadn't got tired of Stallone, we had barely seen the fellow before he showed up on the screen as a Vietnam - vet. ready to burst. Well,the thing is; this is a pretty good actionmovie and no one can take that from it! Its independent, entertaining, tough, highly dramatic and interesting. Sylvester Stallone delivers one of his best performances ever (together with the first Rocky).STORY: A home coming soldier, former Special Forces Nam vet. John Rambo has got some serious mental wounds after the war, his only remaining friend lives out on a depressive countryside, when he finally reaches the place he gets to know that his Nam friend died of cancer last year. Rambo is alone. While walking in the wilderness he soon gets in trouble with the local cops, he kicks down the sheriff and his helping men and soon he runs out in the wilderness, out in the forest, alone. He gets the cops after him...and they're pretty p*ssed off on the Vietnam soldier...now, Rambo has started his own war...Very amusing! Very nice piece of action! We get a lot of different kindof nice genre flashes here: we get flashbacks from Vietnam showing Rambo getting tortured, we get a lots of nice characters; we get Rambo showing of his best bits from Nam experiences - but the ending scene is very nice I think, showing Rambo sitting in a totally smashd up house talking out about his mental problems to his Colonel Trautman, that was in the same group together with him back then. That's a very nice scene I think, maybe Stallone doesn't do his best performance right then, but the mood and Vietnam - psycho rubbish, really gets you thinking about the poor bastards.Rambo: First Blood stands alone as a one hitter very nicely, allthough the sequels aren't that bad it maybe had got a better reputation if it had been a outsider sort of. I recommend this movie, it is after all thee original one-man-starts-getting-angry movie! STARS: **** 4/5 (it pushes to the fifth star!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautifully realised fable of injustice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stallone had milked the Balboa character dry by this point (Rocky III was released earlier the same year), and so John Rambo was a good alternative, offering the same character type in a different role. The result is a tougher polemic on behalf of the American working class (they who comprised the forces in the Vietnam conflict).It's a little touch and go though. Brian Dennehy's rasping Sheriff Teasle is not matched by Crenna's excitable Colonel Trautman - a jedi-ish role manquee for Samuel L Jackson, for example - and the action loses it narrative blade towards the end, in pursuit of a clean resolution of the grudge which kicks it all off.But the pathos isn't in the acting or the action but in the painfully beautiful backdrops against which it's all played out, visual and aural. Andrew Laszlo paints on each frame as if on a canvas (he wants you to look at the film not put you in it) and a fine score from Jerry Goldsmith. Again. If you, as many, though it was too violent then, now's the time for a second look - 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isnt just a movie, this is an incredible movie. Personally I dont care for the 'vet' issue, but for more like any ordinary person. Heres a guy walking down the highway who wants to get something to eat, and then comes along the Sherriff. It was right on the money, lets face it, have you ever met a nice cop? It is true, society can drive a person to do what John J Rambo did in this movie. I think its more a lesson to the cops that being judgemental is wrong. Who were the cops to judge John J Rambo for walking down the highway wearing a jacket because he's a vet? All he wanted was something to eat, and he would have moved on...but no, like all cops out there, they brought on the war themselves when they pushed an innocent man to insanity with accusations and lies...What a pleasureable ending with the M16 shooting of the sherriffs station, I hope someday more people stand up to themselves, espically if you're innocent, then show the world that the justice system just doesnt work and society is responsible for its own actions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First Blood has its weaknesses. There are some editing flaws that take a little bit away from the movie-going experience (i.e. the escape from the sherriff's office), as well as some assumptions that must be made about Sherriff Teasle's previous encounters with vagrants. However, the strengths overcome such passable flaws. The story is powerful, meaningful, and fun. The variations that Stallone made to the Rambo character are interesting in comparison to Morrell's Rambo and overall add to the style of movie that was produced. Well acted, well-produced (for its time), and delivers to the audience. Stallone does a fine job of getting the audience to sympathize with Rambo's (and other Vets) difficulty adjusting to civilian life after war; Dennehy makes a very good macho law enforcement officer; Trautman's quiet power was done brilliantly by Crenna. Not a perfect movie, but perfectly balanced adventure, survival, action, social commentary, and fun for the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, I'll have to declare what baggage I bring to this movie. Before Rambo: First Blood I was a big fan of war movies (like A Bridge Too Far), and I loved the forests, especially pine forests. When I first got to see this (after 1983), this was great. I dug the landscape (home of Grunge) and Vietnam stories were still few and far between. Anything good just wasn't there. Nothing had really been done on Vietnam. Nothing like Tour Of Duty, but lots of pseudo-Vietnam stories like The Deer Hunter and Apocalypse Now. As such, this is again not a real Vietnam story, but a post-Vietnam story. Sylvester Stallone plays a ex-Special Forces veteran who apparently was sent out to eliminate enemy personnel, and wants to visit the home of one of his comrades. By the book Sherif Brian Dennehy decides to push him around, until Stallone decides to "push back" and bring guerilla warfare to Colorado. This is a very lean, very effective little movie, that maintains most of it's credibility for three quarters of the show. This movie was followed by several sequels, of varying quality.First Blood was one of Stallone's main franchises (next to the Rocky series) and helped kick off and fuel the lone super-action hero genre of the 80s with superstars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris and lesser knowns, Jean-Claude van Damme, Jeff Wincott, Jeffrey Speakman, Thomas Ian Griffith and more. Look for small cameos from then (1982) still unknown actors, David Caruso, Michael Talbott (Stan Switek in Miami Vice) and Chris Mulkey.This is a classic movie, only paralleled in it's effectiveness and lean budget by the hyper-realistic LRRP documentary-styled "84 Charlie Mopic".</fullReview>

That is what the best movies do. They draw you into the screen. This is an American story in many ways, mainly because of the Vietnam vet stuff and the general feeling of an individual against the crowd. I couldn't understand--literally--everything that Stallone said to Troutman at the end about Vietnam, etc. His annunciation was poor, as he was very emotional in those scenes.

		<fullReview>No one would call "First Blood" an accurate portrayal of Vietnam veterans. It's a jingoistic, Regan-era action movie, shamelessly manipulative and completely implausible. It pales next to the realism of "Taxi Driver" or "Born on the Fourth of July." Judging from the setup, I strongly suspect that the source material, the novel by David Morrell, was much more literate and realistic. Indeed, as a film project, this property has passed through several studios, directors, and stars before Stallone took over. It would have been interesting to see the material in the hands of more serious filmmakers, but that will surely not happen for decades. Still, taken on its own as an action movie, it's not half-bad. You really can't take it seriously, but it's acceptable escapism that's short and to the point, unlike some modern films of the genre. (Do these James Bond flicks really have to run past the two-hour mark?)Regardless of the script shortcomings, Stallone himself is effectively cast. He rarely speaks, letting his facial expressions and body language do all the acting for him. His loneliness, instability and internal tension is believable, even if the script isn't. It's interesting to note that he's more of an anti-hero in this film than he is in most other movies. He's like Travis Bickle on steroids. The coda does allow him to show some vulnerability for once, though his monologue is such an obvious way of making an ideological point. When he's onscreen "First Blood" doesn't let up, but I didn't like it when the film focused on Brian Dennehy, who plays a sheriff determined to capture him. This two-dimensional character often got on my nerves. It might have helped if more insight had been provided for him; why did he react so negatively to Rambo's presence from the start? In contrast, Richard Crenna provides solid support as Stallone's former mentor from his Greet Beret days.Stallone's action scenes, while lacking in credibility, are quite engaging. The cinematography casts an appropriately cold, brittle parlor over everything. The mountains and forests are characters in their own right; even John Rambo himself is overwhelmed by their cold majesty. One of the best scenes is the forest hunt; the setting and action make for an appropriately eerie, suspenseful sequence. Despite the relatively low budget, it's still a more visually interesting movie than a lot of other action films. It's still not a cinematic classic, but it's much better than you'd expect from an early-eighties B-movie. I won't lie and say it's good art, but it's fairly entertaining and well-crafted.**1/2 (out of ****)Released by Carolco Pictures (thru Orion)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies that Sylvester Stallone did. He actually wrote the screenplay for this movie, and his talents are visible. Stallone plays John Rambo, a Vietnam vet who is more or less a drifter, wandering from place to place. When the movie opens, Rambo is on his way to visit one of his old friends from his unit from Vietnam only to find out that he died from cancer. As it turns out, he died from exposure to agent orange that was used in Vietnam. Rambo then wanders into a small town to look for something to eat. The local sheriff there, Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) doesn't like Rambo from the very beginning. This was probably one of the best acting jobs by Dennehy. Rambo is arrested for vagrancy, and immediately set upon by one of the sheriff's deputies. He is hosed down like an animal, and is in the process of being dry shaved, and totally flips out. He begins reliving one of his nightmares from Vietnam, and beats up the sheriff and his deputies and escapes from the jail. The chase scene afterward is great, and Rambo outwits the sheriff, and runs into the forest. The sheriff uses every means at his disposal to recapture Rambo to no avail. While the sheriff and his deputies are searching for him, he attacks them all, including the sheriff. He informs the sheriff that he could have killed them all, and warns him to back off. When Rambo's commander shows up to assist in capturing him, it turns into a real confrontation between him and the sheriff. Richard Crenna plays his commander, and does a great job. He tries to point out to the sheriff that it would be wise to just let Rambo escape and capture him later on, but to no avail. This sheriff is determined to get Rambo one way or another since he killed one of his deputies. Trautman (Crenna) tries to explain that with kind of survival training and combat training Rambo has had, the sheriff's men are no match for him. Rambo ends up in a cave,fighting for his survival. National guardsmen blow the cave up,thinking they killed Rambo, but are surprised when he shows up later. He steals an army truck loaded with weapons, and blows up a gas station in town, then blows up a sporting goods store before catching up with the sheriff. Rambo wants to kill the sheriff, but Trautman talks him out of it. Rambo then breaks down, relating to Trautman what it was like to come home from Vietnam, and be treated like nothing. I have this movie on VHS, and I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admit it: I was wrong. All the years I've seen Sylvester Stallone as yet another dumb jock hero, and I've avoided watching his movies because they seemed to contain too much drama for me. I'm an action movie guy: I like it when things blow up.Since then, I've gained great respect for the guy. Check out "Oscar", which is hilarious. Did you know that he wrote the script for "Rocky"? Anyway, "First Blood" is quite dated and we've seen flashier action films since 1982. But there's a real story here, and I got a connection to some of the anguish that Vietnam vets had coming home and not getting a parade, just the reverse. And although there is a lot of drama, its not overly arty or melodramatic, and the pace is fast enough. The trip underground is sort of a rebirth: I get it!Who should see this film:-- Action movie buffs, even if you don't like dramas: this one'ssafe-- Drama movie buffs who might like the occasional action flick-- Everyone like me who stereotyped Sy Stallone and should dopennance. But see "Oscar" and "Rocky" first.I'll give "First Blood" a surprisingly resilient 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine dramatization of the need for absolute victory in battle and what happens when a soldier who is forced to accept defeat.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sylvester Stallone gives a brilliant performance as John Rambo; a highly skilled and decorated army veteran of the Vietnam War. Brian Dennehy plays the typical "jerk-water" town sheriff who arrests him for the misdemeanor charges of "vagrancy" and also for having a larger than average hunting knife used primarily for survival purposes. What follows is more than the entire town is prepared to handle as Rambo escapes the controlled custody of the very mean, un-wise, overweight sheriff and his group of sadistic and stupid deputies. The pursuit is then on, as the cops (with the assistance of equally stupid, ill-equipped and under-trained pseudo-macho army weekend warrior national guardsmen types pursue Rambo deep into the woods. Rambo uses all his skills to survive their advances and shows great restraint in his struggles against these "defenders of democracy". The casualty count just keep getting larger until US Army Colonel Trotter (well played by Richard Crenna), arrives on the scene in an attempt to stop him. Things just keeping getting worse for the sheriff until the exciting climax where some of the most important points of the movie are made. This is a MUST SEE movie for the important lessons it teaches about freedom. Just stay out of "small town" America. Especially if you are a military veteran of the Vietnam era or later and don't fit into the acceptable image of a "respectable" citizen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**POSSIBLE SPOILERS**The success of FIRST BLOOD owes much to its spare use of dialogue, and reliance on engaging set pieces of physical acting. Not a revolutionary template for an action film, but there is a tendency for films of this genre to be weighed down by unimaginative sequences or dull pretentious rhetoric. Here a naturalist formula works due to economical pacing and the willingness of the lead to push himself in physically demanding scenes throughout. Ultimately however the picture succeeds in making its anti-war statement without becoming stuck in sentimentality (see BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES), and as such excels further by making valuable comments about displacement and alienation without losing an objective viewpoint. The combination of a well-translated message within a commercial action picture makes for a composed yet entertaining picture.The small town forest setting of Hope works in its representation of a greater US misunderstanding and hostility towards its own Vietnam veterans. The local characters are accessible and manageable (though somewhat too narrow minded) as barometers of the initial inability of civilians to accept veterans of a morally unjust war (though as the town's title and low fatality rate suggest there will be greater understanding). The blame for this rests squarely with the establishment, as it is the law that instigates the animosity and is thus the target of retribution (the one death being an unprofessional cop). Overall the low-key realism offsets the normal tendency of action films to negate location as merely a playground of destruction, and rather showcase overblown characters and pyrotechnics. Not to suggest that over the top action with pulp dialogue and big guns doesn't hold merit (see PREDATOR). Rather the weight of this picture is not compromised by an excessive depiction of weapons or cartoonish dialogue and as such retains a balanced naturalistic result (there is enough violence, explosions and machinery to satisfy).The economical pacing provides for no gaps where time lags. All the action sequences contain the right mix of good composition, well executed stunts, realism and tension. The period between Stallone's leap from a rock face to his ambush of the police force is especially memorable. Not least for the action, but also for it's role reversal of hunter and hunted and ironic use of the guerilla tactics that were so effective for the Vietcong. The scene is efficient in highlighting the US as ill prepared for combat both at home and abroad. The intermissions between Crenna and Dennehy, do not fail to please by either stressing the need for a revision of understanding concerning veterans, or by entertaining and keeping the picture grounded as an action film with imaginatively bombastic dialogue.The pain of war, that of the alienated individual (veteran) or of a country coming to terms with assimilating its displaced soldiers (town), is conveyed physically. The body is abused throughout the film and minimal attention is given to the mental hardships of coming to terms with war and its consequences (see BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY). Emotional weight, in the form of searching dialogue, which may have offset the action, is only delivered at the end in a cathartic speech. The effect of omitting heavy dialogue and relying on action to convey the effects of war avoids any danger of the picture becoming stuck in mawkish drama (see COMING HOME). The result still retains an objective viewpoint in its anti war message without losing its impact as an action film. Not that it lacks depth in relation to its composition. Stallone's final speech is in line with the ambitions of the film by succinctly outlining themes of alienation, mistrust of the establishment and hopelessness.The appeal of FIRST BLOOD is its ability to satisfy on many levels despite being primarily an action picture. The film delivers a strong core message on the effects displacement and assimilation. It maintains a subversive element with its anti establishment views and questions what the establishment was doing to help. Indeed the film can be viewed as a western with its themes of civilization, order, alienation, and violence that are prevalent in the genre. The destruction of the community and its values are needed to highlight the war at home. There are even noirish elements suggested by its somber mood (rain, dark), fatalistic composition (his last friend killed by cancer from agent orange) and the soldiers existential crisis upon returning home.It is credible that the film raises these issues economically and still retains freshness as an action item. A critique of a similar film, THE DEER HUNTER, which although being far grater in scale and scope, fails regularly in its attempt to convey the ambiguity of veterans (traditionally heroes) returning from a questionable war. It contains too many maudlin sequences that fail in their awkwardness (the transparency of trying to emote pathos best seen in the portentous ending). I rather prefer the dry delivery of pulp hyperbole in reply to the issue of sending troops to capture Rambo (the reference being to the commitment of troops to Vietnam and the difficulty of repatriation of veterans):'You send in that many don't forget one thing' 'What?' 'A good supply of body bags!'</fullReview>

Acting is surprisingly good and even Sly does a great job. This movie would have probably got the credit it deserves if it was released when the war had just ended and things were still hot (maybe in the early seventies). I'm sure the impact would have been much greater back than. It is ridiculed by its violence but you actually only see three or four people die in the movie (and one was an accident)! All in all I would say that First Blood is great action movie if not a great movie.</fullReview>

It has been criticised for it's lack of dialog, however, I found it coherent with Rambo's character. John Rambo (at least in first blood) is not an almighty hero, is just a human being with weaknesses that has the right military training.It was a very nice surprise and I fully recomend it, in fact, the only thing I hated from the movie was the horrible end song.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Acting is always a physical art - rarely this good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's start with a rule of thumb: no film featuring Brian Dennehy can be a bad film. This is important because Dennehy plays the villain here, and a hero is only as heroic as the villain makes him be.Then let's look at another principle, voiced by Lord Olivier who once said acting wasn't particularly hard, just a matter of remembering your lines and not bumping into the props. What he was saying, so glibly, was that acting is part cerebral and part physical. Too many critics forget the latter half. You find them praising the films of John Cassevetes, who uses close-ups more than any director I could name, but they think his films are about the dialogue - they are just as much about the facial expressions of the people delivering it. This film has fewer words than 28 minutes of a daytime soap, as a local critic once wrote as a putdown; to me that's high praise. One of the difficulties is that most critics are highly literate people and, being brought up on books, they tend to think words are the most important element of a story. They downgrade physical action. First Blood is almost like Japanese kabuki theatre in its emphasis on physical action over words. Text-based critics can criticise Stallone for his chest-acting, but I say there isn't a chest - or a pair of biceps - that can act better, and physical acting is what this film calls for. He's great. Unfortunately, the dialogue that does exist is mostly pretty bad. Its like a sledgehammer driving home points that the action has already made. The speech at the end, especially, is seen by some other users as explaining why John Rambo is mad at the world; I thought the visit Rambo made to an old comrade's home at the start of the film, and the treatment he received from Dennehy's bad guys, was rationale enough for all that follows. In fact, as I suggested, whatever capacity for the lead role Stallone might have lacked is made up for him by the quiet force of Dennehy - just like that little wimp Luke Skywalker being made a hero by the epic evil of Darth Vader.The scenery is gorgeous - and becomes integral to the action. The long periods without dialogue are refreshingly daring. And I love the fact that the plot calls for John Rambo to be buried and rise again. The resurrection of the hero as an invincible avenger has become almost a staple of action movies ever since.Action is a much neglected skill in movies, and physical acting is a much undervalued skill, too. I think this film is almost a masterpiece. Had they left out a bit more dialogue, it would have been complete.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While growing up I thought First Blood was annoying, boring and drab. I was really too young to understand what a good plot was. After watching this movie as an adult, I absolutely loved it. Now that I look at it, compared to the other Rambo movies, First Blood had a believable plot, strong acting and a good story line. As a son of a Vietnam veteran, I actually felt the pain of a ex-soldier who just needed a friend. Although muffled in his accent, the speech about "nothing being over" was very strong and meaningful. Why should someone who spilt his guts for his country be unaccepted in a society he defended? Rambo talks about how he was in charge of multi million dollar equiptment in the service but at home he can't even be offered a job washing cars... is it fair for out country's veterans to be overlooked? All Rambo wanted was something to eat, but a small town sheriff wouldn't even let him do that in his town. First Blood is about one man's fight to survive in a cruel world. It portrays the dark ages of Post-Vietnam.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It`s rare when you come across an action movie that you can watch over and over again and still like it!! But First Blood is an exception. Their are two characters Stallone is known for Rocky and Rambo, and he does a great job at both of them. Not very many movie stars are known for two characters like Stallone is!! It`s hard to say which character i like the most their a little bit alike both have the odds against them and both are quiet characters. Anyways back to Rambo their are a couple of scenes in this movie that i would consider as the best action scenes ever filmed. first, has got to be the forest scene when Rambo uses his camouflage tactics to take out the police officers tracking him. Second, the cliff scene when Rambo jumps off a cliff and into a tree and uses the tree to cushion his fall, great stuff!!! If you`ve ever wanted to see the police lose this is the movie for you. Also this is a great DVD movie because you can go right to your favorite action scene. rating (best of 5 stars) .....3 1/2.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie begins with some antiwar messages, especially concerning Vietnam. We see mentally unstable vet who finds out that his war mate has died of cancer because of the poison that US army spread on the battlegrounds. Also, he is unable to overcome disturbing images of war terror and apparently has problems to continue his life. Police force present cruel society that has no understanding for individuals who fought in the name of American government.But, soon, the movie becomes its own antithesis. In many dull action sequences he is almost presented as a superhero which leads us to believe that American elite squad is quite unbeatable. Of course, here, that message is subtle, but in sequels it is more than visible. It seems that US Army desperately sought for a way to appeal to young disillusioned generations - Rambo looks like a hippie and an outcast from society who is in fight with authorities.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... says Rambo to the guy who made him, Colonel Trautmann? he couldn't be righter. You know this situation when you underestimate the strength or the dangerous power of that seemingly harmless guy who always keep his cool, and you have people around you telling you to apologize or just get the hell out before it's too late, you know nothing about the guy, but you start to make up an aura around him, and you know you've made a big mistake. In "First Blood", the first opus of "Rambo" series, the Police did that mistake, and they're gonna pay the biggest price.Indeed, there's one part that is absolutely irresistible in he film, it's the beginning. John Rambo just comes from Vietnam, looking for a friend, who lives somewhat in the most isolated area in USA's North, the man's dead from Cancer, because of that orange thing spread in Nam, says his wife. She almost could carry the man who formerly towered over everyone. Rambo is shocked, he gives the picture and tries to find the closest town to have some food, and probably some rest before getting back wherever he live. Life was hard for Vietnam Vets but he's got no one to hold his grudge against, that's just fatality, but somewhat, fatality isn't over yet with him.What is strange in Rambo is that the heart-pounding chase that is about to start isn't driven by a plot, or a motivation, there's no mission, nothing, just a great miscalculation from a man who awakened the monster behind that guy minding his own business. Brian Dennehy is Sheriff Teasle, a big burly man, nice looking, respectable, intimidating, he knows everyone by their first name in Hope, his town, boring as he wants to keep it. So, when he finds that smelly and dirty drifter entering his territory, he sees immediate disturbance and he tries as coolly and respectfully as possible to get rid of Rambo without hurting his feelings. "Is there a law forbidding me to eat here", "Yes, me", "Why are you pushing me?" asks Rambo, Teasle's speech about being the Sheriff of a quiet little town who wants to keep it that way, is a cliché now, but it worked then.It woks because it's straight to the point, and it's immediately illustrated by the following scene. Teasle leaves Rambo at the city exit, wish him goodbye and leave. If it was a Simpson gag (the series paid tribute to the film), you'd have cloud appearing and a storm starting in the background, the sky wasn't very welcoming anyway. But then, it's one of the most memorable pivotal moments from any film, that clear expression in Stallone's eyes saying "what the hell has just happened?" We know exactly what goes in his mind, what he's thinking, and naturally, we expect the right reaction, to get back on his road. Why did he do that? Principles ? that's all. The man was insulted and he wouldn't take no crap from anyone, at that moment, "Rambo" takes off and delivers its premise. It's all about choosing your own path, and the deviation forced by Teasle wasn't acceptable.I remember the first time I saw the film, my father told me he was coming back from War, and I immediately assumed it was the last film,"Rambo III", and I was so impressed by the film, I guessed the first movies would be pretty bad ass. But little did I know that the two other films would make a joke of the Rambo-figure making him exactly the type against what he was fighting. "First Blood" like "Rocky" is the first, and the best, it has provided the screen with a new immortal icon... after Rocky and Indiana Jones, the 80's begged for a franchise-military hero. And while the Vietnam Vet wasn't a totally fresh figure in 82, while, like Ebert pointed out, there had been "Deer Hunter", "Travis Bickle" or Bruce Dern in "Coming Home" and they didn't need to say much about their experience to know how haunting they were, John Rambo became the most vivid and iconic embodiment of the Nam trauma. Indeed, while the speech wasn't vital to understand Rambo because it was shown in microcosm in the film, it was still necessary.It was for one simple reason, it added substance to a character who was still a one-dimensional bad-ass hero trying to escape from the Cops and indeed fighting the Police with an undeniable superiority, but there had to be something in his heart that needed to come out. It was necessary because, as I said, the film had no specific plot, it was a sort of nihilistic escape that had no possible conclusion other than Rambo surrendering because he was, by essence, a good guy, the only death in the film wasn't his fault and he tried to conceal it, but the harm was done and the no-return limit was reached, so was Rambo, he broke his reaching point, and became a sort of Colonel Kurtz with no army, with all his experience of a Green Beret expressing itself, because that's what he was, more than anything, a Green Beret, the cause of his despise would be the cause of his triumph.The nervous breakdown in front of Colonel Trautman after Teasle was finally incapacitated is another highlight of Stallone's acting talent, when given a good script and an interesting character to hook your hearts on. As action-packed as it is, "First Blood" is also a fascinating character study, all the more fascinating because Rambo never says anything about himself, we see what he believe, he's strong like ten men, he masters every transportation and forest is his territory, not to mention the redundancy of Trautman praising his merits, to Teasle's much displeasure, the final element of his personality is finally imploded at the climactic speech. After that, the film can close, leaving us pretty much satsified.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meet John Rambo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Rambo came out in 2008, everyone rediscovered the franchise and quickly crowned the newest installment as "the best Rambo movie ever". Now that a few years have gone by, the name John Rambo has again fallen out of the mainstream consciousness. This is good for the people who never saw the original trilogy, because they can now discover it without suffering from popularity bias. I have always held the opinion that First Blood was by far the best John Rambo movie. It had the best story, the action was believable, the character development was good, and the acting wasn't "phoned in". The same can't be said for any of the other movies in the franchise. First Blood came along before the franchise devolved into a modern action movie. If you pay attention you'll realize that Rambo is trying NOT to kill any of his pursuers. The fun is knowing that he easily could, but chooses not to. Instead he eludes them using his Green Beret training, embarrassing them in the process. In the later movies it's just about explosions and body count. If you haven't seen First Blood, then you haven't met John Rambo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Blood (1982) ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First and best of the series has former soldier John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) traveling through a small town in the hope of visiting an old army friend. He is spotted by bigoted sheriff Teasel (Brian Dennehy) who promptly escorts him off his turf. When the peaceful Rambo turns around and defiantly starts walking back into the town, Teasel has him arrested. Mocked, mistreated, and beaten at the police station, Rambo snaps with agonized flashbacks of Vietnam, escapes the police, and flees off to the woods where he is pursued by law officials. What they don't realize is that Rambo is a Green Beret, trained for survival and conditioned to endure pain and weather. Teasel and his men have now set Rambo off, and he wages a personal war on them that "they won't believe". Rambo's old commanding officer (Richard Crenna) arrives on the scene to try and calm things before his man goes too far.This is surely one of Stallone's finest films and characters, and Sly looks his best in FIRST BLOOD. His John Rambo here is someone we can sympathize with, and his balance of calm followed by extreme self-preservation intensity is well realized. This film is smaller and more independent in feel than the sequels which came after it, and this gives it more appeal. Brian Dennehy is quite good as the hateful town sheriff whose prejudice has resulted in Rambo's wrath. Richard Crenna was a last minute substitute for Kirk Douglas (who backed out eventually), and perhaps occasionally appears a tad theatrical in his approach. The ending of the movie contains an emotionally charged speech by Stallone which is often criticized as being incomprehensible, but if you pay close attention you can decipher just about all of it. ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An action/adventure masterpiece (tainted somewhat by two cartooney sequels)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the title blurb says, "First Blood" is an action/adventure masterpiece of the first order. It's easy to lose sight of this in light of the two cartooney sequels that made a caricature of John Rambo: "Rambo: First Blood Part II" (1985) and "Rambo III" (1988). Thankfully, the series made up for it with the outstanding "Rambo" in 2008, which was totally serious, deep and non-cartooney.Most people reading this know the plot (PLOT SPOILER!): Vietnam vet John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) drifts into a Rocky Mounain town looking for a war buddy, only to learn that he died due to exposure to Agent Orange the summer before. The town's sheriff (Brian Dennehy) tries to steer Rambo out of town and ends up arresting him. Big mistake because Rambo is an ex-Green beret, a virtual one-man-army. He easily escapes into the local forests where he takes on both the police and the National Guard in jungle warfare. Before all is said and done he almost levels the entire town! The picture was filmed in beautiful Hope and Golden Ears Provincial Park, British Columbia. Yes, it's drizzly and dreary with absolutely zero sunshine, but it's incredibly picturesque nevertheless. A wonderful place to commit suicide I'm sure (jk).Dennehy is perfect as the arrogant, pushy and intimidating sheriff. He essentially plays the same role in the Western "Silverado" (1985) albeit the character in that film is ten-times WORSE.Stallone is physically in his prime here, although he's not as bulked-up as in the two sequels. In fact, he's almost skinny. His waist is obviously only about 27-28 inches and his chest isn't all that big, although his arms and shoulders are certainly impressive. Anyway, one good byproduct of seeing "First Blood" is that it'll inspire guys to get back in shape (or get in better shape).Stallone sort of blows his initial lines talking to the black woman about his war buddy at the beginning, but aside from this he's outstanding in the role of Rambo. He doesn't have many lines; most of his acting is non-verbal. At the end Rambo finally screams out and lets out all his pent-up rage. This is a potent scene. He screams: "Over there (in Vietnam) I was in charge of million dollar equipment, over here I can't even hold a job PARKING CAAAARRRRRRSSSSS!!!!!" I'm not normally into DVD commentaries and rarely blow the time to listen to them, but the one featured on the Special Edition DVD (the one with the red cover) by writer David Morrell is truly worthwhile. Morrell talks the entire 90-minute length of the film and offers a wealth of information, like the differences between the film and his novel, how the film set many precedents in the action/adventure film genre, the incredible way he came up with the name Rambo, the 3-Act story structure of films, etc. Make no mistake, David Morrell is a genius.It doesn't matter how many times you've seen "First Blood." The film has such a captivating anointing you'll be spellbound from start to finish every time. If your a sucker for lost-in-the-woods/survival pictures "First Blood" is a must.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sylvester Stallone plays John Rambo, a troubled Vietnam vet who returns to the United States, only be promptly abused by various civilians, public servants and police men, all of whom view him as a "vagrant", "drifter" and "menace". Tired of this mistreatment, Stallone rips off his shirt, flexes his muscles and engages in a little jungle warfare. Supporting him from the sidelines is Sam Trautman, a kindly United States Special Forces Colonel."I did what I had to do to win," Rambo cries, "but somebody wouldn't let us win!" He's referring to all those who opposed and picketed the Vietnam War, a lost war which the film now seeks to make right. And so Rambo becomes the lovable warrior who gets nothing but love and affection from the Army and hate and scorn from his countrymen. You cheer for him as he outsmarts ridiculously evil civilians, who break every law imaginable (they nonsensically abuse, shoot and beat Rambo) whilst oozing pure contempt for our poor hero. By the film's end, civilians have been punished, the audience has been carefully reprogrammed, the Army has gotten its revenge on an unsupportive, dissenting populace, and the stage has been set for "Rambo 2", an ultra right wing war on Russia and Vietnam, waged in the guise of rescuing "our boys" from commies, who, bizarrely, are still interrogating prisoners in the jungles of Vietnam, two and a half decades after capture."First Blood" was directed by Ted Kotcheff and heavily rewritten by Sylvester Stallone. A mating dance between 80s blockbuster cinema and 70s "neorealism", the film sports a somewhat "realistic", "gritty" and "melancholic" tone, despite its action movie pyrotechnics. Unsurprisingly, Stallone, who has made a career out of understanding his audience's love for working class underdogs, plays Rambo as a sad eyed, abandoned puppy. He manages to exude real sweetness.Like its sequels, the film's quality is besides the point. Virtually every scene is both iconic and influential. From here would spawn everything from "Die Hard" to "Predator" to "Apocalypto". Among the secondary characters, actor Richard Crenna stands out as an unintentionally hilarious straight arrow Colonel. His dialogue - "God didn't make Rambo, I did!", "Don't forget the body bags!", "You're lucky to be breathing!", "I didn't come to rescue Rambo from you. I came here to rescue you from him!" - exists only to hype up Stallone. Never has an actor been so thoroughly reduced to a mouthpiece for epic one liners.8/10 - See Walter Hill's "Southern Comfort", released one year prior to "First Blood", for the thematic flip-side of this movie. Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soldier fighting against society and his own inner demons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah this is basically a action movie that goes in a more humanistic approach, now this is a 80's movie but it's still gripping to watch the traumatized soldier fighting back in a society that has abandoned him and hates him without knowing and experiencing the bloodshed that took place in the Vietnam War. John Rambo is a icon, but he becomes more of a cartoon or comic book like hero instead of a more believable soldier who is fighting his own demons, which haunts him. Sylvester Stallone has created another movie icon that influenced many other characters in the movies, video games and other forms or types of entertainment. Solid Snake from the MGS games come to mind as well and I can tell Hideo Kojima was heavily influenced by John Rambo when making the MGS games. I also liked how the action in this film has a purpose and defines John Rambo and his character. The Colonel shows up later in the film and goes on and on about how badass of a soldier Rambo is and what he has gone through. The audience gets the point, but I personally thought it kept on dragging with the colonel constantly talking about how deadly and unstoppable he is CONSTANTLY. Which got sort of annoying and for a while it seems that is the only purpose for that character. Rambo in this film basically is fighting off cops that goes on a power trip, and I detest cops like that. So I couldn't help but root for Rambo the whole time and despised his enemies that is suppose to protect and serve. But soon realized it's not only the thug cops he is against, but society itself that treated him like dirt without experiencing the horrors of war and for fighting for his country, unjust war or not. What was also interesting is how the hunters which are the cops, become the hunted, but Rambo doesn't kill any of them except one who had it coming. His a character that doesn't kill any innocent civilians. Overall this was a good film about a soldier fighting against society and his own inner demons. Although there is a lot of chase scenes and action sequences, the last scene with Rambo and the colonel was emotional and helped get a understand of Rambo even more and made him appear to be a real torn up character. Which made the film more memorable and left a mark.7.4/10</fullReview>

The Plot Is That John J. Rambo is a former United States Special Forces soldier who fought in Vietnam and won the Congressional Medal of Honor, but his time in Vietnam still haunts him. As he came to Hope, Washington to visit a friend, he was guided out of town by the Sheriff William Teasel who insults Rambo, but what Teasel does not know that his insult angered Rambo to the point where Rambo became violent and was arrested, as he was at the county jail being cleaned, he escapes and goes on a rampage through the forest to try to escape from the sheriffs who want to kill him. Then, as Rambo's commanding officer, Colonel Samuel Trautman tries to save both the Sheriff's department and Rambo before the situation gets out of hand.

		<shortDescription>An exhilarating experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the truly rewarding things about movies is how exciting they can be. It feels good to sit and watch a movie that gets your adrenaline pumping and keeps you on the edge of your seat. No genre of movie does that like Action. Made up of a hero or heroes up against some great evil and filled with action sequences and usually big explosions. I for one love all kinds of films, including those that make us think and have some profound message, but it's nice to sometimes sit back and just be entertained. That's exactly what 'First Blood' does and it does a great job of it. It also has more than just great action scenes, it's also a pretty good drama.Pros: Strong performances all around. Amazing score that ranges from beautiful to exciting. Nicely photographed and the scenery is breathtaking. Charges along at a good pace. Plenty of action-packed sequences. The filmmakers create a good balance between the action and drama. From the point that Rambo begins to fight on we're kept on the edge of our seats.Cons: You'll need to suspend your disbelief a lot.Final thoughts: Most action films are filled with elaborate set pieces and stunts, plus they have a lot of things blowing up. Not that I'm saying 'First Blood' is quite the thinking man's action film, but it isn't so over the top and the actors make the characters very real as opposed to chewing the scenery. The plot is simple and the direction more restrained than it is in a lot of these films, and it works exceptionally well.My rating: 4.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The traumas of war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1970s America was in the myers, suffering from economic problems, Watergate, the Vietnam War and the subsequence protect movement. In 1972 a little novel called First Blood was written which set out to be an anti-war novel and its affects on people. 10 years later this novel was made into a successful film, commerically and critically, starting Sylvester Stallone.John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone), is Vietnam vet, a green beret. He discovers that he is the last of his unit and has become a drifter. Whilst walking he goes to a town called Hope in Washington State. The redneck sheriff Will (Brian Dennehy) warns him to stay away and drives him through the town. Rambo is pushed and ends up getting arrested. Whilst in police custody Rambo suffers from police brutality and flashbacks of being tortured by the Vietnamese. He snaps, attacks the officers, and makes a run for it in the forest. There his guerrilla warfare training kicks in, and easily fires of the local police and national guard. He starts a one man war against the sheriff as he trauma is brought back.First Blood kicked off the very successful Rambo series, sporning 3 further films. Rambo 2 and 3 became very right wing, with America re-fighting and winning in Vietnam and then with Rambo beating back the Soviets in Afganstan. However, First Blood had more of a heart and a message about the treatment of veterans and the trauma they suffer (admittly taking it to the extremes). It's a bit more psychological then the other Rambo films. The direction by Ted Kotcheff, he handled the actors and the action well. I personally enjoyed how Rambo was able to camouflage himself, and able to fight with instinct. It gives you a good insight in the style of war, and how the survival skills were transfered to forests of North-West America. The writers and director also made sure that to keep Rambo a moral and sympathetic character he never killed anyone directly. That was a wise more so the audience can support him. It's a little like Jason Bourne before Bourne came to the cinema. Out of the 80s actions stars, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dolph Lundgren, Jean-Claude Van Damme (80s and 90s), Steven Seagal (admittly 90s), etc... Stallone is the best actor out of all them and this was a strong performance by him, especially his final speech. Kotcheff made sure he didn't make a clichéd action film.However there are two major films. Firstly the premise is a little thin. Why did Rambo bother going back to the town in the first place? But there are worst ideas and Rambo is a decent film. Second is sadly the film is dated nowadays compared modern actions films (Bourne films) and war films (Saving Private Ryan). But it is a standard of good to 80s auctioneers.It's worth watching if you want something short to escape the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Vietnam veteran runs into trouble in a small town.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story is simple, a Vietnam vet is first trying to have a reunion with an old army buddy. Apparently, he is the last of Rambo's buddies left after the war (Rambo being the main character for the two people who might not know who I am referring to). Well he finds out this guy is dead as well so suffice to say Rambo is not in the best of moods. He ends up strolling through a town where the local sheriff stops him and promptly escorts him out of town. Rambo says he would just like to get something to eat, but the sheriff is most insistent on his leaving. Rambo is dropped off on the edge of town and Rambo promptly turns back towards town, most likely tired of the attitudes people like the sheriff have towards him and others that served in Vietnam. Well the sheriff arrests Rambo and him and his staff proceed to treat him like some sort of animal leading to a violent escape by Rambo and the sheriff and first his deputies then the national guard go on the hunt for him. Rather good scenes abound in this movie as Rambo makes rather short work of the deputies and some guys dogs. You also get to witness Rambo trying to escape a cave and have a cool shoot out at the end. All is not perfect with the film, but there is enough good stuff to make this an all around pretty good film. I just do not see a small town being as inhospitable towards a veteran of any war. The kind of attitude you see from the sheriff is something I would think one would see in maybe a college town at that time or a city. I also wonder if there were maybe a McDonald's in town if the sheriff had taken him through the drive thru would Rambo been more apt to leave when taken to the edge of town? It also could have ended if that one idiot did not shoot Rambo in the side of the head when he was trying to surrender. Yes, a lot of things fell into place so that we could have the fiery ending we got.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A long road begins...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always found war movies more than a little dull when I was growing up. But Vietnam was different - a war in which most of the traditional rules of engagement no longer seemed to apply. And because the scenario was so strikingly different from what American troops had experienced before, the collective experience stamped an unprecedented - and, in many cases, tragic - psychological mark upon their souls. FIRST BLOOD - the first Rambo film - gets this point across subtly and beautifully.John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is an ex-Green Beret who lives in this world but cannot be said to be truly a part of it. His sole frame of reference is the POW camp in Southeast Asia in which he was tortured, and he cannot help seeing parallels to those atrocities in the brutal behavior of some of his fellow Americans. So when the arrogant sheriff of a sleepy small town in Washington State ironically named Hope (although a better title for it, as one character in the film puts it, would be "Jerkwater, U.S.A.") has him arrested for the most arbitrary of reasons, the prospect of eternal haunting by the ghosts that have followed him back home becomes just too much for his sanity to bear.FIRST BLOOD has been called one of the last of the "New Hollywood" films that raised American cinema to previously unscaled heights in the 1970s; certainly, it was the last of the RAMBO films to proudly present the aesthetic. Although Stallone - in the souped-up RAMBO sequels and many others - would become famous for his macho one-liners, he speaks very little in this film - and our experience is so much the richer for it. He allows his actions and gestures to speak for themselves, communicating to us the willful indifference of a man who has been through hell and back; the simmering fury of an individual misjudged and ostracized by an ignorant world; the desperation of one who is determined to remain free within a society that regards him as a menace; and the anguish that invariably exists within anyone who has witnessed gruesome human deaths and (un)fortunately did not suffer the same fate. Brian Dennehy commands our attention, too, as the aforementioned stubborn sheriff whose unreasoning hatred of Rambo often drives him to act just as madly as the psychotic vet he's pursuing - and yet, when we get to know him better, is revealed to be not devoid of a core of basic decency after all.Aside from Stallone and Dennehy, the movie's biggest star is the virgin wilderness of the Pacific Northwest - a terrain superficially similar to that of Vietnam, and yet distinct enough to drive home the point that the savagery of guerrilla warfare packs the same punch against any backdrop. Shot in appropriately naturalistic fast-stock photography under dismal December skies, the forest in FIRST BLOOD looks raw, rugged, and dangerous - not the kind of locale you'd choose for a family camping trip. Other noteworthy qualities include the suspenseful musical score and thrilling yet totally believable action sequences. The performances, too - even the non-principal ones - are exquisitely nuanced, bringing out authentic human drives and desires.My only real quibble with this enjoyable movie would be the dubious moral message it transmits during the last twenty minutes. After having been put on the defensive - and thus earned our sympathy - for most of the picture, Rambo finally goes on the offensive by hijacking an Army truck and driving back into town, where he unleashes all his rage - and an M-60 - on various buildings. Why did the makers of this film feel it necessary to turn their protagonist into a terrorist? No matter what the circumstances of the plot, it is asking a lot of the audience to accept a hero (or an antihero, in this case) who lashes out indiscriminately at everything in his path simply to satisfy some perceived collective thirst for carnage. We all love violent sequences, but they must be dramatically plausible - and they really should be tempered by some sort of moral clarity.When Rambo tearfully surrenders himself to his sympathetic commanding officer in the end, he ceases to be a villain in any capacity - and yet, he can never regain the status of anything resembling a hero. Perhaps, ultimately, this is the point that resonates the most with us: that Rambo, for all his feats of martial prowess, is no crudely scripted character but a credible facsimile of all of us - or, more accurately, any one of us who had to live out his nightmare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John J Rambo (Stallone) is a special forces green beret and Vietnam veteran, the story starts with Rambo walking down a long road he's been looking for a guy he knew when he was in Vietnam, he's homeless with nothing to live for. a local sheriff see's him and arrests him for vagrancy, when they reach the station Rambo gets beaten by some of the deputy's obviously this annoys him and eventually he loses control, his already fragile mind is pushed over the limit and he escapes with ease beating the crap out of any cop that gets in his way. The only thing in Rambo's mind is to escape and be alone before he kills anyone, but the hard headed sheriff decides to pursue him into the mountains and thats when the skills of Rambo come out as he starts his own personal war against the whole sheriffs department and the state police.A physcotic green beret.Expert in close quarter combat.Expert in guerrilla warfare.Expert in weapons and explosives.A man on the edge of sanity with nothing to lose.all the ingredient's for a superb action movie, but with something else as well.Rambo first blood dosn't just focus on the action but also on the sad side of a soldiers life, Slyvester Stallone shows excellently how war can effect a man phscologicaly, Rambo is in pain and he dosn't have any one who understands him, in Rambo's eyes nobody cares therefore everyones against him which is why his war will never be over.the action in this movie is great and Stallone is perfect for the part, when you see Rambo running along carrying a m60 support weapon (which are supposed to be used lying down with it resting on a bi-pod) is classic. i loved how he took down about 10 cops in the woods with just a knife.(Rambos knife is excellent by one off e-bay the blade is 10 inches long).Great action, great story, great acting makes Rambo First Blood one great movie.A classic, a Icon, to be honest its a classic icon.I give this movie 9 out of 10, well done Sylvester Stallone! PS.Make sure you watch the two sequels there not as meaning full but are jam packed with action.Stallone is bringing out Rambo 4 in 2008 titled John Rambo i can't wait.(you can see the trailer for it on you-tube just type in Stallone and look for it).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having never seen a Rambo movie before, I expected him to be in Vietnam blowing things up. I was very wrong. This is the story of John Rambo walking the streets as a drifter in search of his old comrades. Finding out the last one is dead, he becomes very distraught. When confronted by the local sheriff (Brian Dennehy), Rambo snaps. The rest of the movie is one man's war against the local police department. It's hard to say whose side to be on.If you want straight action, this is your movie. There is plenty of helicopter flying, gun shooting and booby-trapping. Good, old-fashioned fisticuffs, as well. The pacing is perfect and you can hardly stop rooting for your hero.The star of the movie, in my opinion, is Richard Crenna - playing Colonel Trautman. Trautman's matter-of-fact attitude makes him something of a deux ex machina, a bit of reality in a place of fiction. His plain speaking, explaining to the police what they're up against, frames Rambo in such a perfect picture. This film would already be recommended, but Crenna makes this film HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</fullReview>

Like EFNY it is stupid at times, and like EFNY, it helps if you're a little drunk when you're watching it. Neverless, it's nicely crafted, and Brian Dennehy's performance steals the show -- no thanks the dialogue dubbing, which is atrocious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly a classic "guy" movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie spawned countless imitators but this is still one of the best of the genre. What impresses me about it was the fact that for the most part it was all believable and realistic. It didn't have people running around shooting guns with endless supplies of ammo and the hero taking on dozens of men at once and never getting shot like Arnie did in Commando. Stallone was excellent as was Brian Dennehy as the sheriff with an attitude.I'd say this was one of the most influential movies as a whole in the early eighies. To this day when someone is talking about a soldier or a wannabe soldier he says "he's a rambo type" or "he's a rambo wannabe". I think it manages to look remarkably contemporary considering it is now a 17 year old movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I venture a remark concerning those critics who say that Rambo movie propagates violence and triumph of brutal force. I think this movie is very human. There is no violence as in most of the movies today, only self-defence. Only one person was killed, the others were only slightly injured so that they cannot continue pursuit. I cried the first time I watched First Blood and heard John's speech about his Vietnam ordeal and the way his home country welcomed him on return. I think Rambo sequel propagates courage, loyalty to one's country, praises comradeship-in-arms and condemns meanness, insidiousness, and treachery. It teaches people to be more tolerant to each other and sympathetic to the sufferings of others. Rambo is one of the most remarkable characters in the history of American cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Undoubtedly, the first film is the best of all its sequels. Only the 2008 film comes even close, which it does well, but this film is just a classic that can't be topped. When I first saw this film, I only watched bits and pieces, and mistook foolishly as just another action movie. But after viewing it again, I now see it's true nature, as well as respecting it on a number of levels. As for Stallone, this is the best role he's ever done in my opinion. His performance was just spot on and you end up feeling very connected with his confused character. Richard Crenna was awesome as Colonel Trautman, and despite what happened to the series later on I'm glad he was present in them. And Brian Dennehy was great, being the fool who kept pushing and on a more significant level symbolizes how many Americans felt about Vietnam veterans. With no real friends left, no occupation, and nowhere to go, John Rambo comes "back to the world" expecting at the least acceptance back into society. But even that is turned down, and he quite simply loses it. Backing all this is a great score by Jerry goldsmith, whose music keeps a level of constant tension and darkness, but always a touch of remorse. And the cinematography was great. Director Ted Kotcheff was more concerned about the quality of what was on screen rather than large explosions which is what makes the first film stand out amongst rubbish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In its core this is really one simple straight-forward action flick. It's part of the reason why this movie is just so great and a true genre classic but also when you look past the surface, you'll see that this movie has so much more to offer.The story in its main core is real simple; An Vietnam vet who is being chased by a couple of mean cops through the woods. This is basically how most part of the movie is like. It's good and also sort of refreshing that there are totally no distracting different plot-lines and needless characters or comical relief or anything else of that sort, that most other genre movies have. But the movie is really more than just a 'dumb' overblown action flick. It actually knows to still very humane and on a small scale, as strange as that may sound, since this movie is known for being one of the most ultimate action movies out there.The movie mostly works out as well as it does due to it's main character John J. Rambo, who has become a real action movie icon. He is definitely a character who is on the edge and looks like he can snap any moment but we understand him nevertheless. Even though he says as little as possible you can still follow his emotions. For this, also credits needs to go to Sylvester Stallone. of course lots of people have criticized his acting over the years, the same as all big action movie actors got criticized. But playing a believable and likable action movie character also really takes skill, especially the role of Rambo, who is a real well layered character in terms of emotions and personality. Brian Dennehy and Richard Crenna also play some real good roles. The acting within this movie is not what you perhaps would expect at first sight from an action movie. It was also fun to see a still very young David Caruso in a for him early movie role.It's a quite hard brutal action flick, even though funny enough only one person in this entire movie dies on screen. Nevertheless, Rambo causes the cops and his other chasers lots of different injuries, by guns as well as self made weapons and contraptions. So for the fans of the action genre this movie has plenty to offer for them.The movie isn't made by the most talented cast or crew that was around at the time but it's just one of those movies in which everything comes together and eventually works out perfectly and takes each and everyone involved in the production to a whole new higher level of prestige.What I also like about this- and all of the other Rambo movies, is the Jerry Goldsmith musical score, except for the latest Rambo movie from this year obviously, since Goldsmith past away in 2004. I feel it's one of his more underrated works. Everybody knows the theme for movies such as "Jaws". "Rocky" or James Bond but not that many actually also known the Rambo theme, even though it's at least just as brilliant and recognizable. Perhaps it has to due with the fact that it was an action movies score done in the '80's, which of course was not the most respectable genre at its time.Still great and also quite unique within its genre.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know that most people see this film as nothing but a macho display, but watch a little more closely. This film showed fairly simply the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder. It also showed a man who was not invincible necessarily, but very capable of improvising in many situations. Unlike many other similar movies, Rambo had to make do with a knife and a few rounds from "aquired" weaponry. His heroism is not so much in his strength, but his fear and desperation. Almost nothing he does in this film is of the calibre of hero. Of course, the crux, when he gets Teasle in the forest and tells him "in town your the law, out here it's me.....Don't push it or I'll give you a war you won't believe" is his final attempt to "difuse the situation" and that does seem to flex some muscle. But again, it seems more out of a desperation to stop everything before Rambo is forced to go farther than he wants and knows he can go (viz., killing people). What we see is a man who is caught between two worlds; the one the military and Trautman indoctrinated him into and what we call the regular world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First Blood, "John J. Rambo" hey will Rambo is a solider boy"...tells the whole story.....what a great action film, tells the story of a supremely frustrated Vietnam veteran who has run out of hope and respect for what's left in America for war heroes...... Superb casting.....Sylvester Stallone as Rambo is perfect, Brian Dennehy as the fat ass idiot sheriff Will Teasle is a gem, and Richard Crenna is perfect as Colonel Trautman, the only man on the planet who has a chance of cooling off the emotional basketcase Rambo. The film was a complete sleeper in 1982 and most of the major studios passed on making or financing this film, some studios only saw Stallone as Rocky and not much else. Probably the best non stop action film ever made....there does not seem to be a dull spot anywhere in the screenplay and the tempo of the film is kept moving rapidly by director Ted Kotcheff. How can you not root for Rambo to win out in this film? Hicktown sheriff department bent on intimidation and harassment of locals and drifters picks the wrong "cowboy" to start a ruckus with. You get to see the true acting ability of Stallone in this film, more so than the Rocky films. He is reckless, sad, brave, bold, daring and emotionally spent during the course of the film. Great musical score by Jerry Goldsmith piques the viewers imagination all the way thru the film......score couldn't be better for an action film. Underdog Rambo wreaks havoc on mismatched bunch of local yokel cops who try to pull a Dirty Harry show of force on him all because he was considered a "drifter"........Rambo blows out the full force fury of hell on overmatched idiot cops hell bent on capturing him for making a daring escape from the local jail. Gotta love the scene when Rambo one by one takes out with the fury of hell on each of the cops with knives, chokes, battering rams with wood punji sticks and puts a choke hold on Teasle only to let him live for the moment with a warning things will get a lot worse if he does not lay off the tormented vet......Love the scene when Rambo disposes of a group of dogs sent in to attack him when he kills them one at a time and moron local yokel owner says "he killed my babies" ha-ha-ha!!! The viewer of this film wants to see Rambo succeed and the sheriff dept put away on a slab one by one....even the intervention of the military cannot stop "John J" from going berserk. Final scenes when Rambo blows up hick town with a machine gun is fury at it's greatest wrath. Hapless sheriff Teasle falls through the roof of a store and Rambo can put him away but doesn't. Very emotional ending with Trautman consoling war burned out veteran Rambo.......If I am a judge on this case, Rambo goes free and the sheriff's department would all go to prison......gets the emotions of the viewer pent up to the extreme in sympathy for Rambo. Follow up "Rambo II" very good sequel too.....Crenna reprising his role as Colonel Trautman again. Stallone will be identified forever as "Rocky" and "Rambo".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, let me get this straight, I know lots of people love the film, it's a classic, they say. I disagree strongly. I don't like Sylvester Stallone, in my opinion, he is a bad actor. This probably proved it. These are the type of films Stallone can do, and should stick to, because there isn't much acting in it. In fact, this film was complete rubbish. It had a very thin plot, and it was simply that an ex soldier in the army, or whatever, is thrown out of town and decides to get his revenge for going on a killing spree. It was mindless violence with no plot really for why he was doing it, despite being completely insane. And what I can't understand is why they put John Rambo as a good guy. He murders innocent police officers, but oh, that's fine, no problem, they are bad guys. NO! Police officers are not bad guys, a man going around a town killing everyone he sees and blowing stuff up is a bad guy, yet we are made to feel sorry for him. And we wonder why there is so much violence in society today! Yeah, sure, but when they show a serial killer such as Buffalo Bill in The Silence Of The Lambs (excellent film), he's a bad guy, but what's the difference between Bill and Rambo? Nothing, yet Rambo is shown as a good guy! I just can't get my head around it! 2/10 - and that's because I'm being nice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Rambo is a victim</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen the movie and your comments and I was wondering who is the good character and who is the bad one because this kind of movie must have one. Alfred Hitchcock believed that the good characters are not white and the bad ones are not black, everybody's Grey. But I think this is not the case. The most positive character in this movie is Sheriff Teasle and the bad one is the human society and army. John Rambo is the victim in this case, the innocent victim who became a menace to the same society who destroyed his spirit and now didn't want him back. This is why I think this is good movie who has something to say, who has a decent point of view in a domain which many productions debated. John Rambo can't be brought back to ordinary life so the sheriff does what he was told to do: eliminate any possible threats to his community. The hero's ending speech is useless because none of the people outside actually listens to what he has to say. He is doomed to remain an outcast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First Blood doesn't know what it wants to be. There are times when it tries to be an Indiana Jones type of action/adventure flick and then there are moments when it wants to be a poignant commentary on Vietnam veterans. The two sides continually war at each other throughout the movie, but never get anywhere. Not helping the matter is Richard Crenna in the first of his annoying appearances in the series.I find it interesting in comparison how Rambo goes from sensitive burnout here to a hollow, "warrior of truth" in the third. The reason this isn't as good as Rambo: First Blood Part II is because the sequel understands what it is at the outset (read my review) and doesn't try to be anything better because it knows that it can't. First Blood tries, but winds up being an embarrassment.Stallone never was good at acting, he is only a presence actor. He is only "good" in the one movie of his worth watching, Rocky. By comparison to this, Rocky is Shakespeare.Overall, you don't need to bother with this movie. It is one of the weaker 80s action efforts. 1.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first twenty minutes or so of 'First Blood' are really very good, with a melancholy tone and an impressively quiet performance from Sly (who also co-wrote the script, based on David Morrell's book). The movie sensibly keeps Vietnam vet Rambo a man of few words, getting across his sadness and avoiding wisecracks and cheap one-liners. So it's a big disappointment when plausibility takes an early bath and macho bang-bang takes over as Rambo enacts revenge on an entire town. Early on he bleeds and feels pain and makes mistakes, and the stunts are believable enough; but the more invincible he becomes, and the dumber his enemies get, the less interesting the movie is. It's still the best in the series, though: its good intentions are more evident than in later chapters.</fullReview>

This same nut case also said that anybody who finds it boring is a mindless action junkie whose thrives off of gore. I don't know about everyone else but I would rather be an action junkie than a girly man who cry's with his boyfriend while watching sissy chick flicks.

He kills innocent people for no good reason. It is a perfect example of people who continue to tell young people to join the military should be made aware of and that is, that they won't acquire all these great skills useful to employers, only to return to the US not able to function in normal society. The killing is pointless and proves nothing. Rambo needs mental health care, not a group of part-time weekend soldiers in a small town to slaughter. There are some mildly interesting scenes with Rambo hiding and camping out, but it isn't worth watching this movie to see them. Better off watching a real one, like Survivor man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing Special, Just Another Action Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe I saw this movie too late, when all the ideas have been used to death in other action films. But nevertheless, I found little pleasure in this action classic. The plot is predictable. Nothing new, nothing special. That's not always a bad thing, but in the way this movie presents it it feels like there is no effort and ends up coming off more like a video game- movie than anything else. The characters aren't anything special either. I wouldn't say they were bad, but they were never really focused on until the very end when we received some weird forced moment with Rambo. The action, which is the star of this movie, is boring. I personally don't like watching one overpowered person beating everyone up. One- sided fights just aren't my thing unfortunately. All the fights I felt were too slow and rather predictable too, so I found little entertainment in it. Sylvester Stallone particularly stood out to me as a bad actor. Now maybe that's just because that was supposed to be his character, where the only things he says are little grunting noises occasionally that are made to resemble words, but don't always succeed. Maybe he is a good actor, but he was just given crappy material to work with. Either way, he stood out as being another negative of the movie. Overall First Blood is nothing special. The plot is predictable and unoriginal, the characters are unfocused and sometimes forced, the action is boring, and the acting wasn't great. How this became a classic is beyond me, but maybe it just has to do with timing. Back when it first came out maybe it was incredibly original and deep, but now it stands as just an below average, effortless action movie. In the end I wouldn't recommend First Blood to anyone, because there's really nothing special or new about this movie that you haven't already seen a million times before.</fullReview>

To wit: his avoidance of the Draft, which he did by leaving the country. In FIRST BLOOD, he plays a gung ho soldier a few cans short of a six pack who goes off on a hick town whose sheriff can't keep his hands to himself (played by real life Vietnam vet Brian Dennehy). Rocky Rambo puts the town to the torch (not unlike the way an American soldier would torch a hootch in 'Nam), but, for all his supposed prowess as a killing machine (Richard Crenna, in an unintentionally hilarious part, tells the sheriff to "lay in a big supply of body bags"), he doesn't really do all that much killing. (In the book, he evens commits suicide.) FIRST BLOOD IS very well directed and the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, but Stallone chews the scenery badly and the subsequent films just got worse and worse.

		<fullReview>Just how insanely popular is your franchise when literally everyone on the planet knows the name of the lead character rather than the movie title itself, and when that same lead character's name even became synonymous for ruthless macho beefcake warriors all around the world? Rambo is truly one of the most legendary men ever to hit the big cinema screen and especially this original first film was an enormous box office hit. And deservedly so, as Ted Kotcheff's "First Blood" is also one of the single most exciting and entertaining action movies ever made. It's an unpretentious, straightforward and compelling adventure that guarantees adrenalin rushes from start to finish and benefices from a few amazing performances and perplexing outdoor filming locations. "First Blood" is based on a novel by David Morrell, which I personally haven't read, but allegedly the book is a lot more dramatic and psychological, whereas Sylvester Stallone (who co-wrote the screenplay) and company opted to strictly aim their movie at action fanatics. Former Green Beret John J. Rambo only just found out that his last Vietnam buddy has passed away and aimlessly drifts alongside the small town roads in rural Washington. When approaching a little town called Hope, Rambo is immediately stopped by the overconfident &amp; arrogant Sheriff Teasle who doesn't like long-haired and scruffy vagabonds in his territory. When Rambo refuses to leave, he's apprehended, humiliated and provoked by Teasle's equally intolerant deputies. The barbaric treatment brings Rambo's Vietnam traumas back to the surface, so he battles himself a way out of the police station and into the wilderness. The increasingly frustrated Sheriff Teasle is bound to catch Rambo, but in these impenetrable forests the especially trained guerrilla warrior is unstoppable. Pretty soon, the search for John Rambo turns into an enormous manhunt, and they even require the help of his commanding officer in Vietnam; Colonel Sam Trautman. Many people initially think that "First Blood" is an actual Vietnam War movie but ? as described ? does it merely revolve on issues like problematic reintegration, post-traumatic stress disorder and a general lack of respect for war heroes. There's a number of great thrillers dealing with similar themes, but sadly they are a lot more obscure than "First Blood", for example "Rolling Thunder", "The Park is mine", "My Friends Need Killing" and many others. The film isn't nearly as violent as you might expect and ? in sheer contrast to the later sequels ? thrives on tense atmosphere instead of explicit bloodshed. Sylvester Stallone demonstrates that he definitely can act, especially during the gripping climax, but Brian Dennehy steals the show with his courageous role as the slimy, hypocritical and obnoxious small town sheriff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rambo Is A Classic Anti-Hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the course of his career, Sylvester Stallone has created two iconic characters: Rocky Balboa and John Rambo. Comparing the two - and there are both similarities and differences - is interesting. As far as the similarities are concerned, both are tough as nails and just keep on fighting against all the odds. There's also a softer side to both of them - although that softer side, while it comes out in Rambo at times, is much more front and centre in Rocky. But the differences are more dramatic. Rocky is the quintessential hero. He's everyone - the underdog who gets a shot at living his dream and makes the most of it. But Rambo is more of an anti-hero. Rather than living his dream, he's really trapped in a nightmare. You admire his toughness; you admire (in a way) his battle against obnoxious cops. And yet, at the same time, Rambo's a threatening and even frightening figure. You admire him, but you don't really warm up to him.Rambo's a Vietnam vet. He's a former green beret and a winner of the Congressional Medal of Honor. And he's a trained special ops soldier whose orders were basically to kill. Back home, though (as often happened to Vietnam vets) he was treated with contempt by a society sick of Vietnam, he was unable to hold a job. Then, reduced to being a drifter, he gets into a confrontation with a local sheriff (played by Brian Dennehy) who's none to happy to have Rambo's "kind" in his town. The confrontation escalates, and in pretty short order Rambo's at war with the sheriff's department, the State Police and the National Guard - and he's winning!Maybe it's implausible, but it does make for pretty good action, and overall I thought this was one of Stallone's better performance. The range of acting needed is greater than in the Rocky series, and Stallone does well with it, especially in a scene near the end of the movie when he plays a very emotional scene in the presence of his former commanding officer (Richard Crenna) when he breaks down and exposes his own personal demons dating back to his Vietnam experiences.This is really more than an action movie. It does - in an over the top way - deal with the issues faced by Vietnam vets who served their country and then returned home to find a country that didn't appreciate their efforts. Implausible, yes, and also violent, but overall this is an enjoyable movie. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"John Rambo" (Sylvester Stallone) is a decorated war hero who has recently returned from Vietnam and is haunted by his experiences there. As luck would have it, he aimlessly drifts into a small town and is wrongfully arrested for "vagrancy" by the local sheriff, "Will Teasle" (Brian Dennehy). While being processed inside the sheriff's department, one of the deputies decides to get rough with him and Rambo reverts to his combative ways and escapes into the mountains outside of town. This results in a massive manhunt for him with dire consequences for those who seek to bring him in. Now, while my summary probably doesn't do justice to the intense plot, I will say that this is one of the better action movies out there. Admittedly, some of the scenes are a bit too unrealistic but then that's Hollywood for you. Even so, both Sylvester Stallone and Brian Dennehy performed very well and I rate this movie as definitely above average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sylvester Stallone debuts as John Rambo, in this action packed, exciting, yet thought provoking and unexpectedly moving film as Vietnam veteran and Green Beret John Rambo is now a "drifter" who runs afoul of small-town sheriff Teasle(Brian Dennehy, quite effective as a callous bully) who arrests him on a phony charge, after he was just trying to locate an old friend, but underestimates the resolve and skill of Rambo, who makes a daring escape, and is then pursued by both local and state police, who find they need the help of Rambo's former teacher Col. Trautman(Richard Crenna, very good here).Rambo is a memorable character, well portrayed by Stallone, in a very effective performance. May stretch believability at times, but overall a smart and well written yarn. Holds up to repeat viewings, and first of four films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>?Rambo : First blood" is a true pearl in it's genre. Rarely you will find an action movie almost perfect on every level ? acting , story , action scenes , music , substance. Along with "Rocky" it's Stallone's most famous and best movie . It's also one of his finest performances.What makes it such a great movie is the the ability from the creators to combine action spectacle with a emotional story . All the action is driven by the dramatic conflict between characters . It feels very natural and makes the scenes more exciting , because you're emotionally involved on a level not often seen in other action movies. None of the action scenes seems unnecessary or pure eye-candy.I don't like to use this word when I'm describing action movies ( because almost every one of them needs some suspension of belief ) , but here it fits perfectly . REALISM. "First blood" is a very realistic movie . Emotional realism and practical realism. It feels like this story could happen in real life , which is a big plus. What is interesting and unique is the anti-war and anti-violence message that comes from this action movie . I doubt that anyone who's seen the movie will doubt about the honesty of message . "First blood" has heart and never becomes hypocritical about what it's trying to say , especially since the body count here is low.The story here is still actual in our times and universal . Just replace Vietnam with Iraq or Afghanistan and you could very easily make this movie today . You don't have to be a American or war veteran to appreciate it . It's easy to relate to Rambo . He's a man that has been push to far and fights for his dignity . It's a story of social injustice , lack of empathy and miscommunication. It's a story about how war can take your humanity and how the system rejects somebody it doesn't needs anymore.The conflict is written really well . There is no black or white , there are shades of grey everywhere . Not many people realize it , but this movie is based on a book "First blood" by David Morrell . In my opinion , the movie is superior to book , especially since the characters are more complex . In the book Rambo was a psycho , sheriff a nice guy and Trautman a cold blooded professional.Here , Rambo is a obviously troubled man , but a human being you can understand and care for. Sheriff is a man that cares about his job and people who live in his city . He provokes Rambo both intentionally and unintentionally . He's not a villain , more of a good man with bad attitude. Colonel Trautman is torn between helping Rambo and stopping him before someone will be hurt. As his friend he understands his pain and tries to protect him from the world that doesn't need him anymore.Sylvester Stallone , Brian Dennehy and Richard Crenna ? they all fit they characters PERFECTLY . They understand them . Stallone is silent , lonely , strong yet emotionally vulnerable person . Dennehy is both prideful and arrogant , brave and stubborn , self-righteous and honest . Crenna is intelligent , cool , confident and also emphatic person . The whole trio gives great performances , the best in their careers. Maybe not Oscar material , but definitely worth ovation.I can't say a bad thing about other actors . They give solid support to the main trio . Watch out for David Caruso ("CSI") in small role of Mitch, one of sheriff's men. Usually action movies don't have memorable music , but not here . Jerry Goldsmith created memorable score ? both heroic and sad . There is also a great song "It's a long road" by Dan Hill (you can hear it at ending credits). Andrew Laszlo provides the movie with sometimes dynamic , sometimes breathtaking photography. Last, but not last ? Ted Kotcheff directs the whole thing with confidence . The pacing is perfect."Rambo : First blood" is a story about pain and miscommunication , but there's also hope here . Hope , that somebody will give you a helping hand and will understand you . Hope that you can live with your demons. Also , it's a warning about how violence and social injustice can affect our lives . It's all here in this action movie that has something to tell instead of only providing spectacle . I give it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Henry and Kristl drew Rambo: First Blood (1982)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"This movie is an amazing mixture of good parts and bad parts." Kristl said, "and one part is certainly still relevant today as it was in those days, but, and I say this to underscore this, in a totally different way.""I think I lost you somewhere after the word 'parts'." Henry said cheerfully, while he poured himself a beer and adjusted the red headband. He was wearing something that resembled a camouflage jacket and army boots, the same Kristl was equipped with.Kristl took a long and deep breath, "In those days a veteran soldier was an outcast. Spit out by society because of the Vietnam war they had lost and of a society tired of war.""Yeah..That part is clear. It is kinda spelled out.""Now it has been reversed. Nowadays he is put on a pedestal and revered. They can't do any wrong. And this, my American friend, is called irony. For whether we see Rambo as a vet that is shunned by society or as a vet that is revered by it, he is and still is dangerous killing machine that has been bred by it and totally useless to it one peace has come. And that makes the movie still relevant today as it was back then." "But in a totally different way. I get it." Henry was cleaning his nails with a Swiss army knife. It was the biggest knife he had. Kristl frowned at him."Otherwise it has a lot of bad parts. Like the way the police of Jerktown, in the state of Nowhere are depicted as scumbags. Well some probably are, but all? Is it not over the top?""Well. They had to be, to push Rambo over the edge, I guess. And once he got going.. he got going. Actually the fights are mostly believable. Like they aren't as over the top as they are today. It is kind of refreshing really.""Except that the police keep M-16's in their armories. The standard arms for the local hillbilly police in action town, USA.""Come on, you're nitpicking." Henry bowed forward and tried to use his Swiss army knife to cut the shoelaces of his combat boots, which failed because the knife was dull. He decided against saw the laces and instead just untied them and removed his boots."Okay, I admit it. I am. Yet somehow the whole movie has a message to say and it is snowed under by the action scenes. I somehow feel that if the police had been a little bit less bad and the national guards a little less dumb and the state police had a little bit less gawking as fish that find themselves on dry land, the movie might have been better. Just a bit here and a bit there." Kristl said."You know, have you ever considered that without the action sequences the movie might be a bit more boring and that it requires a lot rewriting and recasting to make the moving in a kind of social drama that the other people, who don't like action movies, would appreciate?""I guess it does.""So considering this, I would say that it is a decent action movie for it's day and it even got a bit of a message. And as you say, that message had meaning then and still has meaning now and this in a way makes it exceptional for an action movie..""I think you are right." Kristl said and then continued after a pause, "Did you notice that there is not one woman in the whole movie. Well, except at the very beginning and a waitress who says hi somewhere halfway through the movie..""Now that you mention it." "Strange, isn't it?""Well, I guess. Does it matter?""Not that I know. Just noticed it.""Takes one, to notice one. Or the lack thereof." Henry said and he gurgled down some beer."What is that suppose to mean?""Well.. you're a woman?""Maybe we should watch a movie with only a female cast next time then.""I think I wouldn't watch it.I think I would fall asleep.""Male chauvinist pig""Really, a film with a whole female cast would either be a chat movie or a lesbian one. And both make me fall asleep, only because of different reasons." Henry said and then he cried out in pain because Kristl had kicked him,"Hope you remember that one for a while.""That hurts. What did you do that for!" He put down his can of beer and started rubbing his smarted ankle."To get your beer of course." And she grabbed his can of beer and ran away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stallone is one of the most underrated actors and this film itself is an underrated classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The word underrated has been commonly used when referring to movies. Even the greatest of films, such as The Godfather, have been considered by many to be underrated. Whilst this may be true to a certain extent, Rambo: First Blood is truly one of the most underrated action flicks that happened during the 80s.When referring to the action star, Sylvester Stallone, the words that pop out of one's mouth are definitely Rocky and Rambo but the film itself, First Blood, is never truly appreciated. In First Blood, Sylvester Stallone plays a Vietnam war hero, John Rambo, who has a hard time getting past the traumatizing events of his days in Vietnam and one days, gets into a feud with the police that results in him opening a one man war against the local police force, to the point where he has them on a merry chase across his favourite place: the jungle! First Blood is one of the films that features one of the most simplistic plots yet is at the same time, one of the most effective action films, in many ways similar to the 1988 action classic, Die Hard. First Blood, too is a classic, and is pure 80s action entertainment that truly demonstrate how low budgeted the film was yet how effective and how entertaining it turned out to be.Stallone's performance in the film is truly underrated, as is his overall acting. His performance is genuinely strong throughout the film and delivers a few emotionally powerful moments, despite the fact that his character has very little backstory. The action sequences in the film are extremely easy to follow and extremely intense but the film is more so, a thriller than an action film. First Blood changes gears in its final act as Rambo gets on top of the police and here, the movie is at its very best! Richard Crenna plays Rambo's fatherly figure, and extremely well I must say! His character is one of the more interesting elements to the film and his generosity for Rambo is evident throughout the entire film. Back to Stallone's acting, he is definitely the most physical of actors I've seen. Unlike action stars such as Schwarzenegger, Stallone is trained for physical combat so many of the physical fights in the film are definitely amazing and realistic to watch.First Blood is a true 80s action classic that will live forever. Maybe a tad slow at times, First Blood surely keeps the audience engaged for its entire 90 minute run time. The intensity, the entertainment, the excitement and the action do not stop throughout this 90 minute classic action film. It helped Stallone get away from being Rocky and make him a true action star!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rage against the machine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When returned serviceman (and former special forces operative) John Rambo visits the small town of Hope to visit a friend and finds his friend has died, he is bullied and harassed by the local law enforcement who treat him as a vagrant. When the intimidation turns violent, survival instincts emerge and he takes refuge in the mountainous surrounds, as scores of local police try to flush him out with disastrous results.The film that started it all and vastly superior to its dysfunctional progeny, with Stallone as the unassuming veteran whose inner hulk is awoken by the unjustified actions of, principally, Jack Starrett as a corrupt and aggressive cop, then further stoked by Brian Dennehy as the violence escalates and the body bags begin to burgeon. Richard Crenna plays the special military adviser flown in to try and appeal to Rambo to concede, Crenna quick to castigate the ill-advised goading pointing to the decorated soldier's valour and survival skills in Vietnam as testament to his supremacy in the cat and mouse game that's unfolding, and warning of a protracted and bloody massacre from which only the unstoppable Rambo will prevail. There's also roles for young David Caruso as an unwilling participant in Starrett's sadistic interrogation, Bill McKinney and Michael Talbott and John McLiam in supporting roles.Has earned a reputation as a misguided social commentary that promotes violence in its extremes, the character of John Rambo emerging as the poster-boy for the little guy, who responds to mistreatment with lethal force. It's not quite that sophisticated in its approach, focusing more on delivering a full-throttle action movie that combines terrific stunts, edge-of-your-seat thrills and colourful characters and locations. While Stallone's indecipherable closing speech tends to attract criticism that infects the whole film, it's not a deal-breaker in my opinion, some viewers perhaps placing too much emphasis on five minutes of gobbledygook rather than the merits of the preceding hour-and-a-half. Ignore the invective that is mostly borne of the inane successors (Rambos 2, 3 and 4 at last count), see the original, and you might be surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Deserved As An Iconic Cult Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the story of a Vietnam War veteran (Sylvester Stallone) who retreats in a small town in Washington State to break away from the horror and carnage that has effected his mind mentally. Just when he thought he has found well-deserved peace, a crooked police cop (Brain Dennehy) who has the pleasure in despising this former Congressional Medal winning Green Beret decides to lock him in jail for no apparent purpose whatsoever. But this fighter turns out to be more than just the typical veteran. This man is a high ranking expert with a vast knowledge in warfare tactics and when he has a weapon in hand he has the instincts like a raging bear. The small town eventually discover that they have bitten more than they can chew as they are on an engaging hunt against a man who's never short of ammunition and is potentially dangerous. The sad thing about "First Blood" is that this action thriller has been overlooked by fans and critics alike or has dismissed it by poor ratings, but I thought that this movie was one of the best action films of the 1980's. The movie truly has all the perfect tools for the classic action film. The pace was excitingly fast, the action scenes were was virtually sublime and we have a character like John Rambo (Stallone) who we can sympathize with even if his character very limited dialogue. Brian Dennehy is spectacular as Mr. Rambo's arch nemesis the kind of villain you'd love to despise. But this movie has some realism added to this excitement as it gives a compelling overview of former Vietnam fighters and the post-traumatic stress that never goes away after the wars they faced. For those just starting out as an action film film, this might be one you should take note on. The movie succeeds on holding up in the plot and it never once meanders in its intentions. Of course it exceeds above all action movies that are on today. There's no cheap, fabricated CGI, just natural stunt work it does look like a cheap reject from a video game or adapted from a graphic novel. Director Ted Kotcheff is quite a skilled director and his methodology goes beyond anything Stephen Sommers and Michael Bay can only dream about. The film depends entirely on directorial merits and not too dependent on technology. Just a classic iconic movie of the 1980's in all its simplicity. Sure the action films from toady's movies like "G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra" are fun to watch, but lots of the scenes are pretty hokey and too much dependent on special effects making them in the long run very unsatisfying. The film relies on the running pace and the thrilling suspense and not counting on how much profit they're going to make on their audience. The natural ability of "First Blood" comes across as though it never feels scripted and the actions that come across are something you would expect from them, making this movie as one of the more believable action films in cinema history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film adapted from an equally great novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It can be argued that this film saved Stallone's career. The only successful films he had done prior to this, were the first two Rocky films. Stallone knew himself he had to break away and try something new, and when David Morrell's First Blood was being targeted for a film, this was his best chance. And boy, did it save it.Despite the film and the book being vastly different in some aspects, not to mention the ending, both are gripping, action-packed, and very engaging. Stallone was perfectly cast in the lead, Richard Crenna and Brian Dennehy in the roles of Col. Trautman and Will Teasle respectively were too perfect castings. The only minor problem I have with the film, is how differently they portrayed the character of Teasle, however, it worked well in the film, but I feel if they chose to portray him how he was in the book then they would have had a much better film in their hands, and a far more better character. Crenna's Trautman too is portrayed differently, but is very well suited to the film's direction, and is simply faultless.This film set a bar for all action films to follow. And also broadly enhanced Stallone's career. Great acting, tremendous soundtrack courtesy of Jerry Goldsmith, and smooth direction from Ted Kotcheff, this film never gets tiresome, and every generation will one day stumble upon the iconic character of the mentally deranged Vietnam war vet John Rambo, and the war he waged on the police, who had no idea who they were dealing with, yet still engaged battle with him, and pushed him too far for really no reason.I strongly recommend anyone who has enjoyed the film to pick up a copy of the book. It is compelling reading as the film is compelling viewing. Reading it will help your understanding of the characters Rambo and Teasle, and the battle to the death that they are both locked in. You will be amazed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have loved this stallone movie since the first time I saw it. I have it on my IPOD. I was watching it on TV the other night. Wasn't 100% sure where the movie was filmed then as I was watching I noticed a woman wearing a "BAY BlANKET" coat (a famous Canadian item) in the scene where they are setting up the police camp in the forest just after John has escaped into the forest and just before Trautman appears. Strange I have to say that I never ever noticed this before in the 20 times I have watched this movie! I too have read the book and love this adaptation. For me it is the best of the Rambo movies it is the one where we find out who John is and in the next 3 movies they get a little weird and we loose who John is until he walks down the driveway again to his home in America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is pretty far from the basis of the book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say that I used to like this movie. And all the Rambo movies (except part 4 which I haven't seen). But then when I was on a vacation I ended looking in a bookstore and found the book. I didn't even realize there was a book. So I bought it and read it all the way through. Here's what I don't like about the movie. Teasle is too much of a jerk in the movie. They basically made him the bad guy of the movie. He was not the bad guy of the book. In the beginning of the book Rambo sneaks back into town and goes to the local diner to buy two hamburgers and a coke. Teasle lets him and drives him back out of town. In the end Rambo kills everybody close to Teasle. Then Teasle gets shot in the stomach by Rambo and suddenly feels sorry for Rambo. He wants to be there for him before he dies. And Rambo both die without feeling any hatred for each other. But in the movie Teasle would rather die, DIE, than to feel sorry for Rambo. They could've at least had him apologize at the end and beg for his life. But they didn't. I understand why they didn't make it exactly like the book but I would've been happier if Teasle wasn't the bad guy of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First Blood (1982)Directed by: Ted Kotcheff Based on the Novel by: David Morrell Screenplay by: Michael Kozoll &amp; William Sackheim and Sylvester Stallone Review: The Novel which First Blood is loosely based on is defiantly one of the Greatest Thriller's I've ever read, it's a interesting manhunt which is told through the Point of view of Rambo and Teasle as the two hunt after each other in the Woods and then finally in the Town. During this hunt the book also describes Rambo trying to survive as the National Guard, Police and Hunters try to capture him Dead or Alive.The Novel is much more darker and gorier than the film, the Character of Rambo in the book is more unstable and kills a lot of people while in the movie Rambo only kills one person while wounding others. The Novel explains more of Rambo's back-story before he went into Vietnam and also explains in detail the struggle Rambo had inside the POW camp and how he escaped. When you read the book you know Rambo isn't a Action Hero but instead a Troubled Young Veteran trying to survive as he's being forced back into violence.The Character of Teasle in the book does give Rambo a hard time and is persistent is getting Rambo, the book also goes into more detail with his past and with his personal life, the relationship between Teasle and Orval in more explained in the book showing that Orval was like a Father figure for Teasle since his real Dad was killed in a Hunting accident.The Character Sam Trautman doesn't have the same relationship with Rambo like he does in the film.The Ending in the Novel is another big difference from the film.My only real grip with the film is that they should have made it closer to the book, other than that the film is a entertaining Action/Thriller that shows how one man must survive against a whole army using the skills he developed in Vietnam, the film also shows how frustrating it was for Vietnam Veterans when they came back from the War.The Soundtrack for First Blood is great and really sets the mood for the film.The acting is great, Sylvester Stallone does a excellent job as the mentally unstable Veteran Rambo. The speech he gives at the end although a little hard to understand especially when he starts crying is so true to what it was like. Richard Crenna is great as Sam Trautman, he has that caring and empowering Father like figure especially when he finally meets Rambo again. Brain Denhey does a great job as the Sheriff determined to get Rambo, it just would have been nice if they made him more like the Tease in the novel. The scenery in the movie is stunning to look at and the Action is thrilling and exciting.Plot: When Young and Rugged veteran John Rambo goes to see his War buddy he sadly discovers that he's passed away, travelling along the the highway Rambo enters a small Town. Drifting through the town Sheriff Will Teasle stops Rambo and offers to take him out the Town, driving him out Rambo decides to go back. Teasle sees Rambo coming back so he arrests him, in the Police Station Rambo starts giving the Police a hard time by refusing to talk to them, have them file his Finger Prints and cooperate.After being cleaned up the Police go to shave him, having a Flashback of the Vietnam War Rambo fights his way out the Station, jumps on a Motorcycle and escapes to the Woods.Teasle and a few others go into the woods to try and apprehend him but soon find themselves being hunted by Rambo.Rambo lets Teasle go unharmed, after a while the National Guard is called in to stop Rambo. It's then that Teasle meets Sam Trautman, Rambo's mentor who offers to help them get him.It soon becomes a fight for survival as Rambo uses his Skills to try and get out the Area before the National Guards and various Hunters find him and stop him.Overview: The First Blood Novel is definitely better but the film is a entertaining 80's Action/Thriller that introduced the Legendary Action Hero John Rambo to the movie going public. Check both the Novel and the Film out to see how different they both are.</fullReview>

He escapes and is perused into the wilderness.If you started with Rambo, you will be disappointed because First Blood is about tactics and survival, not shooting everyone in Stallone's path. Just the sheer fact Stallone looks healthy and not pumped full steroids makes this movie 10x's better the Rambo. My dad did not want see Rambo because of how Sylvester Stallone looked, which undermined Rambo, in my opinion, severely.First Blood is a thrill ride from beginning to end that shows what Rambo is meant to be in his Green Beret ways, a highly trained lethal weapon.I would recommend this movie to people who like stealthy action films and not shoot em' up fans. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised to find that I had never seen a moment of the first Rambo movie. I always thought I had seen bits, if not all, of the original three films. I guess I've seen bits of parts 2 and 3, but not 1. I was also surprised that First Blood was a really good movie, well made, well acted and with some kick-ass action. It's definitely in the mode of nastier, more depressing movies of the 1970s. It reminds me at times of Deliverance. The body count is actually pretty low, but the movie is extremely violent. Sylvester Stallone plays Vietnam vet John Rambo, a former Green Beret, now on the road looking for old friends, all of whom seem to be dead when he finally finds them. When passing through a small town, he is picked up by the sheriff, played by Brian Dennehy, and hassled for no good reason. Dennehy and the rest of his police force soon realize that they've screwed with the wrong man, as Stallone goes all Vietnam on their asses, escaping into the nearby forest and attacking all who follow. After causing some general havoc, the National Guard is called in. Also, Richard Crenna, Rambo's former commanding officer, shows up warning Dennehy that Rambo's gonna kill 'em all if they don't call it off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>cool, slick action-movie danger and excitement, if a wee bit preachy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sylvester Stallone, when in the right context, can hold together an action film like it's nobody's business. First Blood, for the most part, is a terrific example of a man doing what a man does when put to his limitations- that is, when the man is a Green Beret with plenty of torturous, bullet-strewn skeletons in the closet. When it does come time to make its point as a "MESSAGE" movie (message in CAPS for a reason), it doesn't quite make it's mark- it's also slightly disappointing, in a campy-sense, that the new DVDs lack the awesome quality of the audio as Stallone originally mumbled through the final monologue, now pristine and obviously dubbed- as far as "Vietnam scarred me and nobody at home helped." It also isn't very nice to end the film with a sappy song of mourning for Rambo's semi-tragic end.But up until then, it's a near 80s action movie classic, a kind of pre-Predator chase movie where Stallone is, in a sense, both Schwarzenegger *and* Predator, attacking and evading foes like it's some kind of absurdist set of skills. Rambo gets picked up for somewhat sticking it to the Man, so to speak, in a small town up in the Northwest by a hard-ass cop (Brian Denehey) who doesn't like him from the start, pegging him as a drifter even though he's just in town to see a friend (who, by the way, is no longer living, which he never mentions save to the Colonel, but I digress). He's mishandled by the cops, sees a razor to shave him, freaks out, and beats to a pulp his way out of prison, onto a motorcycle, etc etc, till he's in the woods kicking tail and taking names.And, overall, the picture works as hard-hitting entertainment. The direction is pretty clear and unpretentious, the music hits home the notes of an ironic pro-military war movie, and Stallone flips the switch on an image he had by that time semi-established. Instead of inspirational Rocky it's pure anti-hero Rambo, who breaks the law, kills and goes nuts in destroying the town, but possibly (in argument only) in self-defense. At the end you don't stand up and cheer for the guy, but scratch your head and wonder how he got to this point. If the actual dramatics of the movie don't manipulate as well as Rocky for an emotional response it should be a given with the so-so delivery of the message (and, as well, Rocky has an obvious bit more warmth as an inspirational tale). But as a tome of a genuine tough guy, crazy but formidable, facing the elements, it's an example to follow in the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is without a doubt one of the ten best action movies of all time. the point of this is:Johnny Rambo is a disoriented Vietnam Veteran. much action scenes and it's violent too i guess.Rambo he's a violent guy and smart and of course boldfaced person.acting wasn't maybe so good than we have expected.but it's not bad movie at all. one war against one man is the point of the whole movie.it's pretty long battle against Rambo.Rambo is a hard hitting guy i guess. the only man who Rambo trust Colonel Trautman Rambo's old commander. he trained him in.and say that Rambo was a war hero.it's not maybe Stallone's best,but one of the greatest and best movies without a doubt.and can't of course Rambo IV:"Holy War" what is coming out in June 2008.7.5.10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an alright start for the now dubbed four films, but could of handled a bit more care. Sly Stallone is good in one of his early screen roles, but arguably could of been tonnes more exciting. There are some shades of excitement but not enough to get u hipper.The visual effects are half descent but more could of been done. Stallone makes an alright appearance as Viatnamese Veteran, John Rambo but the acting is just not convincing enough for me. Dull, boring and lazy, those are my words to describe Sly in this film. But it does begin to lighten up round halfway through the film. I have not yet seen the 2nd or 3rd films yet, but il tell you one thing, the 4th one looks brilliant which comes to our screens in 2008. So i'm not making any judgement on the 2nd or 3rd ones until iv seen them.To be summed up, Rambo first Blood is an half descent film, with lots of explosions, but thats about it it really, the story's so-so and the acting, well u can all guess what its like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First Blood is not only a fantastic action film but it has good social commentary concerning Vietnam vets. It's nothing people haven't seen before but the subject matter is well handled here. Unlike it's sequels (though they're pretty good) First Blood doesn't loose itself in over the top action sequences and remains firmly grounded in reality (for the most part anyway).Stallone does an exceptional job as Rambo. Playing him in a sombre and relatively straight way makes his emotional outburst towards the end all the more powerful. And although you have to pay close attention to what he's saying, his monologue is pretty effective. Richard Crenna does well as Rambo's mentor from Vietnam and Brian Dennehy is his usual reliable self, turning in a forceful performance as the unlucky small town sheriff.More pluses here include good cinematography, nice looking scenery and a terrific music score by Jerry Goldsmith. Based on a good book by David Morrell, the film of course changed the downbeat ending and opted for a bit more uplifting one. It paved the way for two decent sequels so I've got no quarrel with it. The alternate ending can be seen on DVD anyway.First Blood is a bona fide classic in my books.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Stallones best performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike the two follow ups this is a realistic and believable action movie. Stallone is a perfect fit for the role of John Rambo, a quiet man with dark memories from the war. The movie starts out excellent with Rambo coming to the small mountain town and the sheriff, which is well played by Brian Dennehy, stops him in the street. You really feel the tension building up inside Rambo as he takes the crap from the sheriff. And then the police station scene when Rambo snaps. The rest of the movie is raw, cold action and an interesting study in a Vietnam veteran tactics when hunted in the mountains. The action builds up nicely until the somewhat overblown and oversappy end.The music is excellent with an instantly recognizable track building up the suspense and action. It really adds to the movie experience.This is one of Stallones few good, believable performances along with Cop Land and Rocky 1. Recommended for raw-action-without-fuzz fans.Rating: 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I can really say about the Rambo movies is that watching them is a great break from other movies. There is no thinking involved, so you can turn off your miserable "that's not done right!" critical analysis mode, and just sit and watch mindless violence and guy appeal. It is exactly what a true guy movie should be. The story is simple, the acting is enough to get by. This movie was made for one purpose: entertainment. Sylvester Stallone wasn't thinking "Oscar!" when he did this movie, neither was any other human involved with this project. Instead we have silent weapons, minds as weapons, one man rising against the odds. Some people are going to say this story is trite and blah blah blah... Forget that. This movie does not deserve criticism or a thumbs up or a thumbs down. All you need to enjoy this movie is a cold beer and some leftover pizza. Movies like First Blood remind us that it's okay to take our critical noses out of the air for once and just sit back, watch, and be entertained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like most action movies from the 80's, this just plain owns. The action is good and groady, not like that modern 90's crap. Movies today concentrate too much on special effects and slow motion. This movie is all about kicking ass.I'm sure for the time of this movie, the story of a Vietnam war vet who is tired of being pushed around decides to start a war with the town, is a very good perspective, which must be kept in mind. Today we are more educated and sensitive to the Vietnam war, but for this movie's time in 1982, it wasn't, which makes this movie so good.This is more than a simple action movie, it's a classic. This movie could not be much better. I give it a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A literary critic divided protagonists into four levels: (1) the ironic, in which the central character is too naive to understand what's up, like Candide; (2) the low mimetic, in which the character is weaker than the ordinary, like most of Hitchcock's characters; (3) the high mimetic, more powerful and skilled than most people, like Patton; (4) the heroic, in which the character has superhuman qualities, like Superman. John Rambo is most a high-mimetic character with touches of the heroic. As his ex-superior officer, Richard Crenna explains, he can kill with guns, knives, or bare hands, he ignores the weather, he knows how to live off the land, he can eat things that would make a billy goat puke. So far, so high-mimetic. Crenna doesn't mention it but Rambo can also jump off 500-foot rock cliffs into a forest and land uninjured except for a scratch on his biceps, which he later sews up by himself. He can also move like Flashman. Brian Dennehy is on the roof of the sheriff's office and Rambo blows up a building a block away. Dennehy rushes to that side of the roof and a moment later Rambo explodes another building a block away on the opposite side of the roof. Dennehy rushes, but before he gets across the roof, Rambo is another block away. Rambo is also able to plaster himself over with mud against a hillside. Assuming that he used his hand and arm to cover himself (as opposed to, say, a tongue) then he managed to cover his final arm with mud by some means unknown to the rest of humankind.This is one mixed-up movie. The Sheriff is unexplainedly unfriendly at first, then implausibly murderous. His minions are exclusively brainless goons. They stumble into ambushes. They don't give Rambo a chance to surrender peacefully. A madman in a helicopter tries to shoot him for no reason. The Washington National Guard troops are a bunch of disorganized pussies and wimps who will "be back behind the drugstore counter tomorrow." Rambo kills none of them, of course, or he'd lose our sympathy, but to satisfy the kind of audience that enjoys action movies he wounds and humiliates them all and destroys billions of dollars worth of windows and gas station tanks. What is Stallone's motivation for this outburst of fury? He's been hassled by the cops of this dinky town after hearing some very bad news about a comrade in arms and quietly trying to find something to eat. The movie gives him more than that, though. At the end, in probably the best scene Stallone has put on film, he breaks down and sobs while describing an experience in Vietnam. Richard Crenna gives a TV-movie-level performance as the colonel, a man of few words but very many condescending smirks. He's given "Dragnet" dialogue. Dennehy: "I'm going to send 200 men out there after him." Crenna: "If you do that you'd better bring something else." Dennehy: "What's that?" Crenna: "A lot of body bags." Dennehy's part is that of the rabid, hateful Southern sheriff, but it's confusing because as a man so filled with self-righteousness, pride, and machismo he ought to be in awe of a real soldier, especially a winner of the CMH. It really is a Southern sheriff movie, you know. Only the geography has been changed. Denney's bloodthirsty adjutant speaks with a Southern accent. Dennehy keeps addressing Rambo as "Boy." As an action movie, this is pretty good. As a reflection of anything resembling reality it falls a bit short. Rambo shouldn't be pitted against all these stupid but innocent people. He ought to still be killing enemies over in Vietnam. This was a mistake soon to be rectified.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine action-drama that gets better with age.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"First Blood" is an excellent film. Stallone takes a lot of heat because he has many hit or miss films to his credit, especially in the last 15 years or so. "First Blood" captures one of his finest performances, ranking right up there with his nuanced work in "Rocky" and "Rocky II." It is well-made and has a different tone than its sequels, which focus more on "lone hero versus great odds action" and Stallone's physique. There are other fine performances in the film, headed by the late Richard Crenna, whose character provides a center to the film. The final scene between Rambo and Trautman is powerful and sad, yet uplifting. Rambo is a dangerous human being and it's not just from his training. He was not prepared for a life after war. The sequels, although popular and action-packed, do not build on the human drama seen in the first film. Watch Stallone's body language at the beginning of the film when he meets the wife of his former team member. His pain is intense. Rambo's final speech in the police station is probably Stallone's best single scene in any of his films. Listen to what he says. His nightmares, delivered in a stream of consciousness, are horrifying. The final speech in "Rambo: First Blood Part II" is ridiculous and insincere in comparison. It pales next to the original. "First Blood" looks and sounds even better now that the new DVD has been released. If you were unimpressed the first time around, give it another chance.</fullReview>

Richard Crenna is amazing in his supporting role as Col. Trautman, Rambo's mentor.

		<fullReview>'First Blood' proved that Sylvester Stallone did not have to wear boxing gloves to be successful. Stallone plays Rambo, a character that became even more iconic than Rocky. Although the Rambo character is often seen as a symbol for the right-wing Reagan era, the film is actually based on a 1970s novel with a definite anti-war message. Its author, John Morrell, was not too happy with the action hero John Rambo had been turned into but apparently his objections to Stallone's adjustments did not make turn down the offer to write the novelizations of the two sequels.'First Blood' is first en foremost a solid action film with a gripping story line and some fine action scenes. In addition the film boasts strong performances by both Brian Dennehy as Will Teasle, the small town sheriff who makes the mistake of getting into Rambo's way and Richard Crenna as Rambo's former army superior Col. Samuel Trautman. It is a shame that the makers of the film decided to change the ending of the novel. The finale they have come up with instead seems somewhat of an anti-climax, as if it had been hastily changed just before the film was finished. Nevertheless I consider this film to be a true action classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First Blood is a great action movie, and one on Stallone's best, after Rocky.Stallone plays John Rambo, a former Green-Beret in Vietnam who is arrested by a small town sherrif because he wants something to eat, and charged with vagrency. The deputy sherrif abuses Rambo, and all hell breaks loose when Rambo manages to escape and make it to the woods. Not even after Rambo wipes out half of the team looking for Rambo, and his former commanding officer, Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna) tells the sherrif that he is in a war that he cannot win, will the sherrif give up.Plenty of explosions and violence will keep action fans watching, and most people will probably be sympathetic with Rambo's problems.A good, solid action movie from the king of action movies, Sylvester Stallone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When we talk about Rambo or being Rambo or ramboism, we usually indicate to a movie which is originally named First Blood Part 2 (1985). Then easily we forget that Rambo made his first appearance already in film First Blood (1982).So, what then? Nothing else but, Rambo's political message changed in three years a lot. First Blood is liberal action movie, where they want to show how U.S.A. citizens treat Vietnam vets, using very strict words.Rambo is war crazy lump, who makes anything without thinking just for his own perfect country defending Coca Cola and apple pie.In First Blood Sylvester Stallone urges charismatic physical presence, which has been later years lost from him. But in CopLand he shows how to act, because he is good actor still. (He's my favorite actor). Stallone is Rambo, Vietnam-vet and very good soldier, who wants to be alone or recover from his traumas.But then sheriff of one little town make a mistake. To him Rambo looks like a hippie and then not hoped person. Sheriff wants Rambo out of his town and drives him out of the town, sheriff teases him so Rambo would realize go away. But Rambo's logic goes little bit different way.He declares war against cops, in that battle they don't give mercy and ask mercy. In long time First Blood is excellent action movie, which is impressive and has angry attitude. Though in the end movie goes to the side of stupidity and unrealism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Action Hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rambo trilogy is of historical film interest, as it effectively presages both the beginnings and the inevitable end of the "action" movie trend prevalent throughout the eighties.First Blood is a strong vehicle for Stallone, and odd in its style. While made in 1982, it has enough panoramic sweeps and lengthy scenes to make it feel like a work of the late 70s. Or this could be the "Deer Hunter" connection, the film being set in much of the same woodland territory and with the obligatory Vietnam angst to propel the narrative. Made just four years later, there's even a line where one cop asks another "didn't we go deer hunting here last year?" Whether this is a direct reference or not I don't know, but I'd like to assume it is some form of homage.Now, I won't commit film heresy by saying that I think First Blood is better than the 78 DeNiro vehicle (though I DO think it's better than that pretentious, cold and overrated "epic"), but it's an important focal point for the origins of Rambo in film history. The first twenty minutes or so of this film see a leisurely pace and some dialogue scenes, where the end gives Sylvester a chance to eulogise over the horrors of war. Only a wooden performance from Richard Crenna and a cheesy end titles song by Dan Hill detract from this one. Okay, it's not an all-time great, but then it's not supposed to be; it doesn't have its sights aimed that high. But it IS a well-made, compact film that just happens to have what seems now sporadic violence but was then mould-breaking action sequences, including a plethora of explosions. John Rambo, a taciturn, partly psychotic Vietnam veteran is possibly the most interesting characterisation Stallone ever played. At least in this film.When Stallone returned to the role three years later the action genre was well and truly underway, and his non-Rambo roles ? Cobra, an arm wrestler in "Over The Top" and a dumbed-down Rocky in the execrable "Rocky IV" ? saw him only respond to violence and effects. The need to actually ACT was no longer required. Rambo 2 is a non-acting role, a shoot-?em-up video game on celluloid. Plotless and pointless, it's a completely different film to the original, related by name only. This time the cheesy end song is by Frank Stallone, though Richard Crenna gives a better performance. With an ineffective screenplay by Stallone and James Cameron, it provides such unlikely treats as a "Rambo in love" subtext and some Cod Russians. While the film takes the Rambo concept out of the arthouse and firmly into the mainstream (making over $300 million in the process), it is praiseworthy in some respects. One of those is Stallone who, while not required to act, just point guns, does still make a notable effort in the role. The movie is also, if not anti-American, anti-Government, and as subversive as the first. And it does have a nice exchange to conclude: "How will you live, John?" "Day by day". In every other respect, however, it set us up perfectly for the final part of the trilogy, which may in many ways be the better film.For in 1988 Stallone did us all a great favour, something which would have been lost on him at the time: he failed. Rambo III, a $63 million production, was regularly cited as amongst the top ten all-time biggest flops. (Although it still made $189m world-wide) The original movie gave us a dysfunctional member of society, twisted by the darker side of the "American Dream". Rambo III sees the ultimate distillation of that character into an establishment figure that touts anti-Soviet propaganda as he takes on an entire division of the Russian army. A character who only speaks to deliver smug one-liners and indulges in a witless display of pyrotechnics, firing exploding arrows like the comic book superhero "Hawkeye". This second sequel gave us Sylvester at possibly his physical peak, a pumped-up narcissist who never wears a shirt. Perhaps not as bad a film as is made out, (the usage of an Asian people as heroes is rare in American film, even if the ethic is misguided) Rambo III still stinks, though not nearly as badly as many of the wannabe action movies of the same period. It took a high-production work like this one to fail to mark the first weakness in the seemingly invincible action genre. Even then it took Stallone time to realise he was beat: Daylight, Judge Dredd and the vaguely-enjoyable Demolition Man saw him continue to go through the motions, a sad waste of a considerable and overlooked talent. Such a genre saw few stars, with mainly non-actors latching onto the trend. Steven Segals, Dolph Lungrens and Jean-Claude Van Dammes all proved they could kick-box but not anything remotely approaching a performance. While successful, the only two real stars of this genre were Stallone himself and Schwarzenneger. I don't include Bruce Willis in this category as, while the "Die Hards" of this world fit the mould, they still required the lead to act, to say lines, to demonstrate emotion. Whether Willis did this or not is another matter, but they were, to a degree, acting roles, rather than the "murder-death-kills" of Demolition Man.Which is why Stallone should look back to First Blood for the next stage of his career. His return to acting proper in 1997's "Copland" surprised many, and I know of numbers of people that stayed away just for his name alone. To date he has yet to consolidate this role. I like Sylvester, and believe he can act, when he lets himself. The first couple of Rocky films and this movie allowed him to work as an actor. They may have effectively overseen the destruction of the action genre, but in their initial stages they were worthwhile experiments in cinema. Finally: "Play It Again, Sam"; "You Durtee Rat!" and "Beam Me Up, Scotty". Stallone is added to this rank. Because, you know, he never actually DID say "Don't push me!"</fullReview>

The rainy atmosphere when John Rambo walks through the Rocky Mountain town sometime during the autumn, and the sheriff putting on an act. He is apprehended, and some of the policemen try to wash him with a firehose and shave him with a razorblade. Rambo gets a flashback to Vietnam where he was cut by his captioners. He goes berserk, turns the policestation upsidedown before hi-jacking a motorcycle and driving into the mountains. He is hunted by a hord of policemen and the local homeguard is called into action. But now they are the ones who are hunted, as Rambo easily plays cat and mouse with them. The film may go a bit over the edge at the end, but Stallones speach where he explains the nature of his post-Vietnam mental prison, is what makes all the violence acceptable. Just.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The very first Rambo film is well under-rated. Do not let the fact that it is a Rambo movie put you off that its just a dumb action. It has such great film art in it. It was great in all ways. The script, the music score and the characters and acting. All was just great. It was not until the next film that the legendary tough guy dumb adventure film became famous.A vietnam veteran returning from the war goes to meet his last friend but discovers that he has died too along with all his other friends in the army. Now, with no where to go, not much faith in what to do, walks to a town just to get some food, where he easily becomes an enemy with the towns sherrif. His appearence quickly annoys the cop and after a bit of ruffle, Rambo is arrested but shortly after, escapes from the local police station and goes on the hide in a forest on a mountain where a manhunt groups.The story becomes very captivating and suspenseful with some great stunts. The deprest, loner John Rambo gives a great little comment on the events that took place in Vietnam. The disrespect from the government and people of the United States of America towards the men who were forced to go out and protect their country. A movie describing unloyal people.In this movie, Rambo actually doesn't kill a single person while the legend of the story is that he takes on a hundred guys and kills them all at once is so untrue. It is a good movie. Great fun but serious all the same.This is one you have to watch. A fantastic film which is many times over and over again better than Star Wars as it is set un reality and involves a captivating script. Just wonderful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching the movie for the umteenth time, I cannot help but recall the significant impact this movie has had on our culture. This movie has been significant in that it finally called upon this masses to honor the Vietnam vets for their sacrifice for our nation. Following this movie our society moved towards embracing them back to the mainstream after shamefully rejecting them upon their return home. The events that followed this movie ultimately led to the protection of vets against discrimination, POW-MIA movement, and the multiple memorials now found in every state of the Union. We have to remember that what the movie presents in the end is the catalyst towards reconcilement. This is a class movie and our country and veterans owe a great deal towards its effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Crafted and Exciting Social Commentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The First and Best of the Original Trilogy Introduces Sly Stallone as the Character Whose Name has Become Synonymous with a Gung Ho Fighting Machine. "Rambo". The Two Initial Sequels were a Solidification and Both were Mindless Killing Machine Movies that were Big Hits but Ultimately Nothing More than Over the Top Comic Book Stuff.The Original was More Concerned with Returning Viet Nam Veteran Angst and a War that was as Divisive as Any. It is this Undercurrent that Makes First Blood a Minor Classic and is Quite Complicated, Like Real Life, with Rambo Confronting His "Makers". The Society and the Military Machine that Sent Him to War and then Turned Their Backs on His Return.There Can be No Doubt as Rambo is Not Only Pushed Out of Town ("We don't want your kind here"), but Arrested, Brutally and Sadisticly Abused by Law Enforcement. Even After His Escape He is Hunted and Attacked with Lethal Force and Forced to Defend Himself, All the While Showing Remarkable Restraint and Kills No One.After Returning to Town and Unleashing His Rage on Inanimate Objects that Symbolize Society, He Once Again Shows Who is the Hero Here and it Ain't the "Good Guys". This is a Well Crafted Social Commentary with an Anti-Hero that has been with Us Ever Since Cinema Began to Tell Stories. It Remains a Pop Culture Icon to this Day and Holds Up Very Well. Much Better than those Two Ridiculously Ramped Up Sequels. Note...The 2008 Film Rambo has the Character Return from Retirement to Help the Oppressed People of Burma and is a Very Good Entry in the Canon and is Worthy of the Name and Redeemed the Character who was Exploited in II and III.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An action masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is a former Vietnam vet and soldier who was drifting in Oregon and when he is harassed by a tough hearted Sheriff (Brian Dennehy) and the local authorities of a small town, he suddenly gets bad memories of his past in Vietnam that gets triggered. The cops are hunting him down as he is hiding near the woods for Rambo is armed with weapons, his former commanding officer/friend Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna) comes in and must try to control his former soldier from causing any more damage to the police and the town.A powerful and compelling action drama thriller is one of the best movies of the 80's and most influential. Inspired by a novel from David Morrell, this gritty and downright violent film is also a human drama as well which is co-written by Sylvester Stallone. The film became a surprise box-office hit in October of 1982, it spawned a few fun sequels and some knock-offs but none of them could surpass this marvelous gem which actually made Rambo a more tragic character that the audience could relate to. This movie has spectacular stunts and action sequences, good performances and a memorable score by Jerry Goldsmith which makes this a personal fave of mine and a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film in Dire need of a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is raw, brutal, and in a way honest. But (SPOILED ALERT) end wrong. had it ended the way it did in the book, There would be no half ass-ed Rambo vs. Pinko travesties.As a Newly Made Vet myself, I understand the difficult, to an extent, of the balancing act of a soldier. A man goes to Basic training, it taught how to kill when ordered to do so for the service of his country. and then come home, puts away the soldier and never forgets how to gut a man 6 ways to Sunday, and is told, this is not acceptable behavior in the moral right. But I severed the moral right told to shoot to kill my enemy? For some it is far worse. Not all scares are on the outside. and many come home after having done or have had done to them Very terrible things no man should ever have to endure. All for their country right or wrong. That is a debate I'm not willing to evoke here.Rambo, John J. Of Arizona is just that sort of soldier. While he was probably asked to do these terrible thing to people and did so with out question for a country he loved so much that he served it and did so with honor. His real Goal was to server his "BROTHERS" in arms. to a soldier every man and woman he or she serves with is a Brother or sister as real as if they where related by blood.To come home and living 7 years of private Hell having been a POW and tortured for what we'll never know. he is looking for his place in the Society that sees him as human trash. Would be enough to brake any mans spirit.On his search for family and belonging he seeks out at very least one of his army brothers, to find him dead. his reaction is leaving the only picture of his true family behind and throwing any other connecting scraps into the fire thus severing any ties he has to the world. Stallone I found actually played this moment very well. He start hopeful and optimistic and then the curtain drop and he find him self battling his demons with no one to help him.by the time he meets the town of Hope's Sheriff, He's already lost all sight of any connection to the world. Made worse by a man who is relentlessly driving him away to the point of abusive assertion of authority. but he was not the worse character he would face. While being booked, Teasle's men are down right cruel and have no idea how to be anything but or what memories they are stoking in this already fragile mans mind.When all hell brakes loose. it is they who truly drew first blood but it is Rambo who instigated this. In my take of the story, Neigther Teasle nor Rambo where right or wrong. but what makes them so different, Teasle felt falsely justified where as Rambo made no attempt to hind his wrath true nature. He was after all build to be a killer and once a killer always capable of killing with out question. his fatal flaw is he knew nothing more then the service of violence.The Movie it self can never be made like it was ever again on such a budget like that scaled to todays movie furnaces. but the film is by far a simple story of what the human creature is really like. suppress the animal is side you all you want, we are all Killing machines inside and are all driven to violence.From Rome's Gladiator to our current Splatter Flicks. We all wish to see or do things to others living thing to destroy them. it in our nature, deny it all you want, it still true.the trick is maintaining that creature in a safe and healthy way, some fail other curb it so much they believe they killed it.Still this film needs to be retold, ended they way David Morelle wrote it good or bad. and left to the view to decide who was right and who was wrong.SPOILER: in the book, Rambo killed many that stood up to face him. if your intent was to kill him you where a dead man. He left few to live, and injured even fewer.while that sort of a character would not be your standard "hero" he was after all a killer of men. that what he was trained to do, that what he did for most of his adult life (age 18+) and thats is how he would die at the end of first blood.The film as it sits was good for it time and is still relevant even if you had Rambo a vet of the First Iraq conflict, or still Vietnam for that matter. and with what we can do even with practical effects (Effects done live on camera) that where hard to do at the time. the movie could be so much more as long as, Bless him for the character, Sly stays the hell away from it. We don't need Rambo 4: Old Fart's blood. We need a remake of Rambo 1 with fresh blood and a new face for the man we call Rambo. and a redefinition of what Rambo Style really means.after all Rambo is a tactical Combat Expert. one thing you see little of in the films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is not one part about this movie that does not rock. This is the best movie of Stallone's career as far as action goes. Nothing can compare to the over the hill mix of normal, hardcore, emotional train wreck that Stallone brings to this film. Forget fancy words, and forget fancy talk because the only words needed to describe this film..."absolutely awesome". As I sat down one night looking for a good movie I had seen this movie in the library and hundreds of rental places but had never taken the time to see the action it was supposed to bring. Finally I sat down and watched this movie and I was blown away. I had always seen Stallone as kind of a more serious actor than what people give him credit for. Once I watched this movie, there was no kind of, this is as serious as it gets. Nothing in his career compares to the over the hill in your face sock it to 'em action that Sylvester Stallone brings to First Blood. Forget drama and suspense because there is plenty of it, and if you want action well there is more than you can handle. Of you want one movie that can bring you all the fundamentals of a good movie this is it. I think what every movie needs to succeed is this 1. a good story, 2. dramatic moments, 3. suspense, 4. and lastly good acting. well this movie brings all of this and more. It only takes a moment for this film to give you some drama. And it only takes but a moment more for the incredible acting that this film brings to finally set in. This film had such great action, great suspense, moments of everything I look for in a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original And Best Rambo Flick - A Classic Action Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Rambo is a Vietnam War veteran having trouble readjusting to normal life who drifts into a small north-western town and immediately falls foul of the local sheriff, who arrests him for vagrancy. The feud escalates to lethal proportions when Rambo busts out and heads for the hills, hotly pursued by the cops, and a bloody manhunt ensues.Let's get one thing clear right off. The two sequels to this movie, Rambo: First Blood Part II (surely the stupidest title in movie history) and Rambo III are big-budget right-wing macho Hollywood crap. This movie on the other hand is a superb little action drama, nicely written, brilliantly acted and extremely well made. Its strength is twofold - primarily, it's a great boy's adventure flick packed full of fantastic action; a motorcycle chase, camouflage combat, helicopters, a fall from a sheer cliff-face, Dobermans, a rat-infested mine, an exploding gas-station and a lunatic with an M16 assault rifle. Secondly, Stallone (who co-scripted) wisely lets the rest of the talented cast tell the story and pares his dialogue to a minimum, which gives his touchingly hysterical crying-fit speech at the end all the more poignancy. Dennehy is excellent as the implacable Sheriff Teasle, constantly justifying his personal vendetta against his prey in terms of his responsibility to keep the peace. The movie is a model of good action film-making on a modest budget, with fabulous photography by Andrew Laszlo in beautiful wintry forest locations (it was shot in Golden Ears Park in British Columbia), great stuntwork by Conrad Palmisano and a stunning score by Jerry Goldsmith, which punctuates the violence perfectly and features a truly haunting guitar-and-trumpet theme. Stallone is a love-him-or-loathe-him kind of actor, but I kinda like him, and this is my favourite of his movies; he's completely convincing as the ultra-survivalist Rambo ("He's been trained to eat things that would make a billy-goat puke.") but the character is a great rallying-call to the disenfranchised, exacting his vengeance only when he is pushed too far. When his old Colonel tells him he can't go running around wasting friendly civilians, his bitter response is, "There are no friendly civilians.". A somewhat forgotten film, but one whose influence on action films since has been hugely significant, this was a big hit for the great independent producer partnership of Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna, who went on to make several excellent films (Angel Heart, Johnny Handsome, Total Recall, and several others). Extremely well directed by the talented Kotcheff, and based on a great pulp novel by David Morrell (in which Rambo dies). Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First Blood (1982) is a highly entertaining movie about John Rambo (Stallone) a green beret and highly effective one man war machine, who has returned from Vietnam to visit his war buddy in a small town near Portland.When he finds out that the last member from his group his died of cancer he is left on his lonesome where he drifts through this small town, but the local sheriff spots him and doesn't want him in HIS town, the sheriff is a cruel son of a b*tch to Rambo, he drives Rambo out of the town, when Rambo trys to re-enter the town for abit of food the sheriff arrests him and brings him back to his small time Jail with other nasty officers!!! Rambo is treated in a cruel manner, but being a war expert and a survivor from NAM, he soon breaks out of the jail, and from then on the film is a cat and mouse chase, about 200 police officers headed by the nasty sheriff chase Rambo into the woods, they want him DEAD!! A while into the film, his old leader from Vietnam returns to try and help Rambo, but can his trust the Lieutenant?? This film is a classic, the characters are very good and you really feel Rambos pain, the torture he suffered in NAM, he was a hero there who could use fighter planes and drive tanks, and now he's just a loner in a town where nobody likes or trusts him!! The film has great action, lots of explosions and it keeps you fully entertained the whole way through, so it gets a well deserved 9/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film in many ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the few Hollywood action flicks that really "works." I will not pretend to admit that Stallone is much of an actor (he really isn't very impressive), but we have a good script, good action, brilliant soundtrack and great sets.The movie is interesting on several levels. First, Brian Dennehy and his idiot deputies actually DO portray how police officers behave when they get too much power. They go crazy. Why do they do it? Because they have the power to lock up people and use weapons. Having had personal experience with police officers, I have seen this before. One of the reasons this movie is so good is because Brian Dennehy is brilliant as an actor. He truly can play anything -- and this role shows him at his best (although his character is unlikeable). He carries the movie.Similarly, Richard Crenna is nothing short of brilliant in this movie. His acting ability is flawless. I have never seen him give a bad performance, and he truly shines to keep the movie entertaining. His scenes with Brian Dennehy really make you want to know what is going to happen next.So, even though Stallone is marginal at best, the other actors in this film really make it worth watching.Next, we have an absolutely brilliant soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith. This movie has a lot of running in it, and Goldsmith has always been a master at chase scenes. Truly, this is one of Goldsmith's BEST soundtracks because it is so riveting and full of life. The music makes Stallone's character come alive on screen.Last, this film was shot in the Canadian woods. The scenery and sets are stunning! I cannot think of a better location to film this kind of movie.GREAT MOVIE! Highly recommended. Sequels not impressive by comparison.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"First Blood," the 1982 action hit starring "Rocky's" very own Sylvester Stallone is a fine piece of action cinema that should be viewed for what it really is. This movie, unlike other movies about military men waging one man wars was the first of it's kind to portray a bad-a** Vietnam vet or military man in that light. This movie help spawn future films about soldiers that have no mercy i.e. Soldier(even though he started having a heart). This movie was excellent because aside of this being an action movie, it was also a dramatic movie as well. You could really feel the intensity at the end when Sly Stallone delivered his powerful monologue to Sgt. Troutman. This is by far Sylvester Stallone's finest acting performance to date. Forget Rocky, Rambo was his best character. Watch this movie today, because this is the only one in the series that really showed Rambo's humanistic side instead of him as an all out killing machine like in Part 2 and 3. This is the best survival movie ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original that started it all...The RAMBO craze of the 80's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"First Blood",was without a doubt one of the most popular Sylvester Stallone flicks of its era,second to his extremely successful "Rocky" films which were still going string in the decade of the "he-man",macho go for the gusto era of bad-muscular driven individuals of the 1980's. "First Blood",was without a doubt the first action-packed Sylvester Stallone movie vehicle that introduced the world to the hero and basically take no prisoners individual,John Rambo,which during the 80's the RAMBO craze took off like a rocket and from there lead to franchise of RAMBO fever that swept the country. But here is the original version based on the novel by David Morrell,which was in fact the first screenplay was written in the mid-1970's,but it never got into production until the next decade which was suppose to be set for actors Clint Eastwood,Burt Reynolds,Steve McQueen,Charles Bronson,or James Coburn,but anyway the script was revised and went to Sylvester Stallone instead who did wonders with the role that brought in the boxoffice receipts."FIRST BLOOD"(Carolco Films/Orion Pictures,1982)-Was released in the summer of 1982,and the week it opened was the top-grossing film of its day and one of the top five highest grossing pictures of that year which was beside heavyweight contenders from the summer of 1982,like "E.T.","Star Trek II","An Officer And A Gentlemen","Blade Runner",and the Disney computer-generated thriller,"Tron". Synopsis: Sylvester Stallone is former Green Beret survivor of the Vietnam War whose nightmares of wartime horrors are triggered by a wrongful arrest in a small town. He escapes into the mountains of the Northwest and leads his pursuers to all manner of bloody ends,especially the one who framed him which was under the scrunity of the tyrant small town sheriff(Brian Dennehy). Finally,the Army is summoned to crush him. Extremely violent and frequently confused,he takes out the tyrants and the entire town,one by one and piece by piece by a fuel of revenge that brings this movie to a climax. It also brings Richard Crenna and David Caruso,and Jerry Goldsmith's masterpiece of thematic music. Worth seeing. Rating:**** out of *****"RAMBO-FIRST BLOOD:PART II"-(Carolco Films/Tri-Star Pictures,1985)-Despite what some may say about the film's bad image,they wouldn't know grand entertainment if it kicked them in the ass. Despite being of the worst films of that year,it was a shocked to the some and Stallone's critics that the sequel to "First Blood",was one of the top-boxoffice grossing films of the year,making over $200 million in worldwide receipts and one of the highest grossing pictures of the 1980's,and the highest grossing summer picture during the summer of 1985,alongside its heavyweight contender,"Back To The Future",as two of the biggest blockbuster hits of that year. It's reason? This film was very patriotic in the way it symbolized John Rambo as a American icon who stood for freedom,truth,justice and the American way. This time around Sylvester Stallone is called back to duty under his supervisor(Richard Crenna)to rescue POW's still trapped in Vietnam,and if anyone can save our boys still held prisoner in Southeastern Asia,it is none other than John Rambo,and this time around he goes back to the hellhole he had to deal with years ago,and this time around its the fight to save our beloved soldiers still held captived by a bunch of Russian baddies and Vietnamese sadistic villains. Along the way,he is captured,tortured by Russian intelligence,and then he escapes flexes his biceps,and then disposes the bad guys by the dozen in one of the biggest dead body parades every filmed,and the body count gets higher and higher as Rambo takes them out one by one and then towards the end goes back to the superiors and takes out the commanding officer and the headquarters in a blaze of bullets. It may have been some mindless action,but the testosterone level was driven to levels no one ever believe,and the boxoffice receipts showed this too. This film launched a franchise of RAMBO oriented gear which included games,toys, merchandise by the truckloads and a syndicated short-lived Saturday Morning cartoon series,even though had a "R" rating for excessive violence throughout. Wasn't part of the 1980's cool?THE WORST OF THE RAMBO SERIES: RAMBO:FIRST BLOOD-PART III-(Carolco Films/Tri-Star Pictures,1988)-This time around,Rambo(Sylvester Stallone) is call back to duty to rescue his mentor(Richard Crenna)from a sadistic Russian general in the hills of Afghanistan.The action was good and fair,but it lacked the no-brainer and sheer tentactive of the first two Rambo's,but it was basically the final Rambo film,and from this sequel,which was filmed on location in Isreal,cost over $58 million to make,the most expensive film ever,at its time which also came out in the summer of 1988,and lost to heavyweight competitors "Crocodile Dundee II",and the action-packed Bruce Willis vehicle "Die Hard",which was the top grossing film of that year.And the producers want to make a RAMBO IV? I don't think so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film, could have been much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First Blood was a tremendous idea, but unfortunately was not fully capitalized on. The problem was sacrificing quality to be more mainstream and make more money. One reason I say that is because the filmakers tried to hard to make Rambo a sympathetic character. Why did Rambo only kill one cop, and the one he killed wasn't even an attempted killing? Had the Rambo character been more vicious, the film would have been much more powerful. He should have killed Brian Dennehy at the end, and then had the balls to face all the cops before eventually getting killed, taking some cops with him in the process. That would show that his situation was so bad, that he didn't want to go on living.The low-point of the film was Stallone's rambling, bore-athon of a speech at the end. The film tried to make it dramatic and powerful, but it failed miserably. Anyone with a basic knowledge of the vietnam war could tell what Rambo's motivations were. Spelling everything out is a disrespect to the audience. The people who made this film should have studied Sam Peckinpah's Wild Bunch, and take aspects of that film into First Blood. The legendary "Let's go" line especially.Richard Crenna's character was pointless and the film would have been better off without it. Also, too much swearing took maturity out of the film.The positives of the film were the great action sequences. Rambo obliterating the pathetic town was a spectacular finale. The Dennehy/Stallone car chase and Stallone's escape from prison were also great. However, the scene where that fat cop couldn't kill Rambo from a helicopter, while Rambo was hanging on a cliff was contrived and totally sucked. Other than that great action.Dennehy was tremendous in his role. His treatment and tone towards Stallone in the beginning of the film set the stage and rallied the audience around Rambo. Well-done soundtrack as well.In conclusion, there's some definite quality here, but too much what-ifs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First Blood (or as it is called by everybody : Rambo) is the kind of movie we should be ashamed of to admit we actually liked it, but the truth is that this movie comes close to that of a true masterpiece and perhaps one of the finest actionmovies ever made! We better not talk about the sequels (director Ted Kotcheff distances himself completely from it), the many Rambo wanna be-movies (remember the laughable "Missing in action"-series with Chuck Norris) or the fact that tons of idiots identify themselves with Rambo. Even the story was back then quite original (only be seen in "Apocalypse now" or "The deer hunter" as this movie was more a critic towards the society (boys who fight in Nam were abandonned by their own countrymates). The movie starts great with John Rambo (Stallone of course) visiting a small American town to visit an old Namfriend at where he is quite shocked that this friend died of cancer he got there. Disappointed he walks back till a sherrif (brilliantly performed by Brain Dennehy) tells him to go away as his "city" doesn't want creeps like him. He soon lands in the local prison without having committed a crime and once he's got beaten by everyone who wears a blue skirt, Rambo escapes to the prison. By accident and by selfdefedence a cop dies but Dennehy and his crew declare the war on him...and during the second part of the movie that is as brilliant as Boorman's "Deliverance" you see the haunt for Rambo. Eighty minutes long you see a brilliant picture that looses its fascination at the end when Rambo comes back to town...it would have been better if everything was shoot in the forest though. The role played by Stallone (apart from the rather ridiculous endmonologue) is a silent one...and let's say it like it is, this casting was perfect. Lots of serious people will dislike it, you're right on if you do that with Rambo II or III but this one is great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First Blood was a great film with a serious message and a realistic story boosted by great performances by Stallone, Dennehey and Crenna etc. It also had some great action sequences especially the police car/motorbike chase and the cliff face jump. People might dismiss this film too quickly as it's a Rambo film but maybe thats because of the overblown action packed sequels that followed, but this film has many emotional moments. Stallone was great in this and put everything into his performance plus the music by Jerry Goldsmith is excellent. The follow up to this film was nothing more than an adrenaline pumped actioner, though it was highly enjoyable, whilst Rambo III is pretty rubbish to be honest. But this one is just great all the way through and set Stallone up to be one of the biggest stars of the 1980's.</fullReview>

Rambo got a cut (they drew FIRST BLOOD) so naturally old Sly must defend himself. Not bad for a laugh with some friends but not what i would call a strong film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First Blood is action classic that makes you think. Stallone created a new franchise for himself in the form of John Rambo. Brain Denhey makes great bad guy and Richard Crenna as the father figure type is always good. The action sequences in the film are intense but below all that is a film with heart that makes you think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily the best of the Rambo movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much better than it's usually made out to be, FIRST BLOOD is a far more powerful and more thought-provoking film than one might expect. Stallone gives perhaps his best performance after his turn in the original ROCKY, as an unemployed Vietnam veteran trying to survive in even more hostile territory, smalltown USA. Traumatized by captivity and torture during the war, and seemingly abandoned by the no-time-for-losers capitalist ethos of the country he fought for, John Rambo is drifting towards mental breakdown and vagrancy. Passing through a rural community, he is hassled and hauled in by Brian Dennehy's redneck sheriff (another fine performance), but when Rambo escapes the police station and leads his pursuers into the nearby forest, the authorities find themselves no match for the former soldier skilled in jungle warfare, The TWIN PEAKS-esque town is an atmospheric backdrop for a film that delivers as a fast-paced action thriller that has a few intelligent points to make, and is helped in making them by the fact that the villain, Dennehy, is not a nasty guy as such. He's somewhat reactionary, certainly overzealous and a blowhard, but he's ultimately a good man trying his best to do his job. At the same time, Stallone (then best known as the purer-than-the-driven-snow Rocky Balboa) took a risk in playing the disturbed Rambo (who became a comic book superhero in the sequels; here, he's all too human), hardly a safe choice for a Hollywood leading man. The late Richard Crenna completes the trio of excellent performances in FIRST BLOOD, as Rambo's former commanding officer, Colonel Trautman, who comes across as part good guy, part bad guy. As a patriot and a military leader, Trautman understands the necessity of creating killers like Rambo, and he also knows the manipulation and stripping of personalities involved in moulding such men. Directed with spendid economy by Ted Kotcheff, and boasting a first-class score by Jerry Goldsmith, FIRST BLOOD has aged very well (by contrast, the intelligence-insulting RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II and RAMBO III now seem embarrassingly dated relics of the 80s). Forget the dumb pop culture icon Rambo became, and check out this, his first outing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie may have the reputation of being a "no-brainer" action flick but it definately has something very important to say.This film isnt about big guns and explosions, its about the horrible affects that war can have on men and a country itself.The unfair treatment that John Rambo gets from a small town police department only sets off the mental torment that is brooding inside this man's head.Rambo suffers from Nam flashbacks and war-shock, he is a man that is in desperate need of a friend and a little gratitude from his country.All of the main actors in this film do a terrific job and im especially talking about Stallone and Crenna, you can tell that Stallone put his all into this performance, just watch the finale of the film because Stallone is able to portray his emotion in a very convincing way.This in my opinion is the best Stallone film and should be watched by everyone that is seriously interested in action or drama.Check it out for yourself.</fullReview>

Brian Dennehy is equally good as Sheriff Teasle, the man who pushes Rambo over the edge. The action scenes are good, but not as good as in the other two.

		<fullReview>This was the best film I have ever been lucky enough to see. Sylvester Stallone has got to be the worst actor ever to come out of Hollywood, which makes for some pretty hilarious monologues including a brilliant final speech which is about 10% understandable. My favorite bit is where he throws that rock that breaks the helicopter windshield and it somehow manages to cause the helicopter pilot to go mental, he then twitches the stick throwing the chief of police 100ft to his death. Great considering that in the scene before it was only hovering 30ft off the ground. I love how the situation quickly and completely unbelievably escalates from an arrest for vagrancy to a full scale war where average police officers carry fully automatic weapons such as m16's, ak47's. I 100% recommend this film to anyone who likes a good laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lazy drifter stumbles into a small town and refuses to comply when a kind-hearted sheriff asks him to leave.Despite the excellent skill and training of the police department, Rambo (Schmuck Stallone) soon goes on a rampage and destroys the city including transformers so all the residents in the area have to live without heat or electricity in December. Rambo will surrender, but not before he gives a five-minute rambling incoherent dissertation about all the "flench glies" (friends) he lost in the war and how he can't hold a job for "gate gowers" (eight hours).Colonel Trautman delivers this maniac to the cops with Trautman's coat draped over Rambo's shoulders so he's nice and warm and his hands cuffed in front of him so he's not too uncomfortable when Rambo really ought to be hog-tied and have his shoes taken away from him.It's a long road, but someday the nice citizens of this once-quiet town will get their lives back on track now that Rambo has been put away.... until the sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overblown entertainment almost at it's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Titled 'First Blood', but more commonly known as 'Rambo', this film tells the story of ex-Vietnam Greet Beret, John Rambo who starts his own personal war with a local sheriff after being picked up for vagrancy. The Rambo series has a reputation for being big, bold and stupid; and there is a good reason for this, as that's exactly what it is. However, as no film fan worth their salt will go into this film expecting a deep and philosophical masterpiece; the fact that it's entertaining is more than enough to stop it being a bad film. First Blood features more explosions, gun fights, fist fights and just general adrenaline pumping carnage than you could wish for, and it manages to keep up the high tempo that it creates towards the start for the duration. The film is rarely boring as the action keeps it ticking over, but it does start to get a bit samey after you've seen Stallone hammer another bunch of people with his M4 for the eight hundredth time.The action in First Blood is pure comic book stuff, and it does manage to go ridiculously over the top on several occasions, but it's all in the spirit of entertainment, and is, therefore, forgivable. Sylvestor Stallone is an actor that I'm not a fan of; the way he speaks and his general demeanour is annoying, but he definitely knows his way around an action film. And let's face it; that's all he's good for at the end of the day (yes, I've seen Cop Land). The script is something in First Blood that could do with some work; it's not bad on the whole, especially when compared with some of Stallone's other work (e.g. Cobra), but it spends too much time focusing on Rambo's mentor telling the police that Rambo will kill them all blah blah, and it becomes dull and silly all too quickly. The way that it 'brings the Vietnam war' home is a good idea, and I like that aspect of the film...although it was done to much better effect five years later with the Schwarzenegger masterpiece; Predator.To sum up, First Blood is very good entertainment. There's plenty to keep action fans thrilled, and some of the ideas such as the commentary on the Vietnam war are good, but it's let down by a script that gets silly and too much of the same stuff. Recommended viewing if you want something to entertain you and aren't too bothered about depth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ted Kotcheff's film tries to make serious comment on how the Vietnam war affected many of its soldiers. "First Blood" gives us 'John Rambo'(Stallone), a man pushed too far by the local law enforcers at a small U.S. town. Angry, he declares a 'war of his own' against them.The action is not bad, but this was probably the wrong vehicle for Kotcheff to bring his message across with. Perhaps Stallone's 'Rambo' is the wrong sort of hero. He is good in the action sequences, however he is a little too unbelievable and unstoppable to be taken seriously.The attempt at an emotional ending to the film also fails, mainly due to the fact that we can barely make out what Stallone is saying.

		<fullReview>"First Blood" is one of the most entertaining films of its kind, a straightforward, tough, extremely fast paced thriller with a real poignancy to it, a poignancy that was mostly absent in the over-the-top comic book sequels. It's not a very faithful adaptation of the David Morrell novel, instead portraying its haunted lead character John Rambo (played here by Sylvester Stallone) in a far more sympathetic light. And you do feel bad for John Rambo: like so many Vietnam veterans, he's had a hard time readjusting to civilian life, encountering hostility from far too many Americans. One such man is hard headed, close minded small town sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy), who takes one look at Rambo and decides he doesn't like him. Rambo escapes his clutches and leads Teasle and many law enforcement types on an intense chase through the forests of the Pacific Northwest. Soon Rambo's former superior Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna) arrives on the scene to try to talk some sense into his crazed soldier, who's hellbent on finishing the private war that Rambo insists the cops started by pushing him too hard.While watching this, you do realize that Stallone does get under-rated as an actor, and you do really come to understand his character and resent the authority figures who mistreated him. Crenna is equally solid as the Army man who takes a certain pride in his "creation". Dennehy's role could easily have come across as a one-dimensional villain, but he's a great enough actor to give the man some dimension. Other familiar and reliable actors in the cast include Bill McKinney, Jack Starrett, Michael Talbott, Chris Mulkey, and David Caruso. Excellent location shooting, slick cinematography by Andrew Laszlo, and a memorable, rousing music score by Jerry Goldsmith are heavy assets. Granted, this movie isn't always exactly 100% believable, but it's still on a more even keel than the sequels; it's played straight and is compelling from start to finish. The stalking / pursuit scenes are actually quite suspenseful.In this viewer's humble opinion, "First Blood" can rightfully take its place as one of the most enjoyable films to deal at all with the effects of the Vietnam War on the people of its time. It may not necessarily be a "great" film, but it's exciting as hell, leading to a big emotional finish. The final speech may not be the most coherent, but it's certainly heartfelt.The following year, Canadian director Ted Kotcheff (another under-rated talent who's had a diverse career) made another Vietnam war related action picture: "Uncommon Valor".Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't read the novel(I understand that changes were made), although I'm certainly considering it now. This should not be compared to its sequels or the overall memory or impression that people have of Rambo. This does have violence and explosions, but it isn't a simple, straightforward Hollywood flick. While there is action, and it's rather nicely done I might add, it isn't gratuitous, nor is the blood and the like. The plot is well-written and develops well. The pacing is magnificent. The editing and cinematography in this are very good, there is one sequence in particular which is highly effective, and nothing you'd find in a run-of-the-mill movie of this genre. The suspense is marvelous. The acting is great, the leads all give solid performances. Sly is spot-on in the role. The dialog certainly has well-written and quotable lines, if the one-liner or two seemed out of place, and it's never poor. There is language in this, plenty, and harsh, albeit it could be argued that it's justified and fits the characters. The DVD features a teaser and a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to any fans of those involved in making it, not the least of whom being Stallone, and possibly of the book. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Friday the 13th : The Lost Sequel !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Violent movie, that's it and please nothing more ! People are talking about how classic this masterpiece, and what an elegy it is ???, they are missing the point and playing the trite awful game of overrating ! I don't know who was the first one said "what a movie about Vietnam war's American victims" to have all of these strange ones iterate it blindly like annoying parrots ! It's much simpler, it's the Action movie yet more intensive and masterly pure, and it's the commercial exploitation of important case which had been expressed surely in better ways.Look closer : it was nearly 3 hours film, based upon a best seller, with a lot to say about the character of the returnee soldier, his affliction, the tragedy of treating him unjustly again, and naturally the destructive flare-up. The inward symbolism was somehow creative, even names like director (Mike Nichols) and actor (Dustin Hoffman) were attached to THAT project. Then they did it with (Stallone) !!, and further than that after (Stallone) saw the first cut, he hated it so much that he tried to buy the film back and destroy it (now that's a movie star to respect !). When he couldn't do that, he suggested that the producers cut much of his part, and eventually that cut the movie time in half ! Truly it's a precedent, once to condense it into just massive action to be a typical example for the crazy sheer action movie of the next era (so that's the classic part, yet with minor elegy !), and once more to confess rarely (Stallone)'s bad performance !!Speaking of which, when (Rambo) at the end was talking about the death of his friend and what precisely happened to his body, that WAS : the worst moment of this movie, the worst moment in (Stallone)'s career, and maybe the worst moment in the history of acting ! The thing that puzzles me the most is how the Razzie didn't take care of this one appropriately ! It even wasn't at the 1990's infamous honoring for (Stallone) as the Worst Actor of the Decade where at least (Rambo: First Blood Part II - 1985) and (Rambo III - 1988) were mentioned !! Maybe (John Rambo) discharged a lot of suppressed anger inside a lot of Americans to retaliate the authority / the sheriff and to see them the monster they made, the hell they deserve, but that had lost amongst big and loud action that seemed absurd for most of the time. Therefore it's the explosion more than the exploration !This movie presented cinematically the dawn of the one-man-army and the case of it as the unstoppable killing machine whose killing the enemies along with the drama, the psychical analysis, seriousness ..etc. Actually a lot of its upcoming likes will do the same. I think (Rambo II) even portrayed Rambo's unbelief of political authority way better but as a straight action with nothing to allege. So, generally, this is the lost sequel of Friday the 13th where the wounded comes back to town, revenges on the ones whom gave him his original pain (or whoever represent them), successive fierce murders happen, however.. The real horror here is the horror of BAD acting !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Relevant TODAY than in 1982</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, the movie just finished up about 60 seconds ago, and i decided to comment on it. This is the second time I have seen this movie. The first Rambo movie that I saw was "RAMBO II".There are two ways to see this movie. The first is to not take the premise seriously, to see it as a mindlessly violent movie, and to miss the point. I suspect that people rating the movie below 7 see it this way. This was not the intent of the first movie, although RAMBO II and RAMBO III were certainly mindlessly violent movies.This movie is about rejection, loneliness, and post-traumatic shock syndrome suffered by Veterans, all Verans. The movie is particularly relevant today, as we fight a needless war about NOTHING AT ALL in IRAQ. We will have many citizens coming home with the mindset of Rambo, and many of them will be shunned for "Losing this War" which was never win-able.Rambo plays an outsider, visiting a town to see an old friend who is no longer there. In many ways, this movie is like a Western, where an unwanted stranger comes to visit an insular town. The Police Chief is the protagonist, and takes an instant dislike to Rambo, for no apparent reason. He participates in physical and psychological abuse, takes Rambo into custody, allows his lesser offices to "Beat Up" upon Rambo. Of course, Stallone escapes, and like a one-man tank he single-handedly DESTROYS the town, and is finally cornered. While cornered by the Police, he is talked down by his CO, who returns from Fort Bragg to help stabilize the situation.I cannot believe we involved in another war like this - two in my lifetime is simply TOO MUCH.9 STARS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping and mostly realistic, this is Stallone's best since Rocky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the early 1980's, Stallone wanted to break the mould of being Rocky by promoting variety in his roles. But he is forced to repeat the Rocky franchise because the other films either fared decently or were flops altogether. As a result, after filming Rocky III (which would be released in Summer 1982), he finally got his chance with a movie called Frist Blood (also known as Rambo: First Blood in a lot of countries).First Blood is an extremely dark and grisly story in which Stallone plays a former Green Beret in his mid '30s haunted by memories of the war in Vietnam. He attempts to reunite with a fellow veteran, who is revealed to have died from Orange exposure a few months earlier. So, he strolls about here and there to find some peace, but instead ends up at the hands of a bored Sheriff from a quiet town who's looking for a fight. After enduring beatings and mistreatment from guards (much of this was unintentional), Rambo escapes and has to hide in a forest nearby, where most of the action takes place.Stallone finally showed some talent for the first time since the original Rocky, as he plays and brings this frustrated and marginalised character called Rambo, an ex-Green Beret, to life. The action sequences are very imaginative and powerful, even if they were not intended to entertain. The other two leads, Richard Crenna-- who was Rambo's friend and Boss from the Vietnam war--and Brian Dennehy-- the over-zealous Sheriff--, are dead-on with their roles and give their potential to fit their parts. My favourite scenes are the failed ambush late in the first half, and the cave sequence.Some of the movie's few flaws are that Stallone does not have much to say in most of the film, and many of the supporting characters are flat, and there's hardly any back story to the main characters other than spoken dialogue. The ending, however, in which Rambo tells his boss about one of his most frightening experiences in a Saigon bar, does give the chills and is effective in sending its message without being overtly explicit.The movie became a good BO film, earning over 3 times of its $14 million budget in the US and about $78 million overseas, making it his first big hit outside of the Rocky franchise. This would also inspire to create two comic-book style sequels and eventually another one that is more down-to-earth. Of all the Rambo movies, this one is the one to watch, because of its deeper and more critical storyline, critical because it reflects a strong social connotation: apathy towards the Vietnam veterans IS RIFE. Unlike their grandparents and parents before them, who were widely revered as heroes during the World Wars, the Vietnam veterans are not viewed as heroes but rather "baby killers" and are widely ignored and resented by the media, the government, and even the army itself. In short, despite living similar experiences as those of the previous wars, they become obstracised, and Rambo is pretty much a case in point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Instant Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Possible Spoilers)First Blood is ultimately considered a very violent, pointless movie. However, I found First Bllod to be much more. John Rambo (Slyvester Stallone) is an ex- Green Berie visiting an army buddy. Upon visit he learns the man is dead and heads into town. Not looking for trouble, Rambo remains quiet as he is questioned by Police Chief Will Teasle.Next thing you now Rambo is escaping from prison and running into the woods. Throughout the entire movie we see Rambo's amazing skills of military training from putting stitches in his own arm to traveling through an abandon mine shaft. Even though the movie is considered violent, there really is no killing (except for a police officer accidentally falling out of a helicopter).Although when most people watch First Blood they think of it as a violent pointless movie its message is deep. It shows how the world treated American hero's after Vietnam and how the army was pretty much there whole life. Stallone was an excellent choice as the ex-soldier Rambo and Richard Crenna and Brian Dennehy add solid supporting jobs. The best part of this film is probably Rambo remembering his training and using it against the police force in the forest. First Blood: Slyvester Stallone, Richard Crenna, and Brian Dennehy. 4 out of 5 Stars.</fullReview>

John Rambo is a frazzled vet, who just wants to get by, and is mistreated by local law enforcement so badly that he ends up having to use his skills to fight it out in a familiar habitat.

		<shortDescription>First and best of the Rambo series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First Blood is the first of the Rambo series of films, and it is an OK actioner with enough shooting and chasing to satisy genre addicts. For an hour or so it is actually almost believable, but then things begin to happen which ruin the plausibility.Stallone plays John J. Rambo, an ex Vietnam vet who is hiking around NW America in search of members of his old wartime team. Having just learned that one of his old buddies has died of cancer, his day gets a hell of a lot worse when he is picked up by a rude, bullying sherriff and told he is not welcome in a small town. Rambo gets annoyed by this, so he deliberately provokes the sherriff and gets himself arrested. Some of the cops at the jail give Rambo a beating, until he snaps and wrecks the place, escaping in the process. Soon he is hiding out in the nearby hills and forests and the police fail to find him (in fact, many fall victim to the Vietnam style traps he has set) so the National Guard is drafted in to track him down.During the early scenes, and the police .vs. Rambo manhunt, the action is crisply done and genuinely exciting. Only Rambo's freefall leap from a cliff into tall pine trees rings a little false. The mountainous backdrop is nicely photographed, and adds to the atmosphere. However, the film goes rather wrong once the National Guard start to join the hunt. Richard Crenna turns up, spouting terrible lines about Rambo being capable of eluding 200 men with ease. "200?" he gasps. "You're sending that many? Make sure you've got a good supply of body bags!" Worse still is the hopelessly corny line: "I haven't come to save Rambo from you. I've come to save you from Rambo!" At this point, the film loses its grip on excitement and logic and becomes a plot hole-filled parade of chaos and violence, more comparable to a comic book than reality. To sum up, First Blood is half a good movie and half a bad movie, but (unfortunately) since the bad half is the last half you come away from the film remembering freshly the bit that you would probably be better off forgetting.</fullReview>

His lone action hero preempts Schwarzenegger's "Predator" movies, and Willis' "Die Hard", and set the standard for a new kind of hero in eighties action movies. Stallone remains mute for the most part (just as well, considering his rambling closing monologue) and is just fine as the flawed Vietnam vet on the run from the local cops. The chase is all well and good, and the pace never lets up, but the whole leaves a sense of implausibility and embarrassing incomprehensibility. Much better than any of it's sequels, and much better than it's reputation would have us believe, but still no masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First Blood is undeniably the best of the three Rambo films. In fact it is perhaps one of the best action films ever to come out of Hollywood and basically created a new genre of survival/loner/action films during the 80s.It also signaled another nod towards memories of Vietnam and Hollywood's gradual acceptance that the US didn't do very well over there (this was ultimately highlighted in more dramatic films such as The Deer Hunter, Coming Home &amp; Platoon). Although this film doesn't delve very deep in the Vietnam nightmare (brief flashbacks &amp; bitter memories are all that we get to see) what we do see is the after-product of a Vietnam vet who has "come home" not so much a hero but a vagrant touring small little town after small little town with only the clothes he wears to call his own.Rambo, therefore, is not only disillusioned by the events of the war, coupled with finding out his best friend for that era is dead he now sees an America that really doesn't respect him as a soldier who did his duty for his country.Such bitterness only really culminates in the final few scenes when he lets rip regarding his feelings towards the America that turned its back on him and his friends during his time of need.It is not surprising, therefore, that when the local sheriff arrests him for obstruction and carrying an offensive weapon he fails to appreciate he is in trouble with the law and shows little or no emotion until they force him to take a dry shave (and thats when his flashbacks of him being tortured take hold), and only then does Rambo unleash his anger and sees the police as an enemy just like the Vietcong he fought against in the war.There are many good scenes, stunts and special effects. The action takes a head start over the rather hackneyed script &amp; rather poor acting from all and sundry (especially the rather wooden Richard Crenna as Rambo's commander from Vietnam).Scenes that stay in the mind are the cliff hanger (literally!), the hunting &amp; wounding of some of the Sherrif's deputies in the deep forest and Rambo's dark &amp; dangerous journey into the bowels of an underground cavern.Rambo's erratic speech at the very end is rather unconvincing &amp; hammy, which is a great shame because for once Stallone does a very good job adding a second dimension to his character.The direction &amp; editing are a delight (and to be honest I thought I was watching a John McTiernan movie such was the pace &amp; edge-of-seat excitement. But the actual director, Ted Kortcheff does an exemplary job and should be applauded for his efforts.Overall then, First Blood, is a great great movie. Ok so the dialogue is pretty ropey and some of the acting has more wood than the forests Rambo roams through, but its a great rollercoaster ride of escapism, thrills &amp; spills.Not to be missed.****/******</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First Blood created a new character for Sylvester Stallone after the success Rocky. Canadian director Ted Kotcheff directed First Blood from the novel First Blood by David Morell. Morell wrote the novel in 1972 while the film was shot in 1982. Morell wanted to write a book in which a Vietnam veteran gets involved in similar circumstances than in Vietnam. Stallone plays Vietnam vet John Rambo, who is visiting his old friend only to learn he's passed away some time ago. In the little town, he soon gets into trouble as local sheriff (Brian Dennehy) starts to follow Rambo and wants to get him out of the town and is irritated by this big and silent man. Soon Rambo is arrested by the crimes he never committed and the sadist guards and polices abuse him, before he finally manages to escape the police station, and start the legendary hunt, and thus the structure for this action film has been developed. "Non stop action" as author David Morell said.This is indeed pretty exciting and non-stop after the first 15 or so minutes. There are many chases and pulse pounding moments, which I really felt were genuinely exciting and breath taking. The director of photography in First Blood is Andrew Laszlo, the same photographer who shot Walter Hill's Southern Comfort and its incredible visuals in the swamps the film was set in. The scenes in forest are equally brilliant in First Blood, so this Hungarian cinematographer is really talented. Just watch the gothic scenes in First Blood, when Rambo does his first traps while the police is after him in the forest, soon after the great helicopter attack scene. Very atmospheric and great looking scenery. The film is very professional and brilliant in editing and pace, too, and the helicopter scene at the cliff is really amazing. That was the scene in which Stallone hurt himself while doing his own stunts. The excitement is very high on that helicopter scene with great use of camera. The film is pretty dark in tone and in its colors, but at least the ending is little "brighter" and purifying, even though Rambo dies violently at the end of the novel. The end speech Rambo gives shows the acting abilities of Stallone and I think it must be among his greatest acting moments. It is very gripping to watch this man's suffering and emotions exploding. The brief flashbacks from Vietnam are also very chilling and horrific, and also reminded me of James Glickenhaus' ultra nihilistic action film The Exterminator, which has also similar, albeit far more disturbing flashbacks from the war.I am really pleased with the film's quality considered this is an action film which usually don't have merits this high, at least action films of today's Hollywood. This film created one of the more legendary movie characters and heroes of all time, and author Morell has said that Rambo is equally significant hero character in the field of cinema as James Bond and Tarzan, and that is probably true. There are also two sequels, directer by George Pan Cosmatos and Peter Macdonald, but they are not as high on quality as this original, which can almost be called classic. Rambo gets 8/10 from me and deserved the great DVD release it got from Artisan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"First Blood" is the best Rambo film ever made and Sylvester Stallone is a great actor! Stallone stars as an Green Beret who came back from Vietnam and was trying to find his friend, but found out that he died of cancer. He was getting away from those jack-assed cops to the wilderness and went back to town and blew up buildings and cried in front of his commander (Richard Crenna) at the end. If you haven't seen "First Blood", rent it on video or see it on TV. You'll like it! I like it.10/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stallone's best movie. Tension to the max!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie I was probably about six years old and it was one of my very first action, thriller come suspense movies I had ever seen. First Blood took my little mind by storm. I must have seen it approximately 20 times over the years and I'm still biting my nails when Rambo is being tracked by local cops.Overall this is definately at the top of my charts and I think it should be at the top of Stallone's charts along with 'cliffhanger' which was also gripping. I remember in primary school about third grade playing games and somebody would always say, "I'm Rambo!, I chose him first!". Rambo is definately an icon as a the toughest guy ever in a movie along with Arnie Schwarzenegger.As this was the first and best suspense movie I have seen, I now compare every other type of similar movie to 'First Blood"DON'T THINK ABOUT IT, JUST GRAB YOUR CAR KEYS HEAD TO YOUR LOCAL VIDEO SHOP AND RENT THIS MOVIE OUT... YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie makes a commentary on the plight of vietnam vets. SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FIRST BLOOD was a novel by David Morrel that was a international best seller. Stallone insisted the character needed to be more sympathetic to the audience so the character of Rambo was softened from what it was in the original novel. Also, the novel's end was altered....in the book Rambo dies and in the film he lives. The film was shot in Canada, by canadian director Ted Kotcheff. During the film's shoot several exotic weapons used in the film, were stolen by international arms thieves and the RCMP was called in to investigate, new weapons had to be bought to finish filming. FIRST BLOOD was popular because it hit a nerve with disaffected vietnam vets. The film portrayed the "stereotype" american society had labeled them with following the end of the war. originally, KIRK DOUGLAS was supposed to play TRAUTMAN but he dropped out and RICHARD CRENNA stepped in. The first film in this series spawned two sequels, yet this first film is considered the best. Kotcheff was miffed he was passed over for directing of the sequel in place of George Cosmatos. FIRST BLOOD had a down to earth honesty that the "comic book'" sequel lacked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable early 80's action film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First Blood starts with a Vietnam veteran named John Rambo Co-writer Sylvester Stallone) drifting into a small town called Hope looking for an old friend, Sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) likes a nice quiet town &amp; the scruffy looking loner Rombo doesn't fit his perfect town image. After a face-off Teasle arrest's Rambo &amp; takes him back to the police station where Teasle's deputies also give Rambo a hard time who eventually snaps &amp; goes crazy, Rambo beats up the deputies &amp; breaks out of jail &amp; steals a motorbike &amp; heads for a nearby forest with Sheriff Teasle &amp; his deputies in pursuit. Rambo uses his skills to hide, track &amp; turn the tables on his pursuers, Colonel Sam Trautman (Richard Crenna) attempts to talk Rambo down &amp; give himself up...Directed by Ted Kotcheff &amp; based on the novel by David Morrell (apparently in his commentary track on the Special Edition Morrell states he named Rambo after a brand of apples) I had actually never seen this until last night, I don't really know why since I have seen Rambo III (1988) &amp; Rambo (2008) &amp; enjoyed them both a lot &amp; I have to say I really liked this one too. The script differs from the novel in various ways including changing the ending in which Rambo is killed in the book but lives in the film but never having read the book I cannot compare the two, First Blood is great to just sit down &amp; watch since it has a great pace that keeps going all the way through, it's never too fast in that you can't reflect on what's going on but it never slows down to the point where I was bored. Although definitely an action film the film has things to say, the aftermath of the Vietnam war &amp; the abandonment of those who fought in it along with the effects of the war on those who fought in it &amp; there's a broad swipe at racism as well. The villain of the film isn't as black and white as you may think, is it the Sheriff who just wants to do his job &amp; protect his town or is the villain Rambo who causes untold damage &amp; ultimately breaks the law? The character's are good, Rambo barely says anything &amp; never really interacts with anyone either as it's the other character's (played by better actor's) tell the story &amp; flesh Rambo's character out more than he does. I enjoyed this, it's not full of flashy effects &amp; the body count is surprisingly low with one one on screen death but overall I thought it worked great as both an action film &amp; one with a (albeit slight) message.The action is really good here, this is solid 80's action with nice steady camera shots rather than modern shaky quick fire edited hard to understand set-pieces that give me a headache. There are exploding cars, exploding shops, motorbike chases, fights &amp; shoot-outs plus a car jump in which a stunt man broke his back but carried on &amp; the shot is actually in the film. First Blood was the first Sylvester Stallone film that wasn't Rocky not to bomb at the box-office &amp; arguably launched his career. The film looks great &amp; the forest wilderness is a terrific backdrop for Rambo to turn the tables on the cops, Rambo uses the terrain to his advantage &amp; as an action adventure film setting it works well.With a supposed budget of about $14,000,000 the production ran months over &amp; delayed the filming of Rocky III (1982), the action scenes are great with cool explosions &amp; no modern quick editing at all. Although set in the US this was filmed in British Columbia in Canada. The acting is good from a solid cast &amp; since Stallone doesn't hardly say anything is acting skills or lack of don't get the way too much.First Blood is a terrific early 80's action adventure film, there's a bit of a cop out ending in which no one really wins or loses but that just left the door open for some sequels which duly followed with Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985), Rambo III (1988) &amp; Rambo (2008) while the IMDb lists Rambo V: The Savage Hunt (2011) as currently in production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent drama, total contrast to stupid sequels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rambo's final speech in this movie is, in my opinion, an Oscar worthy performance. I never knew that Stallone can act, I always thought that he can only scream and mumble so I never gave him much credit until I saw this film. And was I surprised! I have never been so attached to character from the beginning to the end in any movie as I was to John Rambo in this one. All of Rambo's friends are dead, people treat him like crap, he has no skills to make a living, he is basically homeless, and the only person that he knows is his former commanding officer who can't really do much to help him. It's about a veteran's wrath in an ungrateful world. I am impressed with how Stallone was able to capture that expression, that dude's a genius. Many people think that this film is an action movie, it's not. It's a very sad drama. The idiotic sequels should have never been made. I strongly recommend seeing this movie first if you have never seen any of the trilogy. The only reason that I even bothered to watch Rambo: First Blood part II and Rambo 3 is because I really cared to see what happens to John J. Rambo. Unfortunately in those films Stallone was not in the same character as he is in this movie and the plots were very ideal for a video game conversion. I highly recommend watching this underrated film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a fine film with a genuine theme. What followed with the sequels was dangerous propaganda. The first Rambo was essentially an anti-war movie. It was based on a novel that had John Rambo shot dead at the end by his ex-commanding officer. Unfortunately the movie was embraced by jingoistic Americans, looking for a story to re-tell what happened in 'Nam. "We really did win the war, but for Washington selling us out .... ". The US had no moral right to be in Vietnam in the first place and nor do its story tellers have the right to misrepresent history to make Americans feel better about the Indo-Chinese war.Novelist David Morrell should hang his head in shame for being involved in the sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typically American</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So what do I mean by Typically American?Smacks of overkill, going to the extreme. The film starts all calm and mellow with Rambo going to visit one of his former Army Buddies only to discover he'd died of cancer from Agent Orange.So the film is getting it's political messages in early. Rambo is prevented entering the town by Sheriff Teasle (does he even legally have the right to deny him entry based on his appearance? So much for Land Of The Free.) and is driven to the other side of town and told to start walking.Teasle sees Rambo walking back into town and starts exceeding his authority right there, asking him for id, grabbing him and then claiming assault (untrue, he grabbed Rambo 1st) and arresting him on 3 trumped up charges.The vagrancy charge is so trumped up its unreal, the assault charge is a pure fairy tale as it never happened. And the only charge that might have stood was the concealed weapon which he'd have never found if he hadn't searched him.Rambo is treated awfully in custody, assaulted twice by the officers processing him (including a VERY young looking David Caruso who would go on to find fame as Horatio Cane in CSI:Miami), little wonder he reacts the way he did.His escape from jail is not unwarranted but the police were already trying to shoot at him even then (for what offence, exactly?). His fighting with the police in the station can be explained by the treatment he received (both the assaults and the fire hosing) and would not be counted too heavily against him.His 1st actual crime is theft (of the motorcycle) and then he goes to ground in the forest. He is shot at by Galt (who is acting against orders and is solely responsible for his own death) and the helicopter pilot would have been able to clear him of ANY involvement in Galt's so called murder.Even during the 2nd encounter in the forest, Rambo does not actually kill anyone at all. When he quite easily could have killed all of them. The only man shot was hit by Teasle by accident.Even when the National Guard shoot at him, he never kills anyone.I am unsure exactly why the rats attack Rambo in the mine (he is no threat) but I assume it is to make the viewer think everything is against Rambo and nothing is for him.The final conflict in the town is pretty contrived, even after all the pushing Rambo still does not kill Teasle. He merely injures him.Trautman finally talks Rambo down after his breakdown when he realises he is the last of his squad alive and is alone in the world.The ending of this could have been much better explained what was going to happen to Rambo and would have better set up the sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure why, I mean, bad acting, senseless violence, not much of a plot, but I loved this film. I have been interested in seeing the big macho films of Stallone and Schwartzenegger for a while. I'm just your average girl who loves the action flicks a little better than the chick flicks. In the 80's an extreme amount of action flicks came out: Die Hard, The Terminator, First Blood, Commando, Aliens, Batman, etc. I'm not sure why, maybe the 80's were just that boring. ;-P Just kidding to those who grew up during the 80's.In essence, First Blood is a movie that replays the Vietnam War with Stallone's humorless, absurdly indestructible killing machine, JOHN RAMBO. Yes, the Rambo! Well, we start off with evil cops who just hassle Rambo, I mean after all, we do need him to go off in some way. Rambo is haunted by some very disturbing memories from Vietnam. He escapes from prison where he is very much abused and runs to the mountains. He goes on a crazy spree of not really killing, more like scarring all the cops who did him wrong. Thanks to them, now they've got a loose and crazy killing machine who can kick some 20 men butt.I loved the ending, because they actually touched on real human emotions. I'm not saying this because I just love drama movies, but it made this one just more than an action movie. It was real and showed that even Rambo can cry. For an action flick, everyone, this is it. I'd also recommend Die Hard or The Terminator. 80's, what a decade, huh?8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Silly...But Machismo Flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the silliest films ever made. The direction is trite, as is the script and the plot. The performance of Stallone as John Rambo is one of the worst characterizations ever presented on the screen. He may have represented something for the 1980's, but I can't for the life of me figure out what the hell that was. Crenna is horribly miscast as the Colonel who made Rambo. Crenna is so awful that he has to actually force himself to overact to keep up with Stallone's meager performance. The last scene, where Stallone delivers the most poorly annunciated monologue in the history of cinema, is a fine example of poor improvisation. Brian Dennehey, however, is quite good as the sheriff on the hunt for Rambo. He's a fine character actor and these are the kinds of roles he shines brightest in. Director Ted Kotcheff squeaks his way through this film, although I assume that tough guy Sly had the say over the editing and pretty much the entire film. Although silly, this is a machismo flick!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't lie, "First Blood" is no "Deer Hunter." It doesn't successfully evaluate the post-Vietnam after-effects on the human psyche. But it isn't the human bloodbath people think it is, either. If you want to know a scary statistic, John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) kills one, maybe two people in this film - tops. There's no massacre, and in fact he doesn't let loose until the very end.The curious thing about "First Blood" (which, by the way, you will notice is not called "Rambo") is that Rambo himself is not really the main character. He's an anti-hero in some ways, and in others less so.First of all, he rarely speaks. Second of all, he garners little screen time after the first fifteen minutes; the middle of the film is devoted solely to the police force trying to chase him down.It's not until the very end that Rambo loses his nut and goes on a rampage, and even then all he does is shoot up stores and he certainly doesn't attack any surprise-attack Viet Cong intruders.In fact this is a very low-key Vietnam-themed survival thriller (yes, thriller) and the only reason people think of Rambo in general as this macho killing-machine action icon is the following sequel, "Rambo: First Blood Part II," which is responsible for every Rambo cliché known to man.You might very well be surprised by how different this film actually is from its sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a great film but reasonably effective as both an action movie and a message movie without being great as either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John J. Rambo is a Vietnam veteran who is hitchhiking around parts of the US trying to catch up with friends from the war. However when he reaches one small town, the sheriff tries to force him on his way before he has finished his visit. When Rambo comes back into the town, Sheriff Teasle arrests him for vagrancy and lets his men rough him up some. The rough treatment sets off flashbacks in Rambo's mind and he goes on the run from the law. The local police pursue him and try to hunt him down with dogs ? however Rambo slips further back in his mind and turns the tables in the middle of the woods.I have never watched any of the Rambo movies and have only seen a few moments of part 3 that I didn't get into at all but I have taken the chance offered by BBC3 to watch all of them over a few weeks. I was unsure of the basic plot of this film but I was aware from what other's told me that the novel it was based on had a lot to say about Vietnam and America's view of those that came back scarred by it. If that is the case then this film doesn't manage to quite do the same ? it tries and there is some message there, but it is very much secondary to the action and is more of a hook to hang the action on rather than it being a thread that runs through the whole film and lifts it to be something more than an action movie. The action is a bit exaggerated and unlikely (and takes away from the message by having this veteran being a near indestructible machine of a man). It is well delivered though and is exciting as long as you try not to think too much about where it is happening and how the plot develops.The direction is good and uses both the forests and the town's high street to good effect ? maintaining tension even as the actions of Rambo start to get too extreme for the script to really support. The cast is not great but contains an impressive number of famous faces. Stallone is a good physical presence and he does well enough in what is a pretty monosyllabic role ? he looks tortured and harrowed and that's what was needed; only at the end does he make an emotional impact in the film. Dennehy is a sympathetic bad guy (a problem the script creates) even if he tries hard not to be. Crenna is a good presence and he delivers the message in a clear (if heavy-handed) manner. Other faces include McKinney, Mulkey and an early role for David Caruso (giving the same performance as he is decades later!).Overall this is a rather split film ? it wants to be an exciting action movie but it also wants to be a message film about America's attitude to Vietnam veterans. It manages to do quite well at both without excelling at either. The action is enjoyable but gets too big and silly (almost Commando style exaggeration) while the message is very much window dressing until it is bluntly put forward in the final scene. It is an effective film and more than just a dumb action movie but it could have been better with more of a balance and a decision about what it wanted to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Blood - mindless action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not having seen any Rambo films before, but aware that it is one of the two series that made Stallone's name, I came to this film expecting top rate action if not much to think about. The action was actually less exciting than I had hoped; I was right about the lack of thought-provoking dialogue and plot. I knew that it had something to do with war but was expecting a war setting, so the idea it was a Vietnam vet on the loose in America, up against the local police force, gave little reason to like Rambo compared to if he were fighting a just cause abroad. He was psychologically damaged yes, and you feel for him, but he's still not really a likable character. Some scenes are exciting, especially early on, in the early part in the forest, but the film feels more meandering as it goes on. The police chief was equally unlikeable, and very two dimensional, always sure he can bring down Rambo despite the mounting entrance to the contrary. The best character was Rambo's leader in Nam, the only one of the three who talks sense. I'm not a fan of mindless violence but some recent action films I've seen such as Apocalypto engage the mind as well as on multiple other levels, which didn't happen here. I pitied Rambo but just couldn't really muster the will to get wholly in his corner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After he is wrongfully arrested and physically abused by the prejudiced police of a hick town, disillusioned Vietnam Veteran John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) escapes to the surrounding mountainous countryside where he wages a one-man war against the Sheriff (Brian Dennehy) and his men employing all of the survival skills he acquired as a Green Beret.In Rambo: First Blood Part II, the jingoistic, ultra-violent sequel to First Blood, Sly Stallone's John Rambo?a musclebound, comic-book warrior toting a rocket launcher who singlehandedly hands the commies their collective ass?became a larger-than-life symbol of US military strength, an instant hit with American audiences, not least with then President Ronald Reagan. So iconic is this image of Rambo that it is easy to forget that he was once a broken man, struggling to adjust to civilian life in a country still coming to terms with defeat in Vietnam.This more human portrayal of the character is what helps makes First Blood far superior to any of its sequels, Stallone bringing to the screen a believable hero for whom the viewer can not only cheer but also empathise. This excellent central performance, coupled with superb, no-fuss direction from Ted Kotcheff, makes for one of the most satisfying action flicks of the 80s?an adrenaline-pumping 93 minutes of gritty guerrilla warfare, old-school stunt action, and brutal 80s-style payback.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you can get through the ever-increasing silliness of the plot, the slanderous insults against the National Guard, the cartoon caricaturing of law enforcement. and possibly the worst performance Richard Crenna ever gave, you'll probably enjoy Ted Kotcheff's First Blood, the oldest and only above-room-temperature-IQ edition of the Rambo series.Kotcheff gives us a taut, fast guerrilla warfare-movie with a decorated Vietnam veteran (Sly Stallone) first harassed by big, burping Sheriff Brian Dennehy, then pursued by him and about a thousand brain-dead cops and weekend warriors until Stallone blows up much of Hope, Washington (actually, British Columbia). All the while, Crenna chews copious amounts of Pacific Northwest scenery, telling Dennehy that he's gonna need a lot of body-bags, and getting to give John Rambo a manly hug when our catatonic hero finally breaks down and starts emoting in the gutted wreckage of the local cop shop.It isn't all bad, though. First Blood actually pays decent lip service to such now-common themes of Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome and Agent Orange. Yet, the good stuff is almost obliterated by about $200 worth of dime store psychology.By the end, you'll feel as if you just got your action-movie money's worth from the video store, even though your brain will have been sorely taxed by any of the numerous plot holes, each big enough to drive an Army 2 1/2 ton truck through (and don't forget the hideous end title song warbled by Dan Hill).My suggestion is to turn off the sound as soon as Sly stops blubbering. Of course, you can always leave the sound off altogether and treat First Blood to a homegrown Mystery Science Theatre 3000 treatment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"First Blood" has all the grounds to be called the standard for the whole action genre. It is tough, bloody, realistic (even with the jump from the cliff it looks like a documentary!), and very dramatic. John Rambo cries in one of the scenes but it's no weeping. These are tears of a tough man who has been on the verge of a breakdown (on the verge of killing everybody on sight before being terminated by the army).We finally have a special DVD edition of "First Blood" in our country. It has some deleted scenes included as a bonus. It is sad that the suicide ending had been put off. What a mistake! A possible ending can be like this: Rambo dies, his colonel's face is shown in a close-up, the camera comes closer to his eyes; then goes the scene showing him and Rambo leaving the place (like in the final cut), but it all ends with the colonel leaving alone. The credits start to roll over. The End. Here we would have the following interpretation: Samuel Trautman only imagines that they are leaving the place together, though John Rambo is already dead lying in a pool of blood. It is very annoying, if it is true that the public opinion had wanted to digest a "happy-end" version and the director had surrendered. John Rambo must die and there must not be stupid "Rambo II" and "Rambo III" which added some cartoonish smell to the original movie. So, while personally watching the film, when reaching the final episode, there is a burning wish to jump to the death scene (taken from the DVD bonus). He dies - the movie ends. "First Blood" is an example of clever action without doubt. And please mind: there are no stupid love/hug/sex scenes in the movie (though, there is a deleted sex scene as a bonus on the DVD ? and it is not stupid, it is tragic). Every piece of violence is in its right place and the epic music is amazing.Even for this version where Rambo lives in the end, it is a solid 10 out of 10. Thanks for attention.</fullReview>

The shaving scene is so funny. Sylvester Stallone, Richard Crenna, and Brian Dennehy are fantastic in this film.

		<shortDescription>Nothing like Rambo II and III!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great movie, no matter what your taste is! (Possibly the ending is a little sorry compared to the beginning of the movie.) Don't compare this movie with Rambo II and III. This is about psychology and pure survival instincts, while the two follow-ups are nothing but fictional action entertainment. There's also basically no killings in this movie, contrary to most peoples beliefs. Take notice how the whole situation of 200 army men chasing Rambo through the mountains arises because the local sheriff wouldn't let him have a meal in his town! Sylvester Stallone adds 'presence' to the movie and I don't think anyone else would have been able to make this movie what it is. Of course, the local sherif, is a great counterpart and certainly gives the film more flavour. Enjoy and hate him!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First Blood (1982) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Vietnam vet John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) arrives in a small town where the Sheriff (Brian Dennehy) begins messing with him. Soon other cops are abusing him, which forces the vet to break free from the jail and head off into the mountain territory where a war follows. It's somewhat hard to remember because of the sequels and pop cultures jokes but this first film was a serious movie that tried to deliver a serious message about vets returning home with mental issues and fears. This here is certainly the best in the series, although the fourth one works better as pure, wacky camp. What I love most about this are the scenes in the woods where we get to see this expert work his training in order to wipe out an entire army of cops. The cops are perfectly set up as villains so we have no trouble cheering for Rambo to take them out and the mountain settings really give the character a lot to work with in terms of fighting back. Another benefit is that Stallone is just so darn good in the role of Rambo. We really get two types of performances here with the first one being the silent guy who is simply doing what needs to be done to survive. Stallone doesn't get too much dialogue during the action scenes in the woods but he doesn't need any because his body and face perfectly show off what a warrior like this could be like. The second act comes at the end when Rambo finally has his breakdown and I'm sure a good debate could be had but I think Stallone handles this scene quite well even though I think it's too heavily handled. Dennehy is excellent as the cop and comes across as a guy you really love to hate. Richard Crenna is also good in his small role as the Colonel. The blow up scenes at the end of the movie really go against everything we've seen before it and I think it would have been better to end the movie in the woods but that's a minor complaint as for the most part this film delivers a great hero, great villains and a very good entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the Rambo films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Morrell's novel, First Blood, told a rather harrowing story of a veteran forgotten by the country he fought for. After an attempt to catch up with an old squadmate ends in tears, he wanders into a nowhere town with a rather bigoted sheriff who arrests him for vagrancy. As he is dragged down to the cells and given a cleaning up for a court date, he begins having flashbacks to his time in a Vietnamese prison camp, which eventually spill over into a violent rage that these policemen cannot stop. In this respect, the novel and film are pretty much the same, but the film takes a number of divergences from the novel that do not do it any favours.In the novel, a bit more background is given to the Sheriff, explaining that he is a veteran of the Korean war, for one thing. The film pretty much reduces the policemen in this story to a bunch of clownish buffoons who couldn't catch the flu. One pivotal moment in the film is when Arthur Galt, the sergeant who attempts to get Rambo's name earlier in the film, falls from a helicopter. Before he does so, he attempts to put a bullet into Rambo, in spite of repeated orders not to from the Sheriff that is supposedly one of his best friends. I somehow doubt that this film won Sylvester Stallone, or any of the writers, friends among the police force. Even Rambo himself is never given more than one dimension. It is also interesting to note that Rambo is often absent from the screen when much of the exposition is delivered, lending some credence to the story that Stallone suggested his screen time be cut down and the story told by other characters.Another area where the film diverges from the novel is in the ending. The novel's ending had Rambo shot down by a policeman at the final fight from within the police station. A darker ending was filmed for this film adaptation, in which Rambo eventually kills himself. Apparently, this ending was deemed to be too dark, with the ending as we know it edited into its place. Of all the divergences from the source material, this is probably the most regrettable. Although Morrell would write two more Rambo novels, both appear to be based on screenplays that Sylvester Stallone had a hand in. If they had not altered the ending, we might have been spared two of the most downright embarrassing sequels in the history of film. Or at least, they would have had to turn the clock back a bit and made them into prequels, which might have made for a more interesting story, given the historical contexts in which the Rambo character has fought.Richard Crenna puts in a great performance as the serious dramatic part of the film. Every bit of acting credibility that the film has, which is not saying much, comes from this man. Interestingly, other actors who were considered for this film include Clint Eastwood, who probably would have made the film a little more credible. His asking price might have been more than the production team could afford, however. John Travolta was also considered for the part of Rambo, and while this is one of many roles that John rejected that catapulted another actor to stardom, I doubt that Travolta would have any regrets about this one. For although Stallone had a truly commendable career during the 1980s, setting a record for the highest actor's salary in 1988 with Rambo III, he has pretty much disappeared from the front page in the past ten years. Unless you consider his record thirty nominations and ten wins for Razzies in various categories to be particularly newsworthy. Then again, given some of the things I have heard about those who have turned up to accept their Razzies in person, I doubt that Stallone has done the same. But then, he is also in a pretty exclusive group of actors who have directed themselves in Razzie-worthy performances.When all is said and done, I gave First Blood a seven out of ten. It is not a great film. It is not even so stupid that it is brilliant. But as an action film with a low bodycount and a statement to make, it works. It is certainly more entertaining than the sensibilities of those looking back on it without the proper historical perspective would have you believe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True models of law enforcement.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First Blood is the unexpectedly simplistic story of a mentally unstable Vietnam veteran who returns to America and is shunned by the people who's freedom he was fighting for, as was so famously the case with so many soldiers returning from that war, regardless of how much or how little they believed in the war itself. I have to say here that the story is simplistic because it really boils down to John Rambo fighting a One Man War for his very life but really for no reason. His plans to visit an old Vietnam friend are crushed when he learns that that friend died of cancer that he developed from Agent Orange in Vietnam, and so he immediately becomes a drifter. Evidently he had no other plans and came from nowhere, and therefore has nowhere to go. I won't go into whether or not the book went into more detail about where Rambo came from or why he has no destination whatsoever beyond visiting his friend, because I haven't read it.I have, however, seen the movie, and at this point in the trilogy, I find it rather surprising that Rambo has become something of a cultural icon because of this film and the two sequels. In First Blood, as he wanders aimlessly down the highway, he stumbles into a small town and right into the town sheriff, who politely escorts him to the town limits, saying that drifters only cause trouble but he's more than welcome to grab a bite to eat 30 miles down the road. After being dropped off, Rambo promptly walks back toward town, is promptly noticed and arrested, and ultimately ends up in an all-out battle with what has to be the most incompetent police force on earth, then with the most incompetent state police force on earth, and finally the most incompetent national guard on earth.First the town police can't even get Rambo to put his fingerprints on the paper, then he manages to punch his way completely out of the police station while unarmed, then the state police starts a massive manhunt, apparently unable to find Rambo, who is conspicuously hiding out in his enormous log cabin in the woods, in which he builds a nice fire and takes a nap, and then the national guard is afraid to pursue him in a mine shaft, so they fire a grenade into it instead, but only after the senior officer importantly says, 'Wait, lemme get outta the way first?' Just so you know, the type of elite military forces that would be sent on such a mission are just that. Elite forces. And by that, of course, I mean these guys don't mess round. They don't respond to orders with 'No way, I ain't going' in there!' The commanding officer of such a company would never, while under fire, call out, 'Who's got the rocket launcher?' Nor would he say 'Give that man a cee-gar!' 'Bullseye!' or, heaven forbid, 'Come on you guys, shoot!' Rambo's rampage is somewhat justified by the mental scars that he suffered from his training and work in the Vietnam War, although that topic only comes up right at the beginning of the film and then in the closing scene, when he suddenly starts ranting and raving about how bad the Vietnam veterans have it back in America, spouting more dialogue all at once than he had in the entire film up to that point. If he had been able to explain any of this to the idiot police officers in the beginning of the film, he could have saved himself a lot of trouble. Sure, we wouldn't have had a movie that way, but he wouldn't have had to throw himself off the side of a sheer cliff and into a tree to avoid getting shot, either. Not a bad trade-off, I should think.The reason it seems curious to me that this movie has inspired two sequels and a cult following is that, while it's true the movies are certainly fun to watch, the logic is nonexistent, even for a cheesy action movie. Rambo allows himself to be taken into custody by men that he could snap like twigs, then doesn't react to anything, including such benign queries as 'Name?' until he has a razor to his throat. By the way, this is the nicest criminal justice system I've ever heard of. Not only do they assign you a court date the very morning after your arrest, they even assign half of the police force to be on hand while they give you a shave so you'll be presentable in court. Even worse, the whole movie is based on irreversible combat training that Rambo is acting on, in massive self-defense, which is what causes him to enter into a one-man war against the town police force, the state police, and the national guard. Sure, soldiers come back with post-traumatic stress syndrome as well as the remnants of dangerous training that can lead to harsh reactions to small provocations and sleepless nights, because these people have been so heavily trained for combat that some of that remains after the war. What the movie catastrophically forgets is that, along with combat training, soldiers also come out of the military with intense respect for authority figures, especially those in uniform. Not Rambo. Not only does he treat the police as well as the national guard like the subjects of a hunt, he doesn't even respect the very guy that trained him. Somewhere along the way, it seems, Rambo snapped and lost all control of his abilities, becoming a dangerous weapon, a lethal weapon, if you will, who does, in fact, need to be stopped. Unfortunately, the guys who should be the good guys are such morons that it is impossible to root for them, even if they weren't led by the sheriff, who is the only really bad guy in the movie. First Blood is fairly clever as a manhunt film, but as an informational movie about what it's like for Vietnam veterans it's pretty outlandish. Sure, there are tons of problems surrounding that war and the soldiers did return and get pretty bad treatment, but Rambo is such a two-dimensional character that it's almost a shame to see him representing them. He came from nowhere and goes nowhere at the end, all we see is him going nuts. I hope the movie hasn't actually contributed to the problems that Vietnam veterans have had to face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rambo: First Blood, is a faithful remake of The Courage of Lassie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A useful corrective to the cinematic stereotype of the traumatised war veteran. Rambo: First Blood, is a straight down the line remake of the 1946 classic The Courage of Lassie. Sylvester Stallone takes over the role of Lassie, traumatised by war service in the Pacific, who returns home and seeks refuge in the mountainous north-western US only to fall foul of a cruel local policeman. Lassie uses all her combat skills to evade the pursuing cops, but it takes the intervention of the soldier who trained her to save her from unjust punishment at the hands of the bad sheriff. The key difference between Rambo: First Blood and The Courage of Lassie, is the hero's not a dog (um?); the war he returns from is Vietnam, not World War II; Elizabeth Taylor. Courage of Lassie's writer Lionel Houser truly deserves a Screenwriters Guild 'original story by' credit for this epic. Not that he'd probably want it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first of the Rambo series is also the best - First Blood is a good action and survival film, but it has notable faults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First Blood is a good, albeit largely forgotten, action and survival film. Nowadays, when people think of Rambo at all, a M60-toting teeth-baring, Commie killing tank comes to mind. This only comes to pass in the last two Rambo films, which were either mediocre (Rambo II) or poor (Rambo III). First Blood, however, surprised me greatly. I expected this film to kick off the modern Rambo legacy which lives on in the minds of many teenagers' today. Instead, I got a film which was more about survival than about pure action. A lot of the time, we see Rambo prowl through the jungle in a game of cat-and-mouse, being stalking and stalked by a few unwitting cops. We observe Rambo's incredible resourcefulness, as he uses all things available to him to create ingenious booby traps for his enemies while subsisting on things that "would make a billy goat puke". (He even uses a paper sack as a shirt!)Anyway, now on to why John Rambo is prowling through the jungle. He does not prowl through there because he wants to - no my friend, the 'system' is out to get him. (Where have I heard this excuse before?) You see, Rambo is a war hero of the highest order. After walking into a small town, the local sheriff, who seems to have X-ray vision, kicks Rambo out again. After walking back, Rambo is arrested for vagrancy. This is a ridiculous plot hole, as you cannot arrest anyone for being a 'suspected' vagrant, particularly if you have not seen the guy before. The plot mostly consists of hide-and-seek games between Rambo and said Sheriff; other than an interesting twist at the end, there is not much to it. I also do not understand why you would aggressively pursue someone for an offence as minor as vagrancy.However, the hide-and-seek games are enthralling to watch, due to the eerie music score which always seems to resonate in the background. I knew what would happen at the end, due to my prior experience with Rambo II, but the uninitiated will not guess what will happen until Rambo's commanding officer, Col. Samuel Trautman, arrives on the scene, 'to save the cops from Rambo'. At this point, First Blood has already firmly established itself as a survival movie, but up to this point, there has not been a lot of action. This quickly changes, as Rambo, who is by now 'on the edge', goes into town and blows a couple of buildings up real good. He also does everything possible to damage the town, including shooting up the police station. In the police station, his mission comes to an end...one way or another.One of First Blood's main failings is it's construction of the main character, John Rambo, who, on first glance, is seen to be terrorising a few cops. Rambo appears to be little more than an uncultured thug, which is why I did not like this film the first time I saw it. I could not for the life of me understand why Rambo was attacking a few decent cops who were merely following orders from a fanatical, obsessive Sheriff. Another failing is it's dodgy moral stance: that people who served in the Vietnam War are all schizophrenics and psychos and as such should be hunted down. The construction of Rambo could more or less be put down to the performance of the lead actor, Sylvester Stallone. Let's face it, when he plays anyone who has a deeper personality than that of a heroic muscle-man, he usually sucks. Thankfully, he utters precious few lines until the end, when he goes into a rant about Vietnam. The rant has absolutely no effect due to his lack of coherence. Luckily, he is backed up well by Richard Crenna, who plays Trautman with remarkable assurance, along with Bill Dennehy, who attacks the role of the local Sheriff with aggression, as he should, given that the Sheriff is an authoritarian character.Anyway, I have said enough. First Blood is a good action and survival film which has largely been forgotten, due to the omnipresent insanity of the two films which followed it. It is not what I would call excellent: it's plot and moral stance are both dubious and this is quite telling. It is still, however, above average and better than many action movies going around today. If possible, make sure you see it before seeing the other two, otherwise it loses some of its sting.3.5/5 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew very little about "First Blood" prior to watching this movie except that Rambo was in the Vietnam War and was good at his job. I thought this was going to be a straight-forward action movie. It is not. The film opens 7 or so years after the Vietnam War ended with Rambo going to find one of his old army buddies, only to discover he died. Rambo then walks about the streets of a quaint Washington town where he is arrested for vagrancy by a police officer on a power trip. After being brought into the police station, Rambo escapes into the mountains while being pursued by most of the officers on duty. We follow Rambo as he deals with an ever-increasing opposing force.So that's the basic story without giving too much away. Now for the problems I had with the movie in order of severity. -The pace. Up until the last third, it was a chore to continue watching. The fifth sixth of the movie was such that I was indifferent to continue watching and the final sixth actually had me interested in what was happening. -Rambo's character. I understand that he most likely has PTSD. I can also understand the fact that he doesn't want to kill anyone. ****SPOILERS AHEAD****This works up until he escapes from the cave. If he really didn't want to kill anyone, he would not have jumped onto that truck and kicked the driver out. He knew that the driver would be found, he would report that Rambo is still alive, the hunt would return again and people would most likely get hurt. He then took the fight to the city which almost guarantees people will die. Perhaps he could have had a change of heart sometime through the movie, but it would have to be the very small window from the time he didn't kill the driver of the truck he hijacked to the time he decided to ram the police car off the road into that car.****SPOILERS FINISHED****-The soundtrack is often abrasive and doesn't blend well with the movie. There were many times that I found myself distracted by the music. -The final problem which is no more than a nuisance was how a police car crashing could produce a fiery explosion, but a mere minute later a large truck crashing into a police car results in no explosion.Were it not for the last 15 minutes, I would have awarded this movie 3 stars. For reference, a 5 star movie is something that I feel completely neutral towards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most people probably remember "First Blood" as the movie that gave birth to the action flick as we know it today, but I was able to interpret more. It's clearly looking at how the US government abandoned the Vietnam vets - which leads Sylvester Stallone's character John Rambo, as the lone fighter, to strike a blow for the common exploited man. But of course, that's what the typically American rugged individualism is all about. Maybe this movie is worth watching as a historical reference. But still, it looks like the cynicism arising from the Vietnam War is clearly abounding here. Also starring Richard Crenna and Brian Dennehy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Possible Spoilers Ahead!*Yep. A shiny, gold star goes to anyone who can clearly understand more than 3 words of what Stallone's character was babbling about during his final monologue.Whatever the frick Rambo was ranting on and on and on about (ho-hum!) in this supposedly dramatic and emotional moment was pretty much lost on me. All that I got from his spewing was just a demented slur of inarticulate rubbish. It was a truly terrible display of the verbal venting of pent-up anger that I've ever witnessed.(Sorry, but, no "Oscar" nod for Stallone on that one) If I didn't know better I'd have sworn that Stallone's character (little Johnny Rambo) was a certified mental defect of the highest order.If First Blood had been billed as a silly, slapstick Comedy, then, yes, I could've appreciated its asininity-factor to some degree. But, this utter nonsense was deemed as being regarded with the utmost dead-seriousness. And, of course, with that, no one would ever dare to be allowed to even chuckle at the likes of Sylvester Stallone, the King of Self-Love.The one scene (of many) that totally killed me was where Rambo (who was being shot at by an officer with terrible aim) leaps from clinging to the side of a sheer-faced cliff and plunges about 50 feet, crashing through trees and then finally landing on the jagged rocks below - Only to walk away from this certain-death ordeal with just a bad scratch to be concerned about. (Ha! What a laugh-and-a-half that was!) If you were to ask me, I'd swear that they were actually making this garbage up as they went along. And, naturally, with Stallone being one of the screenplay's co-writers, my presumption probably isn't too far off the mark on that one.First Blood is clearly the sort of ramshackle-movie where one doesn't give a single, sweet damn about any of its characters. They were all despicable, each and every one of them.I think its somewhat revealing to note that (other than seen very briefly in this film's opening scene) there was literally no female presence, whatsoever, happening in the story. Viewing First Blood from the perspective of an adult male, I certainly thought that this total lack of women spoke volumes about Stallone's attitude towards the opposite sex.This wretched mess also lost itself some considerable points by its blatant placement of certain well-known consumer products such as Coke, Chevron, Dairy Queen and Raleigh cigarettes.And, after all is said and done, I ask you - Did this Rambo-bozo really have the sort of image that Stallone wanted so badly to be identified with? Well, I guess that this was the case - 'Cause as his films that followed after First Blood showed, he literally milked this contemptuous character to its very last drop, and then some.Anyways - When Johnny comes marching home again. Hoorah! Hoorah! We'll give him a hearty welcome then. Hoorah! Hoorah!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fact 1-During the prison break it is clearly seen that Rambo is wearing dark brown trousers, however when he escapes these trousers are now a dark yellow and torn in several places (thrice on the crotch and 13 times on the upper right knee).Fact 2-The motorbike that Stallone escapes on was hand built by a young Robert Duvall. Fact 3-In earlier outtakes of the film the red bandanna was actually green with a dark grey trim.Fact 4-To get over Stallone's fear of helicopters he was shown round an aircraft museum in Flint, M.I in a bid to relax him.Fact 5-Martin Sheen submitted 3 alternate endings for the movie but was rejected on all 3 occasions by studio bigwigs.Fact 6-On the laser disc edition released in the Malasian market, the box did not show Stallone topless because of strict censorship, but instead showed a close up of his right eye with flames and gun debris reflecting off the pupil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After living with the specter of Rocky for years, Stallone finally hit pay-dirt as Rambo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although not as beloved as his Rocky Balboa character--and not as popular at the box-office as his "Rocky" films or this picture's two sequels--1982's "First Blood" was a perfect fit for Sylvester Stallone, not requiring him to talk too much and yet showing off his rock-hard physique. John J. Rambo is an ex-Green Beret who gets into trouble with the law near Portland, starting an all-out war with the local authorities. The film works fast and hard at getting the audience completely on Rambo's side, but does so by turning the police officers into dolts and bloodthirsty sadists. Most of the scrapes our hero works his way out of are due to his own irrational behavior, but the full-throttle machismo, brainless though it may be, struck a nerve with a great many people. Followed by "Rambo: First Blood Part II" in 1985 (which upped the action ante) and "Rambo III" in 1988. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rambo: First Blood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the release of the fourth film in 2008, simply titled "Rambo" ("John Rambo" in America) it was right they should show all three of the original films, and this is the first. Basically John J. Rambo (Sylvester Stallone, also writing) is a mentally unstable Vietnam war veteran, who has come to a quiet little town to see an old war friend, but he finds out he's dead. When he walks through a not-to-far mountain town, Sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy) gives him a lift to the end of town, and tells him to leave, but Rambo ignores him and is arrested for vagrancy (being a tramp). As the cops try to make him go through the arrest procedures, he eventually breaks out in rage and manages to escape. Teasle and the many officers are now hot on his trail, but they also meet the man that knows Rambo best, Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna) who personally trained to be the best. There are many explosions and quite a lot of gun fire as loner pushed too far tries to end and get away from this "warfare", but in the end he gives up and goes to prison. Also starring David Caruso as Deputy Mitch, Jack Starrett as Deputy Sgt. Arthur Galt, Michael Talbott as Deputy Balford, Bill McKinney as State Police Capt. Dave Kern and Chris Mulkey as Deputy Ward. To be honest, this wasn't the film I was expecting or had in mind, I found it just a little random and pointless, even though it is fun to see Stallone bleeding a lot, firing and blowing stuff up, but I don't know who's side to be on, and is Rambo a hero or anti-hero? Nevertheless, worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally, I found all those Rambo flicks to be pathetic, boring and worthless.This was the first installment of this pathetic franchise, and it is also one of the worst movies ever made, being overrated, boring, clichéd (Even for the time where this was made) and it is also a very ugly film.Awful, awful movie. This movie is awful beyond belief, and it is one of the most overrated movies ever made. There isn't anything good about this movie. It was terrible, tedious and irritating from beginning to end.I hate this movie. I think that it was the biggest disgrace for the action genre(Having a very negative influence on it) and personally I think it is the worst war movie ever made.</fullReview>
