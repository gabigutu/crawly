		<fullReview>At a risk of sounding slightly sacrilegious, on first viewing I'm kind of inclined to put this right up on a par with 'Shaun of the Dead'. Now, given I view Simon Pegg as an unquestionable comedy genius, I realise this is a rather big claim. And to what extent you agree with that last statement may be a good preliminary gauge of whether 'Fido' will appeal to you.In a way the comedy picks up where 'Shaun' left off, except we're back in the original 1950s Living Dead-era stereotypical middle-American small town. The Zombie Wars are over and zombies themselves are becoming more well-adjusted, useful members of the community. This, so we're informed at the outset, is largely thanks to the scientific advances made by the good people at Zomcom - a nice play on romantic comedy perhaps? The beauty of the film lies in its dead-pan depiction of a respectable neighbourhood maintaining core values while making a place for zombies and the special hazards they pose. The charm and balance with which it does this is near enough perfect. Themes you might expect from a more mainstream kitsch comedy come through - the veneer of good clean living, keeping up appearances, repressed emotion, muddled parental values, social decorum and the plight of the alienated individual.It's a story told with happy heart and wide appeal that is brought to life vividly by the film's all-round strong cast. It's one of those works where it really shows through that everyone involved got a kick out of taking part. It's also fun imagining what Billy Connelly learning his script must have been like...So in conclusion, it is probable you will appreciate the humour of this film unless your father tried to eat you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wish I didn't have to wait for this to come out in the US...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose the ultimate curse of attending the Toronto Film Festival is your release date time table get messed up. Quite frankly, I'm just happy Fido got picked up for US distribution. In any case...Ever seen Shaun of the Dead? Good. How about Lassie? Able to reconcile the two? Well, if you can your name might be Andrew Currie, Canadian helmer of the first ever family themed zombie comedy, or zomedy. (Seriously, that's what the press book in Toronto called it.) Though not as violent, dry, or British as Shaun of the Dead, Fido remains true to its roots: a devotion to old 50s black and white television including both Lassie and the infamous sci-fi pulp that was being pumped out during the period.Fido's talented headliners (Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connelly, Dylan Baker, and Tim Blake Nelson) stand as a testament to the brilliance of the script. The film explores all the implications of its premise: a world where zombies have been converted to servants because of the sheer number of them due to a strange accident. What would you use your new undead servant for? A butler? Manual labor? A pet? Unspeakable acts? Fido tackles all these possibilities in a sweet and surprisingly classy way, with much thanks to the work of Connelly (as one of said zombies) and young TV actor K'Sun Ray, who seems at times to be a better young Elijah Wood than the young Elijah Wood was.If you're expecting another Shaun of the Dead, don't waste your time. There's not nearly enough gore and pokes at the genre to satisfy you and you'll just leave the theater bitter and depressed. But if you're willing to take a look at what happens to Shaun of the Dead when it jumps across the lake, you're in for a treat. Think of Fido as the sensitive, more often beaten up little brother to Shaun of the Dead's rebellious loser, and you're starting to get the drift. If you like (or at least tolerate) zombies, small children, and loads of deadpan satire, Fido's the film for you. If that's not the case....well, you know the drill. Just hit 'em square between the eyes.</fullReview>

Great work by Carrie Anne Moss, Dylan Baker, Tim Blake Nelson, Billy Connelly and up and comer, Alexia Fast.Weirdly, I found myself thinking about the movie for days after seeing it.Writers, Dennis Heaton, Robert Chomiak and Andrew Currie layered in a lot of political subtext - but didn't whack you over the head with it.The world they created had depth, and made sense. There is a giddy carnivorous spirit to this movie.FIDO is guaranteed to cure grumpiness.Loved it!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fido is a cute comedy that deserves wider recognition, especially considering the mainstream crap that is supposed to entertain us these days.As has already been pointed out, this is hardly a real zombie film, but rather a sweet satire that employs the undead to point fingers. While there are necessarily some bloody scenes, there is almost no gore and the way this movie is presented (feel-good 50s style), I can't imagine anyone being actually scared or turned off by Fido &amp; his fellow sufferers.While the cast is generally good, I felt that Moss and Nelson stood out. The humor is not in-your-face, but rather subdued; there's a lot of attention to detail and I caught myself smiling benignly several throughout the movie. This is certainly no masterpiece of cinema, but it doesn't strive to be - instead, Currie succeeds in delivering a heart-warming black comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Pronounce This a Zombie Movie Is Somewhat Misleading</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw the World Preem of Fido at the Toronto International Film Festival and thoroughly enjoyed it. Here we have a welcome reworking of a genre widely thought to have been pioneered (certainly 'fleshed out' extensively and successfully) by George Romero. But this is a Canadian film by a Canadian Director and it's a Comedy! And, YES, I actually think it is better than 'Shawn of the Dead'. Thoroughly believable and, perhaps even more importantly, enjoyable performances by Dylan Baker, Carrie-Anne Moss and young actor K'Sun Ray, whom I suspect we'll be seeing a lot more of in future features. However, I must confess that I most enjoyed the delicious turn by Tim Blake Nelson as neighbour Mr. Theopolis, essentially playing a willing animated version of Victor Van Dort from the Corpse Bride (or, for those who've seen the film, wouldn't that read even better here as the Corpse Pride?) and, of course, Scotch actor Billy Connolly in his least animated, yet somehow deeply moving role as the titular character. Just think, he would not have gotten this role had it not been for Peter Stormare's commitments to Prison Break (as was revealed in the Q&amp;A following Thursday night's screening). I can't help but speculate that the Screenwriters must have drawn a lot of inspiration from Day Of The Dead's Zombie 'Bub'.I am not keen on ever revealing plot details during a Comment and I won't start now. Suffice it to say that Fido is NOT one of those dour, graphically gory Zombie films you can rely on from Romero. Rather it is a film that will have you constantly chuckling and, although (and I did have to think back carefully to be sure) there is a fair dose of blood-letting and violence, the delectable humour, so well enhanced by the surreal milieu created by Director Currie and his co-screenwriters, goes a long way towards making this seem like a feature that ought to be rated PG-13. I urge you to go see this little Canuck gem. I'll certainly be buying the DVD once it emerges hopefully by next Summer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wanton homicide, zombies, slavery, bullying: yet it all makes for zany light comedy here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in a middle class neighborhood in the imaginary town of Willard in the 1950s, this dark comedy with a light touch toys with such American obsessions as gun mania and violence, materialism and keeping up with the Joneses, fear of others, slavery, golf, and the disposing of the dead. Yes, it all sounds a bit heavy, but trust me on this, it's nearly as light as a feather.Zombies are featured prominently among the characters. Crucial questions arise, such as: who will become a zombie (90% of the Willard folks choose this final path, while only 10% prefer a traditional funeral)? Who owns how many Zombies to do their bidding like robots (they've become a mark of social status)? And, what is the range of possible relationships that can be worked out between the living and the sort of reincarnated dead? Somehow, director Andrew Currie, who also co-wrote the lively screenplay (with Robert Chomiak and Dennis Heaton), keeps this improbable material percolating along for an hour and a half without once faltering for want of a good laugh. A super cast helps: Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker, Henry Czerny, Tim Blake Nelson, Mary Black and Sonja Bennett are the principals, aided by young K'Sun Ray as Timmy, the innocent kid with a good heart who acts as fair witness to all the lunacy of the grownups. (Having seen her only in "Memento" and "The Matrix," I had no idea that Ms. Moss had such fine comedienne chops.) The production design and music are exquisitely 50s, to a tee. Maybe this one isn't for everybody. It surely will be a hard film to beat for my annual Bizarro Award. But intelligent comedies that stay funny from start to finish are among the hardest won achievements in movie-making. For me anyway, "Fido" is a hoot! My grades: 8.5/10 (A-) (Seen on 01/30/07)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must see, cult film in the making!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first must see film I've seen in the last year! It's wickedly funny, incredibly original, unbelievably great looking (they went for this super cool wide-screen Technicolor look that's awesome to behold,) and it actually has depth in character and in what it says about society. It's really smart satire that nails everything from Homeland Security to race issues, while at the same time leaving you laughing and realizing how much are world lives in fear. Carrie Anne Moss turns in a comedic performance I never imagined would come from her! She's sweet, funny and sexy! Billy Connolly is great as Fido who can only grunt and moan! And Dylan Baker as the Dad is priceless. In fact the whole cast is perfect. Henry Czerny as the bad guy, Tim Blake Nelson as the neighbor with the hot sexy zombie girlfriend (getting the idea now?) Funny, though-provoking and just all round amazing! Go and see this movie! It's like nothing you've ever seen before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Like Leave It To Beaver With A Brain-Hungry Butler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A year or so ago, I was watching the TV news when a story was broadcast about a zombie movie being filmed in my area. Since then I have paid particular attention to this movie called 'Fido' as it finished production and began playing at festivals. Two weeks ago Fido began playing in my local theater. And, just yesterday, I read a newspaper article which stated Fido is not attracting audiences in it's limited release, with the exception of our local theater. In fact, here it is outdrawing all other shows at The Paramount Theater, including 300. Of course, this makes sense as many locals want to see their city on screen or spot themselves roaming around in zombie make-up. And for any other locals who haven't seen Fido yet but are considering it, I can say there are many images on screen, from the school to city park to the forbidden zone, that you will recognize. In fact, they make the Okanagan Valley look beautiful. That's right beautiful scenery in a zombie movie! However, Fido itself is a very good movie. Yes, despite its flaws, it is better then most of the 20 other movies playing in my local market. Fido is best described as an episode of Lassie in which the collie has been replaced by a member of the undead. This is a clever premise. And the movie even goes further by taking advantage of the 1950's emphasize on conformity and playing up the cold-war paranoia which led to McCarthyism. Furthermore, it builds on the notion that zombies can be tamed or trained which George Romero first introduced in Day Of The Dead.K'Sun Ray plays a small town boy who's mother (Carrie-Ann Moss) longs for a zombie servant so she can be like all the other house wives on her block. However, his dad (Dylan Baker) is against the idea as he once had to kill his own 'zombie father'. Eventually, the family does acquire a zombie named 'Fido' (played by Billy Connolly), and adjusts to life with the undead. Billy Connolly was inspired casting. He is able to convey Fido's confusion, longing, hatred, and loyalty through only his eyes, lumbering body, and grunts. Connolly shows that he can play understated characters better than his outrageously comedic ones. This is his best role since Mrs. Brown.Fido follows in the footsteps of other recent zomcoms such as Shawn Of The Dead and Zombie Honeymoon. Being someone who appreciates Bruce Campbell and Misty Mundae movies more than Eli Roth and Jigsaw ones, I prefer humor over gore in my horror. However, I understand the criticism of those horror fans who feel there is not enough 'undead carnage' in Fido. Yet, I am sure patient viewers will be rewarded by the films gentle humor.The movie does break down in it's third act. It's as if the writers were so wrapped up in the cute premise of domesticated zombies in the 1950s, they forgot about the story arc. However, given my interest in horror comedies and my appreciation for seeing the neighborhood on screen, I rate Fido 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing must-see movie of 2007!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My goodness. This movie really really shows the talents of actors. Billy Connelly flexes his acting muscle. Truly an amazing man, if you look at him in Absolution as a rebel, Boondock Saints as a madman/killer, and then finally in Fido as a zombie! His character in Fido looks from cute to frightening, absolutely fabulous! Cariie Ann Moss is no hack either! Jumping in career from Matrix and Momento as a darker character, to a heart warming conservative 1950's housewife! Rare these days to see actors being able to not be so type-casted.Now onto the storyline (No Spoilers, don't worry). This movie would make Max Brooks (Author of Zombie Survival Guide &amp; World War Z) happy with joy! Finally a well done twist of zombies and comedy.If you like zombies, if you don't like zombies, if you are just bored, or if you are too busy, go see this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And this somebody is me. And not only me, as I can see here at IMDb or when leaving the theater. Why did the people love it? It's obvious: Everybody knows zombies by now (at least the Horror fans by heart and the others through the "Dawn of the Dead" reinvention or Resident Evil movies etc.) Or at least they thought they knew everything about zombies ... that is until this movie came along. And you'll see zombies in a new light (perhaps). This is not a horror movie, although it does contain some violent scenes, but is rather a comedy. A satire to be precise. And it never runs out of steam! That is why I rated it so high. Pacing wise it's incredible, the acting is great and the script has no (obvious) mistakes ... quite the contrary: It's a gem and if you're only a little bit interested in zombies you ought to see it! And even if you dislike them, watch it! Because it's a great (comedy) movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Douglas Sirk meets George Romero!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film takes place in the 1950s. According to this the dead (called zombies) have arisen to eat the living. However a company has developed a collar that, when put around the zombies neck, makes them docile and perfect servants. The Robinsons mom Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss), dad Bill (Dylan Baker) and son Timmy (K'Sun Ray) hire a zombie because everyone on their block already has one. Tim names the zombie Fido (Billy Connolly) and becomes friends with him. But his dad hates him and Timmy looses control of Fido and things go wrong.As you can see this is--among many other things--a takeoff on the "Lassie" series with Fido being a stand in for Lassie. Timmy was named that for a reason! Every single of the famous Lassie episodes are spun here. My favorite is when Timmy sends Fido off to get help before the zombies eat him! Also it's a satire of those 1950s Douglas Sirk films where everything is bright and colorful--but dark secrets are tearing people apart. The characters wear VERY bright 1950s clothes (Moss is always in a dress)--the furnishings, settings and cars especially are all 1950s in hyper bright colors. Even when the script becomes repetitious there's always something to look at. The script is good--but there are only so many Lassie jokes you can make. The melodramatics are kind of silly but the cast pulls it off. Everyone here is excellent and right on target. Even Connolly as an emotionless zombie does a good job. Moss is the best--playing each line for all its worth---but never going overboard.This isn't for everybody (of course). The satire may be lost on most people and the gore is pretty tame. The gore is done so casually and with happy music playing over it it's hard to take it seriously. So, for some people, this will really work. I give it an 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not What It First Appears - An Absurdly-Funny &amp; Touching Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you see the cover of the DVD you're convinced this is some Class B cheesy cheapie, a film made for $1,000 in somebody's backyard.Wrong! This is quality material and really good. It's a comedy and a clever one at that. It also is very touching in spots, with a nice spot of kindness. The production values are very good (this looks excellent), the actors are known, the film's direction and sets are great. It's amazing. Who would have thought?Carrie-Ann Moss, playing against-type, is terrific, as"Helen Robinson," the June Cleaver-like wife; Billy Connolly is great as the grunting good-hearted zombie "Fido;" Tim Blake Nelson ("Mr. Theopolis") is a hoot is the neighbor with the sexy zombie girlfriend "Tammy," and Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker as dads (check) are excellent, too K'Sun Ray as young "Timmy Robinson," shouldn't be overlooked, either. In fact, he probably has more lines in the movie than anyone.If I explain the story it will sound so stupid that few of you would watch it. You'll just have to take the word of the people here who liked it and found it to be a very, very pleasant surprise. You need a dark sense of humor, though; an appreciation of the absurd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fido Crapped His Pants</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As soon as I heard about this film I knew I had to check it out. Well, I heard about it, then I found the trailer. After that, that's when I knew I had to see it. And I am so glad I did. You want to see classic television mixed with zombies? No? Then get lost.FIDO is a movie unlike anything I've ever seen. Well, actually, it kind of is. It's kind of like a Lassie episode and a Zombie film. Though when combined, it feels completely new and original. FIDO is about a little boy named Timmy and his new pet Fido. Well this new pet ain't no squawking parakeet or some potty-trained puppy. It's a re-animated dead guy...a zombie. A large radiation cloud engulfed Earth which led to all of the dead rising, which ensued the Zombie Wars. Though through the genius of Reinhold Giger, lead scientist of ZomCon, he discovered that if you destroy the brain, the zombie will perish, thus giving us the edge and the win in the Zombie War. Though due to lingering radiation, whoever dies becomes a zombie. Which can be a problem especially with the elderly. Though Zomcom steps up again with more breakthroughs, especially with the Domestication Collar. The collar stops the zombie's need for human flesh and thus making it harmless as a household pet. But not all is perfect in this Zombie Utopia, collars break, old people die and....well I'll just let you watch this incredibly unique flick.FIDO is a fantastic idea brought to fruition. With an all-star cast, and great writing FIDO rises above most in the comedy/horror genre. There are plenty of funny and original situations that really had me entertained. Though after seeing the film, I personally think the movie would have been better in black and white. At less than 90 minutes, the movie doesn't go on for too long and moves from scene to scene at a good rate. It'll probably end up being a cult-classic of sorts, since it's not really a laugh out loud comedy or even a horror movie. It's a comedy/family/zombie film immersed in the 1950 vibe. If you thought anything I said here was interesting by all means check this film out. But if you're still on the fence, swing your leg back over and stay there. 8.5 outta 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasantville meets Night of the Living Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I didn't know what to expect when I saw the cover to Fido, honestly when I came across it in the video store I was tempted to rent this movie, but nothing about it really grabbed my attention. But when I was looking around in Netflix, they were advertising this like crazy if I liked "goofy" scary movies, so I figured to just give it a shot. I'm so glad that I did watch it, this was just a great movie, it was absolutely hilarious and so charming to watch. Like I said, it's Pleasantville meets Night of the Living Dead, it's just a great concept, what does happen after a mega zombie attack? As we see in another zombie comedy, Shaun of the Dead, they have fun by making the zombies left over as "handy" citizens. This is a very overlooked horror/comedy movie, I think a lot of people were just so blown away with Shaun of the Dead that this got the boot. But it's a great story and the cast was perfect and made this into just a really funny movie.In a 1950s alternate universe where radiation from space has turned the dead into zombies. This radiation still plagues humanity, as all those who die after the original contamination turn into the undead. In order to continue living normal lives, communities are fenced with the help of a governing corporation named Zomcon. Zomcon provides collars with accompanying remote controls to control the zombies' hunger for flesh so as to use them as slaves or servants. In the town of Willard, a housewife ,Helen, buys a zombie in spite of her husband Bill's zombie phobia. Their son, Timmy, befriends the zombie, naming him "Fido". One day Fido's collar malfunctions and he kills their next door neighbor, who turns into a zombie. Timmy "kills" the zombified neighbor. When a pair of local bullies are blamed for the missing neighbor, they capture Fido and Timmy. Helen comes and rescues Timmy and Fido from the bullies and they try to forget about the whole thing. Several days later, the neighbor's body is found and the murder is traced back to Fido, who is taken away to Zomcon where the public is told he will be destroyed. Timmy learns through a friend that Fido is simply working in a factory at Zomcon. Timmy sets out to rescue him with the help from his neighbor with a zombie girlfriend in hopes to get Fido back.I really do highly recommend this movie if you get the chance to see it, it's so silly but a lot of fun. Billy Connelly did a great job as Fido and really brought, no pun intended, a lot of life into the character. I think the scene that made me laugh the most was when Timmy has to burry the old lady that Fido attacked and killed, his last words to her were so funny, "you weren't really nice, but you liked flowers, so?" and he buries her in the garden. Not to mention the neighbor with the zombie girlfriend, sick, disturbing, wrong, but classic laughs. I still love how even though this is like the Leave It To Beaver-esquire type of world, there still is a lot of gore in the movie. So if you do have a chance to see Fido, take it, I promise some good laughs.9/10</fullReview>

K'sun is really great as the son just trying to be as normal as possible in this nightmare existence, and somehow succeeding. He's a genuine screen presence. Very photogenic, and natural. Without naming them all, the rest of the cast is wonderful. Henry Czerny plays a suspicious policeman with honed instincts and little squeamishness as if it's his everyday persona. Billy Connolly is delightful as Fido. A fine actor: I wish that he had played the title role in "Braveheart," with Gibson directing. My sense is that his William Wallace would have been closer to the actual character. His Fido is contained, yet accessible. A nice touch.In short, a great and marvelous satiric poke at morals, values, social pinnings, feelings, growth, coping in uncertain times, and compensatory adjustments to impossible conditions.

		<shortDescription>A touching tale of a boy and his zombie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an alternate 1950s, where an outbreak of the undead (caused by a mysterious 'space-dust') has been contained through the use of special electronic collars, a young loner, Timmy, finds a friend in Fido (Billy Connelly), his family's recently acquired domesticated zombie.Fido quickly becomes a surrogate father to Timmy, whose real dad is unable to adequately express his love for his son (or for his hot-to-trot wife, played by the gorgeous Carrie-Anne Moss) having been psychologically scarred as a child (when he was forced to shoot his own father, who tried to eat him!).Timmy runs into a spot of bother, however, when his putrid pal's collar goes on the blink, and he attacks and kills an elderly neighbour. With the authorities on Fido's trail, trouble brewing with a pair of local bullies, and his mother forming a bond with their undead house-help, will Timmy be able to hold on to his new found friend?A refreshing take on the whole zombie schtick, Fido is a thoroughly entertaining, deliciously dark comedy that should appeal to anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humour. Taking the Romero zombie-verse and transplanting it into 1950s small town America is a stroke of genius, and the result is simply one of the most original films to tackle the whole 'reanimated dead' theme that I have seen.Connelly's Fido is a cinematic zombie worthy of inclusion in the Undead Movie Hall of Fame, along with Day Of The Dead's Bub, and Return Of The Living Dead's Tarman; it is not often I feel empathy for a walking corpse, but The Big Yin's performance is so fine that I actually found myself rooting for the big blue bag of pus! The rest of the cast also give commendable performances, with young K'Sun Ray (as Timmy) and Ms.Moss deserving special mentions?Ray, because, for one so young, he puts in a particularly assured turn, and Moss because she is so bloody yummy!This is the third zombie film that I have watched this week (the others being the somewhat disappointing Planet Terror and the rather fun Flight Of The Living Dead), and, to my surprise, it is also the best. Director Andrew Currie has given fans of the genre something truly original to treasure and is a talent to be watched in the future.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have stayed dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's been a vogue for the past few years for often-as-not ironic zombie-related films, as well as other media incarnations of the flesh- eating resurrected dead. "Fido" is a film that's either an attempt to cash in on that, simply a manifestation of it, or both -- and it falls squarely into the category of ironic zombies. The joke here is that we get to see the walking dead in the contrasting context of a broadly stereotyped, squeaky-clean, alternate-history (we are in the wake of a great Zombie War, and the creatures are now being domesticated as slaves) version of a 1950s suburb. It's a moderately funny concept on its own, and enough perhaps for a five-minute comedy sketch, but it can't hold up a feature-film on its own. The joke that rotting corpses for servants are incongruous with this idealized version of a small town is repeated over and over again, and loses all effectiveness. The soundtrack relentlessly plays sunny tunes while zombies cannibalize bystanders. The word "zombie" is constantly inserted into an otherwise familiarly homey line for a cheap attempt at a laugh. The very broadness and artificiality of the representation of "the nineteen fifties" here can't help but irritate me. It is so stylized, in it evidently "Pleasantville-"inspired way, that it is more apparent in waving markers of its 1950s-ness around than actually bearing any resemblance to anything that might have happened between 1950 and 1959. There is something obnoxiously sneering about it, as if the film is bragging emptily and thoughtlessly about how more open, down-to-Earth, and superior the 2000s are. Because the characters are such broad representations of pop-culture 1950s "types," it's difficult to develop much emotional investment in them. Each has a few character traits thrown at him or her -- Helen is obsessed with appearances, and Bill loves golf and his haunted by having had to kill his father -- but they remain quite two-dimensional. Performances within the constraints of this bad writing are fine. The best is Billy Connolly as Fido the zombie, who in the tradition of Boris Karloff in "Frankenstein" actually imparts character and sympathy to a lumbering green monster who cannot speak. There are little bits of unsubtle allegory thrown around -- to commodity fetishism, racism, classism, war paranoia, et cetera, but none of it really works on a comprehensive level, and the filmmakers don;t really stick with anything. Unfortunately, this film doesn't really get past sticking with the flimsy joke of "Look! Zombies in 'Leave it to Beaver!'" for a good hour- and-a-half.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched FIDO on some movie channel and I have to say that I've become an instant fan. The film feels like a comic book that perfectly captures the look and feel of the surreal 1950s, you know the wholesome decade when they danced to Elvis while dropping nuclear bombs in the desert just for the heck of it. People were so naive back then that it's frightening and the idea that those clean cut folks would find it normal to have zombies as pets actually works here.Kudos to this Canadian production, the colorful crisp cinematography and the excellent cast, including Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Henry Czerny and the kid.It's a shame this film wasn't a bigger hit. It deserved more recognition. It's much better than the stuff from Tim Burton or the SHAUN OF THE DEAD team. Oh well. It's an instant classic nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie gets both a 6/10 rating from me, as well as a 9/10. Here is why: As a standard horror movie for the standard horror crowd, where action and gore and scares are taken into consideration, this movie WILL bore you. It's basically a family drama similar to what you'd see on the Lifetime channel, but put in a horror universe. The story and formula are age-old, retreaded hundreds of times. If you're looking for any originality in the plot structure or the minimal conflicts, you'll be disappointed. Take away the zombies and you'll have something just as melodramatic as A Beautiful Mind, tripping on cheese. This is the 6/10.However, the basic synopsis and idea is pretty original and over-the-top. It's literally something you and your friends would joke about when you're half-drunk . . . but that joke actually got a theatrical release. The idea gets a 9/10 from me. The only reason it isn't perfect is because they could have taken it even further, but they didn't.The mix of both is mixed. I thought it was funny, but as with most all comedies, it wasn't THAT funny. I had my mom and little sister watch it with me and the jokes we made about it were funnier than the jokes scripted. There were moments of utter genius, but there were also moments of pure boredom.I sincerely hope that other movies take this kind of over-the-top risk and original ideas. I just can't say it was perfect, or even near it, because of the lack of originality to the plot.A GREAT family movie. A great movie to watch with a bunch of guys (or girls). A great movie to watch with anyone . . . but if you watch it alone, it will be a bit boring. Other people always make this kind of movie funnier and richer.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was also on hand for the premiere in Toronto. This film was sort of a consolation when I thought I wouldn't be able to get in to see my first choice. Well, I was totally blown away. By the time I got to the theater I could remember little other than the basic plot of the movie (yes, I actually forgot who was even in it.) Terrific performances from the entire cast. Carrie-Anne Moss was great in a true departure from her days as Trinity. As for Billy Connolly, I think not since Chaplin has an actor played so brilliantly with no lines what-so-ever. The kids were also great. Definitely check this one out if you get the chance.And, by the way, I got to see my first choice anyway- and this was way better.</fullReview>

I guess it would be classified as a comedy or horror by most, but i think it is really neither. Not a horror at all (the zombie aspect of this movie is very original) and although i laughed numerous times i think its not a movie i see as designed for laughs. The acting i find to be superb. A very good, under-appreciated film. Would recommend to anyone.Don't watch it expecting it to be a horror film nor the next "shaun of the dead". Its not; its a hell of a movie though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Fido" is a movie you have to be in a certain mood to watch! If you are up for it the experience will be enjoyable! If not than the movie will be quite boring! It is a nice comedy with a special take on the zombie genre! "Fido" doesn't take it self serious,so the acting is light and acceptable! As a parody it works quite well! But it does require some knowledge about zombie movies made by George A. Romero or similar productions and "Lassie" movies! Otherwise it will be hard to understand the humor used in this movie! There is little gore and no suspense at all! So in essence there is nothing extra to be experienced! Billy Connolly as Fido is perfect! He doesn't say much and only growls at times! But even then you understand what he is trying to say (What do you mean a parody on "Lassie"?)! "Fido" is pretty entertaining even when the pace is slow at times! At least it is not a waste of time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fidois a very odd film. And in many ways, a very good one.My first thought after viewing, was how the hell are they going to market this thing? If Shaun of the Dead is a romantic comedy with zombies, Fido is a boy and his dog story blended with fifties nostalgia comedy with zombies. Doesn't exactly trip off the tongue.Fido has little of Shaun's carnage, gore &amp; belly laughs. It is a different beast altogether (forgive the pun).Fido kicks off with a black &amp; white information film that explains the back story - humans have won a war against zombies by developing a control collar that subdues the flesh-eaters into dumb servants.At first I thought we we were in for a fifties cold war paranoia parody a la Matinée, but we are soon hurled into a world of bright primary colours and fifties middle-class nostalgia.Young Timmy Robinon is a lonely kid who doesn't fit in at school. His mom is would-be social climber,and his dad is nervy and detached.Seeking to keep up with the Joneses, mom (Carry-Anne Moss) has acquired a zombie. Jimmy is disinterested at first, but 'Fido' (Billy Conelley) soon proves a great buddy for Jimmy. Until his collar goes on the blink...Fido is NOT a horror film, but my problem with the movie is figuring out exactly what it IS.Much of the humour is of the light family variety, and sometimes the plot line is too heavily reliant on the boy and his dog/family moments.Yet the film is shot through with wonderfully dark, truly funny moments, which while welcome, will ensure an R rating for what is, for extended periods, a family comedy.The film looks gorgeous, and is wonderfully performed by all involved.Despite its difficult tonal problems, I hope this movie finds a niche, as it's quite a little gem in this year's deluge of cinematic crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meet My Pet Fido, He's a Zombie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most hilariously refreshing Zombie film since "Return of the Living Dead." You just know with a name like "Fido," that this film is going to be a die laughing affair, &amp; "Fido" like faithful dog, never disappoints! Yes, there is some elements borrowed from "Shaun of the Dead," as far as Zombie's being incorporated into society as workers, but where "Shaun of the Dead" skims over the subject, "Fido" goes right for the gut &amp; the brain. Where "Shaun of the Dead" relies partially on crude comedy to get it's laughs, "Fido" is the thinking Zombie's comedy. It is also a love story, a pet story, a murder mystery, a story of Zombies being more than just brain munching cadavers. Here the Zombie's are the good guys &amp; cooperate villain Zomcon, is the bad guys.As "Fido" unfolds, it's a funny &amp; touching comedy that has brains to spare, not for eating, but for thinking. After all, Zombies have feelings too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A zombie film for, well, everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fido," is a unique example of the zombie comedy. Instead of focusing on the comedic events that come from acclimatization with a world overrun by zombies, Fido examines the benefits and pitfalls of cohabitation with the living dead. The context of a precariously stable interaction between humans and zombies allows the film to address some very interesting questions. To be sure, this film breaks from some of the standard conventions of the genre. Even though the genre breaks may offend a purist; the film's novel approach provides a great deal of thoughtful material that is accessible to a wider and thoughtful audience.As with all zombie films, Fido is based on the premise that the dead can return to life. Furthermore, the zombies all have an inherent desire to eat human flesh. The deviant premise is that humanity has found a way to curb the violent lusts of the zombies and thus created a docile and mindless workforce. The last premise is what allows for fascinating questions. Zombies robbed of their horrific behavior quickly enter into a zone as gray as their slowly purifying skin. Are these former humans alive or dead? Do peaceful zombies retain memories or emotion? What are the moral ramifications of harnessing zombie labor? Is it morally aberrant for humans to form emotional attachments to zombies? All of these questions are subtly touched on in Fido. That the issues are touched on subtly is key to the success of the film. Had the filmmakers decided to create a heavy handed yet contextually odd morality lesson, the film would have come off as preachy and gimmicky. Fido, however, takes a more even handed and vague route. Respect for the various biologically ambiguous positions are maintained throughout the film.To be completely fair, the filmmakers do allow themselves a measured amount of firm moral positioning when establishing conflict. An underlying theme is depicting the qualities of a healthy family relationship. The filmmakers views are much more concrete in this area. While subtlety is lost, the moral judgment maintained is neither mawkish or distracting. Overall, the film creates an easily accepted context from which a collection of interesting philosophical questions are explored.In regards to the more technical aspects of the film, Fido is well done. The character development and acting is well done. The most easily identified weak point is Moss's portrayal of the mother. In the first half of the film, Moss is rather stilted and wooden. By the mid-point, however, Moss has eased into a much more believable and dynamic character. Regarding editing, shot composition, and cinematography, Fido is a cleverly composed evocation of a post-apocalyptic 1950s suburban America. All in all, this is a thought provoking story told through a film that is just plain fun to watch.On a personal note, I will be highly recommending this film to friends. Being such a mix of genres and ideas, Fido offers something to almost any viewer. This film is near perfection for the Friday movie night with friends. 8 of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Day Of The Subservient Dead.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taking the nice 50s-era and adding some unique characters that create a nice analogy for prejudicial attitudes and the gaping chasm dividing social classes, Fido then throws in some of the post-9/11 commentary that The Village had. Not only that, it does it all with zest, smarts and some great one-liners. And Billy Connolly.After the trauma of "the zombie war" the world is a relatively safe place to live thanks to the developments of Zomcon. Their collars seem to stop domesticated zombies from having the munchies and all of the dangerous types are kept outwith the huge fences that surround all major population areas. Billy Connolly plays Fido, one of the collar-wearing, domesticated zombies who ends up showing Timmy (K'Sun Ray) that there may be more to the walking undead than just a desire to eat human flesh. He also makes a good impression on Timmy's progressive mother (wonderfully played by Carrie-Anne Moss). Mind you, you can't make an omelette without breaking some eggs so the journey through possible zombie rehabilitation doesn't come without the occasional limb being lost here and there. When a neighbour or two disappears everyone's suspicions are aroused, especially the security chief of Zomcon (Henry Czerny) who lives on the same street.Directed by Andrew Currie, from a script he helped co-write developed from a story by Dennis Heaton, Fido is one of those little movies that doesn't necessarily wow you but just does everything right. From the opening public information film to the final scene, this movie never really rises to greatness but at least maintains an impressively consistent balance between the great one-liners, the dark humour and the pointed digs at aspects of our society. Just take the following exchange as a prime example of what I'm talking about: "I'm pregnant baby!". . . . . . . . . . . . "Oh, darling, I just don't think I can afford another funeral on my salary". And that's just one of many great lines in the film. On top of the script we get cracking performances from everyone involved. Dylan Brown is great as the father who doesn't really ever act like a father, Carrie-Anne Moss is superb and really feels like she IS a feisty 50s gal, Henry Czerny is as good as he ever is (why isn't that man used more?), Tim Blake Nelson has a fun role, the youngster is very good and Billy Connolly gets to moan and grunt in a vocal performance that works on two levels. A) He's not too bad at portraying a zombie and B) fans of his stand-up work will no doubt be reminded of his amusing back catalogue of strange/pained/drunken/angry noises.Released at a time when it felt like everyone and his uncle was making a zombie comedy in an attempt to make a quick buck, Fido is one of the rare real surprises of the lot. It oozes quality thanks to the writing, shooting and performances. Even the soundtrack's absolutely right for the material. A definite winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tremendously well written zombie comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel confident in stating that Fido is the most charming movie that will ever be made about flesh-eating zombies. Now, if you think the words "charming" and "flesh-eating zombies" should never be used in the same sentence, this might not be the film for you. If you're not bothered by such a dissonant incongruity, you'll find Fido to be delightful on many levels. This story is set in 1950s America. Not the real era, of course, but a 1950s America where a cloud of radiation came from outer space to cover the Earth and cause anyone who dies to rise and seek to feast upon the living. After a desperate war against the walking dead, humanity has been able to secure itself behind protective fences and has created a technology that can control zombies. As long as their special collars are working, the monsters are docile and capable of following orders. So, they're put to work as gardeners, dog walkers, paper boys, house servants and anything else you can imagine. In this bizarre world, the movie focuses on two families - The Robinsons and the Bottoms. Helen and Bill Robinson (Carrie-Anne Moss and Dylan Baker) and their son Timmy (K'Sun Ray and yes, his parents should be horsewhipped) are the stereotypical 1950s nuclear family. Helen is a homemaker who is consumed with appearances and keeping up with the Joneses. Bill is the emotionally closed-off breadwinner who only thinks he's in charge of the family. Timmy is the typical scamp who has to deal with bullies in school and has a crush on the new girl in class. That new girl is Cindy Bottoms (Alexia Fast). She's just moved to town with her parents and her dad John (Henry Czerny) is the head of security of Zomcon, the company that created the zombie-controlling collars and essentially functions as the corporate overload of this strange society. Worried that the Bottoms are rich enough to have 6 zombie servants, Helen goes out and finally buys a zombie (Billy Connoly) for the Robinson family. Despite Bill's deep dislike for the idea, for reasons that become clear in the film, Helen and Timmy form a bond with their zombie servant. Timmy even names him Fido and treats him like a pet dog. Unfortunately, Fido's collar temporarily malfunctions and he kills the neighborhood's busybody old lady. That sets in motion a chain of events that has Zomcon take Fido away and forces Timmy to team up with his next door neighbor Mr. Theopolis (Tim Blake Nelson), a man with his own odd relationship with the undead, to rescue Fido and bring him back home. This is a very, very clever film. In fact, while multiple writers is usually a sign of a poor story, the three men who collaborated on Fido came up with one of the better written movies I've watched in a long, long time. Fido isn't just an amusing comedy about zombies. It also creates one of the most well thought out fictional realities you'll ever see. The movie is just packed with little touches that reflect what it would be like to actually live in the 1950s if the living dead were real. For example, instead of life insurance, people have funeral insurance. That's so when you die, someone will cut off your head and bury you so you don't come back as a zombie. But Fido is also a good natured parody of those boy-and-his-dog films like Lassie. You can't help but laugh when Timmy gets trapped somewhere and Fido has to go for help. T hat's not all, though. Fido is also a gentle parody of modern films about the 1950s, with Helen being that isolated and unfulfilled housewife who becomes emotionally drawn to her black gardener or what have you. Except the man she turns to when her husband can't make her happy isn't a man at all, it's a zombie.Fido is a marvelous example of how twisted popular culture has become. It's a comedy about zombies that parodies a genre of films from the 1950s and a genre of films about the 1950s, all the while creating a fictional reality with the attention to detail of an obsessive-compulsive Dungeons and Dragons fanatic. Admittedly, the bigger a fan you are of Romero-type zombie stories, the more you will love Fido. But even if those horror movies aren't you cup of tea, there's a delightfully absurd sense of fun in this film that you still might enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new genre?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing to mention is, that I have never heard about the genre of this movie. Is it a comedy? A Zombie-movie? A father-son story? A love story? To me this kind of story was new...first thumb up. The acting of all the actors was well done. Especially Carrie-Anne Moss and Dylan Baker were great. He played a frightened, insecure man, who tries to be a "good" man without emotions, but the "real" emotions were there in every gesture and every word. The Zombie, his little friend and the heart of the house, Carrie-Anne Moss showed emotions with their eyes, with little gestures, that were readable and believable. Great job, next thumb up. The atmosphere of this 50's clean suburb was well done and believable, the cars, the houses, the hair cut, the interior, great job on this too. The story itself is funny and emotional without being silly or cheesy. Maybe not a "cult movie", but very well done, with fine acting and a characters you can understand and follow. A couple of thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so you say you are a horror aficionado in need of a good re-up? I'll keep it real, you won't be scared, but, trust me on this, you certainly won't be disappointed either. Fido is the kitschy answer to the more recent trend seen in self-reflective genre pieces commonly referred to as comedy-horror. The advantage to this film, however, is that it makes no pretenses. It's like a cross between _Stand By Me_, _Edward Scissorhands_, _Dead Alive_, and your favorite Zombie movie featuring whatever slow-moving undead. And don't worry, I just threw the Scissorhands in there to help describe the back-in-the-day, anti-nostalgia effect. If the _Stand By Me_ thing throws you way off, you could replace it with _Benji_, I guess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Zom-Com since "Shaun of the Dead"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the immortal "Shaun of the Dead", we are introduced to a London where the slackers and the high-and-mighty alike are forced to battle flesh-eating, reanimated corpse versions of their friends and family. At the end of the film, it is suggested that the zombies are rendered harmless and used as cheap labour. "Fido" presents us with an epilogue to "Shaun" set in 1950's America, in a hilariously witty and original "what-if...?" movie.The film is set post-zombie-apocalypse, for a change; after the terrors of the Zombie Wars, ended by the creation of the ZomCon company and their patented zombie collars which make the corpses as docile as lambs. Every town in the world is fenced off from the Wild Zone, the once-fertile landscape torn asunder by the surviving zombies and left-overs from the apocalyptic wars. The idyllic town of Willard is your typical, pristine 50's suburbia, with one small difference; social status is measured by a family's amount of domesticated zombies. Unfortunately, the Robinson family has no zombies whatsoever, due to their patriarch, Bill's, fear of the reanimated dead. Timmy Robinson and his mother Helen both suffer from the pressures of suburban life, until the day that Helen purchases a zombie servant in a desperate attempt to impress the neighbours.The zombie earns Timmy's love when he rescues him from a pair of violent bullies, and the two form a bond to rival the classic "boy-and-his-dog" cliché... a boy and his zombie. Timmy names his "pet" Fido, and he soon becomes an aid for both Timmy and Helen to escape the prison-like routine Bill has put them in. But when Fido's domestication collar goes on the fritz and he devours the elderly Mrs Henderson, the Robinsons have to contain their connection the sudden wild zombie epidemic and still manage to keep their beloved Fido.A film whose sharp wit and satirical gore carry it just as much as its all-star cast (including "The Matrix"'s Carrie-Anne Moss as Helen Robinson and Billy Connelly as Fido), "Fido" is a zom-com for the ages. With some rather twisted subplots - for example, the sweet and unsettling feelings that Helen and Fido begin to have for each other - and a poignant commentary on 50's suburbia and the zombie genre, the film manages to bring out the worst (and the best) in its characters while still enabling you to care for them."Fido" is, by far, one of the best dark comedies I've ever seen, one of the best films that I've seen in a long time, and THE best zom-com since the incredible "Shaun of the Dead".</fullReview>

The humor is very sublime and not in your face like most Hollywood comedy junk. I.e. The Nutty Professor. If you have a short attention span and are used to the typical Hollywood stuff you probably wouldn't like this as it is a bit slower paced. I picked it up on Blu-ray and I have to say the image quality is top notch. Probably one of the better looking Blu-rays I've seen so far. The extras were cool too. They deleted quite a bit, but that's probably a good thing as most of the deleted scenes didn't really add anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Due to the invention of a "The Domestication Collar", flesh-eating zombies are brought under control, and become productive members of society; however, they perform menial tasks. The servile dead attend to those living in fenced US 1950s-styled small towns, while untamed zombies roam around in "The Wild Zone". In the town of "Willard", pre-teen K'Sun Ray (as Timmy Robinson) lives with parents Carrie-Anne Moss and Dylan Baker (as Helen and Bill Robinson). Alas, the Robinsons are the only family on their street who do not own a zombie; their new neighbors, the Bottoms, have six. So, to keep up, the Robinsons obtain zombie Billy Connolly (as Fido).Unfortunately, Mr. Connolly's "Domestication Collar" is damaged by an old lady's walker, and he eats her; then, new and hungry zombies infest the town. Meanwhile, young Ray has grown attached to Connolly (the boy and his zombie are like TV's "Timmy and Lassie") and, the Robinson family find it difficult to cooperate with the controlling "Zomcom" authorities. "Fido" doesn't go far enough into its own intriguing "Wild Zone"; but, it is a colorful, stylish, and amusingly satirical addition to zombie film lore. Ray and the cast perform well, individually; with nubile zombie Sonja Bennett (as Tammy) and owner Tim Blake Nelson (as Theopolis) the most memorable pair. Director Andrew Currie and crew, including Rob Gray (design), Jan Kiesser (photography), Don MacDonald (music), and James Willcock (design), deservedly won awards.******* Fido (2006) Andrew Currie ~ K'Sun Ray, Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who says zombies can't be converted into useful members of the community? Certainly not the makers of "Fido," who take us to a never-never-land version of the 1950's where the undead have been turned into butlers and servants for the burgeoning middle class. Timmy Robinson is the all-American boy who becomes emotionally attached to the family's new full-time domestic - a recently resurrected zombie whom Timmy has affectionately dubbed Fido. All of this has been made possible by Zomcom, a big-brother-type organization that has found a way to render the zombies (who were originally brought to "life" by radiation from outer space) manageable and docile - at least most of the time.This twisted, modern-day spin on the TV series "Lassie" - it might easily have been entitled "A Boy and His Zombie" - takes slyly satirical swipes at such pre-'60s concerns as obsessive social conformity (here keeping-up-with-the-Joneses means having more zombie servants than the folks next door), the sterility of suburban life, the corporate control of civic affairs, small town corruption and nuclear family values - all played out in a beautifully designed setting of parti-colored houses and immaculately manicured lawns. The movie doesn't hit the audience over the head with its message nor does it engage in endless hyperbole to generate laughs. Instead, this is a low-keyed, subtle little satire that elicits appreciative chuckles rather than full-bellied guffaws. Much of the humor derives from the incongruity between the placidness of the setting and the cavalier attitude towards death demonstrated by the fine citizens of the community (Life Magazine has been replaced with a periodical entitled Death Magazine). Despite some playfully graphic violence, the movie stays true to the spirit of innocence we generally associate with both the 1950's itself and the cheesy, low-budget horror movies that were so much a part of the pop culture scene of that decade.K'Sun Ray, Carrie-Ann Moss and Dylan Baker are amiable and appealing as the wide-eyed Timmy and his Cleaver-esquire parents (with slightly sinister undertones), while Billy Connolly accomplishes the well nigh impossible task of bringing a great deal of humanity and depth to the role of a resurrected corpse.This is what "Lassie" might have been had Timmy's best friend been afflicted rabies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark comedy oozing with originality........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fido" is to be commended for taking a tired genre, zombies, and turning it into a most original film experience. The early 50s atmosphere is stunning, the acting terrific, and the entire production shows a lot of careful planning. Suddenly the viewer is immersed in a world of beautiful classic cars, "Eisenhower era" dress, art deco furniture, and zombie servants. It would be very easy to dismiss "Fido" as cartoon-like fluff, similar to "Tank Girl", but the two movies are vastly different. "Fido has structure, a script that tells a story, and acting that is superior. Make no mistake, this is a daring black comedy that succeeds where so many others have failed. Highly recommended. - MERK</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The funnest zombie movie around.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fido is a story about more well mannered zombies who have been trained to serve the human race. All falls apart though, when young Timmy's zombie Fido eats the family neighbor. From then on, disaster (well, maybe not disaster, but to some extent, chaos) occurs. Most of the people treat their zombies with fairness, and one such character sleeps with his zombie (very funny part of the movie, if not also very disturbing too). And we find the loving Fido whatever he may do. This is a very funny and unique film, especially for the zombie genre. It is also probably one of the least violent of zombie movies (no negativity in this statement). I very much recommend it to people who are looking for something funny and different. I rate this 8/10. Rated R for zombie related violence</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun dark comedy. How do you call it? Post-zombie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many zombie movie lately that it is just sickening (then dying and undying), but Fido takes it up a notch. The zombies were defeated (they were old style zombies, slow and almost harmless) and domesticated. People own them as slaves or pets or cars, flaunting them as priced possessions. Things are just like in the 30's America, with zombies instead of black people.The movie will probably be funny for a lot of people, although I doubt anyone would really laugh at it. Also, I think women will not enjoy it so much. There is not much gore, but the references to old eras and movies combines with decaying waling corpses is bound to produce that effect.Bottom line: interesting take on the zombie story. A little too satirical for my taste. It could have been a little better with not much effort. But it was original and well acted and directed.</fullReview>

The storyline is not what i expected and I was pleased with the entire thing. Fido is a really cool character and its strange to actually see a really nice zombie, but I think it was good for the plot.

		<fullReview>"Fido" is not as good zombie-comedy as "Shaun of the Dead" but it is a lively and funny story of the world where people don't die normally but transform into flesh-eating and menacing zombies.Luckily there is a corporation, Zomcom, what has managed a possibility to live with zombies in a normal society. They can be servants and for other help, etc. Timmy Robinson (introducing K'Sun Ray) is a lonely boy who finds the most unusual friend of a Zombie Fido (Billy Connolly). Tim's father (Dylan Baker) opposes the zombies as a house-hold item but Tim's understanding mother (beautiful Carrie-Ann Moss) wants to take a zombie also to their family. Problems arise when Fido accidentally kills a old woman and compromises family Robinson's future..."Fido" is a colorful and macabre, a nice little package of black humor. The feeling of the 50's is fun and gives a nostalgic touch to the subject and highlights the dark features. The movie is tagged as a horror-comedy but it is a thoroughbred comedy. There is nothing scary in it. "Fido" is entertaining and enjoyable comedy and includes lots of laughs. Besides a little plot flaws and a little too short film-duration the movie reflects the state of normal society by commenting it trough black humor. Though it would have been great to see more completed character-developing."I'd say I'm a pretty darn good father. My father tried to eat me. I don't remember trying to eat Timmy." -Bill Robinson-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was like no other zombie flick that I have seen in the sense that it combined the "innocent" era of the 1950s and the grim, grittiness of a zombie outbreak. The movie is about a typical nuclear family living in the early 50's after the Zombie Wars. In this scenario the zombies have been modified, via neck bracelet, to be the work force of the entire town thanks to ZomCom. However, when the family's young son accidentally turns off the collar temporality and the zombie kills an old lady; the head of security of ZomCom goes nuts. What this movie does for the zombie genre is provide "zombie sympathy" to the walking dead.Like most zombie movies, the walking dead are perceived as horrible, vicious, man-eating monsters, however, in this movie when the zombies have the bracelet they are almost human; they have hidden emotions of love and the simple pleasures in life they once had. In this case, Fido, the zombie, eyeballs the housewife as though he has feeling for her, he calms down when he has a smoke and with his collar off he still restrains from eating the little boy and the housewife. Evidenced by these actions we can assume in this movie the zombie, Fido, is not the bad guy, but rather a protector and a friend of the family.The movie effectively shows the image of the typical Norman Rockwell house and the stereotypical nuclear family. The yellow house with a garage, white picket fence, the stay at home mom with the Jaclyn Kennedy pearls and father who smokes his pipe and plays golf. The set design is beautiful and really stands out in the movie. They have the vintage cars; the costuming was amazing and even the music fits the time era. The production design wasn't your typical indie or even zombie-horror movie, but rather a great experiment with color and editing. It was an overall outstanding achievement.The acting in this movie wasn't that bad, but it wasn't the good either, but because this movie is supposed to have a calm, innocent feel to it the acting must be the same way. The only real postal-type acting that was good in this movie was by Henry Czerny, who plays Mr. Bottoms the Security Manager of ZomCom. There was great acting by Billy Connolly, who plays Fido and Carrie-Anne Moss, who plays Helen Robinson. However, for the supporting roles the actors and actresses mention are the most notable; Time Blake Nelson, who plays Mr. Theopolis, Sonja Bennett, who plays Tammy and K'Sun Ray, who plays Timmy Robinson. But each of these characters has a somber and calm emotion throughout the movie that I think could have been amped by tenser emotions.There wasn't any real scares in this movie, not even gore except till the end, but this movie makes up for the lack of scares with great zombie characterization and a brilliant achievement in production design. Aside from some okay acting and a radiantly crafted satire piece, this movie was a great "horror" move for anybody who loves zombie comedy movies like Shaun of the Dead. It's not necessarily a parody on zombie flicks, but a new outlook on them. I would recommend this movie to any horror fan, but if your looking for something with a kick and a scare here and there, than you may want to avoid this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever multi-genre satire...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...ranks alongside "Shaun of the Dead" in the "zomedy" scheme of things. Sporting dead-on production design (Rob "Picture Claire" Gray), art direction (Michael N. "Slither" Wong) and costuming (Mary "Halloween 2007" McLeod), "Fido" takes place in a mythical post-zombie holocaust 50s America, in which numerous fenced-in bastions of civilization are protected by ZomCon, the company that devised an electronic collar to pacify zombie appetites, transforming the living dead into domestic servants. One such community is Willard (an obvious nod to "The Twilight Zone" as well as "Night of the Living Dead"), wherein reside the Robinsons (Swiss Family? Here's to you, Mrs.?), a typical household straight from the land of "Leave it to Beaver," etal. Mrs. Robinson (deliciously played by Carrie Ann "The Matrix" Moss) wants to keep up with the Joneses by having a zombie servant of her very own, despite the misgivings of her hubby, Bill (equally well played by Dylan "Happiness" Baker), and her son, Timmy (perfectly realized by newcomer K'Sun Ray). Wives, of course, have their ways and soon enough the Robinsons have a zombie of their very own: Fido (an awesome job by Billy "The Last Samurai" Connolly). It's not until Fido gets loose and chews on an irksome neighbor that things get out of hand, but the trip there and back to "normalcy" is quite amusing. Jan "Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical" Kiesser's cinematography is lush and evocative, as are Don "Rollercoaster" MacDonald's apropos score and the small cavalcade of 50s pop songs that propel "Fido" to its "Lassie, Come Home" resolution. Director/co-writer Andrew Currie really hits the mark in what seems to be an un-jinxed sophomore full-length feature, along with co-writers Robert "Mobile Suit Gundam" Chomiak and Dennis "Blood Ties" Heaton. Kudos to all these gentlemen and everyone else involved; if making movies in Canada means more treats like "Fido," then I'm all for it! The look of the film is immaculately nostalgic, the sound equally so, and the above-reproach ensemble acting and confident direction make "Fido" a laugh-out-loud satire of the first order. And you don't even have to love zombies to enjoy it, although it would undoubtedly help. I praise my local library for carrying this oddball title; I might never have run across it otherwise, since I can't imagine anyone who bought it actually getting rid of it. I know I won't once I find a copy of my own. Not to be missed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first caught this trailer a while ago and have been trying to find a copy for ages. I finally did and watched it tonight. What a great, funny and food for thought film this is. Everyone likens this to Shaun but I thought it was more like a happy Pleasantville. Great script spoken by some fine actors. Not in the least that of Billy Connolly (who by the way is a Scot and not Scotch that is a drink) He has had many roles and has always shone in them but this one he was great as Fido. What a man! What a Zombie. A zombie who died of a heart attack but still fancied a cigarette. The town is 50's kitsch with mums at home and the dads unable to relate to their wives, note the twin beds, who the men think haven't got a thought in their head. So the family gets a Zombie, the mum is cool, the kid picked on and the dad repressed, rather, playing golf than with his kid. One happy nucleur family with the addition of a Zombie that Timmy decides to call Fido. We have a security chief who is a pain in the ... and drunk on power. Who mistreats the zombies and welds his power freely even down to obtaining his new home. Well Fido saves the day several times. Saving Timmy from the bullies and from the biggest bully of all. We have a neighbour who has a zombie girlfriend who was fired from the corporation for just that. We have the head honchos daughter who is a fine shot, we have Zombies doing menial jobs, with a soundtrack from the fifties and the most intense colour cinematography. We have untamed zombies, minus the collar that they are made to wear to keep them docile. And sometimes these collars just don't work. So if you like Zombies and you want to laugh What this. Its a lot of Fido fun</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>50s television has its own starring role!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept of Fido is pure Midnight Movie fun: a Lassie remake, with zombies. But just as Shaun of the Dead is "a Romantic Comedy, with zombies", Fido rises above its purely b-conceptualized beginnings and becomes something of a "good cult classic" well deserving of its ever-rising devoted audience and critical enthusiasm.The real star in Fido is the production design. This is not the 50s as it existed, nor is it the 50s as we wish it existed. It is the 50s that existed in the 50s televisions that existed. In Fido, married couples sleep in separate beds. Idyllic suburban imagery opens up to Leave It to Beaver situation comedy. The only lingering disturbing sense is of the awkwardly sleazy next-door-neighbor, who of course eventually has to come to terms with his relationship and personality as the community sees it and just be himself. The rest is a coming-of-age story as a little boy named Timmy learns about life, love, responsibility, and zombie killing due to the colorful, crazy antics of his pet-in-the-flesh-himself, Fido the zombie.The imagery is immaculate, the world building is logical. Fido is one of those rare gems that manages to find its way into the all of the noise: it is an entertaining, fun-filled family delight, besides having maybe a few things to say about our relationship to the 50s and especially how 50s produced imagery affects our consideration of that era. Notice, however, that there is no film noir concepts, lighting, or design to be seen. The "horror", if it need be considered that, is the tension of "Little Timmy fell down a well, boy?" This movie, despite appearances, is the exact opposite of The Stepford Wives, except that it still considers a bit of post-feminist revisionism. Though that is to say, it's also a great popcorn film, something fun to play during social events, and much more deserving of its attention than some other tongue-in-cheek cult films out there that are all too aware of their camp value to even try to rise above it (not that that's wrong, but sometimes a bit tiresome).--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New turn on the zombie genre - you can see political statements in it, but you don't have to</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A pretty smart little movie!The 50ies idyll was white, and no one would have to worry about the crap jobs - they would all be carried out by a class of zombie slaves. People with no right to vote and no spokesperson. Very truly Republican ideal, I bet! *evilgrin* I myself had to think of US illegal workforce all throughout this movie. Since the movie wasn't much political, I don't see too much of a problem that their misery was represented by Zombies. I don't think that the makers of this movie wanted to compare illegal Latin-Americans or other illegal immigrants as zombies, but they obviously wanted to make you wonder whether it is really OK that we let other people doing the crappy kind of chores, pay them practically nothing and -to top it all- to disrespect them so much. Remembers me of a comment that Sarah Polley made in an interview on her movie "my life without me". She said she took the role in that independent movie because this was the first movie in a long time to not depict people of low income to be all stupid and rotten. I guess that's not only a Hollywood thing (Million Dollar Baby, Waterboy, Flodders), but many do it in US society: they think of poor people as stupid and as if they deserved it (because, if they REALLY wanted to prosper, they could, right so Mr. American Dream?). Just think of the word "white trash". The fact that people actually dare to call others trash because those people live in trailers is outrageous.The twists this movie makes is cool and believable. It really revives the zombie genre. The funny scenes are cruel and dark humor, so if you are not up to that, don't watch it. People die like flies. Just with many other movies - please don't take it too serious. I hardly noticed "Trinity" at first- I just wondered from where I knew the lady in the movie. Carrie Ann Moss is more gorgeous than ever and plays extremely well. And the kid, K'sun Ray, is a sensation!! Weird name :=) But he and his mom and Fido are the heart of this movie. And Dylan Baker plays terrific - the emotion-suppressing father who seems to be the only one who is afraid of Zombies (and who, strangely enough, seems to be the only one to miss people who have been killed by Zombies, namely his father, who he can't talk about). Great cast, cool funny story, wonderfully dark and entertaining. Two thumbs up!</fullReview>

It also wasn't helped by bland characters - not the mockingly plain characters of stuff like The Truman Show or Pleasantville, but just terribly uninteresting - or some pretty bad acting - especially the kid - and the third act turns incredibly corny. The laughs, when they happen, are pretty impressive, and it's got some brilliant ideas, but it never really pans out. Still, it could be worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>~Spoiler~I remember being shocked with Joe Dante's first Masters of Horror entry entitled Homecoming. It was a zombie movie with a very political slant and unlike the fun, lighthearted films Dante is usually associated with. Fido is the zombie movie I thought Joe Dante would make. It's a cheery romp that mixes Dante's Matinée and The Burbs with Romero's zombie lore. Writer/director Andrew Currie has captured that Dante/Spielbergian feel in Fido. He also manages to breathe new life in a sub-genre that has seen tireless repetition. I have to admit, I thought a film about a boy and his pet zombie was going to be a one-trick pony. It was a nice concept, but I didn't feel it lent itself to a feature length film. I'm glad I was wrong. Fido takes place in an alternate version of the 1950's where a zombie war was fought and won thanks in part to a special collar that allows the zombies to be domesticated. That is the world we're introduced to in a fantastic educational video indicative of those famous "duck and cover" programs. Zombies are a modern-day convenience equivalent to a microwave or dishwasher. In order to keep up with the Jones', you must have a zombie. I don't really want to say anymore about the story itself because the fun is in the details. I will say that the cast is outstanding. Carrie-Anne Moss, Tim Blake Nelson, and Henry Czerny are good and Dylan Baker just plain looks like he stepped out of a 1950's movie. But the stars of the show are K'Sun Ray and Billy Connelly as the boy and his zombie. With these two, you are seeing a veteran at the top of his game and a child actor who is pitch-perfect. If you are tired of watching talentless hacks tackle the zombie film and fail, give Fido a chance. Sometimes different is good.</fullReview>

However, being a zombie character, he is limited to a few grunts and expressions. The laugh-out-loud parts come from pretty much everyone and everywhere else, and there are more of them in the first half of the film than the last. I had no idea who else was in this movie and was very surprised and delighted in the cast. It is very well made and the story line is very well planned, but the production crew (director, editor mostly) apparently show much more flair for the shorter segments and scenarios than the longer, tie plot lines up parts. But DO NOT let that keep you from seeing this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely Funny for the Right Kind of Viewer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading some of the negative reviews and some of the positive I think I should make one thing clear. This is NOT a realistic movie. I'm amazed at a reviewer making such statements as, "the zombies would stink" or "they would rot in 6 months". OF COURSE THEY WOULD. This isn't a realistic drama about a real life situation. Anyone who takes one glance at the poster or DVD cover has got to know this is an off the wall zombie goof. I honestly have to ask myself how anyone can look at the box or God forbid read the box and not know to expect dark humor that is certainly stupid at times but funny as ever for the right viewer. My wife won't even consider watching Fido. She hates horror movies and she doesn't get dark humor. If she wrote a review she would give Fido 1 star and call it the worst movie of all time. The thing is that Fido wasn't meant for people who don't enjoy dark humor and are willing to let things be a goof and enjoy it for what it is. Even though I knew I wanted to see Fido I was honestly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. I was skeptical that it would be very cheaply made but to my surprise it was the opposite. Fido has decent gore fx, GREAT acting and GREAT time period sets. It felt like I was really watching a 1950s zombie comedy but with a wonderful color picture. The houses, cars, clothing, etc. all seemed top notch.Bottom line: If you look at the box or know what dark comedy is and enjoy goofy movies like Shaun of the Dead then you will most likely LOVE Fido. However, if you are one who wants to pick a movie a part even when it makes it obvious that it is not meant to be realistic (umm... Zombie Comedy.. hello) then stay far away from Fido. This is pure brainless fun. There was one comment that a reviewer made that I can understand and that was the vibes of romance between a human and zombie seemed a little much but hey.. like I said, you are watching a zombie COMEDY. Anything goes. I thought it was a bit sick but accepted the goof of it and moved on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's amazing that they can make a flesh-eating ghoul with scarred blue skin and a tendency to eat the neighbors into a lovable teddy bear named Fido. Though 'Fido' isn't without its slips, by the end of the movie I really didn't give a crap. I loved Fido.There's no doubt it might just make the cult-classic list, for its lovable characters, cunning wit and brilliant cast. Carrie-Anne Moss still somehow retains her Matrix-y badass persona even as a 50's housewife. There's a hilarious scene where Fido leads her to Timmy, who is in danger of getting eaten alive by a zombie. The dialogue ("What is it, Fido? Is Timmy in trouble?") obviously gave me flashbacks and made me chuckle out loud.What makes 'Fido' funny is how the film makes itself seem so...cute, even though it is occasionally punctuated by a bloody killing. If you pay attention, you'll notice Moss' character, who seemed to be a sterile housewife at first look, now pulls out her handy snub-nosed pistol and shoots a zombie multiple times. Then, she walks back, and the sweet, Lassie-ish music starts up again. I nearly peed my pants laughing. And this isn't just a movie for guys. Women will probably outright adore Billy Connelly's Fido, and identify with Moss' character, who deals with her whiny husband daily. The film gets good when she starts to rebel. I picked this one up from Blockbuster, and I'm sure I'll buy it sometime soon. This is one to add to your collection.9 rotting zombies out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slice of the Afterlife...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's ironic (and I've mentioned it before, but I have no problem with repeating myself) that the parodies of fright films are often far better, in terms of production values, than the films they spoof. FIDO captures the look and feel of '50s complacency better than most any period drama set in the same era. Director Currie has a good eye (perhaps two) and a sure hand; his players, from Billy Connelly as the direct lineal descendant of George Romero's Bub in DAY OF THE DEAD to Dylan Baker as the straight-laced, William H. Macy father figure (he's little more than that, is literally unable to communicate with his post-nuclear family members) to Carrie-Ann Moss as Mrs. Robinson and Tim Nelson (from OH, BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?) as the zombie-lovin' Theopolis, all shine (or "shine it on," as it were). "You have to get over having feelings," the Father tells the Son: "Being alive is what counts." FIDO, with its domesticated dead, could very well be a follow-up to Romero's LAND OF THE DEAD without so much as a breaking of stride. Not as politically savvy, perhaps, but it does manage to capture the dynamics of the post-nuclear, retro '50s family of today very well, indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great idea, so-so results</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a 1950's style America, humanity has survived the zombie apocalypse, which happened much as it did in Romero's Night of the Living Dead, and is now living safe inside fenced-in safe zones. There is an invention, a collar of some sort, that is able to quell the zombies' hunger for human flesh. Now they are used as servants, or, in some cases, pets. Fido is the Lassie of zombies. He even belongs to a boy named Timmy. Unfortunately, as tame as the zombies are, the collars don't always work so well. Timmy and Fido get into trouble when the collar gets turned off, and zombie mayhem begins. The concept is gold, but I don't think co-writer/director Andrew Currie produces anything that interesting. His film-making is often sloppy. It sometimes feels like he spent all his budget on some vintage autos and an unnecessary helicopter shot. The zombie makeup looks terrible, which is always distracting. And the zombie actors are generally awful, probably on account of Currie's direction. They all seem too expressive in their faces and eyes. There are a lot of interesting aspects of this post-apocalyptic society, but the world and its rules are never adequately explained. To boot, it's difficult to understand some of the backstories, especially that of the father (played by Dylan Baker). I'd still give a slight recommendation, just because the idea is so fantastic. And it's an amusing picture, even if it disappoints.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserving of an instant cult classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Outragiously funny. The site is Willard, small town America in a story book world in the 1950s. Everybody is on a first name bases. Neigbors know their neighbors plus the rotting zombies that deliver the milk, deliver the mail and mow the lawn. At some time the world passed through a dust cloud that caused the dead to rise again with urgent desire to taste human flesh. A company known as Zomcon have defeated the zombies and developed a way to domesticate them. Timmy Robinson's(K'Sun Ray)mom(Carrie-Anne Moss)does not want to be the only housewife on her block not to have a zombie doing chores about the house. Timmy thinks of him as his new best friend and names him Fido. When Fido(Billy Connolly)eats the next door granny, this idyllic community again deals with zombie-phobia. Sure there is zombie violence and gore, but in a comic book way, thus the rating PG-13. The cast also includes: Dylan Baker, Doug Abrahams, Tim Blake Nelson, Henry Czemy and Alexia Fast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Canadian filmmakers fascination with necrophilia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a joke that a standard Canadian film is a "quirky" story that involves despair, odd humor, incest, bestiality or necrophilia. This movie goes for the last category.I really don't see other countries that have such a fascination with the subject matter and get mainstream government funding for it. I suspect that one of the appeals of funding a a film like this is that it pokes fun at US culture. The irony is that in the 1950s Canadians were watching the same movies and TV shows. Our own shows and movies were awful or non existent. I wish Canada would expand its horizons and try making horror, fantasy and science fiction films that aren't meant to be quirky satires. There ARE other stories out there. New Zealand and Australia are able to do it--I don't see why Canada can't. The only exception seems to be when one half of the film-making team(writer or director) comes from another country. The case with Rituals, Terror Train etc.PS A poster from Finland said people who prefer non human animals to other humans as company suffer from a pathology similar to the idea in this film that humans would take zombies as pets and servants. I pity someone who thinks that there is a link between a fondness for living species and necrophilia. Human nature is a scary thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>doesn't work for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love a good zombie film, dawn of the dead, night of the living dead, day of the dead etc. These movies are great because they're horror films and you are scared of seeing the Zombies eating people and running amok. Shaun of the Dead worked great as well as even though it was part-comedy, you could at least identify with the realism in it and there was some genuine humor amongst all the deaths. Fido is a great idea and to some people, I can see why they think its a great film but this just didn't cut it for me. You do see zombies eating people but its all sanitised and done so quaintly in the 50's setting that its hard to really know what sort of film you're watching. I realise this was the directors intention to throw in the whole clean living, keeping up with the Jones's post war 1950's boom era but for me its completely the wrong place to put a zombie film in. Its like watching "harry and the hendersons", its certainly not horror and its not comedy either. Its interesting to see a civilised society where zombies can live with humans as their slaves/pets/workers but its not enough to make a 90 minute film out of it. Kudos to the director and writer for trying something novel and certainly very different but for me personally, the movie falls flat on its face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was at the NSI Film Festival in saw it play there. I thought that Fido was the best feature film playing there. I found it to be funny from start to finish. I liked the fact that they had Night of the Living dead in the film and also I liked that they used the same name Willard for the town just like in NotLD. The acting was great from Billy, Carrie and Tim. Also the fact that they based it in the 50's made it even funnier because of how the people from that time era acted. The other best part of this movie is that the whole film has that Disney feel to it. That might be because as they were writing it they watched a lot of Disney films. Andrew is going places and I cant wait to see his next movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth the time and money, lots of fun, delivers what it promises.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm really impressed by Fido. It's funny, satirical, and even delightful at times. The references to "Lassie" fame are funny but respectful. The characters are intelligent when they need to be and tweaked just enough that they don't have to reach for laughs. The production value allows the audience to buy into the camp style even though it's in the spirit of satire. I don't think there is a single weak performance in the whole cast. K'Sun Ray delivers a performance that rivals that of the adults in the picture. Billy Connelly manages to be funny without even saying a word. Last, but not least, it's a breath of fresh air to see Carrie-Anne Moss in a role so alien to Trinity. It does have some gore and tense periods; but it's more about comedy than suspense or horror. I'd definitely see it again, which isn't something I do a whole lot. I give it a 10 because even though it didn't change my life, it did everything it claimed it would; and all with some panache. Every moment was entertaining.</fullReview>

I love the actor playing the lead zombie. He was so good, and of course, I love Trinity from The Matrix. She always knocks it out of the park.If you thought zombie movies were dead, think again. They keep finding new ways to make them interesting, and this one doesn't disappoint. The music was well done too and the pacing was fantastic. I was never bored at all despite how many movies I watch a day. I think Fido will have to go on my to-watch list for every Halloween. It's going to be a tradition in my family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a zombie satirical, but it doesn't necessarily follow the same stereotypical pattern of a zombie film - instead it parodies it with a style reminiscent of Tim Burton (degrees of fantasy and sci-fi) in a very well made 1950s setting.What I liked about this movie was it maintained its theme and its mood through out, unlike films that take unexpected turns (for the worst!) The movie was definitely made by a romantic, and with twists of irony, maintains that fluffy 50s surrealism surrounded by the most absurd of morbid circumstances!The movie could have been explored further and to deeper levels, but it chooses to play itself out closer to its satirical nature; it left the story simple, but still very effective and satisfying in its duration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Endearing if not entirely satisfying zombie effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After surviving the zombie apocalypse, a small family in the suburbs receives a zombie helper who begins bonding with their troubled son and forces them to question their commitment to it when a series of deaths are blamed on the creature.Overall this one was quite a fine if troubling effort. One of the few good points here is the film's overall premise, which is one of the most creative and original ideas used here to contain zombies and their fate here, making an ingenious nature. Managing to turn the creatures into domesticated slaves and treated much like a household pet, forced into doing chores and treated like members of the family is really unique and logical way of dealing with the creatures. Not only that, there's plenty of enjoyable about the manner of treatment brought to ensure this with some rather well-thought-out explanations used to keep that a cohesive part of the story and really grounds this one quite nicely. The action here isn't all that bad either as the fact that the zombies are still threats makes the rampaging zombie through the neighborhood taking out the different townsfolk and the later scene of the team taking out the reanimated creatures in the park and the encounter with the bullies out in the wilderness come off nicely, through the big swarming battle at the compound here makes for some fun times as there's a lot of the action with the swarming creatures getting free, the panic of the workers and the rather great gore here to make for a great time. These here are enough to hold this up against the one true flaw with this one. The main flaw here is the fact that for nearly two-thirds of the running time there's no horror here, with the domestication taking nearly everything scary away from zombies by design being the biggest hurdle here as instead this is replaced with the drama about the kid growing up being bulled and bonding in a friendly manner, the father overcoming his fear of the zombies and the slight romance that occurs between the two which doesn't come close to providing this with any kinds of scares and keeps this one as a drama throughout this. Though it's enjoyable, there's little of this that becomes centered around horror scenes which is really the only thing wrong here even though it's a pretty big issue.Rated R: Graphic Violence and children-in-jeopardy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fido (2006): Dir: Andrew Currie / Cast: Billy Connolly, Carrie-Anne Moss, Dylan Baker, Tim Blake Nelson, K'Sun Ray: Satire of living dead horror films that continues in the gross decaying delights of zombie fans. Zombies are now controlled thanks to an electronic collar however it is obvious that this tactic will backfire. Twisted worldview that suggests sexual relations between human and dead. Director Andrew Currie has fun with the concept of pet zombies but the strongest aspect is its simple 1950's visual style. Billy Connolly plays Fido the friendliest zombie. He is collared but will be blamed for some tragic incidents involving the recently deceased. The whole idea of Fido being a husband or caregiver is corrupt on itself. Carrie-Anne Moss and Dylan Baker are its human owners but the roles are flat. Baker has zombie phobia after being part of the zombie wars. The result of this relationship is sad and another low. Tim Blake Nelson plays a neighbor whose relationship with a female zombie leaves much to be desired. K'Sun Ray plays their son who forms a bond with the zombie and views it more as a pet. The makeup and visual elements are superb but the humour is often sickening. The theme of emotion and feeling play strong in this very strange setting where perhaps the family pet should be regenerated back to the simple dog and cat. Score: 5 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Enjoyable Lighthearted Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot : ******* 7/10The film opens with a mock up of the old 1950s style public service announcements, similar to those dealing with topics such as surviving a nuclear war, proper gender roles, or bicycle safety. This particular P.S.A. deals with zombies, giving the viewer details about this post- apocalyptic world, the rules and laws that govern the roles of the zombies within this fantastical society and facts about the primary dealer of zombies, Zomcon. As the viewer leaves this black and white narration, the film opens onto a beautifully colored world and viewers are introduced to the Robinson family. It's revealed that the Robinson's are the only family in the town of Willard without any domesticated zombies and this fact seems to be a bone of contention between Bill (Dylan Baker) and Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss) Robinson, parents to young Timmy (Kesun Loder). The story is driven forward, when Jonathan Bottoms (Henry Czerny), Zomcon's new head of security, moves into the neighborhood, leaving Helen Robinson feeling compelled to buy a zombie in an effort to impress their new neighbor. To the dismay of his father, Young Timmy quickly befriends this new addition, naming him Fido, and treats this zombie much like a pet. Events spin out of control, when Fido (Billy Connolly) is accused of zombie attacks, resulting in a small band of re-animated zombies wreaking havoc on the town. The insurgence of zombies are ultimately hunted down by Zomcon forces, but, unfortunately, this is only the beginning of the trouble for Timmy and Fido. The incident provides Mr. Bottoms with the perfect opportunity to confiscate the lovable Fido and Timmy soon learns that, while his family had been told Fido had been destroyed for his apparent crimes, he was, in truth, being held at Zomcon with plans to reassign him with another family. This leads to a final confrontation between Bill Robinson and Jonathan Bottoms with Timmy caught in the middle. Themes : ******** 8/10Although Fido deals with two of life's most serious issues, it manages to do so in a fun and entertaining way. First, and most obviously, we are confronted with the issue of slavery, servitude and exploitation. We see these zombies domesticated and largely treated as pets, or, as in the case of the neighborhood playboy Mr. Theopolis (Tim Blake Nelson), as love slaves. Most of the people of Willard, however, treat the enslaved zombies as property, looking down upon them with disgust, ridicule, and contempt. Secondly, somewhat more subtly, we see a society obsessed with death, possibly mirroring the fear that has plagued our own society in recent years. When we hear Bill Robinson remark that he is saving up for his son's funeral fund, as opposed to the college funds most of us establish for our children, we begin to see just how preoccupied they have become with the subject of death and the undead. We see the internal struggle of the characters with their own mortality, as the decision of whether or not to allow their bodies final rest is debated and contemplated. Finally, this theme of a death obsessed culture is driven home when we see Bill Robinson reading a magazine, which has a cover resembling Life magazine but, instead, is entitled Death.Conflict: ****** 6/10Fido presents the viewer with several points of conflict throughout the film. First, we are faced with the internal conflict of the characters, each of them trying to determine whether it is better to pursue a funeral, which will guarantee a final rest, or to return as a zombie, so that their loved ones can continue to have them in their lives. Is this conflict ever resolved? No, but, by the time the end credits roll, the viewer feels that the Robinsons at least have learned better how to deal with death and with the living. The primary conflict grows out of a combination of Mr. Bottoms intrusive presence in the neighborhood and the bond Timmy has formed with his beloved Fido. The relationship between Fido and Timmy alarms the officious Mr. Bottoms and, as situations spiral out of control, he sees an opportunity to be rid of Timmy, as well as Fido. It is finally in this final confrontation that we see another conflict resolved, a struggle between an often absent father and his approval-seeking son, as Bill Robinson comes to Timmy's rescue.Overall: ******* 7.5/10Fido is a fun, enjoyable film with minimal gore, an easily followed story, and a likable cast. From the very moment of the opening sequence, throughout the entire film and until the end credits roll, director Andrew Currie succeeds in transporting the audience to a simpler time when zombies knew their place was in the service of the living. In Fido, we can escape to a time (and even an alternate reality) where the living have trained the undead to perform our most menial tasks for us with few accommodations. It is only when Timmy, feeling bullied and alone, befriends the family's first zombie servant that we begin to see the flaws in this system and it is this upsetting of the status quo that propels the story into a humorous jaunt of suburban life and zombies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Night of the Living Dead meets Pleasantville. Fido will rip your heart out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fido is one of those satire boy and his pet comedy that makes you wonder if the director writer Andrew Currie just watch an old Lassie episode, and just rewrote the part of the dog with the word 'zombie'. The film takes place in a 1950s-esque alternate universe where the Zombie War just ended. People continue to live normal lives in fenced in communities with the help of a governing Zomcon corporation. Due to the small population, many of the jobs have been taken over by collar control zombies that Zomcon allow its citizens to have. The mock documentary kind-of 50s newsreel narration that explains the story is neat. Tim (K'Sun Ray) dreams of owning a zombie. He finds a pet in Fido (Billy Connelly) which his mother Helen Robinson (Carrie-Anne Moss) buys in spite of her husband Bill's (Dylan Baker) a zombie phobia, as Bill has had bad experiences with zombies having been a veteran of the Zombie Wars. Billy Connelly is just awesome in the role of Fido as he pull being a cute zombie off. Undoubtedly, the collar fatal-flaw for Timmy's Pet Fido breaks free and bite an old lady. Soon the whole town has a small outbreak popping everywhere and Timmy and Fido has to find a way to stop it. Fido is an exercise in insanity, borrowing from Romero's original intended satire from his first zombie films which spoke of the communism red scare and the idea of a new generation eating the previous one. I think the film is trying to mock what people view is the Golden Age of idealized suburban life by saying beyond its white fences, there is a ugly truth to it. It was a decade of death as well with the Korean War and Cold War fears. The 1950's element is done fantastically well, from the dialogue to the cinematic clichés, but its faults to meet the demand in comedy. Its comedy is a hit and miss. One such miss is its idea of having Necrophilia as a certain theme throughout the film. There is a character name Mr. Theopolis (Tim Blake Nelson) who use zombies as mistresses. Theopolis is a name spell to mean Lover of God or Friend of God, very loosely close to the Greek word Theophilus. The filmmakers might be trying to say that theistic religions are invariably obsessed with death. Who knows, but it's not only Mr. Theopolis as Helen also has a thing for Fido. Helen even says, she wishes she had met him before she got married and when he was still alive. Leave it to Carrie's beaver wanting things. While Carrie Anne Moss is hot, I don't want to think of Fido and her hooking up. Eww. Necrophilia is taboo for a reason and it's rarely funny. Hints why it fail to be funny in this movie. It sometimes feels like the director spent his entire budget on some vintage autos and an unnecessary helicopter shots as the movie fail in the box-office. It was straight to DVD release of Fido albeit with enough gore to gain it an R-rating in the US. Fido doesn't do anything, so it's not a comedy. It's not scary, so it's not a horror either. What is it? It's a nonstop fan boy homage to older, and meaningful zombie flicks. All that said, the cinematography, set design, colors and actors are all great. Fido is a wonderfully original and morbid take on the idea of a boy and his pet. For zombie movie fans looking for something different and offbeat, give Fido a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's That Boy? Zombies Are Chasing Timmy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every couple of years now, it seems a zombie comedy (or zomedy) makes it into theaters. A few years ago, it was ZOMBIELAND. Before this movie, SHAUN OF THE DEAD made its appearance. Usually zomedies are characterized by having a mix of chills and chuckles. FIDO focuses more on the chuckles and less on the chills, though it has a fair amount near the end. Set in a small community known as Willard (thanks for the nod) during the 1950s, we are introduced to the state of the world. A mysterious radiation caused all the dead to rise, there was a war, blah blah blah. Taking the same basic story from NOTLD, the filmmakers expand on it by supposing that we won the war against the undead, sorta. Zombies are still around. However, a brilliant scientist found a way to tame the undead by placing collars around their necks. Zom-Con is formed. As the black and white movie fades out, we are introduced (in color) to a classroom. At the back sits Timmy (who bears an uncanny resemblance to a young Macaulay Culkin) who's a lonely, thoughtful boy. The school curriculum now includes gun training and zombie hunting skills. In the neighborhood, we see zombies delivering milk and papers, watering the lawn and walking the dog. Practically everyone has a zombie. Everyone, that is, except Timmy's family. Timmy's father has a phobia of the living dead (which everyone else thinks is weird) but that doesn't stop Timmy's mother from revealing the big surprise one evening at dinner. To the father's growing unease, a 6-foot tall zombie is serving the roast. From that point forward, it's a standard boy and his zombie tale. Boy befriends zombie (calling him Fido). Zombie's collar malfunctions and he eats a curmudgeonly old neighbor. Before long, other zombies start cropping up. The Zom-Con security squad is called in. Zom-Con suspects Fido. There is an overall sense of wonder in this alternate 50s reality. Everything seems almost too cute at times. The entire cast gives outstanding performances. Once again, I must give kudos to the filmmakers for letting the kids act like kids. Dylan Baker as the father gives his least-creepy performance. For most creepy, see him in HAPPINESS. He's mainly a bumbling idiot, but he means well and he does love his family despite his hang-ups. Carrie-Anne Moss as the mother gives a subdued performance that almost allows her to disappear into the role. The real star of the movie is (of course) Billy Connolly as Fido. Throughout the course of the film, it shows that zombies had lives and thoughts and feelings before they turned. And even after turning, sometimes old habits die hard. Apart from some bloody zombie violence, this movie could be viewed as a (bitterly) sweet family movie. There is no profanity, or any other things that one normally finds in modern family movies (shame really that we've sunk so low.) Naturally, it's making a statement about zombie movies and the mentality of the 50s, but the best way to enjoy it is as a zomedy with a heart. If ever I planned to "go zombie" this would be the movie to convince me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad film, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fido is by no means a bad film, but it has a few basic problems that make it hard to me to give it a rating higher than 6.- One problem is that this film doesn't fit in any genre. While for this works to the advantage of some films as it makes them unique, it is a disadvantage for "Fido". The concept is too goofy to be considered a serious movie, the humor is too mild to generate actual laughter (at least in my case) and the gore is too mild and the whole "Pleasantville" setting is too bright and shiny to appeal to zombie movie fans while the gore and zombies themselves will upset many art house film fans. etc. Basically, the film deviates too far from any genre it is inspired by and it's not good enough in either of its deviations for this to actually work in its advantage.- As a satire of suburban sensibilities and the way people treat creatures of a different species, ethnic group or class, Fido never really succeeds in making a point. Unlike satires like "How to Get Rid of the Others", "Idiocracy" or "Dr Stranglove" the message is too subtle to really have an impact on the viewer and many people probably won't even understand what message this film actually holds.- Being too shallow for a satire and not goofy enough for a story a la "Monty Python", "Brain dead", "Shaun of the Dead" or "Hot Fuzz" the humor in Fido never really worked for me and considering this is supposed to be a funny movie that's a major drawback.So why does it still deserve a 6? The visuals are more than decent and the concept is one of the most original concepts I've seen in a film for quite a while. That made it still a film far more worth watching than any Michael Bay crap. It's just too bad they didn't get more out of the concept than they did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new take on the zombie genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fido is a great spoof of a 'boy + dog' 1950s heart-warmer. Pretty much take one of these movies and replace dogs with zombies, and you get Fido.This movie is incredibly well done and entertaining. It's innocent and quirky, splashed with bits of chaos and sheer terror. The zombie jokes are flawless and witty. I feel bad for passing this up @ the local rental place for a year.The fact that Fido is a zombie doesn't really change the emotional relationship between him and the boy. In my opinion, it strengthens their relationship. Fido rips an old woman to shreds, and the boy takes him home and hoses him off in the garage. Upon removing Fido's shirt, he notices a scar right down the center of his ribcage. "You died of a heart attack... so did my grandpa!" The kid tells Fido. By the way, Fido is usually a raging flesh-hungry monster when he doesn't have his control collar. The fact that his collar malfunctions off and on throughout the movie provides a good amount of zany zombie shenanigans. Fido is loyal to his family and loves them... TO DEATH. (Sorry, just had to do that) He's a sharp contrast to the boy's real father, who serves as sort of an antagonist to the film. He hates zombies, and is opposed to having one as his pet - though it's now the normal thing to do. (Keeping up with the Johnsons) The depiction of a society functioning in a time of zombie chaos is interesting to say the least. Elementary school kids learn how to use various firearms. They walk in line singing happy songs like "Not in the chest, shoot them in the head!" The society itself contained and controlled by a corporation who deals in industrializing the zombie threat. They maintain the security fences around the towns, they take old people away once their health declines (if they die without supervision, they're a security threat. Everyone who dies rises again), they even invent this nifty collar I mentioned before that goes around a zombie's neck - and when it's activated, the zombie becomes non-aggressive and is able to do simple tasks.I think I'm giving away too much, I hope you saw the spoiler warning. I'm just excited that I finally got to see this movie... and that it was all I hoped it to be! Don't be afraid to check it out. There's some blood and guts, but hey... it's a zombie movie :) I want a pet zombie!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Refresthing B-effort for the genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very pleasant surprise I found on Hbo on very late schedule. This is a brave independent movie that deals with a zombie as pet and a young boy who doesn't get enough attention from his parents.The political context is pretty clear and the way that zombies are treated like beasts and pets gives you a message...The gore is pretty brutal but at the same time amusing. You can't get enough of a zombie that disposes to have an old woman as a snack!The production values are great and refreshing for the genre. The art direction is perfect and it really gives you a 50's feeling after a nuclear war or something; everything's just wacky. The cinematography is colorful and makes the film candy for the eye.The acting is also pretty good, specially by indie expert and favorite Carrie Anne Moss who gets sexier with time. I love her face and her legs.This is overall a fun indie effort that should please fans of b-cinema. Remember, it has also a message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lassie Meets Pleasantville Meets The Robinsons Meets Zombies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We've all heard the saying, "You have to see it to believe it." And that statement was never truer when talking about FIDO, a zomcom (zombie comedy) of the highest order. Often referred to as the "Pleasantville of Zombie films", Fido certainly has that time-gone-by feel and look to it, but gives us some comedic talent from surprising locations.Scottish-born comedian Billy Connolly (THE BOONDOCK SAINTS) stars as Fido. Normally a pretty loud and brash actor/comedian, here Connolly has zero lines (unless you consider occasional moans and groans lines) as the newly installed zombie in the Robinson household. Installed? you ask. Yes, installed. Post-zombie wars, the world now uses the undead staggerers for menial tasks thanks to a new control collar placed around each zombie that makes them docile and family friendly. This all takes place circa 1950s America, too, a time when Lassie and other innocent shows began littering TV stations across the nation.Not surprisingly, since we're talking Lassie, the young son of the Robinson house is named, yep, Timmy. Timmy is played by relative newcomer K'Sun Ray who is more familiar to television audiences as Jason in the series SMITH. But here the young actor shows his comedic muscle by taking 'Lil' Timmy' and making him Fido's best friend. Fido, in turn, becomes Timmy's best friend also. The two form a boy-and-his-dog relationship that transcends the Lassie version and takes it to a hysterically funny level ("What's wrong, boy? Is someone in trouble?") More surprising than young K'Sun Ray, though, was Carrie-Ann Moss (the MATRIX trilogy) as Timmy's mother Helen Robinson. Stuck in an emotionless relationship with husband Bill (Dylan Baker, ACROSS THE UNIVERSE), Helen finds solace with her son and a strange awakening to her feminine needs with Fido. It's creepy, sappy, nostalgic and terribly funny all at once.There is so much going on in the film that it's tough to cover all of it with one simple review, so I'm not even gonna try. But I will say that sex, sexual repression, death and funerals, zombie-paranoia, big business, big government, and plays on morality are all interspersed throughout Fido.If you're a fan of SHAUN OF THE DEAD, you owe it to yourself to see this. Not only is Fido a great indie film, it is a great film in its own right. Be prepared to laugh yourself silly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Perfect Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a night when everyone else was going ape over Harry Potter and the All-Star game, I was sitting in a near empty movie theater enjoying the perfect flick - stunning mid-century Modern decor and fashions, gorgeous old school Technicolor cinematography, wicked irony, witty dialogue, zombies, gore, cool cars, the works. I loved the opening newsreel relating the story of the Great Zombie War and its aftermath, when a major corporation, Zomcom, created idyllic suburban oases for the living amid the "dead zones" populated by ravenous undead, "taming" many of them via electronic devices into useful house servants, gardeners etc. I loved the swingin' neighbor with the hot zombie chick girl-slave. I loved the "Lassie"-like stuff with the kid and his pet zombie roaming the beautiful countryside, just before all hell breaks loose. I loved the cornball 50s music playing over zombie carnage. I loved the vibrant colors. I loved all of it. It's funnier than "Shaun of the Dead," "Bubba Ho-Tep" and certainly anything starring Will Ferrell, and at least as funny as "Dead Alive." It mixes elements of Romero's "Day of the Dead" and "Land of the Dead" seamlessly with 50s Sirk melodramas like "All That Heaven Allows" and "Magnificent Obsession" plus elements of "Leave It To Beaver." I laughed all the way through it, but then maybe it just happens to hit both my sick sense of humor and retro-aesthetic sensibilities square in the bullseye. IMO sheer genius and an instant cult classic. If I was ever going to make a zombie movie, this would be it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having recently finished Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, I can really appreciate this film. It is that idyllic paradise of the 50s, where everything was so neat and tidy and clean, and here we insert disgusting zombies. How does a mom keep up appearances when things like blood interfere? It even had a scene reminiscent of Lassie, where little Timmy (K'Sun Ray) was in danger and his zombie (Billy Connolly) went to fetch his mother (Carrie-Anne Moss).One could read into this film a criticism of 50s communist scares, or racial prejudice. There was certainly an undercurrent of sexual tension present.Or, one could just sit back and enjoy a funny satire on life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but Delightfully Bizarre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill Robinson: Now, I know you're not supposed to have a hand gun until you're twelve... but it can come in real handy.I think I love the concept of 'Fido' far more than the actual movie. How original is it to have an alternate reality set in 1950s Leave it To Beaver Era in a perfect little neighborhood where all of the inhabitants are devastated after the great zombie wars of the 1930s. That's right, instead of WWII this reality faced a military conflict with flesh-hungry corpses revived from the dead. Now everything is quarantined, and a company called 'Zomcom' controls basically everything. 'Zomcom' is a company known for converting and brain-washing zombies with electronic collars to become servants.After the first five minutes of FIDO my hopes were set sky high but by the end I was sorely disappointed. 'Fido' is a good film and a great film in it's genre, but there is so much that could have been done with this groundbreaking and shockingly innovative plot that the final result is almost appalling.The performances are are solid. Carrie Anne-Moss is excellently creepy as the mother, K'Sun Ray is great as little Timmy, Dylan Baker, best known for his outstanding and haunting portrayal of a conflicted pedophile serial-rapist in Todd Solondz's 'Happiness', is solid here in the stereotypical uptight white male role he is always type-casted in. The real stand-out is Billy Connolly, who with essentially no dialogue is side-split-tingly funny with his priceless facial expressions as the zombie we all cheer for, Fido. It's also nice to see the always reliable Tim Blake Nelson here as Mr. Theopolis, the neighborhood's Quagmire who uses his zombie as a sex slave. The writing is solid on the ideas scale, but the screenplay gets tedious and slow for a big chunk in the middle of the film. Andrew Currie's directing is solid for the most part, but nothing special.All in all, I highly recommend Fido to any fan of the horror/comedy genre and only lightly recommend it to the rest of you. It's a good film, but it could have been so much better. Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why was this film rated R?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the life of me, why did this film receive an R rating?! While it IS about flesh-eating zombies, believe it or not, it's actually a pretty good family-friendly film--at least if your kids are age 10 and older. Unlike the traditional zombie films, this one has an excellent sense of humor as well as a traditional values--albeit a bit twisted! The language isn't a serious problem, there is no nudity and the film style is definitely geared towards kids (much like the old TV show "Eerie, Indiana")--yet some knucklehead slapped an R rating one it! Believe me, most kids have seen worse violence than this and it just seems silly to make audiences think this is an adults only film.The story is set in a parallel-type world. While the fashions, cars and mores appear circa 1953, in this bizarro world there has been a fierce recent zombie plague that resulted in the "zombie war" and massive changes in everyday life. At school, kids are trained in armed combat and there's a cute scene late in the film where the father gives his son a handgun and tells him to keep it in his backpack "just in case"! As for life outside of school, it's pretty weird as well, as people now have learned that zombies AREN'T such a bad thing! Heck, using shock collars and training, they can be made into slaves who can do your housework, clean streets, deliver milk or, in the case of a really sick guy, be your "special friend".This film deals with one particular family that finally buys their first zombie slave (played by Billy Connally). Mom is thrilled and her son slowly becomes the zombie's friend. Dad, on the other hand, isn't convinced--as he was forced years early to kill his own zombie father and he hasn't yet gotten over this!! Funny, irreverent and unique--this film needs to be seen by a much wider audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not often that you see a horror-comedy flick that also functions as a social satire, but Andrew Currie's "Fido" is just that. It portrays 1950s suburban America in the years after the "zombie wars". The humans proved victorious in these wars thanks to a corporation called Zomcom, which invented collars to hang around the zombies' necks to control them. Zombie servants are thus the new fad.Anyway, little Timmy Robinson (Billy Connolly) is the son in the one family that doesn't have a zombie. But when mom Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss) buys one - whom Timmy names Fido - dad Bill (Dylan Baker) isn't sure what to think...especially after Timmy accidentally lets the zombie kill the obnoxious old woman on the block! I figure that they must have had fun making this movie. Aside from some of the stuff that the zombies do people - or that the people do to other people - just how they make a point of ripping at the image of a wholesome, all-white America. How Helen complains about not having a zombie servant must have mirrored how every family in 1950s suburban America wanted a TV, or whatever the newest appliance/fad was. But beyond that, you have to observe how many of the humans - namely John Bottoms (Henry Czerny) - are just about the vilest individuals, while many of the zombies have nary a mean bone in their bodies.Anyway, this is just a hilarious movie. I guarantee that you won't find it a bit boring. So check it out. And if I may say so, I wouldn't mind having a zombie like Tammy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could almost be a sequel to 'Shaun of the Dead'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're a zombie-movie fan, you've probably seen the brilliant 'Shaun of the Dead' (and if you haven't ? stop reading and watch it now!). On the off chance you haven't caught it yet, I won't go into how it ends, but if you know, you could almost look at 'Fido' as a semi-sequel. Okay, not really, but in principal it's like a continuation.In Fido's world, we appear to still be living in 1950s America. We're never told we are, but everyone still dresses and behaves like they are (plus there isn't an iphone or Twitter account in sight). And, at the beginning of the film, we're treated to some brief (but very funny) black and white newsreel footage informing us that, ten years after the 'zombie wars,' we're now living in a safe society, happily using the undead as servants (courtesy of collars which control their flesh-eating impulses).It's almost an ideal world. You never have to do your own laundry again, thanks to a kindly rotting corpse who will do it all for you (assuming you don't mind your laundry slightly torn and hideously unfolded). If truth be told, the undead, while willing/forced to comply, they aren't that good yet at the tasks they've been assigned.And then we're introduced to the Robinsons ? the perfect 'nuclear' American family, living a perfect life ? zombie free. However, pressure on society dictates that every good house needs its own undead butler, therefore they bow to public pressure and purchase the zombiefied form of Billy Connolly. What follows is a tale of friendship between the family (or most of them) and their 'pet zombie' who little Timmy Robinson christens 'Fido.' Of course no relationship ever runs smoothly and it's never easy when one party has to wear a collar that prevents him from tearing innocent old ladies apart every time the collar fails.Basically, if you're a zombie fan, not only should you have watched 'Shaun of the Dead,' but you're also probably aware of George Romero's classic 'Dawn of the Dead.' Apart from the cool action sequences, a lot of people admired the social satire he wove in, commenting on a consumer society. Well, if you're in the mood for more than just gore (of which Fido also delivers on), you may enjoy the numerous swipes the film takes at peer pressure, people's frailties about not being good enough and even some touching moments (partially played out by a character that can only groan).I read online that Billy Connolly watched to play the titular role because he was intrigued by the opportunity to portray a sympathetic character with only expressions and movements, i.e. no dialogue. I'm not normally a fan of Billy's acting (I thought he should have stuck to stand-up comedy!), but here he hits every note, as does every one of the cast. A fair proportion of the film is taken up with children and their relationships and it's easy to hate child actors, but here their presence never detracts from the story.What you have here is a refreshing take on a (currently overused) genre with gore, heart and, above all, enough laughs to put it up there with the great 'Shaun.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious Outlook on the 1950's (With Zombies!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fido is a satire for the way society was in the 1950's, from putting out government PSA educational films about new technologies every day to the way adults covered things up (and kids knew it). What makes Fido stand out? Well, the earth in this film isn't your typical 1950's society of poodle skirt wearing, jukebox playing geeks. This film portrays a fictional version of the 1950's where radiation has turned the dead into zombies, leaving "zombie zones" fenced off from the safe living areas and the dead having to be created or decapitated to prevent infection. All this is done by a large corporation, ZomCon.Bill and Helen are a typical 1950's couple; ditz mom (feminist movement wasn't around yet) and breadwinner, if not incredibly nerdy, father. They have a son named Timmy. Timmy has a serious crush on the daughter of Zomcon's president, Cindy Bottoms.One day, much to Bill's disgust and horror, Helen purchases a zombie "pet" to do household chores, as this is the latest trend in upper-class society. The family secret is that Bill saw his father murdered by one of these zombies, and he automatically hates the zombie, enjoying electrocuting it, kicking it, etc. which Timmy finds incredibly cruel. He, contrary to popular belief, thinks the zombie may be sentient, and names him Fido. With the help of a pervy next-door neighbor who once worked for ZomCon (and has a zombie sex slave named Tammy), Timmy discovers that Fido is docile and harmless when allowed to smoke cigarettes (he died due to smoking in his former life).When ZomCon discovers Timmy's "abomination" Fido is sent away to be destroyed, and Timmy is heartbroken. Can he save his beloved zombie (who also seems to be developing a romance with Helen?) You'll have to watch it for yourself to find out, and believe me, this is one black comedy you don't want to pass up! It's hard not to fall in love with Fido as he goes through various adventures with his new "owners" and becomes a part of the family. The soundtrack, all nostalgic to the 1950's, is great, as is the acting. It was wonderful to find a zombie film without some underlying annoying environmentalist hippie propaganda message about anti-pollution too, Fido is just a simple, classic comedy that you'll love no matter what. I'm surprised it isn't in the top 500 popular movies, because it's one of the best ones I've seen in some time! Combining elements of Parents (1989), Night of the Living Dead (1968), Goosebumps Welcome to Dead House (1996) and the television series All in the Family, Fido is one classic you'll never forget!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really cool idea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following a '50s style sci-fi zombie apocalypse, ZOMCOM develops a collar to tame the zombies for domestic use. Communities live in fenced off middle American towns. The Robinsons (Carrie-Anne Moss, Dylan Baker, Kesun Loder) get a new zombie (Billy Connolly). Mr. Bottoms (Henry Czerny) is the head of security for ZOMCOM who has just moved into the neighborhood with his daughter Cindy (Alexia Fast).It is a really cool idea. However after the really cool idea, it needs something more compelling. It doesn't have the needed biting comedy. It cruises along with a ultra-light monotone satire. The odd thing here is that they have muzzled Billy Connolly who is one of the funniest comedic voice around. It's not funny enough to be a light comedy if you're going to use zombies. It needs to have a much darker undertone, and it's never exciting enough as a zombie horror movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In theory, a story about a family who takes in a zombie might sound hilarious. And it's not badly executed at all. I was surprised to find myself enjoying it more than I expected. But maybe if this had taken place in the present (why the 50's, I don't know), and happened under different circumstances, it could have been a laugh riot. But because people were more civilized in those times, it's probably gonna take a lot more than zombies to make a zombie comedy set in the 50's (or earlier) a whole lot funnier. The movie also opens with an uninteresting and unnecessary introduction (the video the class is watching). This might also be a breath of fresh air for anyone tired of watching zombies in horror films.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fido</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perfectly cast satire on the zombie genre and 60's mores, focuses on a suburban neighborhood soon after the "zombie wars" where the undead are now used as "pets" and "slaves" to help with the household chores along with comforting their masters. The family the film highlights are in a disconnect with each other. The father, Bill Robinson(Dylan Baker)has never recovered from having to kill his zombie dad, forcing his wife and kid to sit through funerals every Sunday. Mom, Helen(..a delightful Carrie-Anne Moss, simply glowing, and able to wonderfully mimic the methods women of this era of time acted regarding temperament towards their clueless husbands)wishes for her family to remain squeaky clean and proper to her neighbors, slowly, over time, tiring of her husband's inability to connect with his family, his withdrawn and always uncomfortable nature. Son Timmy(K'Sun Ray) simply wants some of his dad's time, receiving little affection or attention which leads to his developing friendship(kinship)to their zombie slave Fido(Billy Connolly, in a bit of inspired casting).FIDO pays tribute to George Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, not exactly poking fun at his movie as using it's social message regarding people's facile natures, without allowing the breakdown of society because of the zombie revolt(..you don't see people at each other's throats, twisted angered faces, or characters tearing into one another)featured in that masterpiece. The smiles are wide, people almost always remain at a certain level of calm even during more "heated" moments(..heated as say a husband and wife disagreeing about something on LEAVE IT TO BEAVER or THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW), and stinging remarks, along with rebellious feelings towards the status quo(..most often uttered from the mouth of young Timmy)are buried under scrutiny for "stepping out of line". Yet, even though Timmy isn't as hip to the company "Zomcom"(..the company who discovered the method of killing and containing the zombies), he is always the standard archetype little boy you are accustomed to when you come across THE PATTY DUKE SHOW or FATHER KNOWS BEST. He wishes to protect his "pet" from those who wish to harm Fido, whether it be the two bully students in his class or his neighbor, Mr. Bottoms(Henry Czerny)who runs Zomcom. Established is that if families are unable to keep their zombies from harming others(..Fido's collar is damaged multiple times on purpose by people wishing to harm it, the result, his feasting from their flesh), Bottoms sends them to the "Wild Zone", a wasteland of zombies gated from the sunny, green environment of wholesome suburbia. Director Andrew Currie(..along with co-writer Robert Chomiak)also satirize "gun control freaks" as we see that practically every man(..women, and eventually children over 12 are allowed to carry guns)owns a gun for protection..the war left a nation prepared for perhaps another outbreak.Despite the satire, the film actually devoted much time to the buddy comedy aspects of a kid and his beloved zombie friend, and how Helen, relatively ignored by her husband, who is consumed by other feelings(..such as DEATH;he even reads a magazine titled "Death"), grows fond of Fido. I like how friction is presented, but in a way we might see on conservative television at the time. The friendship's ability to withstand obstacles which threaten to tear apart Fido and Timmy provide fertile ground for the filmmakers to use the zombie traits we're used to in a witty way..such as the outcome towards irritating characters such as Timmy's obnoxious bullies or the old hag who's always criticizing someone. The violence isn't as extreme(..well, for those who have seen the goriest gutmunchers, this is child's play)as we are often accustomed to in the zombie genre, and the rot/decay of the "pets" are never too repellent. I think it works surprisingly well, but this kind of satire seems to divide those that find it funny while others seem to consider it dull garbage. Tim Blake Nelson is a riot as retired Zomcom scientist who has a zombie girlfriend, Tammy(..a lively bit of naughty "necro-comedy")..he actually lends Timmy help when he needs it most..he's not without his faults(..he actually turns a zombie loose on an innocent crowd to assist the young boy in his pursuit of "kidnapped" Fido and, we must not forget that he has a zombie girlfriend!).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a alternate 1950's world, a mysterious cloud of space dust passes through Earth as it brings the dead back to life to attack the living. Human have been killing off these pesky flesh-eating creatures but a scientific company called "ZomCom" has came up with a solution as they create special devices to make the living dead into nice creatures. It controls them into friendly beings and makes them into our slaves of everything without having to cause a fuss as they do the same jobs like us such as mailing, cooking, watering our lawns and more. Young Timmy (K'Sun Ray) is a lonely kid but luckily his sweet mom (Carrie-Ann Moss) purchases a lovable and friendly ghoul named Fido (Billy Connelly) until one day his collar malfunctions as he starts to munch down on a few folks causing a problem for the owners. Zomcom's top agent Mr. Bottoms moves across where Timmy lives so he can find a way to control these creatures and go against their owners.Brilliant and exciting Canadian horror comedy import is one of the better horror comedies in recent memory! This gem of a movie has excellent satire on 50's culture and zombie movies alike. Not since "Shaun of the Dead" or "Dead Alive (a.k.a. Braindead)" has there been a zombie movie that will guaranteed to make the viewer laugh, the acting is great especially Connelly whom plays a modern Frankenstein-esquire character whom we can all relate to. There's little and gory violence shown but not too graphic as this movie offers a dose of dark humor making this a modern cult classic.Also recommended: "Shaun of the Dead", "Night of the Comet", "Dawn of the Dead (1978 and 2004)", "Night of the Living Dead (1968 and 1990)", "Return of the Living Dead Trilogy", "Dead Alive (a.k.a.

		<shortDescription>Initial concept strong, enormous potential - it really is a shame they couldn't pull it together...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to like Fido but after the initial novelty of this movie wore off, it got pretty boring. Sure it sounds good on paper - the domestication of zombies is a fun, original idea and having it set in the 50s is a nice cherry on top. Sounds great, right? Well, aside from a wonderful concept, 5 or 6 decent lines and a few funny historical parodies, that's about all this movie had to offer.This was a poorly, poorly directed movie - there was a lot of potential for good laughs that were either missed altogether or executed ineffectively. The writing was way off- not corny enough to be parody, not cleaver enough to be garner more than a handful of smirks and although there were a number of normally good actors in the movie, they seemed so far removed from their roles that you could almost see the hate they had for their lines on their faces. This movie had a paper-thin plot that is basically revolves around all of the characters interacting with Fido the zombie as he exhibits ever-increasing human-like behavior (because he's still human at heart maybe?)...i don't know, they never really get into the "why" of it all. I ask you - who wants to see a zombie acting like a human? That's not funny. and furthermore, who wants to see people interacting with a zombie who acts human? that's really not funny. It's not even comedy, it's drama!...sort of. But because there's such prominent mis-acting (due to weak, flat writing), it lacks any dramatic believability even in the few scenes that might not have been butchered by the writing.And this battle for focus is the Achilles heel of the movie. It doesn't know what it wants to be, it's not good at being any one genera in particular or many genres at once (Save the Green Planet pulls this off astonishingly) and during the few times when it's successful at either end, it doesn't give us a reason to give a sh*t in the first place, which makes even the charming moments loose their charm. This was a HUGE disappointment as it really did have potential. Shame...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kitsch hybrid that doesn't come off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fido is lovingly shot in glorious fake 50s Technicolour. The film is a vividly styled hybrid that could possibly acquire cult status. But it's a hybrid that doesn't quite gel together. Fido sits awkwardly between a story of suburban manners, a horror and a kitschy comedy. The end result doesn't have enough to tell you, isn't funny enough and isn't scary enough either. It's sinister and a little empty. Even the deliberately over-coloured 50s palette starts off delicious and ends up nauseating. This is a strange film, perhaps unintentionally disturbing in its depiction of living children, dead adults and guns. All dressed up in bandbox brights, Fido leaves an unpleasant taste in the mouth. Potentially a classic misfire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute Film with a Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fido (2006) ** 1/2 (out of 4) If LEAVE IT TO BEAVER ever had a pet zombie then this is what it would have been like. Cute comedy about a young boy who doesn't get enough attention from his father so he begins a friendship with his zombie servant named Fido. You see, after the original zombie outbreak, ZomCom designed a neck brace that you could put on zombies to turn them into your slaves to do whatever you want. Most people use them for chores and its this attitude that makes this film stand out from so many other zombie movies. It's hard to call this thing a horror film because the entire attitude and style makes one think of those squeakily clean morality shows from the 1950s. I think director Currie has a lot going on in the screenplay that ranges from a cute father-son relationship to some other messages like putting your job in front of your kids as well as countless other items. I don't think this is a flawless movie but the imagination is so on the mark that you can't help but enjoy it. There are several good ideas thrown out there including one where when people die they have the option to have their head cut off so they're really dead or they can return as a zombie. We also get some pretty fun scenes with zombies doing stuff humans wouldn't want to like mow the lawn, various other garden items and even some making food. The idea of zombies doing the everyday chores of humans was a funny idea but we also get some more tender moments when it comes down to the little boy not getting enough attention from his father while the zombie is always there for him. Carrie-Ann Moss is very good as the sexual mother and Billy Connolly makes for a very memorable Fido. K'Sun Ray is good as the little boy and the rest of the supporting cast fit their roles nicely. There's some minor gore scenes but if you're looking for a straight, Romero type film then you're going to be disappointed here. The entire idea of zombies being trained to do normal things might sound stupid but this film actually makes the idea work. This certainly isn't a masterpiece or anything ground breaking but it's pleasant enough for fans of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who let the Zombies out? Woof...Woof, Woof!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once upon a time, and thanks to the almighty George A. Romero, zombies were the most petrifying and menacing monsters of the horror industry, but lately they are merely a laughing matter. There were mildly comical zombie movies before (like "Return of the Living Dead") but specifically since "Shaun of the Dead" the living dead are considered to be stand-up comedians instead of dangerous brain-munching corpses. This doesn't necessarily have to be a negative evolution, if it weren't for the fact that most of these new films are embarrassingly unfunny and even almost infuriating. "Fido" is finally the first film again ? since the aforementioned "Shaun of the Dead" ? to successfully blend effective comedy and respectful horror elements into one surprisingly refreshing movie. "Fido" has an absurd plot outline, but it actually works since everyone in the production does a devoted job and because the events take place in the past rather than in a "not so distant future". Director/co-writer Andrew Currie wondrously recreates an irresistibly charming and deliciously clichéd 1950's setting and atmosphere and this is unquestionably the film biggest trump. The narration, lovely disguised as a textbook educational school video, informs us how strange clouds of radiation caused the dead to rise from their graves again and attack the living; resulting in the horrible so-called zombie wars. But that all happened in a distant past now, as a brilliant scientist developed a collar which turns the once-bloodthirsty zombies into domestic and loyal pets. By now, the number of zombies you own in your household has pretty much become a status symbol, so the Robinson family urgently needs to purchase one. Fido rapidly becomes little Timmy's best friend and an object of secret affection for his mother, but his frigid father hates zombies and the new neighbor is suspicious, since a couple of people went missing in the area. I realize it's a strange description, but "Fido" is actually a very sentiments evoking and thoughtful family movie. It features most typical family themes (the kids being bullied, marriage struggles, ?) but ? additionally ? there are rotting cadavers stumbling around and occasionally they devour some of the neighbors. The film is very funny, but never laugh-out-loud hysterical or vulgar. In spite of the zombie -and flesh eating themes, the substantial humor and visual gags are always shown in a subtle and tasteful fashion. Perhaps even more than "Shaun of the Dead", this is the ideal tongue-in-cheek horror comedy and gets away with literally everything, including child-murder, necrophilia jokes, cannibalism and slavery. The acting performances are terrific. Particularly Carrie-Anne Moss is endearing as Mrs. Robinson and Tim Blake Nelson is superbly ethically incorrect as the neighbor in love with a much younger, sexy and DEAD girl. Billy Connelly doesn't have any actual lines as the titular character, but somehow it's a great benefit for the film that he depicts the pet-zombie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombie Movies have been reduced to Farce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can we officially declare that Zombies just aren't scary anymore? This movie is based on the premise than instead of WWII, we had the Zombie War, were a lot of people turned into Zombies, there was a war to defeat them, but they found a way to turn Zombies into a domesticated slave class.It's set in an alternative history 1950's (no people of color to be seen) with loud pastels and pasty white people.There is a scene where two child bullies are killed, zombified, killed again and burned, all in a very antiseptic way compared to how adult zombies are dispatched in this movie.I think this was supposed to be a satire on American values, but frankly, a lot of the jokes fell flat. We all know that the 1950's weren't really the idealized Happy Days type thing. This world is kind of too orderly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You might think, "Billy Connolly as a zombie! How can it miss?" But, you'll just be as disappointed as I was. Honestly, I turned it off after 32 minutes. And I dare you to watch any more and feel good about yourself for it. It turns out that I have to write 10 lines of text to warn you not to watch this movie. In that case, the following will be omitted: Suck, suck suck... sad. Have you ever seen Carrie Ann Moss in anything other than the Matirx movies? Exactly! The main character is a kid that apparently didn't study acting in college. I think he's around 10 years old. The husband might be the best actor in the cast, but his job is to act like a terrified child, which even the 10 year old couldn't do in this movie. And, as unfortunate as it is, Connolly will apparently take any work thrown his way. Just stay far, far away from this flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring and plodding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet another bad movie featuring zombies.But its got a new twist----it's boring and slow.The makers of this film have managed to make a movie with zombies that is about as exciting as watching paint dry.I didn't think that was possible.Just imagine a 1950's as portrayed in "Happy Days" or "Leave it to Beaver" but instead of Mr.C. mowing the lawn or washing the car they have zombies doing those menial chores instead.Sometime before some sort of space dust had hit the Earth and brought all the dead back to life.The hordes of walking dead were brought under control in the Great Zombie Wars and now zombies are controlled by a collar that keeps them under control so they can be made to do chores.One kid ,Timmy, and his zombie ,Fido, form a special bond and havoc ensues.A company called Zomcon makes the collars and fences that surround the towns and keep them safe from roaming zombies-yeah there is supposed to be some hidden message about corporate corruption or greed or whatever.Who cares.Now I know this isn't supposed to be a straight zombie movie,it's supposed to be funny .The only problem is it ain't funny.The storyline is slow and boring and the plot doesn't make any sense.Wouldn't it be better just to wash your own car as to take the chance that a collar will malfunction and a zombie will flip out and kill someone like sometimes happens in the movie? Well I guess not.These 1950's dolts had rather take the chance of getting their throats torn out as to have to pick up their own newspaper from the front porch.But really the terrible plot could have been over looked if the movie had been funny ,even a little.Or gory .Or anything.What it turned out to be was a few zombies with some gray face paint on milling around until we wound down to a totally predictable ending.Minimal gore and no bare breasts make this zombie movie a complete waste of time.I wish I could put a stun collar on the untalented bunch who made this heap of crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that so many people rate this thing highly shows that really good writing is not appreciated anymore. Yes it was a good idea. Yes it's technically well done and the colors are nice to look at. But it's so totally BORING! It would have made a clever 10 minute skit perhaps. I tried to watch it twice, after about 10 minutes I fast forwarded thru it, stopping and hoping for something clever or funny, but no luck. I love horror, splatter, satire, zombies, etc. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH RENTING THIS. IT IS SIMPLY ROTTEN, LIKE A ZOMBIE. Take the time to watch some of the old Universal black and white movies, like Old Dark House, or any other classics. Learn to appreciate really good scripts. Maybe someday it'll be on HBO, test your patience by trying to sit thru it. AWFUL!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Response re Telefilm Support / Financing of FIDO</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am writing in response to the poster who had questions about Telefilm's support of the film. I am actually the producer who spoke to your friend at the Q&amp;A. I apologize if what I said was confusing. What I said was that 66% of our financing came from Canadian sources - only half of that was Telefilm - approximately 33% of the total budget. Another 33% came from other Canadian sources including our Canadian distributor,Canadian equity investors and tax credits. The final 34% of the budget came from sources outside Canada including sales to the United States and several other countries around the world.I hope this clarifies things. Sorry for any confusion or concern that my comments created.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring, unfunny zombie film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>But I'll give it 2 stars because it has Carrie-Ann. I really wanted to like this movie. I like zombie movies. Add comedy, and how could it miss? Well, unfortunately I sat in the theater...waiting...waiting...waiting for something funny to appear on-screen. But it never came. If you're easily entertained and don't ask for much, "Fido" may suffice. But if you're looking for something a bit sharper, stay away. Not only that, but this film DRAGS on and on and on. The main zombie is kind of amusing in the beginning, but after awhile it gets tired. One of the things I didn't like was how "forced" this felt. The directing and acting performances just didn't click. I was bored and very disappointed with this. Don't get your hopes up for this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose I have seen worse movies, although I can't really think of any at the moment, but I am having a hard time imagining anyone actually wasting money on making this movie. It must truly have been a labor of love. The story such as it is reminds me of the old TV Lassie show. That's the only positive thing I can say. The actors were okay considering what they had to work with but the storyline was so dumb that I lost interest almost immediately. I suppose if you are in love with stupid movies and here I can reel off a list, you will enjoy this. I loved old Zombie movies and this one is an insult to their memory. Where is Mantan Moreland when you want to combine humor and zombies?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Just Don't Get It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truth be told.. I don't understand a thing about this movie, much less to enjoy the story. Maybe it's an acquired taste.Yeah I haven't watched Lassie, I haven't watched Shaun of The Dead as well, but Thank God I haven't watched those movies . It's a case of see-one-you-see-it-all .What's with the movie anyway? It's about a kid who has a pet, but not the four-legged kinda thing like cats &amp; dogs, nor it is those cute flurry animals like rabbits &amp; hamsters. No, none of that. The kid, Timmy, has a pale looking.. zombie as a pet! Her Mom acquired the zombie because she felt inadequate because their family was the only one left in the neighborhood who still haven't got a zombie as servant. Her husband opposed to the idea because he had a trauma of having to kill his 'zombie father' before. But she persisted &amp; said that zombies can be a good servant and that they were absolutely harmless, especially with the Zoncom's invention in security collars designed to warned humans should there be a violent Zombies lurking around. At a press of a button and walla! the Zoncom's security people will capture the Zombies, to be taken to a jail. ( I guessed it was a jail, even though it look very much like a slaughterhouse).So the story goes that Timmy enjoyed the company with Fido, the zombie their family owned. One fine day, when playing catch, Fido 'accidentally' killed Mrs.Handerson. Why? I don't know really for sure, but my friend told me it's because it's what Zombies usually eat.I may not get a favorable response from other users, and I'm pretty sure that they'll be more people who disagree with what I said than those who will agree with me, but there's nothing much I can do about it. I'm just trying to tell this movie in my point of view.So there you have it. A score of 2/10.. A very high score I gave considering the low-budget feel to this movie, with characters that I can't seem to recognize and a storyline that seems to lost it's direction halfway through the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disgusting movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is people who like better animals than humankind , it is a pathology ...here we have a movie from the same level than Romero's "Land of the dead" where zombies are some what better , more human and friendly than the living ones ...The movie started good and promising for me but when the pet zombies started to take more and more the place of the living ... maybe even on the bed ??? ... I start to feel disgust about the situation, the situation appears also completely silly with a population of decomposed corpses (what 's about the smell ?) ,serving very goofy the humans, what was the point ???... ho yeah it was the humor parts of the movie ... sorry I didn't get it.I was not against the fact than the zombies were used as slaves , but the relation between the humans/humans and the humans/zombies described here are just totally unreal to the impossible , and that make the movie interest fall minute by minute ... The movie tried to be controversial with maybe a criticism of our society somehow , I didn't find where , the situation just cannot stand up the base of the human reaction who will never let zombies walking around especially with a so poor efficiency. I'm fed up of all theses movies writers which to come to a desired situation just distort to the extreme idiocy how any people should react.OK it's a fantasy movie but please let's us know in a beginning note than the heroes in this movie are totally stupid and not reflect the people in the real life ... at least it will be more honest for us the customers.I'm a zombies movie fan , but I don't love zombies that much like some necrophiliacs around here , I give a 3 for the beginning of the movie who's pretty cool ... The end of the movie just give me a revulsion , because it is just sick and stupid and the guy who wrote the story or never was a mother or never had child ... ----------------I edit my post to fix a little mistake and after to have read the others reviews to add few words. I have read around there are in the movie philosophical, political, comedy view of the American society blablabla ...ok but where are the people , the actor play nice, but they don't play as human people , so the criticism of the society is base on what ?we have totally strange humans who allow falling apart zombies (who much time zombies can stand like that , 6 months , 1 year before to be eat by worms or just decompose themselves ??), who can be near relatives (ok people has lost any emotion ... but difficult to believe), serve them very badly (like I say it was the funny part of the movie , like breaking stuff, very funny indeed ), bring the food without think about any disease (egnouh few days to have mortal epidemic if living near dead bodies), the smell, or the view of these horrible monsters...So please people do not start to see any thing serious in this movie , to read between the lines,to discover a message or a homage or a critic of anything , because there are no link to the real life.This movie is a pure fantasy who tends to the horror-comedy style (but definitely not satiric ) where instead to see people involve in a strange adventure , we see strange people involve in a strange adventure.</fullReview>
