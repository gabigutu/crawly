		<shortDescription>Entertaining black comedy á la Forrest Gump</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Jonas Jonasson novel "The Centenarian Who Climbed Out the Window and Vanished" has been a gigantic success in Sweden, selling more that 250.000 copies. A success that has spread to a lot of other countries as well. I read the book just days before I saw the world premiere on this, as I got the book as a x-mas gift, just two days before the premiere.Well, to make a long story short, this is an unlikely black comedy in style of Forrest Gump, though darker and way more stupid, and filled with more stupid humans. Other films it's in class with here would be "Fargo", "One night at McCools", "Seven psychopaths" a.s.o. The book functions, and I'm glad to say that the narrative grips made on this as a script works as well. It's a good farce, which will give out many laughs. The two hours goes like it's one.The 100 years old Allan runs away from his birthday party, and starts a story which only he could be behind. Inwise decisions gives severe results, and looking back on his own life, he's done it before. He's made both tragedy's as well as things leading to happier consequences. They have tried to lock him up more than once, but he's not the easiest to detain.I enjoyed the film in a quite crowded cinema, which already started laughing at the first scene, and so i t went on. A mixed audience, with surprisingly many pensioners, which have read the book, will probably guarantee the film to be an even bigger success than the novel. At least, that's my guess.Well, how well is the novel brought to the screen, then? Well, surprisingly well, I would say. The most boring parts of the book is when Allan thinks back, and this is narrated down, so that the story happening present is the main thing. That's a major thing in making this work. There's been some minor changes done to shorten the travel, which unfolds like some kind of a trip or road movie, if you like, just as the book.The make up is brilliant, and way better than we've seen in Hollywood films (!). Amazing. Robert Gustafsson, playing Allan, is just turning 50, but here he looks perfect both in the twenties, the thirties and as 100 years old. (Well, maybe he looks eighty-something more than 100, but still it's quite passable.)Some of the CGI isn't exactly brilliant. This I see much better in Norwegian movies. Especially all the explosions are bad, but it doesn't hurt the story, since it's far from believable anyway. The famous persons portrayed are also quite good. The casting is well done, also when it comes to the actors playing the younger Allan. What annoys extremely is the music, which not only is stupid and too "funny", it's also very high in the sound mix. This is the worst bit of the movie. There's also some goofs, like the frozen guy and a tank lid closing itself, while driving away, but still not very big issues.So very well done, and the best Swedish comedy I've seen in many years. Thanks to a great staff, a quite large budget (63 millions SEK) and wonderful actors. (I'm sure it will play in the money!) The book is well taken care of, and if you enjoyed the movie, you'll find a lot more in the book, now with the clients you've seen here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is extremely funny. From the moment the old man crawls out of the window until the very end of the movie, it is a stitch. It is fast paced and all the characters are well drawn and fleshed out, even characters that only appear near the end of the movie. I was reminded of Peter Seller's movie "Being There" and, yes, there was a bit of "Forrest Gump" in it. I did not object to the "violent" deaths that some of the characters experienced because they were so over the top that they could not be taken seriously and the audience apparently agreed with me since everyone was howling with laughter. We saw the movie at the Chicago Film Festival and it was one of the few times I have attended a film festival when the entire audience stood up and clapped at the end of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A marvellous film of many kinds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film follows the progress of Allan Karlsson, a simple man with a predilection for blowing things up, after he leaves his nursing home to embark on a journey that will take him wherever it takes him. Through flashbacks we see that this is a metaphor for his entire life. Karlsson has, it turns out, been with several significant figures of the 20th century and, unwittingly, has profoundly affected its course.The film is comic, darkly comic, absurdist, farcical, a chase caper, an espionage thriller and, finally, peaceful. It is all of these things successfully in a way that Wes Anderson's "The Grand Budapest Hotel" attempted to be, but didn't quite manage. More importantly, the characters are entirely believable despite the often fantastical story lines. It is also beautifully shot."Life is what happens to us while we are making other plans." ?

		<shortDescription>An excellent Nordic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked the story and the acting from Robert Gustafsson. A funny film with great scenario and well done history facts. With great finishing twists and quiet good computer effects.Combining world war 2 and the cold war is just fantastic. And having a ''look back'' in every couple scene makes the storyline much more attractive. It's very funny to have the same Swedish man appearing in big historic events from 1940 and until the end of the cold war.I wish I could be as cool when I reach 100 years old.A must see Nordic comedy film with great actors and a great plot. I haven't seen a film like this for years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Metaphor for Swedish (recent) history?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I'm Swedish, but I've always lived in the Netherlands. I speak Swedish, Dutch and English. Maybe this is the reason why I had a great time watching the movie. There are language and accent jokes (i.e. Gothenburg vs. Stockholm) and such which I really enjoyed, but these may lose their meaning in translation.The acting may not be perfect, but it never really bothered me. Without subtitles the mumbling of the old man may cause some annoyance to Swedes, but anybody else won't have problems with appropriately placed subs. Anyway, I might be going out on a limb here, but I can't help seeing parallels with the role of Sweden in recent history. I'm not a historian, but from what I know, some points made me think of another level. Spoiler: Let me just point to some events with a big tongue in cheek, without proving anything: Sweden has been neutral country since the beginning of the 20th century. (Allan makes friends all over the world, without choosing sides deliberately). He is an explosives expert, since the beginning. (Swedish Alfred Nobel discovered dynamite not long before Allan was born). Allan lost his ability to have children. (Is this the metaphor for being neutral/neutered the rest of his life? Later on he even says that this was more of a blessing than a curse). Many big events are touched upon, but the Great Wars aren't really mentioned. Sweden had no official role in these wars.They're might be more, feel free to elaborate.End spoiler.I couldn't help but to think of these parallels, so please reply if you think I have a lead, or if I am seeing things that aren't there.Funny movie, great special effects, high quirkiness value,Big 7/10,Olof Magnus Wennardt</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A centenarian in an elderly home decides to walk out moments they were about to host party for his 100th birthday.On the surface, how eventful an event could this be? Well you would be surprised. He goes to the bus station and with the little money he had buys a one way ticket out of town. A stranger asks him to look out for his luggage and though he agreed he decided to steal it and little did he know that it was filled with money which made him a wanted man.From then on, we follow this centenarian who tries to avoid the elderly home who sent for him, the gang who owned the stolen money as well as the police. His action plan: none! He took it a step at a time and the audience were treated to en ever ending hilarious situations all the way to the end.Clever plot, well made in a way that actually made it somewhat believable (unlike the Hollywood tendency to go way over the top) this was an unexpected treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Funny Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An unexpectedly great movie. I wasn't anticipating much from this Swedish independent, but was laughing all the way through. Fast paced and written with wry deadpan humor.The main character displays similar characteristics to Peter Sellers' Chauncey, in 'Being There'. Its also somewhat reminiscent of Arthur Penn's 70's classic 'Little Big Man' starring Dustin Hoffman in terms of the plot layout.Whether these were intentional homages to personal favorites of mine is not clear, but they worked magnificently. Serious belly laughs as dry humor is dropped effortlessly into every scene. It is such a refreshing change from all those polished Hollywood set pieces which have decreasingly appealing sequels. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not really of course, but I wouldn't be surprised if some would make that comparison. That old man also seems to have left his mark in history. And while I haven't read the book, I can tell you that the movie is funny in a weird way. Something that you might expect from something with a title like that.The story moves along nicely with interceptions from time to time, that tell us what happened when he was younger. And also are there to show us what sort of character he is. It's tough to really threaten a man of his age. The actor playing him is much younger of course, which we can see when he plays the younger version in the flashbacks. The makeup is more than decent enough in the "now". Really nice and good, this movie is entertaining</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zany fun, insatiably cute and a fun little romp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember reading the back of the book this was based on awhile ago and thinking how great this sounded. I never got around to reading it and when I spied this movie based on it, I was overjoyed!! I didn't even know this has been made. The film does not disappoint. It is a fun, fast paced, ridiculous adventure not unlike a more subtle Forrest Gump and with a little less serious tone. There are some life lessons here to be learnt but its not specifically trying to teach us anything. It is just trying to have a good time so sit back and relax and laugh at the often disturbing dark humour and hilarious comedy of errs. This has all the earmarks and feel of a classic satire and the cast is so fantastic. I think with a slightly higher budget it could have been even better but they do a great job with what they're given. If you're not a fan of foreign films, don't balk at this because much of it is in English and the dialogue and script is brilliant. There are some incredibly memorable moments and lines and a crazy cast of characters that won't seen be forgotten. I will forever remember Allan Karlsson saying "if you want to kill me, you better hurry, I'm 100 years old." Robert Gustafsson is absolute perfect. First of all the make up job they do on him as the 100 year old is amazing and he perfectly manages to play Allan across many, many decades and is believable. Its nice not to have different actors playing the same role to make youth believable. Allan is simple minded in some ways and just has this distinctive "I don't care/roll with the punches attitude" that doesn't change and makes him incredibly hilarious and fun. Iwar Wiklander is fantastic as Allan's partner in crime so to speak. His character is a little underdeveloped but they have great chemistry and he has some truly terrific moments. David Wiberg is also really great as the metaphorically lost guy looking for the meaning of life. Wiberg's character is the perfect balance to the other characters. Mia Skäringer plays the reluctant female drawn into the men's crazy adventure and falls for Wiberg. Being one of the only females in the film she holds her own and has some great moments of her own. Jens Hultén is one of my favourite characters especially following his amnesia and he plays a great part too. Alan Ford adds a needed part of the villain to the story and while he has very little screen time or development, he does it well.This really is the definition of ensemble cast. Foreign films are often this way but everyone works together to make you laugh, smile, be shocked and just go along for the ride. Elephant shot in the butt? Stolen mobster money? A detective chasing them all across country? Budding romance? A 100 Year old man that just wants to be left alone? This is just simply fun. You can turn this on, sit back and have a great time. This honestly should do wonders for director Felix Herngren's career because he handles the film well, tells an incredible story and holds it all together flawlessly. If you're looking for something different but fun and entertaining you found it here!! Check this one out!! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Read the book first to really enjoy the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For anyone who has enjoyed the book, this film will be a hoot. There were changes - but there is too much in the book for a single film. So while it annoying to leap from Siberia to Paris (for example_ its understandable. But, while it does not follow the story exactly, but it perfectly captures the atmosphere and style of the original story. The lead is perfect as Alan, and the rest of the cast fit together very neatlyAnyone who has not read the book will miss loads. Why does Benny almost qualify for various jobs, how did Herbert Einstein suddenly end up in Paris and a range of other questions are answered there. Characters, if based on just the film, lack depth, and things often happen with little real explanation.So not perfect, but a very good attempt to film a complex story that successfully retains the humour of the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for the easily offended, succeeds with black humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hundra?ringen som klev ut genom fönstret och försvann" is the original title of this little Swedish movie and well done to you if you manage to pronounce that. It is written and directed by Felix Herngren, who worked mostly for Swedish television recently. The film is basically split into two parts. The life of the hundred-year-old today and his past years where we get to see how he managed to shape history by meeting famous statesmen like Stalin and not so famous people like Einstein's brother. However, I have to say I found his life as a 100-year-old much funnier than the historic references.The film is as violent with lots of black humor as you would expect from Scandinavian comedies these days if you are familiar with the likes of "In China They Eat Dogs" (which is Danish, but has similar humor). Another interesting anecdote about the film is that the actor who plays the central character isn't even half his age. Lots of make-up work here. Admittedly he looked old, but not even close to 100 or probably 90. The "exploding fox" scene at the start of the film already shows the path of humor this movie is gonna take. If you enjoy the beginning, you will probably also like everything that comes after. Explosions galore. All the characters are very colorful, almost too much that sometimes they seem a bit exaggerated like cartoon characters.All in all, it's slightly under two entertaining hours, but by no means a must-see. This is a somewhat different road movie and I would like to finish this review by mentioning one of my favorite scenes where that one guys runs around in the biker jacket and the other one totally panics because of it. It's actually much funnier than it sounds here and I won't deny that the film occasionally really succeeded in making me (and the rest of the audience) laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forrest Gump if Forrest was into explosives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do you get when you combine Forrest Gump style "travel the world, affect history" kind of storyline, add in a heap of dark adult humour and have the protagonist's main character trait to be that he likes to blow stuff up? In a word, this movie.It's not as great as Forrest Gump. It's clearly imitating the latter, which is not a problem per se, but it causes us to draw comparisons. And while this film is a great deal of fun, the characters are not as nuanced and are there more for the sake of humour than story. It also doesn't have the depth and humanity, at least not to the same amount.But let's not dwell on the Forrest Gump similarity too much. Because this film does have strength to stand on its own. It's a hilarious film about an old grump that one day simply decides that retirement home doesn't suit him. And thus he jumps out of the window and goes wandering like, as we find out through numerous flashbacks, he has always done when life gets too boring. Along the way he meets all sorts of people, including an elephant in Sweden, and hijinks ensue, like they often do in these kinds of movies.This movie shines because of its unpredictability and fast pace. You never know what's coming next and the movie keeps up relentless pace, not letting you dwell on the unlikeness of the things happening on screen, which serves the film's purposes very well. The characters and their actors are also very charismatic and fun to follow around. Sure they're a bit stereotypical, aside from the main character, but that doesn't really bother you as you're watching them go because the events they're in are so bizarre.The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared has one of the most cumbersome titles in a while, but trust me when I say that the film is anything but. If you're looking for a comedy with a dark sense of humour, this is not a bad choice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ASTONISHING; Right from the start when Allan escapes from his retirement home, on his hundredth birthday, I ensure that you will love this hilarious explosives-obsessed centenarian. Based on the bestselling 2009 novel by Jonas Jonasson, the whimsical narrative follows the misadventures of Allan Karlsson (Robert Gustafsson) who, after accidentally taking a suitcase full of money with him throughout a long journey, will constantly meet unbelievable people with hazardous hidden secrets.Nevertheless, I have to admit that Scandinavian humor is said to be difficult to understand, so you might miss the joke in some scenes, or even find it so black-humored which may be rather excellent or awful, it's up to you. Hope you enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rarely is a film this engaging, entertaining and unpredictable, in any language! The story, present and past, of Allan Karlsson grabs you from the start. It reminded me of Peter Sellers performance in Being There. In fact, all the performances worked, from the care home workers, dim-witted bikers, bored detective and world leaders.I had no idea what to expect, only that it was Sweden's third biggest film after the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and the Girl that played with fire (also both excellent films, in very different ways).I really should rate it a 10, as there is nothing to criticise about the film, except to say that it is clearly not The Godfather, nor intended to be. However, for what it is, it is brilliant.If you like to be surprised and entertained, I cannot really think of anyone that wouldn't enjoy watching this. Find it. Watch it. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie from Sweden. Although released in 2013, it's nominated for the 2016 Oscars in the Makeup category.An older guy in a nursing home goes out the window and runs away. During his journey he tells his life story.The atmosphere, style and black humor reminds me of TAXIDERMIA (2006) (an excellent weird movie from Hungary), although it's not nearly as extreme.Excellent makeup, well deserves of the Oscar nomination. The lead actor, who plays a 100-years old man, was actually 48-years old when the movie was shot and most his on-screen time is in full makeup. According to IMDb's trivia, he estimates to have spent a net total of 3 weeks non-stop in makeup.The movie is so-so. Starts well, in large it has a FORREST GUMP vibe - a simple man who somehow manages to make a lot of influence on history. But at the end it loses its way; It drags and leads to nowhere.Good cinematography, good score, very good production value.Worth watching, but not impressive as it could have been; Better watch TAXIDERMIA instead if you haven't seen it yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So it goes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Allan Karlsson would not be a fan of simile, metaphor, or flowery comparisons of any sort; he's much more of a "things are how they are, que sera sera" kind of guy. So he might issue one of his patented crinkly grimaces to hear his film, The 100 Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared (a title as cutely apt, lumbering, but functional as the film itself), allegorized as 'Forrest Gump through the eyes of a Swedish Kurt Vonnegut'. Still, it's impossible to imagine a more conducive description for the film. It's cute, clever, and laced with a very welcome sense of dark Swedish humour, but a bit too light and gentle to dig into the weightier, more Vonnegutian themes of other aging road trip contemporaries. Does this impact our enjoyment of the film? Not at all. It is what it is, and what it is is worthwhile and hugely watchable.The plot is rather episodic, with the series of accidentally poignant flashbacks integrated amusingly but playing out more clumsily here than in book form. Ultimately, it's hard to shake the feeling that we might be better off forgoing Karlsson's colourful past altogether. His present-day caper, an almost Coen brothers-y road trip involving a mysterious bag of mob cash, an entourage of quirky companions, and an ever mounting, morbidly hilarious body count, is so much more watchable than the amusing but more contrived Gumpiness of his reminiscences. Still, Karlsson's amiable, nonchalant acceptance of all things that pass - political regimes, life, loss, Gulags, drinking, doppelgängers, xenophobic vasectomies, unexpected elephants, and lots and lots of explosions - is infectious, and perfectly portrayed with crusty warmth by (48 year old!) star Robert Gustafsson, aided by some pretty impressive makeup. He's an engaging enough narrator that all events, revolutionary (literally) and inconsequential, add flavour to his characterization and film alike.As with all 100 year-old things there are growing pains. The film fights somewhat distractingly hard to play as a comedy sometimes, none the least through its carnivalesque, Nino Rota ripoff musical score, and the ending's cloying schmaltziness won't be to all tastes (though it's hard to find fault with any film that brings us to a Balinese beach vacation). Nonetheless, just as the film urges for nonjudgmental acceptance and enjoyment of everything that drifts on by, it dictates its own ideal viewing state. And as a night's hearty entertainment, untaxing but seasoned with just enough discerning weirdness, The 100 Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared could prove the perfect fit. So it goes.-7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My imaginations came to life and then died</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One day i went to the bookstore and saw a cartoon covered book. It was green and very simple. Usually i don't get easily attracted, but it had a very long title. "The 100 year old man who climbed out the window and disappeared" by Jonas Jonasson. I thought to myself, should i buy it or just leave it? Long story short, i finished the book with many laughter and many new inspirations. it was funny, dramatic, and deep. Jonas Jonasson explained in a simple way how corrupted our world is. It's so ironic it makes you laugh. I share the book to many of my friends. Suddenly somebody said there was a movie based about the book. I was very exited, (if you have red the book, my country, Indonesia, was quoted many times and the stupidity of how our government is was also written) so i searched the movie. It was a bit difficult to get movies that weren't published by our media. The movie store wasn't going to sell any movie that seems had no prospect in it (pop-minded-people). Finally after a long journey i got the movie and watched. Watched. And watched. Yes, the cast are there. The director did a good job casting the actors, especially Allan Karlson, Herbert Einstein, Julius, and the Never Again Squad. But, there was a minute that i got lost when Allan succeed the Manhattan Project and suddenly arrived in Sweden. Is it just me, or is this new plot a bit disappointing? Actually my favorite quote of the book was "There are only two things I can do better than most people. One of them is to make vodka from goats' milk, and the other is to put together an atom bomb." There was a moment in the book where Allan traveled through the Himalaya's. It was there he found his other "hobby" and after his "enlightenment" he went to Tehran and met a very fanatic priest. Maybe because of the budgeting and other technical matters this project can't afford it. But in my opinion this was a important moment for the development of the characters and the story. There were many changes from the book to the movie. I tried to be objective and watch it in another perspective, but still, how did Allan survive Gulag, how did he suddenly had a Chinese traditional clothes when he was in France (the book describes that he was the translator and the best friend of an Indonesian ambassador), and why did the movie script writer add more antagonist (Pim - Alan Ford). The book was dark. It had sarcasm everywhere, but i can't feel it in the movie. So yes, it was entertaining, but not what i hoped for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goofy Meets Dark Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The type of humor that is used in this movie was so refreshing. I love dark comedies, and I love dark humor. I appreciated it even more because it was by no means a dark movie. It was incredible how they made such a lighthearted movie with such dark comedy. Think Secondhand Lions meets Forrest Gump, I know, it's worth it though. The main Character was so nonchalant it was endearing. His care free attitude was refreshing and easy to watch. The supporting cast is what really makes the movie for me though. I don't know who any of these actors are, but the casting Director did such a good job. They all melded so well together. They fed off each other's presence and they were able to share scenes extremely well with each other. It was very play-esque in that regard. Having read some of the other reviews I will simply say, if you take this movie too seriously you've already lost the point. If you look for flaws you're bound to find them, however, it's such a fun movie. It's light, it's dark, and personally, just a funny movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very odd fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well? I never thought I'd be watching this film today. It is the most random, perplexingly odd and obscure film I've ever seen. This film is in fact a Swedish made adaption of an English book, starring literally no actor I have heard of.I would like to say I have never read the book, so I don't know how similar this film is to the book and so I don't care about that and I won't mention it.The film is fairly low budget, so the actors who star in it aren't exactly big stars; but whoever they did bring in, they did a good job. Every character is unique and has their part to play, and all of them show tonnes of expression and tone. But the actors are helped by a fantastically written script (co-written by Felix Herngen, the director) that is filled with personality, subtle jokes and a dark, violent undertone in a mad, all-over-the-place plot that never fails to entertain and make you laugh; and through countless explosions and heads falling on car bonnets to a screaming woman, it is surprisingly dark.The story really is all-over-the-place, so you don't know what will happen next; whether it's a dance with Franco or an accidental escape with Albert Einstein's idiot brother, Herbert. It's quite the silly film, if you hadn't guessed.But it wouldn't have worked without the main character, the 100- year-old man himself: Allan Karlssen (Robert Gustafsson). He personifies the mad and slightly confused manner of the film and carries it through a telling of his life from the age of nine to where he is when he is 100 in flashbacks throughout the film, almost perfectly entwining with the main story; telling you what you need to know to get through it all and, in essence, truly develop the mad character that is Allan. By the end of it, you love him almost as a brother and you know pretty much all there is to know about him; and it works.Yep. Spoilers are comin'.However, the film wouldn't have its dark and violent edge if the story hadn't revolved around a violent biker gang ? that I forget the name of ? who constantly try to retain a brief case that Allan had taken by mistake from one of their members containing 50 million pounds. It is a simple, yet unpredictable story that leads from this; and the biker gang all end up being killed by Allan and his friend by mistake ? other than one who is ran over and somehow ends up becoming their friend, of sorts.No more spoilers. You'll be fine.Sometimes during the film, with the flashbacks, though, it seems like either the writing goes a bit lazy or it just goes too mad. There is too much talk of how much Allan likes explosions and sometimes it dwindles too much on the flashbacks, and then it simply gets confusing at points, the story a little too hard to follow; leaving you, at points, thinking: "What the hell is going on?!" And then there are silly things that just don't quite need to be there and take up time in the film, but I won't bother to talk about them.But the flaws in this film are mostly overcome by everything that is good about it. It is charming, funny, likable, well acted, has some very good characters that all have their part to play, and, most of all, it is completely different from anything else I have ever seen and is an entertaining film to watch. When the film finishes, you are left feeling the same as the police officer at the end of it all: feeling confused, amazed and surprised.Verdict:There's nothing spectacular about this film, but, as a quirky Swedish film about a 100-year-old man and his shenanigans with a crazy biker gang, it gets the job done; with a funny script, great characters and a unique story in a film filled with personality and a surprisingly dark under layer. It may dwindle a little too much on confusing flashbacks and the fact that Allan (the 100-year-old) likes explosions with a story that may be a bit too mad for the sake of it; but it's still a very entertaining watch and definitely worth a go if you're on Netflix or Amazon Prime.So I give it: 75/100.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the f****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well this review interacts only with those who red the book.TO begin with, I'm obliged to say that the director of this film made some changes to the story which anyone who red the book will find them completely unnecessary, added zero points to the plot, diminished lots of funny parts and made this film completely spineless, blunt and unfunny.Some said that the act was great, well I'm not so sure about that. Allan's attitude in the book has nothing to do with the so-called acting of the protagonist. He looks completely as a corpse who's being dragged through the entire film. Some characters were added and I don't find the reason why? Some stories changed and were utterly twisted which again don't find the reason why? They sure had the budget but screwed up with the scenario. Pity, pity, pity that they didn't get this film up to the top, when it was clear that they had such an amazing funny story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you'e close to retirement home consideration or even if it's a bit distant into the future or you just know someone in that situation this fantasy escapism will prove to be entertaining. If the bumbling escapades in the Pink Panther series is in your film dossier then mark up another reason to watch. Typical British understated dark humor. The twists are not very believable, but are entertaining enough in a slapstick sort of way to keep watching the movie, but like it's lead character, about a third of the way through the story seemed to fall into the "repetitive" antics doldrums; just plodding along. The ending just sort of petered out on me also; must be getting old. A film quote as our, supposed 100 year old with an acting age more like in the 70s, escapee finds himself heading toward an unknown destination, "The middle of nowhere is underrated."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>False "innocent" blunders through disasters to unearned success.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not having seen many Swedish comedies since the demise of that madcap Ingmar Bergman, I was delighted by this biting black comedy. But like Bergman, I suspect director Felix Herngren ? and source novelist Jonas Jonasson ? is using hero Allan Karlssen as an embodiment of the Swedish national soul. The key clue may be Allan's involuntary (and sloppy) sterilization, which left him reduced and in pain but grateful for his removal from the temptations and tribulations of romance. At film's end he envies the dithering eternal student Benny for being able to make the romantic connection Allan was denied. The neutered Karlssen embodies Sweden's pretence to neutrality. When the 100-year-old man escapes his old folks' home for an open-ended adventure he personifies the freedom of the unattached, the unrestrained. The old man stumbles through all sorts of dangers and disasters, blissfully unawares. By taking off with a suitcase stuffed with money he triggers a bikers' gang chase and a number of deaths and disasters. Totally without guile himself, he hooks up with another solitary man, then another, and blithely blunders through to a happy ending. The flashbacks to his earlier life replay that drama ? an innocent unaware of all the disasters he is causing. His passion for exploding things clearly alludes to the Swedish genius Alfred Nobel, inventor of dynamite. The child Allan delights in blowing things up. His first targets, of increasing significance, culminate in the explosion of the merchant who underpaid Allan's widow mother for her Faberge egg. For that he's sent to an asylum and sterilized by a social biologist who imagines Allan's resemblance to the statistical Negro. Allan's last adventure begins when he blows up the fox who killed his pet cat.Allan's life is defined by his passion for explosions. When he fights in the Spanish civil war he has none of the revolutionary ardor of his doomed friend Escobar. Allan just wants to blow things up, which is a suspect form of neutrality, destruction without a principle. His last bridge explosion ingratiates him with Franco who thinks Allan saved his life ? when he in fact imperilled it. Allan drinks and parties with Franco and later Truman and Stalin with the neutral's lack of political engagement. But not without dangerous effect.For neutrality can be as explosive, as destructive, as taking an impassioned position can be. Allan's innocence proves dangerous when he helps Oppenheimer invent the atomic bomb and lets himself be swept off to Russia. His mature years are spent as a double agent ? another dangerous, self-deceiving form of neutrality ? as he passes information between Russia and the West, fatuous stuff which favours and imperils neither side but nonetheless leads to many political assassinations. If Allan is too dumb ? he quit school at 9 ? to have political awareness and moral awareness, he has an instinct for self-service. That makes this neutral exceedingly dangerous for everyone, however blessed his own accidental success may make him seem.The violent macho biker who eventually joins Allan's entourage qualifies by losing his memory. That's his form of neutering. It enables him to live with Allan, whom he had planned to kill, but also renders him incapable of responsible thought or action. In contrast to Allan's ignorance, the polymath Benny is neutered and neutralized by his excess of education, his inability to commit to any one discipline. He is an "almost" anything. At least Benny outgrows his neutrality by venturing into a relationship with Gunilla (and her 40-year-old elephant Sonja). Ultimately Allan's greatest gift is encouraging Benny not to stay neutralized like he is.In this vision Sweden has pretended to be neutral but bears a heavy responsibility for the violence and destruction to which she has been party ? however "innocently." The ostensibly neutral end up serving those who exploit them. Neutrality is thus not a moral advantage but an abdication of responsibility. Indeed this film proves prophetic. Sweden's latest blunder in "neutrality" is her premature recognition of the state of Palestine. By recognizing the Palestinian state Sweden is encouraging the Palestinians to not make peace with Israel. Sweden acts oblivious of the terms that ended the '67 war and also the 1933 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States. In the inflamed Middle East Sweden's "neutrality" is as blissfully ignorant, irresponsible and destructive as Allan Karlssen is ? without his silver-haired charm and his defence, senility.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Que sera sera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Centenarian Allan Karlsson (Robert Gustafsson) escapes from his old-age home just before his birthday celebration. He quickly ends up getting involved in a drug-money adventure, sought by both police and criminals. Will Allan be able to keep the money? More relevantly, does he even want it? During this adventure, we are shown flashbacks that tell Allan's remarkable life story. It turns out this shambling old Swede was a psychiatric inmate, mine demolition expert, Spanish Civil War hero, rocket scientist and spy. At one point or another, he was a saviour to Franco, Truman and Stalin.The two narratives are tied together by Allan's character. Allan is an unusually ingenuous man. He is apparently an intelligent man, but a child-like one with no direction, no political views, no sexual life. He lacks a moral sense. He has an obvious enjoyment of explosions and alcohol.He also has the tendency to lead his life from moment to moment. He seems to be rather oblivious to things around him, whether good or bad, treating death and fame, castration and enrichment, Franco and Stalin, in exactly the same way. He lets fate take him where it may. Que sera sera. He is both the victim and the beneficiary of circumstances and coincidences.Allan Karlsson is not a dumb Swede. He is not a Forrest Gump spewing platitudes like "life is like a box of chocolates". But like "Forrest Gump", this is a movie that presents a twisted, humorous fly-on-the-wall view of some of the grand events of the 20th century. History as the personal adventure of a strange character.I enjoyed this movie well enough. It was OK. I did find it funny at times, in a gentle and slapsticky sort of way. But it made me restless. I would not recommend it to a friend.Some of the film was not well executed, so I had a hard time believing it. The scenes in English in particular seemed off to me. Yes, I realise it was a comedy presenting a tongue-in-cheek view of history, and not meant to be realistic. Perhaps the problem was that the movie makers were not working with the budget necessary to make the grand events seem epic.Like FG, this movie will polarize audiences, with some loving it, and others not. I have to admit at this point that I was in the camp that did not really get FG. If you loved FG, you might like this movie more than I did.I suppose the point of the movie (if a comedy needs a point) is that amazing and wonderful things will happen if you just live in the moment and allow fate to take its course and enjoy boozy friendships. Maybe that's true. But I also know from personal experience that sobriety, goal-setting and planning are hugely important.Am I taking the movie too seriously? I found it difficult to decide whether the story was just a silly comedy or a profound story about fate, politics and history. Was it trying to be both? Was it neither? The movie lost me somewhat when Allan blithely and passively allowed himself to be castrated. Perhaps this was a metaphor for something political or social that has escaped me. The scene just disturbed me. It was hard for me to care about the character after that. Everything that happened to him after that tragedy just seemed so pointless.The movie is worth about 6.5, and it certainly keeps you guessing at what's going to happen, but I'm going to round that down because of my restlessness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hundred Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably one of the longest film titles I know, but it clearly tells you what to expect, I mainly took notice of this Swedish when it was nominated at the Academy Awards, I hoped for something interesting. Basically Allan Karlsson (Robert Gustafsson) has lived a long and colourful life, he finds himself stuck in a nursing home, seemingly his last stop, but Allan is still in good health, and he is not keen to celebrate his 100th birthday. So Allan decides to climb out of the window and disappear, for most people this would be the adventure of a lifetime, but this unexpected journey is not his first, he has already experienced so much in his lifetime. Allan finds himself getting into a strange situation where he has unintentionally stolen a traveller's luggage bag, it is full of thousands, if not millions, in drug money, along with some people he meets on his journey, with no determined final destination, he continues travelling to find something to do with this newfound fortune, with criminals hot on his trail. The film has many flashbacks seeing Allan as a child, where he gained a love for blowing things up, and we see him grow up into a man who continues this hobby, using it as a career, and getting in many interesting situations and meeting many interesting characters, as well historical figures along the way. Also starring Iwar Wiklander as Julius Jonsson, David Wiberg as Benny, Mia Skäringer as Gunilla, Jens Hultén as The Boss, Alan Ford as Pim, Ralph Carlsson as Chief Inspector Aronsson, Bianca Cruzeiro as Caracas, Sven Lönn as Bucket, David Shackleton as Herbert Einstein (Albert's brother); Tumba, Sonja and Thnog Suk as Sonja the Elephant, Pernilla Göst as Allan's Mother, Ola Björkman as Allan's Father, Kerry Shale as Harry S. Truman, Donald Högberg as Professor Lundborg, Algirdas Paulavicius as Josef Stalin, Sigitas Rackys as Gorbachev and Keith Chanter as Ronald Reagan. Gustafsson is likable as the very old man who goes through a number of adventures until reaching his tenth decade and proving that you're never too old to have another big adventure, I can see the comparison to Forrest Gump, where the leading character by chance enters many historical events and comes across significant people along the way, but it is not as cleverly done, this does have some nice and atmospheric moments, you do go along slightly with the story both in flashbacks and present day, and you cannot deny the makeup and hair to create ageing is fantastic, but it is not quite funny or enjoyable as other similar films, a fair and reasonable comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Makeup and Hairstyling. Okay!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forrest Gump II and a crime film merged into one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The 100 Year-old Man" is a reasonably enjoyable and quirky film. However, as you watch, no doubt you'll feel that you've seen it all before...which is not surprising. The film is sort of like a Swedish version of "Forrest Gump" merged with a crime film. The overall results are mixed. While the film is filled with wonderful ironies, many times these situations aren't all that funny. And, there is a definitely sweetness missing from this film that you had with "Forrest Gump".The story is about a stupid old man who escapes from a nursing home. Along the way, he steals money that belongs to an evil gang and the gang and the police are both looking for him--but for very different reasons. Along the way, the film has a lot of interludes where you see the central character, Allan, when he's younger and his many Cold War adventures.The film has many wonderful moments but the odd thing about it is that the flashbacks where Allan is involved in the Manhattan Project, meeting Truman, meeting Stalin and becoming a spy all are seriously flawed. First, there is no reason for these--they don't in any way relate to the rest of the film. So, there are Gump-like interludes within the film but they are completely irrelevant. Second, the transitions from today to the past are almost random. I think overall the film would have been better with NONE of these flashbacks and just stuck to the story about the stolen money, as this was much sweeter, funnier and entertaining. Seriously flawed but worth seeing.</fullReview>

I didn't know that this movie was based on a book, but I'd say that you don't have to have read the book to find the movie hilarious. Like "Forrest Gump" and "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" it incorporates real events into its fictional story. I guess that one could say that the movie reminds us that age is just a number that we apply to ourselves, because you've never had a series of experiences like this centenarian has! I have no doubt that you'll enjoy the movie. It goes to show that, yes, the Scandinavians CAN be funny.PS: Alan Ford is best known for roles in Guy Ritchie movies, but also appeared in "An American Werewolf in London" and "Chaplin".</fullReview>

When the movie came out - quite quickly I thought - I was a little wary of it, having seen so many good books really wrecked by the film making industry. However, I have to say that if you enjoyed the book (and you can cope with a little necessary pruning) you should enjoy the movie. It's very well done, it's very funny and it captures the essence of the book perfectly. The characters were well drawn and the flashbacks were condensed so that the story did not falter or fail but blended together sensibly. A good film for those with a perverse sense of humour.

		<shortDescription>the movie which blows</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really hated this movie a lot and I almost left the cinema. It just was a really bad Forrest Gump rip off. First of all: The main character is really annoying because of his stupidity. He never thinks about any consequences or other people. He keeps blowing things off and he doesn't care if people get killed. I guess those scenes should have been funny, but to me they just seemed really cold and cruel. He even helped building the atomic bomb (which killed thousands of Japanese btw) and is totally OK with it, because blowing up things is his favorite hobby.The plot is divided into two stories. The one where the old guy tells (someone?) about this past life which is very bizarre and unrealistic. He parties with dictators like Franco and Stalin. He escapes from the Gulag with Alfred Einsteins very stupid twin brother. And then there is the story that happens in the present where he kind of steals a suitcase full of money and never thinks about giving it back or doing something meaningful with it. Then the old guy finds some company which includes an elephant. There the story turns into a road movie where more people get killed just because they don't want to loose the money. The movie made no sense to me and the statement behind the story may be: Just wander around in life, not thinking and not caring about any living creatures. I felt so angry after leaving the cinema because this story was just boring, not funny at all and really stupid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, but still enjoyable mix-up of Forrest Gump and The Perfume</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A hundred-year old man gets mixed up with drug money and a band of misfits, whilst he recalls a life full of exploding stuff. It's a kind of story almost entirely based on humorous coincidences, and a long line of wacky side characters, including a whole lot of famous world leaders. You can compare it with Forrest Gump, since the story is told very much in the same fashion, but also with the Perfume as well, since people tend to die around the old man. I have serious issues with this part of the story (the death scenes), for even though the acting IS superb, and the side characters all are amazingly well written, it still can be a very uncomfortable watch. There are some seriously disturbing moments, once you pause to think about the consequences of what just happened. The main character pretty much just blunders through his life, incidentally causing disasters (and occasionally miracles). It reminds one of Mr. Maggoo, only if people died from his antics. The main problem of the movie is, that it does not hit the right mark between the macabre and the cartoonishly violent. If you want people to laugh at the violence, you either stay away from showing blood - or you overdo it. So even though the story flows very smoothly, the tone really is all over the place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On his hundredth birthday, Allan escapes from his nursing home to avoid the obligatory party with the mayor and press photographers. On his sortie he quickly meets with other oddballs and becomes embroiled with a criminal motorcycle gang who want to take back a suitcase full of money from him. It's a story that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. One by one, the old fogeys bump off all of the criminal Nazis chasing them. Then there is a backstory which is recounted through Allan having flashbacks every five minutes: "He shouted at me. All my life, people have shouted at me. Including my mother, she shouted when I was born. But then I must have shouted too." And boom, we're off onto another track, where Allan is blowing bridges up during the Spanish Civil War, partying with Stalin or escaping from prison with Albert Einstein's daft twin brother.I presume that the book somehow cleverly combined those little ditties which would explain its enormous success. The film, however, doesn't gel anything. It's not clever, it's just absurd, and feels like an inferior rehash of Forrest Gump in Scandinavia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The novel this is based on, has been a success in Sweden. The film is too, but does it deserve it? The 100-year-old escapes from elderly care, finds a suitcase with hot money, is followed by gangsters and meets interesting people on his way.That could be enough, but he also tells us about his life blowing up things, he meets Franco, Truman and Stalin too and that's the weak point. None of these memories are told in a funny way and the acting is not good. It could have been quite sufficient just to make this a violent road movie comedy, which would have been possible, if it wasn't for the novel.But that road movie acting is good and thanks to this, the film is more than bad slapstick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some funny moments, but cold hearted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with rasmushistoriker's review that the tone is wrong. As a middle aged Swede, I am used to that kind of cynical humor, but my 12-year old had a shocked reaction to the way the main (supposedly likable) characters showed no remorse or sadness when they killed a number of people. And that it was presented as normal, not as a character flaw. (from a kid who plays some violent video games, likes Kickass and thinks cartoon type violence is fun) This is a violent film with horrible tragedies treated flippantly. Some funny scenes, but no heart. There are a lot better ways to spend 90 minutes, (I would suggest Four Lions, Win Win and In A World if you want comedies with a heart).</fullReview>
