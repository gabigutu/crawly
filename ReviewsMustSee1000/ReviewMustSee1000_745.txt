		<shortDescription>Amazingly objective and moving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm astonished how a filmmaker notorious for his political left-wing fervor could make such a subtle, non-sanctimonious picture. If you're for capital punishment, you'll still be for it after seeing this. If you're against capital punishment, you'll still be against it. But whatever your stance is, this movie will, at the very least, make you reflect on why you feel the way you do. There's not one false note in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dead Man's Last Words</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Robbins's 'Dead Man Walking' is a brave piece of cinema. Though the film is about a man on death row and a nun's struggle to help him, I liked how he presented both sides of the central theme of capital punishment. This isn't a preachy film about capital punishment being wrong or right as I doubt one's opinion would change on that after watching the movie. But, it's more of a subtle movie that tells the story of two people who form an unlikely friendship.This couldn't have been an easy film to make yet he manages to pull it off. Poncelet is a ruthless murderer and in no way does Robbins condone what he has done but he and actor Sean Penn manage to win Poncelet the viewer's sympathy. The execution is terrific. The last scene particularly stands out. We see, in flashback, what had happened while Poncelet meets his ultimate fate. We see how he and Helen make the final connection, we see remorse in his eyes, we see him dying a slow death and at the same time the horror of the crime is exposed to us. We know that what he did is unforgivable but he finally took responsibility for that which allows us to see him as a human being rather than a ruthless killer. This also makes the whole tragedy more astonishing because you just ponder, like Sister Helen, on how such a normal human being commit such a heinous deed? Both Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon deliver powerful performances. We pretty much see most of the film from Helen's point of view. Sarandon clearly has put a lot of heart into the role as she skillfully downplays her part showing tremendous depth and pathos. Sean Penn plays his difficult complex character with ease. The supporting cast do well (watch out for a young Jack Black and Peter Sarsgaard).The score is mesmerizing, especially the Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan tracks. I also felt that sense of isolation that was brought out in the prison scenes. The terrific writing grips the viewer's attention right from the start. Even though we can predict Poncelet's fate, we are drawn into the fascinating transforming journey of these two intriguing characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought provoking film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Robbins did a masterful job directing this film. I say this because he avoided convention and cliché. He also oversaw superb performances from Susan Sarandon (who won an Oscar for her role) and Sean Penn. Even more amazing, Robbins doesn't patronize. He just tells the story and lets the events play on the viewer's mind. This is so effective because it allows the viewer to form his own opinions on the death penalty, one of the most controversial subjects of our time, without being unfairly manipulated in either direction. I can't recommend this film enough, 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen many films that really, truly made me rethink a long-held position or opinion on a thorny issue, but "Dead Man Walking" is one of them.I read Sr. Helen Prejean's book, upon which this film was based, when it first came out in 1993. At that time I was utterly supportive of capital punishment -- to quote the script, I felt anyone who committed crimes horrible enough to land them on Death Row was an "expendable human being, suckin' up tax dollars." I also had personal experience with the issue when an entire family whom I knew in my childhood were slaughtered by a man who is now on Death Row for his crimes.As you might imagine, I was disgusted with Sr. Helen's book. I thought that trotting to death row and holding the hand of some scumbag who'd killed innocent people was about the lowest thing anyone could do, and as a Catholic I was offended by the seeming hypocrisy of it.Because I had disliked the book, I never saw the film until about two weeks ago, when I bought a remaindered copy of it in a video store. I have watched it four times since then, mostly because I am trying to work out my feelings on it. I am still a supporter of capital punishment, but it's going to be less easy for me to ignore the fact that (to quote again), "There's nobody with money on Death Row" -- and quite a few more blacks, now that I think of it, AND the fact that, like Matthew Poncelet's character, the men who are being executed are human beings who have feelings and fears. It's easy to jeer at Matthew on the day before his execution, fretting nervously about whether the lethal injection will "hurt," like a little boy at the doctor's office for a penicillin shot, since his victims' last moments certainly "hurt." What isn't easy is to realize that while the victims of these inmates didn't know they were about to die until it was too late, the inmates themselves have what seems like a blessing at first, but upon deeper examination is the greatest curse: knowing the exact hour and day they will die, and having to face it day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute.I'm sorry if this review offends people who are sincere death penalty supporters. I still consider myself to be one, but my thinking has been reformed somewhat and I'm more ready to listen to the opponents and try to make compromises; maybe that's what this issue needs more than anything. I will say finally that ONE part of this film did offend me as a Catholic: the symbolic "crucifixion" of Poncelet during the "last words" scene. That was the one place where Robbins strayed from his even-handed approach to the issue -- the only one I could find.In all, this was a fine film that made me rethink an explosive issue, and I recommend it highly to anyone debating the pros and cons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dead Man Walking" is a piece of incredible filmmaking. All the acting is top-notch and realistic, and the script examines the issue of the death penalty from both sides, paying equal homage to both. Above all, this is a deeply moving story of redemption, of death with dignity and loss of ego. Any film that deals this courageously and maturely with such incredibly difficult subject matter deserves a rating of 10/10. Thank you, Tim Robbins!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sarandon?riding along into the sunset?with Sean Penn?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'It's easy to kill a monster, but it's hard to kill a human being.'Set in St. Thomas Housing Project and Angola Prison in New Orleans, "Dead Man Walking" is the true story of Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon), a Louisiana nun Sister who befriended Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn), a murderer and a rapist bound for a lethal injection machine for killing a teenage couple? Sister Helen agrees to help the convict and to remain with him till the end?an act never before attempted by a woman? At their first meeting, Poncelet swears to the nun that his accomplice was the one who shot both of the kids and pleads her help for a new trial in order to convince the pardon board hearing to spare his life? The film challenges the audience to actually give some thought to the human consequences of the death penalty, but gives voice to angry bereaved parents whose kids were shot, stabbed, raped, and left in the woods to die alone? As Poncelet's execution looms closer and closer, his character is seen deceptively complex, harboring doubts about the rightness of what they were doing to him? In one moment, we hear him sensitive asking for a lie detector test to let his mother know that he is innocent, in another we see him furious playing the victim, blaming the government, drugs, blacks, the kids for being there? Poncelet never understood that he has robbed the Percys and the Delacroixs so much, giving them nothing but sorrow? They are never going to see their children again, never going to hold them, to love them, to laugh with them? In the scenes leading up to his execution, the death-row inmate drops his terrible facade and reveals his identity? Luckily both Sarandon and Penn are here exceptional?carrying out successfully an exquisite, tangible harmony of souls? When Sarandon was looking at Penn, she was projecting compassionate eyes brimming with tears? She asks him to visualize her as he dies? ''I want the last thing you see in this world to be the face of love''?in that moment, we truly believed that she'll be the face of love for him?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Performance by Susan Sarandon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a world in which debatable and misunderstood subjects can be listed endlessly, this powerful 1995 film takes on one at the top of that list; moreover, it does it objectively and realistically, and with a sensibility and sensitivity that makes it a truly great film by anyone's measuring stick. And to add some irony to it all, even the subject matter of this film has been widely misunderstood, as it is wrongly perceived that this is a film about the pros and cons of the death penalty; it is not. At the heart of `Dead Man Walking,' directed by Tim Robbins, is a subject that in reality is possibly the most misunderstood of all, and with good reason, because it just may be the hardest thing there is for a human being to really-- and truly-- understand. And it is what this film is actually all about: Forgiveness. Real forgiveness; not excusing a heinous crime or the perpetrator thereof-- not saying that what's happened is okay-- but finding the strength to go on, and to do so by choosing life. Director/screenwriter Tim Robbins has crafted and delivered a faithful adaptation of the novel by Sister Helen Prejean, in which she discusses her involvement with the death-row inmates to whom over the years she has ministered her faith in God. As chronicled in the film, what for her was to become a lifelong pursuit of not only justice, but human dignity, began with a simple letter from a death-row inmate at the Louisiana State Prison at Angola. Sentenced to death for rape and murder, Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn) was reaching out to anyone who would listen, when his letter ended up in the hands of Sister Prejean (Susan Sarandon), who soon found herself venturing into a territory of which she had absolutely no knowledge or experience. And Robbins has successfully captured Sister Prejean's emotional and turbulent journey succinctly, while managing to keep it devoid of any maudlin sentimentality, which makes it not only real, credible and believable, but makes it a poignant and thoroughly emotionally involving experience for the audience. Through the medium of the cinema, what was once a personal, significant emotional experience for Sister Prejean, becomes one for everyone who sees this film, as well. For her soul-stirring, impassioned portrayal of Sister Prejean, Susan Sarandon deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actress. Sensitive and fraught with emotional depth, her performance is incredibly touching and real, especially in the way in which she conveys Sister Prejean's underlying natural fragility and vulnerability, which she adamantly tempered with the toughness she needed to carry on with her endeavors on behalf of Poncelet (and in reality, a total of five since she began). Whatever your point of view regarding the matters examined in this film, Sister Prejean is without question an individual of heroic proportions, which Sarandon exquisitely personifies here; and she does it without resorting to any superfluous melodramatics, but rather by keeping it real, by subtly and humbly exploring the humanity of the person in a very believable expression of characterization. It's an extraordinary performance, arguably the best of Sarandon's brilliant career.  Turning in a career-best performance, as well, is Sean Penn, who was nominated for Best Actor for his portrayal of Poncelet (he lost out to Nicolas Cage, who won for his performance in `Leaving Las Vegas). Perfect for the part in every way, Penn has quite simply never been better, before or since. He effectively presents Poncelet as a real person, rather than as an overblown caricature of a monster capable of perpetrating the crimes depicted here. Not that it makes Poncelet any less despicable; just the opposite, in fact. It makes it genuinely disconcerting to be faced with the fact that someone who looks like a guy who could live next door to you could be capable of such things. And that's the strength of Penn's performance-- it's so disturbingly real, presented with depth and nuance; you have but to look into his eyes to find the imperfections of a troubled soul. A terrific performance, and -- as good as Cage was in `Vegas'-- Penn should have received the Oscar for it. In another stand-out performance, Raymond J. Barry is memorable in a supporting role as Earl Delacroix, father of one of Poncelet's victims. With limited screen time, he nevertheless develops his character in such a way that enables you to empathize with him, as well as with Sister Prejean, as it is through him that we are given some insight into just how complex and seemingly tenuous her position is, at least on the surface. Barry presents Delacroix in such a way that gives the necessary balance and perspective to the story, which is ultimately extremely effective and helps to underscore the message of the film. The supporting cast includes R. Lee Emery (Clyde Percy), Celia Weston (Mary Beth Percy), Lois Smith (Helen's Mother), Scott Wilson (Chaplin Farley), Roberta Maxwell (Lucille Poncelet), Margo Martindale (Sister Colleen) and Jack Black (Craig Poncelet). It is doubtful that this film will change anyone's mind one way or another about the death penalty, but that was never the intention; what was intended, was to make a thought-provoking, emotionally involving film, which is exactly what Robbins has accomplished with `Dead Man Walking.' Regardless of your personal point of view, this film will have an impact, and hopefully will open some minds to the true nature of forgiveness. For, as we see through the character of Earl Delacroix, true forgiveness is not something one merely decides to do, but is a task that can become a lifetime's work. And it's possibly one of the hardest things in life to effectively accomplish; and you come away from this film with an appreciation for individuals like Sister Prejean, who has selflessly dedicated her life to helping those in need, and to filmmakers like Robbins and Sarandon for bringing her to life for millions of people who otherwise would never have known her. I rate this one 10/10. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dead Man Walking" deals with one nun's struggle (Susan Sarandon in her Oscar-winning part) to help a convicted death row inmate (Sean Penn in an Oscar-nominated role) come to terms with his imminent execution. Writer-director Tim Robbins does something very difficult in this film, he makes us care about the unsympathetic character that Penn plays. Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn dominate the film in every aspect imaginable, they play a complicated chess match at times and eventually become close friends by the end of the picture. The fact that Sarandon and Robbins are openly against the death penalty in real life just adds to this film. Their strong opinion on the subject leads to an unforgettable motion picture that is made well and performed well by the two leads. 4.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How do you know if a movie is good or not? It is the impact it has on you that makes the difference. "Dead Man Walking" upset me a great deal. I watched it twice. I don't know if I will be strong enough to watch it again. No, I did not feel good at all after watching it, but the film was as successful as it can be.Robbins did a great job in incorporating all aspects of this controversial topic. He avoided making an argument that could easily be seen as biased or subjective. I hope that many people get to see "Dead Man Walking". I believe that anyone who supports or opposes the death penalty so enthusiastically should see the movie.I don't know what else it could take to finally convince everyone that this relic from ancient times does not have a place in modern society anymore.The movie itself does not make an argument for or against death penalty. It describes reality. The reality is the best argument against the death penalty.A 10/10 for great performances, good filmmaking, and for the most important film made in yearsThank you, Tim Robbins!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dead Man Walking" is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen. I find it hard to believe that anyone, after having seen the movie, could feel indifferent about the film or its message. Tim Robbins does not try to impose his ideas and beliefs on the viewers, but manages to make a film that are in most ways sympathetic to both views on the death penalty -- whether it is right to murder a murderer or not. I have always known where I stand in this question, even as a child, and this movie -- despite the fact that it does not really take any sides -- made me even surer in my conviction that it can never be right to murder *anyone*.Sean Penn is absolutely brilliant in his portrayal of Matthew Poncelet, his nomination for an Academy Award was very well-deserved. Even if Nicolas Cage does a great job in "Leaving Las Vegas", I would have been happier if Penn had won the award. Susan Sarandon is also brilliant and she deserved the Academy Award she won. And Tim Robbins certainly deserves the vote I have given this film: 9/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sensitive treatment of a controversial topic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming from the Hollywood couple notorious for their strong political convictions and social consciousness, "Dead Man Walking" is a multi-layered and thorough examination of a controversial issue. With this film, Tim Robbins really proves himself as a writer and a director, leaving no stones unturned in addressing the many key elements of capital punishment. In what I consider the best film of 1995, Robbins' take on the death penalty is both compassionate and incisive. Though he, Susan Sarandon, and Sister Helen Prejean (the Catholic nun who wrote the book upon which the movie is based) are against the death penalty, "Dead Man Walking" goes to great lengths to encourage debate and to examine the issue from all angles. It provides us with just as many arguments for capital punishment as it provides against capital punishment."Dead Man Walking" is perhaps most successful in depicting the families of both the murderer and his two victims. The scene in which Sister Helen visits Mr. Delacroix (father of the male victim) after he has criticized her for not doing so in the first place is particularly moving. As the scene ends, the camera slowly moves back, revealing a quiet and still living room. This shot alone perfectly suggests the shattering toll a murder takes on a family. In fact, this film has plenty of subjective camerawork that is both subtle and potent at the same time. Never does Robbins' feel that he has to hammer in the pain that these families face.Sean Penn gives the performance of his career as Matthew Poncelet, the trailer-trashy and racist death-row inmate. This is the role that should have won him the Oscar, had there been any justice. A great testament to Penn's acting is that he does not try to win sympathy for his character. He simply plays Poncelet as is, and presents him as human, in the process. I have seen this film many times over the years and my heart still skips a beat when Poncelet finally lets go of his ego and owns up to his responsibility in the murders.Susan Sarandon is simply wonderful as Sister Helen Prejean, playing her with a combination of bravery and vulnerablility. It is also great to see a Catholic nun depicted in a non-stereotypical way. Just as Penn gives a human face to a hardened criminal, Sarandon makes Sister Helen equally human.I also strongly recommend the book! I have read it twice myself and I am sure that I will be affected by it once more the next time I pick it up. By reading the book, you will notice that Robbins has taken a few liberties with the actual events. The character Matthew Poncelet is actually an amalgamation of two death row inmates that Sister Helen describes in her book. The spirit and compassion of the book is dead-on accurate. It amazes me that Robbins' screenplay adaptation was not even nominated for an Oscar in addition to the other four nominations this movie did receive. As far as I am concerned, Robbins' direction and writing are assured, and I continue to look forward to his next projects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot more than a debate on capital punishment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SpoilersThe easiest thing is to turn a comment on DMW into en emotional debate on capital punishment. Let's just put that aside for a moment. Watching the scene of the last gathering with the family in the afternoon before the midnight execution may make some of us recall similar images, of sitting around with beloved family and friends, saying a different kind of goodbye. The comparison is not that ridiculous, and the sentiment is well reflected in songs over the years, from 'Harbor Light' to 'Leaving on a Jet Plane'. And the similarity is not that far fetched, as in some cases, you may not know when you'll see them again. You try to sound controlled, engage in small talks, refusing to break down. Then you hear 'Now is the Hour' (for those who still remember that one) in your mind. Among other things, DMW focuses on the development of the relationship between two people, convicted murderer-rapist Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn) who struggles to grab a straw to haul himself out of the death sentence and Sister Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon), who answers to that call but is not sure of she can handle the challenge. It's most interesting to observe how the camera takes us through the stages of this development. We start out seeing them exactly the way they see each other, through the wire screen that divides the prisoner and the visitor. Then, the camera moves past the wire screen, and we start to see the faces behind them, but with the shadow of the grate cast on the faces. Then, we finally get the clean shots of the faces, as if there is nothing between them. Once we get beyond realism into the camera's world, various techniques present interesting possibilities. Effectively used is the favorite technique of simultaneously showing the face of the speaker as-is, and the reflection of the listener on the glass panel dividing them. We also see dialogues presented in sideways profiles of the faces of the two facing each other from opposite ends of the movie screen. Through these visual images, we follow the development of the relationship between these two human beings from the initial stance of sizing up each other, to the silent shaping of the final words 'I love you' and 'I love you too' (not in any erotic sense) the minute before the execution.In addition to the very fundamental premises like good and evil, faith, forgiveness, prejudice, DMW touches on many other things. For example, there is the issue of how to survive after losing a child. Two recent good films dealing with this that immediately come to mind are In the Bedroom and Moonlight Mile. Susan Sarandon actually starred in the latter.As the depiction of the two key characters deepens, we see more and more of their human side. When confronted by victim's father Earl Delacroix, Sister Helen is caught a little unprepared, and, after trying to explain that she did not intent to ignore the victims' parents, offers her card and asks him to call her when in need. 'Me call you? How arrogant!' said Earl Delacroix. Of course, he is absolutely right. This just goes to show that to err is human and Sister Helen is, after all, human. For Matthew Poncelet, we see him playing cool and tough throughout most of the film, but finally breaks down, regretting that his tough talks about wanting to join the Nazis had reduced his already slim chance for pardon. And both are not devoid of a sense of humor. Even on the day before the execution, when Matthew lights a cigarette, Sister Helen quips, 'Those things will kill you'.Most of the audience would have at least some degree of sympathy for Matthew, until toward the very end when it is revealed that he did take part in the murder and rape. At that point, some of those sympathy would evaporate, I'm not sure how much, but would think a lot. Even if the final verdict is that he deserves capital punishment, there is still one question. The prison guard said to Sister Helen, 'In Louisiana, when we say life sentence, it is' (something to that effect), meaning that there is absolutely no chance of parole. I'm not sure, which is the worse punishment, and which fits the crime ? being put to death or allowed to live on with no hope of ever leaving the prison cell.Sean Penn got a shot at the Oscar, and lost to Nick Cage. Lost two more tries (1999, 2001) and finally won last year with Mystic River. Susan Sarandon won her well deserved Oscar, after 4 previous tries (starting in 1981 with Atlantic City), a gift of sorts form husband and director Tim Robbins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too important for some people to appreciate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must have seen this movie about four or five times already, and it gets better with each viewing. Suffice it to say: This is the best film I've ever seen. And I think I've seen a lot.But I've always wondered why this film got so shunned in some reviews or ratings. For example, take the IMDb Top 250. Why does it rank only at #216 (as of today)? Surely, the answer's not in the film itself (because that is nothing but flawless), but in its reception. The film caused controversy in its portrayal of compassion for a convicted murderer and its anti-death penalty attitude. And so, obviously, the more conservative-minded user probably didn't like the film (as you can see from some of the other comments). So DEAD MAN WALKING gets a ranking that's nothing but ridiculous in relation to its quality. Those people didn't understand what the film wanted to say, and maybe they didn't WANT to understand, being pro death penalty. So now I get it: It's all political. You're pro death penalty- you don't like (and therefore don't want to hear) what the film has to say.I'm truly sorry there are still so many people out there who simply tune out when a new perspective questions their beliefs.Mr. Robbins, your movie's issue split people's opinions. Some reconsidered their point-of-view, some simply didn't listen, but you made a very important point. Your movie will probably never show up on any "TOP 100 MOVIES OF ALL TIME"-list, but it'll be remembered, long after films like Braveheart or Babe or Apollo 13 (all of which were unjustly preferred over your film at the Oscars 1996) are forgotten. Congratulations, Mr. Robbins, and thank you for this important piece of filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a perfect example of Film as a combination of art and entertainment and social consciousness. "Dead Man Walking" is less about capital punishment than about personal responsibility and redemption. Based on the book by Sister Helen Prejean, who spent many years helping death row inmates come to terms with their crimes and punishments, this film rises above the debate about whether it's wrong to "kill someone to show that killing someone is wrong". You find yourself caring about everyone in this movie: the young rape/murder victims; their grieving parents, one filled with hate, the other two inconsolable; the parents of the perpetrator of this crime; the nun who tries to do God's work in a place that is literally the last stop before hell for many men; even the prison guards who must do their job calmly and competently as they guide a man across the River Styx.Sean Penn is an actor on the calibre of James Dean, reaching deep inside himself and putting his emotions on the table. Here, he somehow manages to find the right blend of odious and pathetic, and his portrayal is so very real that it hurts, even though his character is not a nice person at all. Susan Sarandon and hubby-director Tim Robbins have created a masterpiece, which provokes thought and discussion long after the film is over. This movie runs deep, but rather than resort to shameless manipulation and plot devices, it is real, and tough, and touching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's really good about "Dead Man Walking" is that it shows Matthew Poncelet's (Sean Penn) side of the story, but it never portrays him as a hero. We understand that, and Sister Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon) understands that. Sarandon definitely deserved her Best Actress Oscar for this movie (I can't believe that it took her so long to win one). Never preachy, the movie shows all sides of the story in looking at Poncelet's approaching execution. Among other things, this movie should dispel the notion that they don't make movies like they used to - although this one is over ten years old. A true classic in every sense of the word.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy effort by all concerned.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Robbins takes this film beyond its implicit political message and produces a moving piece of art. Though the underlying anti-death penalty moral is prevalent, the director never becomes tendentious. He intersperses the plight of death row inmate Matthew Poncelet with gruesome, if not surreal, images of the crime that he committed. And where one would expect a juxtaposition of the brutality of Poncelet's (and his co-perpetrator's) nefarious act with an equally cruel demonstration of state-sponsored execution, Robbins shows Poncelet's death to be clinical and quiet in comparison to his sordid deed. It is this type of restraint that not only adds credibility to the work but also power. The performances of Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon as Poncelet and Sister Helen Prejean respectively, are stellar. Penn's grim nuance pervades his character as he moves from stoical rancor to the contrition that provides the denouement. With the incisiveness in which his acting has become associated he provides the edge in which Sarandon impinges her role. Appearing perpetually exhausted, she immerses herself in the sturm and drang of her part and counters Penn's fringe with an enveloping emollient. Even her expostulations and attempts to save Poncelet from perdition do not even approach pontification or the banal. In the end this movie did not change my opinion on the death penalty; such conversions only occur via gradation. However it did leave a lasting impression on me as powerful as its provocative subject matter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was suspenseful, riveting and emotional. A pure drama that contained a unique look at the death penalty system - from a legal and personal point of view.Fortunately, the movie was very evenhanded. I felt good arguments were being made for and against. Though it should be pointed out that any arguments for or against were tucked neatly away behind the scenes.The real point of the movie was the relationship between Susan Sarandon (nun) and Sean Penn (murderer). Both performances were worthy of Oscar consideration and expressed the enormously intense emotions which take place during the final weeks of one's life on death row. I certainly will never look at it the death penalty without seeing it in through the prism of this movie.Why not a 10? I don't know. I guess I just want to give 10's to movies that I love. Though this movie was brilliant and I know of no legitimate criticism, a 9 it is for me. Hard to love death penalty stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sister Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon) works with the poor and befriends Death Row Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn) held in the Louisiana State Penitentiary. She had never visited a prison. He was convicted of killing a teen couple but he insists that his older partner Carl Vitello had actually done the killing. He seems to be a well-mannered but slightly racist. He asked for her help and she brings in lawyer Hilton Barber (Robert Prosky) to try for a pardon. Politics is pushing for his execution. She meets his mother and the parents of his victims.At first, one expects a Hollywood innocent man falsely convicted. However, the movie unfolds in a way that it's more about the characters. The acting is superb. Sarandon is compelling but Sean Penn is sublime. He embodies the dark side even as he pleads his innocence. It's enhanced by the different versions of the incident. The big scene for me is the family preparing for the execution. Roberta Maxwell is amazing in her scenes. There is something very haunting about the regimented procedures of that day.</fullReview>

The work demands deep self reflection from all but those to fearful of what they may find.The wonderful things that people here on IMDb have said are truly a testament to the power of this film and to the capacity of human empathy and love to eventually triumph.The contradictions of many organised religions, and 'civilised' societies is truthfully and painfully considered, together with the sometimes invisible capacity to hate that lies within us all.The final scene depicting the children's message to me is the most powerful scene of the film. It' offers hope for Helen, and gives her the motivation to carry on.I'll watch it again and again to evaluate my own motivations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolutely emotional film that teaches forgiveness and change like no other story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually when someone murders and rapes an innocent person, our instant gut reaction is to have that man killed and that he is labeled as a cold-hearten killer. When the act is extremely difficult to forgive, writer/director Tim Robbins proves even the most heinous crimes are forgivable. 'Dead Man Walking' is the story of a man named Matthew Poncelet (a brilliant Sean Penn), a man who is convicted of murdering a young couple alongside another criminal, and Sister Helen Prejean (a superb Susan Sarandon), a nun who works with Poncelet as a spiritual guider before his execution. The two form a relationship that at first is rough, but ends up to a beautiful friendship that provides hope for Matthew Poncelet and turns into a mission for Sister Helen to save this mans soul. Sister Helen visits the families of those who lost their son and daughter, and are furious as expected and want Poncelet killed instantly. Matthew Poncelet still denies killing either one of the kids, and insists ion being proved innocent. However, everyone except Sister Helen and the tiny family on Matthew want his to bite the dust. The film is very powerful and emotional and it gives you lots to feel about that takes your emotional system on a wild roller coaster. At points you'll want Sean Penn's character to die immediately, and at other times you'll love him to death. That's the mastery of Tim Robbins' writing, he portrays Matthew Poncelet as a human being rather than a sick killer. His directing is perfect as well, and flashback scenes, and prison scenes are shot spectacularly. The film has strong messages of forgiveness and that how people are people no matter what they have done, and that sometimes showing kindness can change people. The film is a monument. As far as acting goes, you will never find two better leading performances better than Susan Sarandon's and Sean Penn's. Each character is superb and shows strong emotions and takes Tim Robbins's interesting characters and turns them into legends. Films that make us emotional stick with us forever, and with 'Dead Man Walking' you'll get an emotional drama that takes on a social issue and teaches society important messages of forgiveness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It made me question everything I believed in about the death penalty. I always thought I knew how I felt but I was wrong. I don't. When I watched this film, other feelings arose in my heart. Instead of only feeling for the families of the victims, I also felt for the family of Matthew Poncelet and even Matthew Poncelet himself. What he did to those kids was disgusting but what the government did to him was sick too. Sister Helen Prejean is the most courageous woman I have ever read about. I think I would be too scared to do what she did. Not a lot of people can open their hearts up the way she did. She remind me of the saying...The less we see with our eyes, the more we see with our hearts. She allowed herself to see another side of Mr. Poncelet, a side that people didn't want to see. The scene when he was speaking with his family before his execution killed me, especially when they weren't allowed to touch him. But when he admitted to what he had done, I started to cry. I cried, not only because Sean Penn is brilliant, but because I realized that the bigger half of me did NOT want him to die. Sister Prejean is my hero...and for me, that isn't a term I take lightly. I mean, I have people in my life that I hold to a high standard and want to emulate them as best I can. But never a hero. To me a hero is someone who is willing to risk their lives for what they believe. A hero is someone who opens their heart to all people and is willing to fight until the very end. Someone who makes me re-think myself and what I stand for. But most of all is someone who makes me wonder...Am I willing to go that far? Is any of us?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Provocative, moving, and remarkably even-handed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies are the best when they don't do the thinking for you. The give you all the information and let you decide what to think for yourself. "Dead Man Walking" is like that, and it's especially remarkable for succeeding in this given the nature of the subject matter and who made it (Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon are well-known for being opponents of the death penalty).Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn) has been convicted of rape and a double homicide, and has been sentenced to die. He writes to a nun, Sister Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon) to help him with some last minute appeals, and she ends up becoming his spiritual adviser. It isn't easy for either of them. Matthew is as reprehensible as they come, and Sister Helen often wonders how she can do this, and if she can keep doing it."Dead Man Walking" is less about the story of these two individuals than it is an examination of their characters, and how they react to the extraordinary situation that they find themselves in. Through this, writer (from Sister Helen Prejean's book) and director Tim Robbins is able to examine every side of the death penalty issue. This is possible because Sister Helen Prejean is our guide into this story, and though she is Matthew's spiritual adviser (and friend), she remains impartial to what happened. This is key because it allows for an even-handed look at the death penalty issue."Dead Man Walking" is a very even-handed film. It doesn't take sides, and will unlikely change anyone's mind about the issue. In a way, she is like a reporter, interviewing everyone involved and finding information. But when she talks to people, Sister Helen is not trying to find out what happened. She offers consolation to the parties involved, and by doing this, she remains impartial and the film avoids the trap of becoming a courtroom drama.Susan Sarandon is wonderful as Sister Helen. She brings warmth to a cold film, and offers love and companionship to Matthew. Sarandon's performance always works, but there are moments where she shines, especially when she's talking to Matthew. She ably conveys her conflicting emotions between what she feels and what she has to do.Sean Penn is a powerful actor who can electrify the screen in a way no one else can. His portrayal of Matthew Poncelet is superb. He makes Matthew a man who is not easy to like, but nevertheless earns our sympathy. Matthew is a fully three-dimensional character, and he is the perfect foil for Sister Helen. There is a fine line between being reprehensible and sympathetic, and Penn is talented enough to find it and still stay in character.While the focus of "Dead Man Walking" is on Matthew and Sister Helen, Robbins does not shy away from examining the other people in this story. Some very powerful scenes are when Helen talks to the families of the victims. The scenes with the Percys (R. Lee Ermey and Celia Weston) are probably the most heartbreaking, but for me, I felt more of a connection with Earl Delacroix (Raymond J. Barry). He's angry and hateful, but he is willing to accept Sister Helen's help. Robbins knows that of the parents, he has the most room to breathe, and Robbins spends more time with him.Unfortunately, I can't give "Dead Man Walking" a 10 because of some small faults here and there, but mainly because it isn't as powerful as it aspires to be. Don't get me wrong, "Dead Man Walking" is a wonderful film, and very powerful, but it's just not as good as it tries to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>..if you haven't been in prison, how can you comment on it?..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dead Man Walking" is about as perfect a movie as you will find. I've read every comment, and am not surprised there are so few negative reviews. The best review I read was written by "Xrandy" of Korea. That commentary is poetic.As most people have said, this movie is to make you think - it doesn't force its premise upon you. Yes, I suppose it does present every side of such a heartbreaking crime: but, if you haven't experienced any part of it, why even attempt to explain it? IMDb is more than repeating the plot: it's about understand situations totally foreign to you. To lose loved-ones in such a horribly unrealistic way would certainly devastate any caring human.....parent or not. Yes, I often cry for revenge for these inhumane crimes - think of the terror one would feel knowing al-Qaidi is standing behind you about to saw-off your head.......so, I try to reason "let he who is without sin throw the first stone". Ain't easy.I'm from Louisiana, and can tell you Angola was/is one of the worst prisons. What you saw in this film has really been cleaned-up, especially for the era the film is about. I'm sure you noticed the "chain-gang" as the nun drove toward it. And, believe-it-or-not, that cruelty provides escape for prisoners on them. They are outside, keeping their bodies strong. Of course, men on death-row do not have that privilege. Several remarks are made "people on death-row don't have any money"; "there are no rich men on death-row". We are told his attorney didn't make too many "objections" during the trial.....trusting twelve imperfect people to decide on another's life should recall "The Juror", "Time to Kill", and "Runaway Jury".It is my true belief anyone who knows they are going to die on a certain date - at a certain time - will attempt to escape that fate. I found it totally believable that "Matthew Poncelet" desperately grasped for any help he could find, only to find that he hated himself as much as those he had so terribly hurt. "The Sister" even tells him point-blank what a monster he was, and said she wasn't sure she liked him. "Brought-up poor?" and "we both live with poor people" are messages in themselves. I think Susan Sarandon's (PreJean) expressions demonstrated without fault how the progression from revulsion to real respect for the convict took place. Sean Penn's (Poncelet) expressions revealed his character's true self-revulsion lay near the surface of his tough-guy stance. Here are two roles which could hardly be re-created. Raymond Barry was the personification of an inconsolable parent. His admission of hatred for "Poncelet" ("Pon-sa-lay" in Cajon French) is tempered by both he and PreJean praying together in the rural church, at least trying. If you've never unconditionally forgiven, you have no idea how "freeing" it is.None of the commentaries mentioned "Poncelet" had been in the Vietnam war - remember the numbers tattooed on his leg? Was I the only one to see that? How can we not understand that teaching people to "kill everything" just doesn't go away? One commentator said it was unforgivable if we forgot the names of the two people the movie was really about - "Hope" and "Walter".Matters not to me that Tim Robbins has a strong revulsion to capital punishment - his movie is powerfully disturbing. Every one of the cast was superb - even the prison-nurse in the bathroom scene. Robbins gives you plenty of time to ponder the heavy issues in this film. So glad there wasn't any violence nor random killing, except for the torturous ones in the Louisiana woodsBravo, Tim ! Brava, Sarandon! Magicial acting with heart-rending vulnerability. If ever an Oscar were earned, she did it. Bravo, Penn! You were robbed of an Oscar. Loved your Pompadour !!! I was shocked by the "cruxificion" scene - but, do remember that "Poncelet" was not standing erectly when he was strapped-in. We now know that even murderers do have souls, "Poncelet's" final dialog revealing it. The "I love yous" at the end were necessary, because they were true. I am thankful to be given this insight into such human strength and frailty. More, please.....20.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting, politically thought-provoking, excellent. (spoilers!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dead Man Walking is a powerful film. Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn are at their very best, and Tim Robbins' direction is great. What is perhaps most impressive is that it tackles one of the most complicated and controversial political issues of the day with startling intelligence for a Hollywood movie.Sean Penn plays Matthew Poncelet, a man on death row for the murder of two teenagers. Susan Sarandon plays Helen Prejean, a nun committed to helping Poncelet accept his responsibility for the crime and die with dignity.This movie stands out among "prison" movies because, as the chaplain tells Sister Helen, there's none of that "he's innocent, he just needs someone to believe him" stuff. Unlike in other prison movies, no attempt is made to absolve the wrongdoer of guilt. Helen only tries to convince people that he doesn't deserve to die. This is a refreshing approach for a movie, especially since the "friend crusading to prove wrongfully-accused man's innocence" persona is so overdone in many movies. Tim Robbins' script does an excellent job of keeping Poncelet from becoming a martyr figure; there are no excuses made for his crimes, and his own foolishness is shown by all the racist remarks he makes to the press. Poncelet is a complicated character, but Penn does an excellent job playing him and Robbins shows him in just the right light.Now, onto the politics of the film. First of all, many people can't figure out if this movie is pro-death penalty or anti-death penalty. It's neither. Asking if the movie is for or against the death penalty is too broad a question. Instead, we should ask: does the film give the sense that Poncelet deserves to die? Does the film give the sense that justice was done? Did Poncelet deserve to be loved? Does Poncelet's death make up for his victims'.I think the film says that Poncelet does deserve the death penalty. When I see the execution scene, I don't see a great injustice. How can you see injustice in this scene when the camera cuts several times to a flashback of Poncelet raping and killing? I should add, though, that I still found the execution abhorrent: the way they kill him, like they're putting an animal to sleep, is just unnerving. I also think that the film says Poncelet deserves to be loved: over and over Sarandon points out that Poncelet is still human, and every human deserves love. I also think the film doesn't tell us that Poncelet's death makes up for his crime, but it does say that his death makes him worthy of forgiveness.While the movie is not very favorable towards capital punishment, I think there is no question that Poncelet's execution is treated as a just punishment (however terrible), and so it cannot be called entirely anti- capital punishment. Personally, I am vehemently against the death penalty because even though there may be some disgusting, despicable, horrible people who deserve to die, I would not trust anyone's judgment (including my own) as to _who_ deserves to dies and who doesn't. Also, courts are absurdly reluctant to stop executions (even if the prisoner is still sentenced to life without parole). The death penalty is utterly final and irrevocable -- should we trust its administration to such flawed beings as ourselves?Dead Man Walking gets 9/10.P.S. Can anyone else believe "Babe" beat this out for an Oscar Best Picture nomination?!?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with the majority of positive opinions about this movie including (elsewhere) Roger Ebert's. Having read many other viewer's comments I'd like to add this. For those who seemed confused about which side of the capital punishment argument this movie falls on, let there be no doubt. Matthew Poncelet's remark at the end (of his life), to the effect that "I ... think it is wrong to take any life, it is wrong for the state (as) it (was) wrong for me..."), leaves no doubt about that.But it is a testament to the superb balance - right up to this revelation, that the movie influenced so many thoughtful people on both sides, especially those still not in agreement with Poncelet.I think balancing this movie was performed as precisely as a chemist weighs the ingredients for a delicate mixture, a mixture that might blow up if not made just that carefully. In particular I think the skillful flashback scenes of the horrible act, as they seem to come back to Poncelet as he apparently begins to admit their truth to himself (and us), erases any sentimentally we might have been developing for him. But this does not diminish our feelings; indeed it heightens them, on the real issue -- is this the right thing to done to him?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought before seeing it, that this movie was only a pro-life movie with a predictable ending. I was very surprised that it gave the views of the persons involved (the families, the killer and the spiritual advisor) instead of focusing on a trial or the opinions of pro-life or pro-death fans. I didn't know at that time that the movie was based on a true story.I then read the book of Sister Helen Prejean and I saw that the screenplay was really faithful to the book although modified. The evolution of the killer's feelings as his sentence approaches is what I like the best. Sean Penn delivers his best performance ever and deserved the Oscar for 1995 (but as you might know, he is not gentle to the Academy). Susan Sarandon is equally excellent. I think it is the best duet I've seen in a movie yet.That movie is hard to watch because it seems so real. It makes you think that even though the crimes were awful, the death penalty is not necessarily easy to apply. DEAD MAN WALKING is not a justified-revenge movie (everybody's happy at the end) like A TIME TO KILL. It is much more intelligent and poignant. DEAD MAN WALKING deserves a big 10/10 for the acting, directing and screenplay. Among my 10 favorite movies ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie about people and their relationships, their morals, their strengths, and their weaknesses. It's a movie that without the perfect cast would have been horrible. Luckily, Tim Robbins is at the helm, and he knows what he's doing.So does his cast.Sean Penn gives an impeccable performance as Matthew Poncelet, a scared but proud young man on death row. From start to finish, Penn is never anything less than totally convincing in this role. He captures emotions so perfectly - hate, anger, fear, pride, happiness, pain - that if you're not a Sean Penn fan by the end of this movie, you will at least have a great respect for his rare talent.Sarandon also turns in a fine performance (and won an Oscar for it) as Sister Helen Prejean, a naive nun who, responding to a letter from Poncelet, goes to visit him on death row. She eventually becomes his spiritual advisor and even his friend, while at the same time trying to reach out to the parents of the children he is accused of murdering.The effect of this movie is something you won't soon forget. Captivating images and excellent music (featuring Eddie Vedder like you've never heard him before) work with the script flawlessly, producing a sad beauty of a film that will make you think as much as it makes you cry.Tim Robbins has put together an extraordinary package here. This film has an intelligence and maturity about it that is very rare.</fullReview>

How would you react? Most people don't know (and would not like to know). The one thing, that makes this movie special is, that it brings us a very believable impression of how it would be. You can actually feel the pain of Mr. Delacroix.And it also showed that behind every "scum" on death row there is a person, a family and a mother.Great performance by Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn.Rating: 8 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never been so moved by a film since "Schindler's List"! Tim Robbins is an amazing director and the performances are of sheer brilliance-Susan Saranadon, Oscar winner for this role, plays Helen Prejean, a nun who leads Sean Penn to redemption. Sean Penn gives the best performance by an actor of 1995. I love this film with a passion! My #2 favorite film of 1990's , Schindler's List being #1.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the movie I feared it would be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My initial thought would be that it would show the Sean Penn character as some poor, misunderstood waif who just mixed up with a bad crowd. Was I wrong! The movie makes clear that Helen's ministry consists NOT of getting killers to feel good about themselves, but to get them to recognize the evil they have wrought, as a first step in healing and reconciliation. This is NOT a syrupy, wimpy, feel-good movie about kids no worse than those from Boys Town; it's a movie where the killer's crime is exposed in all its horror. It is NOT a movie screaming "The death penalty is bad"; it's one accurately showing the fervid emotions surrounding it. Recommended to even the most vocal supporters of the death penalty; this movie will NOT offend your views.</fullReview>

This movie made me cry so hard, and I usually don't cry often. The death penalty is not right, just taking a sinner from this earth with another sin. God should be the ONLY one to take someone from earth, no one else. The whole outlook of this movie is spectacular. But, I cried, and cried, and then cried some more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a great attempt at an even-handed, well-rounded treatment of the US justice system. (Guys, this is a good film to rent with a girl, but you either have to be good at holding back tears or feel comfortable crying.)I say "even-handed" because you really want to hate Sean Penn's character, who has been sentenced to death for murder and rape. And it doesn't help that the media is trashing him every step of the way, turning the scorn of the masses upon him.At the same time, though, the ugliness of the human spirit lives large inside the victims' families, who reject Susan Sorandin's character, the nun whose job it is to convince Sean Penn to except Jesus Christ and be saved before his death sentence.The nun wants to do a thorough job trying to understand her "client," but the more she finds out from him and his victims' families, the less she understands.The main glue of this movie is the pace at which you grow emotionally involved with the plot and the characters, and just when you think it can't get any darker, it does.The reason I say you won't just cry if you really get it: It's such a chilling, emotionally detailed look at a series of events that seem so distant from your own life, yet so real; and the resolution just leaves you cold. You may cry but not know exactly why... Penn is good in this role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dead Man Walking is one of the most truly superb dramas ever put to celluloid. Unfortunately I feel it is largely misunderstood. Yes it is an examination of the rights and wrongs of capital punishment. But it is also (and I feel most importantly) about the repercussions of a heinous crime.Like a lot of people, this is one of the few films I have ever cried at. What I was crying at was not that Poncelet was going to be killed, but that he had committed such a terrible crime. This is what Poncelet himself was crying over, he was totally appalled with himself that he could have done this act. He was not crying because he was afraid to die, he was crying because at that point he wanted to die.I'm struggling to convey here just how profound an emotional journey this movie really is. No film has brought home the emotional impact of violent crime to an audience quite as well as this one. In an age where movies often glamorise violence, this is a strong reminder of the repercussions both on the victims and the perpetrators.Dead Man Walking is brought to life by two unbelievably fine performances from Susan Sarandon and especially Sean Penn.10/10 - Highly recommeded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I often think I go into films with the wrong attitude. I go in expecting to be disappointed by what I see, and as a result, I often am. This film is one of the biggest exceptions to this possible. It caught me in an instant and I was mesmorised by the quality of the writing, direction, acting, everything about the film.I expected to have Tim Robbins' view on the death penalty shoved down my throat, but to tell you the truth, I have no idea whether he is for or against this form of punishment.I always think a good film is one where I leave talking about it, and the ensuing debate on the relative merits of the death penalty went on for days, surely the mark of a good film, as most are forgotten before I even leave the cinema.The only problem with this film, is that I see it as a perfect example of how films should be made, and as a result, nothing else manages to live upto it, leading to even more disappointment in other films I see.I would urge anybody to go and see this film, it is, put simply, a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few films manage to leave an impact as powerful as that of Dead Man Walking. Analyzing the heart-wrenchingly controversial issue of the death penalty in a mature way that pays equal consideration to any possible viewpoints, the film utilizes a fantastically written script and flawless characterization to gather emotional appeal, and regardless of your opinion on the topic, it will doubtlessly leave you with a new, realistic outlook of the topic. Based on the lucid novel written by Sister Helen Prejean, Dead Man Walking retells the emotional memoir of a woman with first- hand experience of capital punishment. The film begins with Sister Helen, portrayed by Susan Sarandon, receiving a letter from an inmate on death row. Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn) is one of two men convicted for the rape and murder of two teenagers, and, after corresponding with and requesting the help of Sister Helen Prejean, is paid a visit by the nun. Through numerous instances of correspondence, Sister Helen eventually takes up the role of a spiritual counselor for the gruff criminal. As she experiences the complexities of the situation, Sister Helen not only comes to befriend Matthew, but also gains a new understanding of the viewpoint of the victims ? after meeting the parents of the dead teenage couple, the kind protagonist becomes aware of the alarming contradictions of the situation, understanding the damage caused by Matthew while simultaneously retaining her sympathy for him. The film closes not with a fantastic plot twist that allows the unsettling character we have become so unwillingly attached to to continue his life ? no, Dead Man Walking ends with Matthew's death by lethal injection, an eye opening reminder of the harsh realities that set the film's theme.The turbulence of the plot in and of itself accounts for a good portion of the film's nerve wracking impact. The film presents the complexities and hardships of capital punishment in a realistic manner, not filling it to the brim with clichés and happy endings but instead utilizing multiple viewpoints to make a dismal statement of philosophy. Dead Man Walking takes care to avoid pushing one side of the controversial topic ? the interactions between Sister Helen and Matthew call to attention the human side of every criminal, while those involving the families of the murder victims allow for contemplation of the justice behind the practice.What drives Dead Man Walking's emotional influence is the strength of character portrayed by the actors. Sarandon's depiction of Sister Helen Prejean is wracked with emotion; sensitive and vulnerable, yet retaining the necessary toughness to see through her relationship with Matthew to the end, Sister Helen's characterization is real and fantastically empathetic. Her emphasis on reconciliation with one's crimes helps to visualize the humanity, or lack thereof, of the issue in question, regardless of your opinion on it. Meanwhile, Matthew's flawless characterization helps to illustrate victims of capital punishment as real people; maintaining the gruff depths and despicable imperfections of a convicted criminal, Matthew is in no way a likable character, yet he manages to grow on us through his impoverished background and eventual acceptance. He isn't shown as an overly exaggerated monster, but instead allows for consideration of the spiritual humanness of even the most abhorrent of people. Even the performances of the parents of Matthew's victims allow for further development of emotion and opinion ? displaying the viewpoint of the death penalty from those who have had to deal with the consequences of losing a loved one, the passion of these characters allow for a fully rounded film while perfectly bringing home the mantra of forgiveness that is ingrained into the script.All in all, Dead Man Walking is a wonderfully produced film that perfectly captures the debate of capital punishment and synthesizes on it to organize a powerful examination of humanity. Refusing to stray from realism, the film perfectly emphasizes with both sides of the rampant controversy and examines crime from a new point of view; regardless of any prior knowledge, Dead Man Walking is sure to further consideration of the widespread dispute.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tim Robbins Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A nun (Susan Sarandon), while comforting a convicted killer on death row (Sean Penn), empathizes with both the killer and his victim's families.Some have called this the Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn Show. And, that is probably true. After all, their performances more or less carried this movie. Even Penn's hair helped a little. But I prefer to think of it as the Tim Robbins Show, since he wrote it, directed it and stuffed it full of family members. This was like his family's gift to the world, take it or leave it.Now, personally, I thought it was good but not as great as it is made out to be. The message is good, depending on what you take the message to be. I can see it being a story that even killers are people, too. But then, some are not people. Some are grizzly bears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whether you like it or not, this film touches on a controversial political issue and that issue is the death penalty. What I liked is how fair this movie played. Each side got their own voice and it was not biased. That being said, Dead Man Walking is a powerful film with strong, capable performances and I think this is one of the best prison film made only trailing The Green Mile.Tim Robbin's film is about a nun, Helen who works in the inner neighborhood. She gets a letter from a convicted child murderer on death row awaiting execution. She meets him and decides as his spiritual adviser, they will appeal the court's decision. But the more they spend time together, the more she finds out what an unstable person Matthew is.The acting is very good and believable. Susan Sarandon gives an excellent performance as Helen and even though she plays a nun, she doesn't come across as overly preachy. As usual, Sean Penn blew me out of the water. Every role he's in, he completely inhabits it.Overall, this is a modern masterpiece that seems to be overlooked. I never knew Tim Robbins would be such a good director. He gives this film intelligent direction. This is a thought-provoking film that touches on a very sensitive issue, but plays fair with each side. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dead Man Walking concerns a man named Matthew (Sean Penn), who has been locked up for six years for murdering a young teenage couple with a close pal of his, who is also in for life. He is now on Death Row, awaiting execution, and has no other choice in life but to be cantankerous, miserable, and content with the cards he has been dealt.He then requests a visit from Sister Helen (Susan Sarandon), a nun who is summoned from her hectic life to meet Matthew. Upon arriving to the Louisiana State Penitentiary, she is instantaneously turned off by his uncompromising arrogance and shallow, machoman racism. She can't imagine sympathizing with a man so contemptible like she will eventually go on to do. The film details Helen and Matthew's relationship as it develops over the course of time, humanizing those on Death Row, but also showing what they did was incomprehensibly wrong and evil; a true act of pathetic simple-mindedness.No viewer could expect to sympathize with Matthew, given his track-record, like we do here. It just seems too illogical; sympathize with a disgusting murderer. While we don't remain ignorant and blind to this fact, we see just how human he is and, even if we don't agree with the hate he spews or the loathing he feels, we can still see that behind the cold-hearted killer lies nothing more/less than a human. A human whose life will soon be ended. Whether you're pro-death penalty, against it completely, or can see both sides with their own points, as I do, you must not forget that fact.Of course not everyone on Death Row is someone we'd like to have a conversation with. One of them could quite possibly be Matthew, who, as a shell and judging by looks, has nothing interesting or vital to say that would change ones' perspective. Some of them are there because they are cold, numbing, and evil beyond comprehension. Perhaps death is what they deserve. But I can't imagine connecting with someone in such a position for a certain amount of time and not feeling something the second they're taken away to that room.The film was written directed by Tim Robbins, whose name will bring certain images and memories to mind when I state he was Andy Durane in the masterwork that is The Shawshank Redemption. Robbins has made something of a career out of either playing characters of directing films that provide the audience with a humanization of the so-often dehumanized. Shawshank followed him as he bravely fought through the drudgery of prison life by allowing hope to set him free from the cold, steel bars of the prison cell. Dead Man Walking furthers explores the idea of the prison system, but by focusing on a soul who does, in fact, deserve to be there. Yet Robbins is less preoccupied with that notion than he is showing the sorrow, woe, and madness this man faces. This is a tough film to watch because it plays with your morality and toys with your emotions. You may even forget you're watching and sympathizing a man accused of murder. When a film can do that, you know it's on to something.The star-power brought for here is simply captivating. This is a film of characters and performances. Those who criticize certain films for "not having a plot" should, by close-minded accusations, dislike this picture, for it is obvious they do not like the emphasis on character and tone. Susan Sarandon gives, quite possibly, the performance of her career, playing a nun who must truly put her belief in faith, love, and forgiveness to the test by relating and coming within the vicinity to sympathize with a murderer. Sean Penn's performance has seemingly been praised for things that I found second to the idea that he is essentially doing all the acting with his words and face. When we see him, he is most often equipped with shackles to the hands and feet, and relying mostly on facial communications and vocals to provide his attitude, opinions, and mood. Penn is a phenomenal actor - that much we know - but not only does he take a daring role, he embodies one with vast limitations. Vast limitations that are also occupied with a trait that allegedly could stunt all likability to the character. And yet, he's nothing short of mesmerizing in the leading male role.From a sociological standpoint, Dead Man Walking does a terrific job of nudging its viewers out of their comfort shell, regardless of what side of the issue of the death penalty you declare yourself on. It opens the door for cultural relativism, and to someone you shouldn't see yourself relating or understanding at all. Even a neutral viewer will have to come out of their shell to view the naturalism and realism portrayed in this film.There need to be a great deal more films like Dead Man Walking. Films that have a competent man as their driving force, the notion to tackle a heavy, topical issue, and one that does it with respect to both sides of the story. That's the kicker here. A movie that could've easily been arguing against the death penalty argument in a propaganda-like manner could've very well been the film we got. A film that took the issue vice-versa could've been, as well. The delicate approach we got is an incalculable rarity, and in present-day, a film similar to the quality of this one on issues like abortion and welfare would be something to truly value. The immediate problem would be getting people to come out of their comfort shell, see the fact that the film is presented in an unbiased light, and see them would be the challenge.Starring: Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn. Directed by: Tim Robbins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very flawed indeed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read Prejean's book upon which this movie is based, I was prepared for the loaded nature of the screenplay and the sentimentality of the later scenes.Penn's character is a composite of two rapist/murderers, one of whom preyed on couples in a lover's lane area over a considerable period of time. The other raped, tortured and murdered his victims while under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Prejean has the honesty in her book to acknowledge the vicious nature of the crimes these men committed; the film really doesn't bring home the torment and cruelty inflicted on the victims of the men represented by Penn's character.In one of her murder-mystery novels Dorothy L Sayers made the point that when we see the murderer in the dock, alone and vulnerable, or when we think of him in the death cell awaiting execution, natural human pity leads us to feel for him/her, while forgetting the terror and agony he/she inflicted on the victim or victims of his or her anger, hatred, and cruelty. This is what this film does - we're led to be SO sorry for Poncelet, while the atrocities perpetrated especially by the second of the rapist/murderers the character is based on (Robert Lee Willie) are glossed over.The execution sequence I found especially offensive. Poncelet/Penn is strapped to the gurney and then raised before us like a crucified Christ-figure - for our adoration? worship? what exactly? I found this offensive, blasphemous and terminally false. In film terms, CHEESY.This movie pales into triviality compared to two much lower-budget (and much less boosted) movies - Peter Medak's "Let Him Have It" about the Derek Bentley case, and Adrian Shergold's "Pierrepoint" about the last Chief hangman in the UK. Personally, I have deep reservations about capital punishment in any form, and Medak and Shergold address these reservations honestly and frankly. "Dead Man Walking" made me feel as my emotions were being manipulated - as if the question is much simpler and less complex than in fact it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie about a difficult theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Robbins directs and writes the controversial and at times uncomfortable true story of a devoted nun who comforts a prisoner (charged of rape and murder of a young couple) during his last moments of life while waiting for his final punishment on the death row by lethal injection. The great Susan Sarandon plays the Sister Helen Prejean, and Sean Penn plays Matthew Poncelet, the hateful prisoner who asked for the nun's help while trying to hide his remorse feelings on the crime. She's there to help no only him but others too with her message of forgiveness and love.The Sister also wants to comfort the families who lost their sons in the tragedy, something that might be very difficult for her (since she never did this kinds of service before) and because the families know what she's doing with the prisoner and they really don't want to get involved with her unless if she changes her mind and stay beside them.What is important in this movie? It is a movie about the death penalty and yet it is not a propaganda against it or supporting it. It shows all the sides of a tragic event and its aftermath, the families struggle to carry on; the days of the inmate waiting for his execution; and the religion part presented by the comforting nun. Robbins's film didn't took a side on the death penalty subject, this is a question for the public choose if it is favorable or not. Watch the case and see it what you think about it. It reminded me of "A Short Film About Killing" 1988 movie directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski. Both great and controversial movies on the same subject. The difference is that in Robbins's work we know all along that there was a crime (presented in flashbacks) and then the punishment will appear while in the Polish film all the story is portrayed in order, first comes the shocking crime of a taxi driver, then almost at the end of the film the execution of the murder. So since the stories were presented in different ways the way the audience will react to the execution of the murders will be way different. But I must say that in Kieslowski's movie you certainly will want the execution of the murderer.The story is very well written, nothing is wasted and there's no political message to ruin the plot. My only disappointment was that Sean Penn's character seemed to be the only one who everyone pointed fingers, calling him guilty, and as we found out that he wasn't alone when he committed the crime and the movie never says what happened to his partner in crime. He was executed? He is free? Everything was thrown on the back of just one single person.The acting is superb from the whole casting. Sarandon won her Oscar for her good performance; Penn was nominated for his brilliant portrayal of the title character; and in the good supporting roles the movie features Raymond J.Barry, Robert Prosky, Lois Smith, Celia Weston, R.Lee Ermey (he's not playing a military this time) and Margo Martindale. My salutations to the direction of Tim Robbbins who made a wonderful film on a serious subject without being too much controversial, or too harsh in its theme. But "Dead Man Walking" is not for everyone, it's only for those who like thought provoking movies or enjoy Sarandon or Penn. 10/10</fullReview>

Penn is outstandingly outstanding. Look at his work in the penultimate 30-minutes, you'll be left awe-struck. Note his expressions when he confesses the truth, that's the finest scene in the entire film, and it's memorable because of the Acting Legend. Susan won the Academy Award for Best Actress &amp; rightly so. She's fantastic. Jack Black is decent in a cameo appearance, while Late Actor Robert Prosky delivers a note-worthy performance.

		<shortDescription>Dead Man Walking - Capital Punishment just or not?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"It's easy to kill a monster, but it's hard to kill a human being," lawyer Hilton Barber told Sister Helen Prejean and his client, rapist and murderer Matthew Poncelet, as he explained his plan for Poncelet's legal defense. "We need to present you as a human being," Mr. Barber said. This was all a part of Poncelet's appeal to the State Board of Capital Punishment in order to have his execution stayed. However, Poncelet, a face for all inmates appealing to have their execution stayed, had to face the societal undertones of death row inmates especially as he received rejection of his appeal. I believe that Dead Man Walking was nominated for an Oscar because for the coverage of both sides of the issue of capital punishment. The character of Sister Helen Prejean offers such a landscape view of the interconnected issues and problems of the death penalty. Ministering in the St. Thomas Projects since her vows, she comes with innocence and indifference to death row. The moviegoer grows in knowledge of the death penalty with Sister Prejean as she visits with Matthew Poncelet, the victims' families, Poncelet's family, and Poncelet's legal team and the courts. We learn with Sister Prejean about death row and how Matthew Poncelet and many other inmates are poorly represented by tax-paid lawyers who, in Matthew's case, have never participated in capital cases before. When Sister Prejean visits the Delacroixs and Percys, the victims' families, we are moved by the Percys loss of their oldest daughter, who was finally leaving home for the army, and we find sympathy for Mr. Delecroix, who was divorced by his wife because of the murder of their only son. Following the movie's motif of a panoramic view of the issue of capital punishment, Sister Prejean visits the Poncelet family, upon Matthew Poncelet's request. Like many offenders' families, the Ponceletes are harassed by the media. Lucille Poncelet, Matthew's mom, is characterized by the media as the head of a crime family, like "Ma Barker", for helping her son and speaking upon his behalf during his appeals. The Poncelet boys, Matthew's younger brothers, are bullied at school by the other boys.Turning inward to her faith, Sister Prejean and moviegoers find even more division in Church on the issue of capital punishment. Father Farlely, the chaplain of the prison, believes that the death penalty is appropriate citing the Old Testament "eye for an eye" and a passage from Romans pertaining to the use of the death penalty on criminals. Sister Prejean tries to teach the Father about what is said in the Gospel of Matthew about turning the other cheek, but she faints as if the all air was sucked out of the room to fuel the fire and brimstone damnation of Father Farlely's rhetoric. However, there are subtle hints to Father Farlely's disconnection from the Church, such as his discontent with Sister Prejean not wearing the habit and the Bishop's presence at Poncelet's hearing with Governor Benedict of Lousianna and his residence over Poncelet's funeral. Above all else, Sister Helen Prejean sought to align her position on the death penalty with the Church, but she was also influenced by listening to the families on both sides and, most of all, Matthew Poncelet. This movie does justice to the issue of capital punishment because it presents both sides of the issue and leaves it to the moviegoer to find their own stance on the issue. However, the movie does present the transformation of a innocent, indifferent (if not pro-death penalty because of her lawyer father) nun who gathers knowledge on the problems surrounding the death penalty, and then, decides to become an anti-death penalty advocate. Putting aside Sister's Prejean's vows, the movie showcases a person, undecided on the death penalty, who comes to a conclusion different from society. Sister Prejean comes to this realization of the indignity of the death penalty after seeking the truth of Matthew Poncelet's case and execution. The main purpose of the movie is to find the truths in the death penalty issue. There is a scene minutes before Matthew's execution in which truths are revealed by both Sister Prejean and Matthew Poncelet. With these truths, Matthew finally finds peace and self-complacency in his heart and Sister Prejean affirms her stance on the death penalty. I believe the conversation that puts the film into perspective and reveals the true teaching of the film are found within the last few dialogues of Sr. Helen Prejean and Matthew Poncelet. Matthew finally admits to Sister Prejean that he took part in the rape and murder of Hope Percy and Walter Delacroix, and regains his dignity as a human being by taking responsibility for what he has done. He understands now the terrible pain he has inflicted on the poor children and their parents and wishes to ease their burden in any way possible, even if it means his death. According to Sr. Prejean, it is this truth of his responsibility in the crime that will set Matthew free, and now has the ability to be reconciled by the Father for his crime. Matthew Poncelet truly shows that all are able to be a Son of God by understanding and taking responsibility for all their actions, both good and evil.When Sr. Helen Prejean was asked by the prison sergeant as to why she was with Matthew Poncelet instead of teaching children she said that she didn't understand why the government's punishment for murderers was more murder. Sr. Prejean understands that the crime Matthew committed was indeed evil, but it is no reason to kill another son of God for what he did. For the government committed the same crime as Matthew through his execution. So, Sr. Helen Prejean left us with the controversial question that sparks debate among all people: "What's the sense in killing to say killing is wrong?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good job, Robbins. The film is great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yesterday night I watched Dead man walking, and it was so moving that, at night, I was just sit in my bed without being able to sleep, because of how it touched me. I cannot understand how is it possible that exist people who live off that sad business. These people who inject the mortal dose to the condemned prisoner, I can't understand it. How they inject the poison! And it hurt me much more that these people who murder the condemned because of their murder, can arrive home calmed and fall asleep, without feeling remorse. Normal people, with sons to bring up... Everyone should watch this film, to see the cruelty are treated this people. People who killed for a reason, because they were drugged up, because they were alone and lost, because they were ill, or simply with having no reason, doing it conscientiously.- a serious problem to treat- So, about the main character, Poncelet, I've felt sadness, I felt pain, but in a brief moment I've felt hate, hate that no one should feel to anyone. When I arrived to the end of the film I was just angry towards the future that Poncelet was going to have, the death!!! An end that no one deserves, even the worst of the worst cases . A drastic end that don't let you stop thinking in all the injustices that many people have to suffer , the death is never the solution to problems. I'd like to thank Robbins for his great work as a director, and say that I'm waiting for your next projects, I hope they will be as great and committed on your convictions as in Dead man walking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, forget about the political beliefs of Sean Penn, Susan Sarandon and the director, Tim Robbins. This movie is a balanced masterpiece on one of America's most controversial subjects. We are given an objective view from both sides of the issue and if you have an open mind you are made to feel both sides of the debate on executions in America. I am not sure if it will change anyone's mind but it should make the subject more clear for anyone truly interested in expanding their view on the world around them.The direction was spot on and the acting was fantastic. Penn plays an unlikable yet vulnerable character and Susan Sarandon owned her role. All of the other actors did exactly what they should have done... Convienced me they were NOT acting.9 out of 10 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-scripted set-pieces (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading the opening credits of "Dead Man Walking", this film feels very much like a family project. Director Tim Robbins directs his wife Susan Sarandon in the leading role, while his brother David Robbins provides the musical score.Based on the book of the same name, the story sees New Orleans nun Sister Helen Prejean (Sarandon) coming to the aid of Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn), a convicted killer on Death Row who is only weeks away from execution. Her faith in God endows her with the belief that redemption is possible for this unrepentant murderer, but her persistence in trying to help him incurs the anger of his victims' families...The film is, without a doubt, superbly acted. Sarandon carries the film well, giving her character strength and substance. Sean Penn is excellent, working hard to make the audience sympathize with him, and is especially effective in the film's closing moments. Elswhere, Robert Prosky is on fine form as a lawyer who tries to have Poncelet acquitted. Raymond J.Barry, R.Lee Emery and Celia Watson stir anger and pity as the victims' relatives. You have to feel sorry for them, but the humanizing of their offsprings' murderer makes their rage seem indulgent and self-righteous.The script is a little flabby in places, and David Robbin's score could have been used more for impact, but there are still some fascinating set-pieces debating the nature of punishment, prejudice, redemption and religious belief. Few Hollywood films can make any serious claim to be intellectual, but this one comes close through asking questions as opposed to providing 'answers'. Is Poncelet a man or a monster? Does capital punishment work? Does it do justice to the victims' families? And can religious faith really redeem a person? In the end, the audience is left to decide.The open-ended nature of the film, and the complete lack of a romantic element, make it stand out from most other film drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally, I'm not a fan of both Susan and Sean, but I completely agree that they are decent and talented actors who produce wonderful films (for example Stepmom, Thelma &amp; Louise, and the newly released I Am Sam...). Dead Man Walking is a spiritually fantastic film and is sure to be the best work of both Sarandon and Penn. Helen Prejean, sympathizes with Matthew Poncelet, is caught among him, his family and the two victims' families. From the communication with Matthew, she gradually opens his heart, brought him to know God, and accepted him with love. It surely is difficult for her when she stands up for Matthews while everyone says that he is an animal and don't even consider him a human being. Facing the indignant accuse of the victims' families, she must know what is right and go for it no matter what. This film reminds me about a horrible kidnap and murder that happened in Taiwan years ago. Three men Kao, Chen and Lin kidnapped the daughter Bai Shao-yen of a famous entertainer Bai Bin-bin. And when she was found, she was killed already. It took a long time for the polices to catch these criminals. Finally, Kao shot himself in a gunfight with the polices, and Lin was caught. Chen escaped and once again kidnapped McGill Alexander, the Brigadier General in the South African Army. Both McGill and his daughter Melanie were injured by his gun, but they forgave him, teach him to know God, and touched him by their forgiveness and how amazing and wonderful God is. Chen eventually got baptized and became a Christian in the jail. Shortly after his baptism, he was executed. After his death, he donated his heart and lungs and intestines to people, but no one wanted them. Many people still believe that Chen was born evil, and those who accept what he donates will be evil too. However, through the grace of God Jesus Christ and the wonderful heartwarming friendship, Chen has got the salvation of the Lord, and has overcome death and accepts the eternal life which is an everlasting promise to everyone from Jesus. The same here, at first Matthew denied that he killed the two youngsters, but when he admitted, and later before he was executed, the way he looks at Sister Helen Prejean was full of gratitude and love. He has accepted the grace and wonderful salvation of the Lord, and died with peace. He is killed, but his spirits lives, and even though he is dead, but like what Jesus said in the Bible: I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live even though he died, and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. (John 11:25) The executing scene is most touching and a real tear-jerker! Penn's repentance has once again proved the everlasting truth: people are truly good at heart no matter they're evil or righteous. The salvation from God that Matthew got is far beyond death.Under the amazing direction of Tim Robbins, both Susan and Sean shined in this heartwarming, superb and powerful story. I congratulae Susan on getting the Academy Award for this brilliant role! But it's really a pity that Sean didn't receive the award. However, the wonderfulness and brilliance of this film is not to be questioned and doubted. Out of 10, I give in an 8.5, and 8 for Tim, Susan and Sean!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A feather in the cap of Tim Robbins (spoilers inside)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dead Man Walking is a stunning piece of filmmaking for many reasons. It features Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn giving incredible performances. The direction of Tim Robbins is outstanding. The script leaves nothing to be desired. This is so close to perfect.The character of Sister Helen Prejean is someone, on basic terms, whom a lot of the audience will be able to relate to. Torn between what she feels and what she thinks is right, whilst being continuously interfered with from all outside parties ? she is just striving to help people. Sean Penn's character develops from being a vicious criminal still pleading his innocence at the beginning of the movie, to the admitting, fear stricken man we see in the final execution scenes.The final scene in the execution chamber is very powerful, and will leave you haunted by its realism. The images of the victims parents, finally realising the enormity of what they've demanded as Penn is being put to death, are very disturbing. It seems that Tim Robbins has succeeded in what he set out to do with this movie, which was to provide a thorough investigation into capital punishment, and how it emotionally affects everybody involved.Robbins' script strays away from the legal side of matters, preferring to focus on the emotional side of capital punishment, a decision that I think is one of the film's strong points. The characters are so expertly portrayed that it would have been foolish to just concentrate on legal statistics.This is a film that communicates directly with the audience, giving them a sense of realism to a concept of which the majority will have no direct experience. If you haven't seen this yet, then I wholeheartedly recommend it as one of the greatest triumphs in film of the decade.**********</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>***** Unbeatable film and performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Susan Sarandon is unbeatable in this powerful and fascinating adaptation of Sister Helen Prejean's true-life novel about her experiences as a nun counselling inmates on death row. Tim Robbins (showing exceptional power as a director) has written a script that fictionalizes Prejean's two factual accounts of her life into one fictional one involving Sean Penn as the first man Prejean ever counselled, a man on death row for the rape and murder of two young teenagers. The entire cast is perfectly rounded, from Margo Martindale as Prejean's good friend Colleen, Robert Prosky as an earnest appeals lawyer, Roberta Maxwell as Penn's brokenhearted mother, and R. Lee Ermey, Celia Weston, and Raymond J. Barry as the parents of the murder victims. The film is at heart a statement against the death penalty, but it doesn't drive a message home--it examines every aspect of the situation and challenges you on so many levels (unlike similarly themed films such as Last Dance and The Chamber) that you'll struggle to comfortably find what you feel is true for yourself. Lois Smith has two wonderful scenes as Prejean's wise mother, and as usual she does a brilliant job. Beautiful filmmaking that gets better with each viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I did not cry at the end, the people I was watching the film with did cry. This is a remarkable film in every way, from the story to the score. Someone had previously remarked that if you couldn't remember the two teenagers who were murdered, than you were crying for the wrong reason. Well I did remember, but this film isn't about the story of two teenagers who were brutally murdered.  This film doesn't present capital punishment as a black and white issue, which is one of it's qualities. While I am against capital punishment, there are several cases that I would feel more comfortable if the killer died.  Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn both give amazing performances. Sarandon won a well deserved Oscar for her turn as Helen Prejan. She embodies her character realistically and honestly. Sean Penn deserved an oscar for his portrait of Matthew Poncelet. Raymond J. Barry also gives an excellent performance as Mr. Delacroix. He is very subtle. Mr. Pearce's character, played by R. Lee Ermey, was a bit confusing. At times, I felt he was rather obnoxious. "What about us?" he says when Poncelet is apologizing for what he did. And that is the only real problem with the script. Is this an enjoyable film? Someone earlier said no, that he would never want to see it again. While it is not a film that will make you feel happy, it is one I would see again. As Roger Ebert said, "This film ennobles filmmaking"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very very doubtful movie in several sides;Humanity,Justice,Credibility &amp; Flexibility of Law,Crime &amp; Punishment,Pardon from the Religion.Each side is too conflicting one to another.Sister Helen is the spiritual adviser of Matthew while the victims are throwing stones at both of them. Religion gives the pardon convict but victims tries to find out the justice through death penalty.What is the right? What is the wrong? Let me ask too, Who is the right? Who is the wrong? What should be the impartial decision?. Let's imagine that one of our family member was slaughtered by someone, then what kinda sense will make us? On the other hand, If we are the religious people what kinda sense will make us? The matter which echoes deeply in our soul is "Should house hold of convict account for the criminal?" Dead Man Walking seriously shows great social problems of such people. Otherwise does law give the pure justice for the society? Matthew counts dates for his execution while the other convict Vitello spends time in prison for life without death penalty. does the law really give people a relief? Absolutely a Perfect movie...

		<shortDescription>Impending Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Asked to visit a death row inmate, a middle aged nun finds herself unexpectedly bonding with the convict in question despite his heinous crimes in this well acted human drama starring Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon. The film is never particularly subtle with its anti-death penalty agenda and it harks on a bit too much about the ease of executing a monster (rather than human being) for its own good, however, the movie also offers a terrific character study in Sarandon's benevolent nun. Throughout the film, she is haunted by flashbacks of killing an animal in her youth and the guilt that she felt at the time, which she evidently equates with Penn's situation, convicted of killing two young lovers. As Sarandon later meets with the families of Penn's victims, the situation grows even more complex for her as she finds herself unable to escape their pain but also drawn to Penn. Solid as Sarandon is in the film though with her internally divided character, Penn shines even brighter here, especially with the changes in personality that he goes through towards the end as he sees his own end approaching. The use of close-ups on the equipment in his final scene is endlessly eerie. Director Tim Robbins also does a great job framing his two leads; there are some excellent shots of them conversing through glass panels with each other's reflection (in the glass) making it appear as if they are sitting side by side. On that note, the connection between the two protagonists here is incredibly strong - much more so than one might expect from two so vastly different human beings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sean Penn is a Dead Man Walking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This simple film based on a true story written off the book by Sister Helen Prejean. It tells her story (played by the great Susan Sarandon)as she gets a letter from a man in prison who is looking for spiritual guidance amidst his impending death row sentence. Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn) has been accused of the two counts of rape and one count of murder of a young couple found in the woods. The town is split by those who think he should be put to death for his crimes, and those who think his sentence should be switched to life imprisonment. As Sister Helen tries to help Matthew find peace through God, the parents of the deceased along with much of the town protest against and get mad at her for "choosing sides." All she wants to do, however, is love all, and help this man do the same. At first a racist, terrible human being, we see Matthew slowly start to be changed by Sister Helen. The film is mainly within the prison showing conversations between the main characters, or Sister Helen going places to get other perspectives through conversations with people. This movie also does not choose sides on the ideas of the death penalty. Rather, it just shows the events as they played out, so whatever side a person is on at the start of the movie is where they still will be, most likely, in the end. This movie is about the empathetic relationship between the two characters, and the duo of Sarandon and Penn work extremely well together. It is definitely an emotional film, and worth seeing.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thought provoking film about the Death Penalty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I want the last face you see in this world to be the face of love, so you look at me when they do this thing. I'll be the face of love for you."Dead Man Walking is a film that explores the unique and unexpected bond formed between a Catholic nun and a convicted murderer on Death Row. I know this doesn't exactly sound as a compelling plot nor a crowd pleaser, but it was definitely a thought provoking film and surprisingly one of the best movies of 1995 thanks to the strong performances. Tim Robbins adapted the screenplay from Sister Helen Prejean's nonfictional book of the same name, and he also directed this inspirational spiritual drama that avoids being one sided and preachy by approaching the material through several different viewpoints. Sister Helen Prejean may be an advocate for the abolition of the death penalty, but this film rather than take sides on the issue allows for both views to make their case and doesn't seem to have a hidden agenda. Robbins could've taken the easy way out by making the convicted murderer more sympathetic, but from the very first scene he's in, we know this is no saint and the film doesn't shy away from what he did and the effect his actions had in the family of the victims. This is one of those rare films that approaches a controversial subject and succeeds at being balanced, which makes it a great tool for discussion.Sister Helen is probably one of the most authentic Christian characters portrayed on film as she is purely empathetic towards everyone around her. She isn't forcing her religion on this convict or trying to convert him, but rather finding a way for him to come to terms with what he did and find redemption by taking responsibility for his actions. She truly cares for this man, who isn't exactly a role model, and there is never any judgement in her words. It is rare to find a spiritual character like this portrayed on film in such an honest way, and Susan Sarandon takes the strong material and delivers one of her best performances to date. She simply cares for everyone around her and she is trying to do what is right because she is committed to her beliefs, and she actually applies them which is a rare thing. Sean Penn also delivers a strong performance as the convict, Matthew Poncelet, who every time he opens his mouth the less sympathetic he is, but it is evident he is trying to hide his true emotions and blame everyone else for what he has become. His chemistry with Sarandon is what carries this movie, but there are also several strong supporting performances. Margo Martindale is an actress that is often overlooked, but she deserves more recognition. She can effortlessly play a villain like in The Leftovers, or a loving and supporting Sister like she does here. R. Lee Ermey and Celia Weston play the resentful parents of the victim, and they share a great scene with Susan Sarandon that says a lot about her character. Tim Robbins hasn't directed a better film and I think he owes much of the success of this movie to the strong performances along with his well written and thought provoking script. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All Deserve God's Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent film, expertly acted and directed. So, then, why just a 7? There were critical scenes when Susan Sarandon's character, Sister Helen Prejean, did not stand up for what she believed in, nay, devoted her life to. This I found literally incredible, as law officers and family members of those murdered questioned, derided, isolated and rebuked Sister Helen. What I found so strange was that she had no answer to their hatred and hostility, and responded in a secular, if kind, way.I am not even a Christian, but in this film, Prejean could have made a powerful statement for the unconditional compassion as offered and described by Jesus Christ. Instead, she sat, staring. While I do believe it is true that real spirituality is in acts and not in words, there were critical junctures in the film where this position needed to be verbalized. It wasn't.I don't know what the reason was, for the somewhat remarkable departure from the norm, by casting nuns that do not wear habits, but it seems evident that the writer wanted to allay convention. Nuns without habits I can imagine: I'm sure it's done. Nuns without a strong awareness of and ability to defend the words and precepts of Jesus Christ, I can not.It also seems evident that the writer and director wanted to create a marked divide between the sanctimonious, condemnative character of Chaplain Farley (played by Scott Wilson) and the honest caring of Sister Prejean, but the secularism was brought to such an extreme that it sometimes seemed that Prejean did not know what, exactly, she did believe.Another lesser sin of this film is that the subject of innocence or guilt is hardly ever mentioned. I was consistently wondering why no one was trying to take a harder look at the case.In summary, it was not necessary for the film to devolve into "preachiness", but the case for revenge and hatred was given much more air time than the case for compassion and humanity. For the film to achieve a "higher level" of believability, those two latter qualities needed to be couched in the rebellious and visionary words and actions of Jesus Christ. A great opportunity was missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DEAD MAN WALKINGI remember when this film first came out, it had such good reviews and I also remember Sean Penn getting such high praise for his work. It was Susan Sarandon who won the awards.It was not a very uplifting film. In fact it was quite depressing.It was weird to watch this because I had mixed emotions. Sean Penn played a convict on death row. He was convicted of raping and murdering a student and also murdering her boyfriend. Susan Sarandon plays a nun who listens to him and tries to help him get off of death row in exchange for life imprisonment.The story was sad. I felt so sad for the parents of the victims. I could never imagine my life without my kids and if I was in their shoes I don't know how I could carry on.Tim Robbins directed this film and he did a fantastic job. I really don't like Sean Penn's character... he deserves to be where he is, but Susan Sarandon's character makes you feel he doesn't deserve to be there. If you believe in the death penalty, then he really does deserve to be there. His crimes were so horrible and unforgivable.The acting throughout is amazing. Both Sean and Susan did a great job. Other cast members that deserve a mention are Robert Prosky, Raymond J. Barry &amp; R. Lee Ermey. They are all great actors and they all worked so well in this film. It was all very believable.I will give this film 7 out of 10.It is an emotional drama, an excellent story with a fantastic cast.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Empathic and contemplative drama..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American actor, screenwriter and director Tim Robbins' second feature film as director which he wrote, is an adaptation of an autobiographical work of non-fiction from 1993 by American Sister Helen Prejean who is a Roman Catholic and a member of the Congregation of Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille. It was screened In competition at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival in 1996 and is a UK-USA co-production which Tim Robbins co-produced with producers Rudd Simmons and Jon Kiik. It tells the story about Matthew Poncelet, a death row inmate who has spent six years at the Louisiana State Penitentiary for the murder of a young couple which he committed with an elder man named Carl Vitello, who was sentenced to life imprisonment. Matthew Poncelet's execution date is getting closer and as a last attempt to get an appeal, he contacts Sister Helen Prejean. The religious sister comes to visit Matthew Poncelet, but is let down when he begins to claim his innocence and shows no signs of remorse. Though acting as if he is in opposition to everything she represents and believes in, the convicted killer gradually loosens up and shows a friendlier side. As Sister Helen learns to know Poncelet, their meetings become more frequent and she finds an attorney who is willing to take his case. While working towards changing Poncelets verdict to life imprisonment, she visits the families who have lost their children and discovers that they have no understanding for what she is doing and that their wish is to see Poncelet die for what he did to their loved ones.Finely and acutely directed by American actor and filmmaker Tim Robbins, this finely paced, humane and poignant story which is narrated from multiple viewpoints, draws a mindful portrayal of a profound relationship between a compassionate humanitarian and a man who is awaiting his execution. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions, fine production design by production designer Richard Hoover, cinematography by English cinematographer Roger A. Deakins and use of sound, this character-driven, dialog-driven and incisive examination of pivotal themes regarding the essence of life, depicts two merging and internal studies of character and contains a good score by American composer David Robbins.This unsentimental though at times evocative tale about a woman standing between a murderer who's life she is trying to save and the families of the victims who strongly disagrees with her helping the person who took their children away from them, creates a multifaceted examination of it's central theme and is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, the incomparable acting performances by American actor and director Sean Penn, American actress Susan Sarandon and the fine supporting acting performances by American actor R. Lee Ermey, American actor Robert Prosky (1930-2008) and American actor Raymond J. Barry. An empathic and contemplative drama which gained, among other awards, the Silver Bear for Best Actor Sean Penn at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival in 1996 and the Academy Award for Best Actress Susan Sarandon at the 68th Academy Awards in 1996.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Discrimination can take many forms</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is absolutely brilliant. It is about the relationship that is built between a man on death row and a nun, a person who is probably his only friend in the world. This movie shows us brilliantly the pain a man suffers when he knows that he is going to die and that he deserves that death. He tries everything to get out of what he deserves and I shall leave it to you to find out what happens.It is the relationship between the man on death row (Sean Penn), and the nun (Susan Sarandon) that really makes the movie what it is. In this movie we see a man who is hated by every person in society, everybody is calling for his blood. Yet as the movie unfolds we begin to see that this monster is in fact a human being, with real human feelings. The movie creates the murderer's humanity by showing us that he has a real family with real kinsfolk. We see the struggle that fought within the man as he tries to come to terms with what he has done and what is going to happen to him.The movie also develops the character of the nun as well. We see a character who is willing to love a man nobody else wants to. Her desire to open out the human side in him and is willing to forgive him even though he has committed extremely horrific crimes. We also see a character in the nun who is strong, standing up to persecution not only from society but also from the church. She knows that all the man needs is love and she is the only person in the world who is willing to give this man some love.This movie also shows us a very harsh and unforgiving society and this society is ours. We see people who will never forget the crimes that people commit and people who would rather kill somebody than to forgive him. We also see a society that is so much blinded by hate that they would prefer to see an innocent man put to death than find the real murderer. Not only is society so hostile towards these people, they are just as hostile to those who are related to or even associate with them. This movie opens our eyes to a bigotry that is very often ignored. We are very harsh on people who are racist and sexist but we ignore those who discriminate against people who have an unsavoury past.This movie is an extremely good movie. It is a movie that leaves you stunned and makes you think about what we really are like. It is a movie that I encourage everybody to see. It is a movie that exposes us to a lot of truths that we need to be exposed to because we probably know a lot of people who are discriminated in a similar way to the discriminated in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful and captivating film that challenges your morals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Could you defend a murderer? Could you bring yourself to sympathize with a killer? Dead Man Walking raises these kinds of questions and delves heavily into the moral ambiguity surrounding forgiveness, acceptance, and the death penalty. The movie is about Sister Helen Prejean, played by Susan Sarandon, who is a nun that has recently become the spiritual adviser for a man on death row. This man, Matthew Poncelet who is played by Sean Penn, is a racist, offensive, and obscene man who everyone else despises. But Prejean develops a closer relationship to Matthew than anyone else, and find it in her heart to not exactly forgive him for his crimes, but accept him as a human being and not the monster that everyone else pins him as. It's a deeply emotional film that has a powerful impact.Dead Man Walking keeps you thinking about the moral and ethical questions of life from start to finish. There are a lot of elements in the film that will sway your emotions back and forth, making sure you're never really sure of whose side you're on. The main character of the film is Sarandon's character, Sister Prejean, she serves as a buffer between two sides of the morally ambiguous argument portrayed in the film. On one side you have the parents of the children that Penn's character raped and murdered. They obviously pin him as the lowest form of scum on earth and want him dead at all costs. Then you have Penn's side where he must console his loving family who don't want to see him die, despite the fact that he might be a terrible person. The argument isn't so much about whether Penn is bad person or not, because he is. The argument is whether or not the "humane" death penalty is really humane at all. I felt at times that the film was definitely trying to sway the viewer's opinion to the latter side, but then elements would arise that made me question which side I was really on. By the end of the film I was anti-death penalty, but the debate could rage on for hours because of all the different factors and variables to consider in such an argument. I think it's a more circumstantial debate more than anything else, but it is still difficult to come to a conclusive stance on the issue.Furthermore, the film is just a very well made film. Tim Robbins directs and the actor certainly proves that he is multi-talented. The film isn't over directed at all and keeps things aesthetically simple, yet effective. There is a lot more focus on the actors and the multi-dimensional relationships between the various characters, so thankfully there isn't a lot of distracting directorial elements to the film. The characters are very captivating, especially the chemistry between Sarandon and Penn. The levels to both of their characters are difficult things to work through, but they pull it off very well and very realistically. The story is designed in such a way that it could have been littered with easy and predictable character relationships, but it went much further and delivered something very human and very sincere. The roles in this film are very emotionally demanding, especially Sarandon's. She acts her heart out though and pulls out an incredible performance that won her an Oscar.Dead Man Walking is an emotional film, but it's also a smart film. It doesn't strike the easy and obvious emotions pin points. Instead it makes you question a lot of your moral values and keeps you thinking from start to finish. The cast deliver powerful performances and Tim Robbins directs with a lot of simplistic emotional prowess that drives the film very well. It was a very worthwhile watch that I took a lot from.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than an "issue of the month" movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years there have been a number of films about the death penalty, nearly all of which, at least in recent years, have taken an anti-death penalty stance, possibly because the concept of deterrence, which is a key element of the pro-death penalty case, is something not easily dramatised on screen. The one exception is perhaps "Just Cause" (also from 1995), which starts off as a standard liberal anti-capital punishment drama and then appears to reverse its stance, probably because the plot hangs on a silly-clever twist which the scriptwriter threw in without caring that it negated the ideological stance he had taken at the beginning of the film. How one reacts to films of this nature probably depends to some extent on one's own attitude to the death penalty, yet although I am personally (for various reasons) opposed to capital punishment I frequently find them unsatisfactory or unconvincing. Probably the best is "The Birdman of Alcatraz", which approaches the question from an oblique angle by showing that even the most hardened murderer is capable of reform, followed by a few reconstructions of real-life miscarriages of justice, notably "Ten Rillington Place" which told the story of Timothy Evans and John Christie. Many of the others, however, simply proceed from the assumption that capital punishment is "barbaric". This has never struck me as a valid argument, merely an arrogant assumption of moral superiority over one's opponents in the debate and a claim that because of their supposed moral inferiority their arguments are not worthy of serious consideration. Nobody has ever been converted from one viewpoint to another simply by calling them a barbarian. Given that "Dead Man Walking" was directed by Tim Robbins, one of Hollywood's most prominent liberals, and starred his equally liberal long-term partner Susan Sarandon, I was expecting it to be another piece of moral grandstanding. Instead it takes a rather more subtle look at the moral issues involved. It is based upon the writings of Sister Helen Prejean, a Roman Catholic nun and anti-death penalty activist who appears as one of the two main characters. The other is Matthew Poncelet, a Louisiana death row prisoner who has been sentenced to death for the murder of a teenage couple and who asks Sister Helen to help him with his final appeal. When this is turned down, he asks her to be his spiritual adviser in the days leading up to his execution. Given his own political convictions, it would have been easy for Robbins to make a standard anti-death penalty "issue movie", presenting Poncelet as the victim of a miscarriage of justice or at least as someone who obviously deserves mercy because of strong mitigating factors in his case. He does not, however, try to make any excuses of this sort. At first Poncelet does indeed affirm his innocence, insisting that it was his accomplice who killed the two young people, and the rather na?ve Sister Helen is manipulated into supporting his spurious grounds of appeal. Only shortly before his execution does he admit his responsibility. There are, moreover, no circumstances which might mitigate his guilt. The killings were brutal and merciless, and Poncelet comes across as a vicious individual, arrogant, callous and quite openly racist, who at first shows no remorse for his crimes. It is hardly surprising that the families of his victims' regard him as a monster, less than human and less even than an animal. The film is not, however, a standard propaganda movie. It is perhaps unusual in that it approaches its subject matter less from a secular political standpoint than from a religious one. Sister Helen's Catholic faith is a vital part of this story. After Poncelet's application for a pardon is declined the film ceases to be the story of the battle to save his life and becomes the story of the battle to save- quite literally- his soul. "Redemption", for a Christian, is a supreme theological reality; it is not simply shorthand for "turning over a new leaf" or "making up for past mistakes". The message of this film is the same as that of "Birdman of Alcatraz"; no person, however wicked, is beyond hope of redemption. The difference is that "Dead Man Walking" interprets this idea in a literal Christian sense whereas John Frankenheimer's film interpreted it in a secular one. Sean Penn gives a very convincing performance as a man who seemingly delights in his reputation but whose diabolical persona is really a mask put on to avoid having to confront the awful reality of what he has done. Penn often makes a good villain, as in "Casualties of War", but his role as Poncelet is something more complex than just a straightforward bad guy. Susan Sarandon (a former girlfriend of Penn) received the "Best Actress" Oscar for her role as Sister Helen, although I thought that she was lucky to win ahead of Meryl Streep ("The Bridges of Madison County") and Emma Thompson ("Sense and Sensibility"). The reason may have lain in the Academy's tendency to spread its awards as widely as possible; Streep already had two Oscars under her belt in 1995, whereas Sarandon had previously been nominated three times without success. It is often difficult to portray saintly characters without making them seem insipid, and I do not think that Sarandon entirely succeeds here; Sister Helen occasionally comes across as too much of a wide-eyed innocent. My main criticism of "Dead Man Walking" would be that it is too slow moving and too dominated by talk. It does, however, succeed in taking a look at the human issues involved in the death penalty debate instead of making simplistic propaganda for one side or the other. It is more than an "issue of the month" film. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this movie shows that sometimes there are no blacks or white, but just shades of grey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE MOVIE AS A DEBATE: the movie is a significant contribution towards our understanding of the nature of the issue of capital punishment. and it has done an exceptional job in showing to us that sometimes it is not possible to take sides. The message is not put out there, it is hidden, not the obvious, and the movie doesn't try to look like it is propagating any message.a viewer could quiet possibly shift his stance from pro to against capital punishment or the other way around and at the end might have no opinion of all. Early in the movie when Mathew (Sean Penn) says that "i ain't killed anybody", you sort of wait to see if he really ain't a culprit, and sort of sympathize with a man on dead row, because you are not convinced that he is a culprit. Then the victim's parents grief and the horrible scenes from the murder site make you want to see the man who caused all of that dead. THE MOVIE AS ART: you definitely feel something is missing in the movie. it leaves you unsatisfied. there is little or no character development, and the acting is not so good. What makes this movie a worthwhile experience is the fact that it lets you peek into the last days of a man who is going to be executed, the people whose life he changed forever. and a good job has been done into achieving all of this. Scores are great and Nusrat Fateh Ali KHan just adds too much to the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walking a tightrope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many writers could easily have messed this up, but actor Tim Robbins - who also directed - skilfully negotiates a treacherous tightrope, taking hardly one wrong step on his way.The film is based on a true story. Susan Sarandon (Robbins' wife, but this is no vanity casting; Sarandon won a Best Actress Oscar for her performance) plays Helen Prejean, a nun who receives a letter from Death Row inmate Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn) seeking help in securing the services of a lawyer for his last-ditch defence against an impending execution. Prejean responds, and embarks on a relationship with the condemned prisoner that has a profound effect on them both.It would be easy for a subject like this to be turned into a by-the-numbers soap-like melodrama in the wrong hands, or a movie with a message by those with an agenda, but Robbins treads a deliberately neutral path with aplomb. He manages to humanise the character of a cold-blooded killer (well-played by Penn) and wins him the audience's empathy without turning him into a martyr or victim in order to do so. Prejean is at times depicted as well-meaning but naive and, if this film adaptation is close to the truth, it's a minor miracle that she wasn't simply chewed up by her experiences.</fullReview>

Whether or not you believe in the death penalty, or whether or not you believe the Penn character deserves to die for his crimes, is beside the point -- I defy anyone to watch this film and not at least be somewhat moved by the sheer warm pulse of humanity that courses through it.

I think the music of this movie had play a key role for its success. Because the chemistry of Susan's acting and Nusrat's music, is mind blowing. And one more thing you cannot forget Sean Penn. He had proved his talent in this movie. Screen play and direction is very good, making plot of the movie strong.

		<fullReview>DEAD MAN WALKING **** Recounting the true event, 'Dead Man Walking' is a lace of character and sympathy, societal issue, and spiritual impact. The film follows Sister Helen Prejean (played by Susan Sarandon) as she rises to the challenge of ministering to an inmate (Sean Penn) on death row. How the movie keeps momentum is focusing on the densely layered, emotional - as well as spiritual - relationship between the two leads as Sarandon makes known to Penn the spiritual prospective on life, and Penn deciding how to respond. The sections touching on how national punishment should involve itself in people committing serious felonies is supportive to the theme. The players are well-suited in writer-director Tim Robbins's gripping setting, who also contributes fine work, and the musical score does it justice that much more. A tough subject well told.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film whilst touching and sensitive is also a tribute to the talent of Tim Robbins and his wife Susan Sarandon. The film stars Sean Penn as a killer locked up on death row, awaiting his lethal injection. Sarandon is a nun who goes and visits him before he dies, trying to get a better understanding of him. This film is very sentimental, yet the quality of the production doesn't ruin its impact. It is a well made film with a lot of tender messages hidden deep within it. Penn provides sound support, and Sarandon puts on an Oscar winning performance as a woman who begins to empathise with the killers problem. The end scenes in which he dies are very moving and the story of what he did equals it on darkness and tension. It is a great film that is well worth watching.</fullReview>

The underrated Sean Penn is excellent as the condemned killer Matthew and is well supported by Susan Sarandon.The viewpoint of the murdered teenagers' families is shown to be unflinchingly in favour of Matthew's execution right to the bitter end. However, the film doesn't show them as bigoted and irrational, in fact their views seem perfectly normal considering the trauma they have been through. Matthew is boorish and unwilling to accept help throughout the movie until the truly touching moment when he apologises to the victims' families as his brutal execution by lethal injection is about to take place.Robbins allows us to make up our own minds about the death penalty while intending to depict it for what it is, a brutal, calculated act of state murder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dead Man Walking"'s excellence comes from two amazing performances by Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn. I've only seen either thespian in a couple of movies, and this is by far their best work. Sarandon is passionate and subtle as Sister Helen Prejean and Sean Penn is larger-than-life as the death row inmate Matt Poncelet. Both have great chemistry and deliver some captivating scenes that I have not seen since the works of Foster and Hopkins in "Silence of the Lambs".To my surprise, Tim Robbins was the director. I don't know what else he's directed, but he needs to do it more often. He not only captures the film, but puts the audience in with what the characters feel. However, the downside to this film is the music. It does not fit with the feeling of the movie, in fact, it disrupts some scenes. For instance, the movie starts with a sound of Blue Grass, but the finale ends with a soloist Arab. What the heck? Two totally different types of music, which don't fit the plot? It doesn't make any sense to me. Despite these poor choices of music, "Dead Man Walking" is an excellent, powerful film. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent. Few movies are "keepers". This makes my list.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I quite appreciated the balanced portrayal of both those adamantly for and against the death penalty (as it all keyed around this topic). Strongly showing how both sides felt, the families of the murdered as well as the families of the convict, the convict himself, and others involved. It stayed on topic of showing the horrors of the crime itself, rape &amp; murder, how bad they were/are, but without showing (distinguishable) nudity.Some bad language, but none was in a place where it would not truly have been much worse in real life. (That is the convict used some inappropriate language, but I'm sure that was lessened in the movie than in real life as opposed to most movies today where filthy language is added or emphasized cuz they think we viewers want to hear it.) I very much dislike any bad language, and I was not offended by this. When you talk to a convict, you will hear some. And I don't recall any other roles using bad language.I also saw this movie listed as with the "female nudity" category. It was not close-up, so this too was depicted well and in taste, in accordance with the movie. When showing dead bodies, all nudity was essentially not shown since what was shown was from such a distance. Even the rape scene was kept as clean as could be, in my opinion. Good for "picky" &amp; clean movie watchers such as myself. I understand the movie is about rape &amp; murder since it is so directly related to the topic. And all is depicted in a very appropriate manner, well, as a nun probably would condone. I am disgusted with nudity in modern shows, but I don't even consider what little nudity the show did include to even effectively be nudity. I personally would not classify it in such a category.A number of cute side-line funnies too. My favorite was when Helen Prejean was pulled over by the officer &amp; his comments to her. But you'll have to watch it yourself; my comment is a non-spoiler in every regard. The movie is well-worth watching.Overall, I would classify this as within my favorite 20 movies I've seen in my life. Very high on my list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a film about capital punishment, "Dead Man Walking" is effective, but the true brilliance of this picture, other than the acting by Penn and Sarandon, is that it deals with so much more. Touching such universal themes as revenge and redemption, crime and punishment, fear and salvation, the movie explores the relationship between Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn), a convicted murderer on death row, and his spiritual adviser, Sister Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon). The bond that develops between them is captured perfectly by Tim Robbins, with considerable help from his actors.Matthew Poncelet, along with a friend, raped and murdered a teenage girl along with her boyfriend back in 1988. Poncelet was convicted and sentenced to death. His execution rapidly approaching, Poncelet struck out to find anyone who could help him file his appeals and requests for pardon hearings. As Sister Helen Prejean accepts to be Matthew's spiritual counselor and helps Poncelet through the legal circus, she tries to get him to confess his sins and admit his guilt. Poncelet forcefully refuses, and Helen quickly finds herself as hated by the public as Poncelet is. Interacting with the victim's families takes her into their world, filled with remorse and anger. Meanwhile, Poncelet's execution comes closer and closer...Tim Robbins wrote and directed "Dead Man Walking", based on Helen's own book of the same name. The film really starts to grow on you as the relationship between Helen and Poncelet becomes curiouser and curiouser. At first, Poncelet appears to be nothing more than a common hood, who isn't worth saving at all and who evokes no sympathy. But Helen takes this man and crafts him into something that, while not quite "good," is genuinely remorseful and, maybe, worthy of redemption.Sarandon and Penn are to be commended for their Oscar-worthy performances, but the story itself is the real star, showing us the harsh reality of the execution process and the raw anger that it creates. 9/10</fullReview>

A subtly crafted script, brilliant performances by Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon and a delicate portrayal of events that lead to the execution of Sean Penn - for a brutal double crime of raping and killing - and most compellingly, the act of execution itself - gives the audience a first-hand exposure to the trauma experienced by all involved.It is indeed a very fine line. To kill or not to kill - that is the question. Why and who kills - is not the echoing thought you are left with. Instead you are haunted by the question - is it right to end a life regardless of who, when, why, how? Sean Penn's last words suggest otherwise. He has lived in a state of denial - not confessing and probably in his self-delusion convincing himself that he too was a victim of a bigger act of serendipity. When he breaks down in an uneventful moment and accepts his crime before Susan Sarandon, -the nun who has done everything she could to give him a fair chance - and subsequently apologizes to the parents of the victims just before his execution, the scenes of the brutal and shameless crime are brilliantly juxtaposed to the sophisticated act of execution. In those breathtaking final moments of catharsis, the audience is left with the big question - is taking a life right? Regardless of who does it.A must watch movie that leaves us with an issue to ponder over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very powerful film with powerful performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie really shook me and made me question my beliefs. No, it did not turn me from a pro-capital punishment to an anti-capital punishment or vice versa but it did present an alternate view point and very powerfully indeed. Although, I do not have any sympathy for the character played by Sean Penn but it surely did make me feel compassionate about another human being put to death no matter how terrible he was.Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn really played there parts with utmost conviction and I was glued to TV set from the very beginning till the last credits rolled on the screen. And when I got up I knew that I was a different person, different from the person who had started watching the movie 2 hours ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film deals with a death penalty, its based on a true story of a man that rapes a woman and kills her and her boyfriend, and he is given the death penalty. Sean Penn's performance in this is amazing as well as Susan Sarandon she is wonderful as the nun who tries to ease's Penn's character. It is powerful as well as touching on how a man can perform such a bad crime yet one woman touches his heart. This is the type of film you can watch again. Tim Robbins who directed this film and starred in the film Jacob's Ladder, both his performance as an actor and director are truly brilliant. The attack scene is powerful yet not as bad as whats been filmed in past movies, it was filmed as it was when it actually happened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Death Row we have here is a place of rigid inflexibility. There exists scant lawful allowance for a lenient interpretation of their crimes because they have already been condemned by the state. In this environment, everybody is made equal. Since we are all equal in God's eyes, too, does He take the same view as the penitentiary? Is there a chance for redemption in the afterlife where none exists in this corporeal realm?Sister Prejean, a nun, wears ordinary clothes. This is important, because despite the dim view of her attire taken by the governors, she wants Matthew Poncelot to take note and see that just for once there is someone willing to travel those depths with him. She doesn't need a different outfit, as a way of placing herself on a higher plane. Her faith is the armour against what she must experience - A Christian walking staunchly into the lions den.It is those who sin the greatest that need the most help. Matthew Poncelot is without doubt a sinner. Maybe we can't stop folks from dying, but we can at least help make sure they go at peace with their crimes when they do. Only when the perpetrators take responsibility for their mistakes can the victims achieve real justice. So by assisting the accused, you're indirectly assisting the bereaved families, as well. Jesus stood up for the disenfranchised, and so all true followers of his will try to do the same.That's the true message of this film. It does not ridicule those who seek the death penalty; although it does suggest that it's not an ideal solution. If you feel capable of listening to views that contrast with your own, watch this film. It's a compelling account of a horrible crime and how best to cope with it; and the main players involved in its conception have done themselves proud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful and personal examination of capital punishment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot say that I exactly enjoyed this film as rape, murder, and execution are not very pleasant to behold, even on screen. However, the movie gives an excellent glimpse into the true life story of the Louisiana nun, Sister Helen Prejean, and her anti capital punishment efforts, particularly her involvement with death row inmate, Matthew Poncelet. Both Susan Sarandon as the nun and Sean Pean as the convicted murderer, the Dead Man Walking, are masterfully compelling in their respective roles.First, the movie depicts quite vividly and despicably the horrendous crimes of rape and multiple murder Matthew has committed, and also its devastating effects on the victims' families. Personally, I am opposed to capital punishment and, since that is my philosophy, I must be prepared to acknowledge that death row murderers such as Matthew are most definitely NOT nice people, their actions unspeakable and even unthinkable to society.Yet, Susan Sarandon does a marvelous job portraying the nun's efforts to bring about Matthew's repentance and salvation, to connect with him and glimpse into his soul. Because of her faith in God, her stand against capital punishment is based on her belief that everyone is of more value than the worst act they have ever committed. Sean Penn effectively conveys Matthew's humanity, despite his horrendous crime. Whether or not the viewer still believes, after watching all the unfolding drama, that he deserves the death penalty is another question, up to each individual to decide.As for the execution, it is chillingly presented. The impressions of the death chamber and the cold, clinical lethal injection have lingered in my mind during these intervening years, though fortunately I've forgotten many of the details.The movie is not intended to be unbiased, and it's true that both Sister Perjean and the entire film seem more sympathetic toward the killer than to his victims' families. I understand and respect all the good faith arguments supporting the death penalty. However, Matthew's execution is unlikely to have brought these victims' loved ones much comfort or 'closure'. My views on capital punishment, including the scenario portrayed in this movie, can best be summed up by a wise old expression: "Two wrongs don't make a right." The film powerfully depicts this truth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extraordinarily powerful movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen. However, it is not for the faint of heart. It is by no means openly graphic or violent, but is emotional and powerful on a level that transcends entertainment for entertainment sake alone. It is right up there with American History X, in that it is extraordinarily moving, but not preachy, poignant, but a "good movie." Though this movie bleeds with unanswered and unanswerable death penalty questions, no matter what side you are on you will sympathize with this movie. Truly, if you aren't moved by at least one thing in this movie, you simply have no heart...I found myself simultaneously crying my eyes out for Sean Penn's "Matthew" when still feeling that he deserves just punishment for the crimes he was convicted of, weeping for the plight of the victims' families, while feeling that they were victimizing. Leaning very slightly to the left of the political spectrum, I am a bit indecisive regarding the humaneness of the death penalty. This movie did little to point me in one direction or the other - but that's not its point. It shows both sides of the story. The family who lost loved ones to a cold-blooded murder and the unquantifiable emotional toll that takes, and the death row inmate facing his last precious moments on earth. All in all, the end, and the story itself, is indescribably perfect...Others on this board have suggested that this is not the truth. That this movie was based on an allegedly true, but in reality, fictional, book. My response is, who cares... It may not be true. It may be partly true. It may be entirely true. Regardless, it does not affect the significance of the work as a moving and worthwhile view.</fullReview>

The first time my mouth hung open through most of the movie, at the raw and gut wrenching realness and flashbacks. I thought Helen Prejean had no business comforting that killer, as the victims had no comfort when they were murdered. All these murderers boo hoo about their past and how mommy did'nt kiss their butt enough so they had to get revenge on an innocent person. If you knew what these monsters really did to Faith Hathaway you would be sick. I think that in the real murder, the accomplice was the instigator and should have gotten the death penalty as well.Very shocking movie, excellently acted, sort of creepy music to send chills along your spine and will make you check your door lock to make sure you are safe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Superb film. Excellent acting. This is one of the movies I fell in love with before I even understood what actually makes a movie great. And now when I watch it I have a far greater love for it than I did when I first viewed it. What got me back then was that the story was so captivating and well written. Tim Robbins has wonderful direction. You can't really expect anything else from him based on the great films he's been in. Jacob's Ladder. The Shawshank Redemption. Dead Man Walking is about a convict named Matthew Poncelet on death row because of his involvement in the murder of two teenagers. But that's just the basics. There is so much more to the film. I won't spoil it by going into any real details. The critical thing that makes me love this movie so much is that Tim Robbins allows us to hear both sides of the story so to speak. We get a look into the anguish the parents suffer, and we get to see how Poncelet at first denies having did anything wrong, and then eventually comes around thanks to his spiritual adviser. Sean Penn is amazing as Poncelet and Susan Sarandon doesn't get any better as his spiritual adviser. The film is based sort of loosely on the book by the same name. It's still worth giving a read, and this film is definitely worth giving a look.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To all outward appearances, an anti-death penalty film. But quite the opposite to a critical thinker.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a powerful, well acted film about the relationship between a tattooed, racist dirtbag (Sean Penn) on Death Row for a brutal rape/murder, and an attractive, modernist nun (Susan Sarandon) who becomes his spiritual adviser.While the movie pretends not to take sides, it's clear message is that capital punishment is still qualitatively as brutal as criminal homicide. Although Sarandon appears to actively sympathize with the families of the victims, the "redemption" of the killer is the most important thing to her ego and those of the other anti-death penalty activists working for Penn's reprieve from Death Row. However, his eventual confession and acceptance of the evil of his acts only comes about when his appeals are exhausted and death is imminent. Real crocodile tears, not for his victims but for his own sorry carcass. After he's strapped into the lethal injection gurney, the camera depicts him in an upright crucifixion position. It was enough to make me sick and recall the Talmudic saying that "Kindness to the cruel is cruelty to the kind." How dare they even imply some moral equivalence between the legal execution of a murderer who was given full due process rights (and then some) and a brutal murder?! This man's victims didn't get to say goodbye to their families. They weren't granted the comfort of pre-death spiritual epiphanies. Just so the reader knows where I'm coming from, this writer is opposed to the death penalty. BUT not for pseudohumanitarian reasons. As a former law enforcement official, I have seen too many panicked witnesses, sloppy and/or unethical police officers, braindead judges and juries, and even coolly lying criminal competitors to have enough faith in the ability of any justice system run by human beings to invariably protect the innocent. The finality of death precludes remedial action for frame-ups and mistakes, even honest ones.No doubt, the husband and wife team of Robbins/Sarandon intended this to be a powerful anti-death penalty statement. But Penn's realistic portrayal of the murderer and Sarandon's equally effective rendering of the truly arrogant egomaniacs that some professional "humanitarians" really are, actually communicates a very different message to those whose thought processes go beyond slogans and preconceived notions. I came away from the movie regretting the fact that that human beings and their institutions are too flawed to permit the execution of scum like Penn's character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Robbins is a wonderful actor. He's an even better director. I believe he would have gotten that Oscar if the subject had been less controversial and his position less clear.Whether you agree with the movie's position on the death penalty, you can appreciate the human drama and the subtle relationship forming between the two main characters.Sean Penn is given his first real chance to let his talent shine and Susan Sarandon is quite simply amazing. They create characters that are completely believable and are shown uncloaked. They are human beings, not perfect heroes.Robbins never try to excuse or diminish the horrible nature of the crime committed by Penn's character. He shows us the grief of the victim's family. He never spares any side of the story. We are in fact shown every side of the death penalty debate and we are left to draw our own conclusion.I thought it was a brave move when you consider Robbins and Sarandon's well known position. I expected something far heavier. It's never obvious or complacent.It's quite simply a beautiful movie.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert "Dead man walking" is the warden's shout when a prisoner goes from death row to the execution chamber. Matthew Poncelet, trying to escape that line being used for him, writes to a city mission, asking for help obtaining legal representation. Instead, he gets a nun to visit, who finds that this convicted killer needs more than a lawyer. He needs to get right with God by facing whatever part he played in the murder of two teenagers. Even we are not sure what the real truth is, since the many flashbacks to the event are different, as Matthew's story changes, until his final confession.No matter what stance held on the death penalty, this movie will cause one to rethink the issue. On one hand are the families of the victims, who demand justice. On the other hand, killing-even executing-is wrong, and the accused also have families. There are quotes from the Bible to support either opinion. One scene does just that, showing Sister Prejean arguing with Chaplain Farlely quoting from the same Bible to arrive at two different points; in the next scene, the warden refuses to even get into that argument with a nun, knowing he'd lose.The main point is that "every person deserves respect." The main question seems to be: how does a person differ from an animal? We see a scene near the beginning of children beating a dead opossum. The lawyer goes through the list of how people have been executed through the ages, but "now we can kill them humanely, just like a horse." The father of the girl who was killed said that Matthew was not a person, but an animal, God's mistake. Because this film deals with such a heavy subject, I was glad to see some humor come in, when Sister Prejean and the lawyer are driving to the prison, and pass a sign: "Have Many Rabbit." They aren't sure if it's a "for sale" sign, a boast, or a cry for help. So too, we're not sure what the answer is to the question of how we deal with those who commit evil deeds among us, if we should consider them an animal beyond redemption, or a child of God who's chosen the wrong path. As Sister Helen pointed out, "Jesus... said that a person is not as bad as his worst deed."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do not walk away from this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dead Man Walking, Tim Robbins' first directing effort, with Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon as lead actors, while suffering from several forgiving but nevertheless irritating clichés follows the redemption of Matthew Poncelet (Penn). The latter is due to be executed for the murder of 2 teenagers, and requests Sister Helen (Sarandon) to guide him spiritually (or something like that).It seems Robbin struck gold with his first attempt, as Dead Man Walking is a very powerful movie (literally!) that relies on the 2 formidable lead actors and an equally excellent directing to show Poncelet's drastic change as his last day on this planet approaches and how Sister Helen is all affected by the events. Keeping this in mind, Dead Man Walking also has a very moving ending that will bring tears to your eyes. Music is also another formidable aspect of Dead Man Walking, particularly the music that plays at the end of the movie. This is a good thing given all the ideas the movie is bound to stir in you concerning the death penalty and what it involves.Dead Man Walking is a truly excellent movie, and I'd recommend it to anybody. If anything else, watch it for Penn's stunning portrayal of an arrogant racist who nevertheless recognizes his faults and errors throughout the movie.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having received letters from a death row inmate named Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn), who committed murder and rape, Sister Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon) decided to visit Poncelet and help him to be put off his penalty. As the short, remaining days went by, Sister Helen gently guided Poncelet to re-discover the humanity that's inside him, and in the meantime, she also visited Poncelet's and the victims' and families to comfort them. Sister Helen did her utmost but the governor would not change the verdict. Before Poncelet was executed, Sister Helen made him confront the truth, the crimes that he committed. She was there to be the face of love for him, at his last minutes, last seconds.We see the suffering of Poncelet's mother for her beloved and to-be-executed son, and of the young couple's (the victims') families. We see the hatred that was inside Matthew Poncelet, we see the remarkable spirit of Sister Helen and the final confession and atonement of Poncelet. Through this film we see that to take a life in order to do justice cannot bring the lost lives back and not an individual, nor a government has the right to take a life, no matter what that person has done. For man is not to play God.I am not sure if this part has been fictionalised, since I have not read the book, but as the movie progresses, Sister Helen recalled the cruelty towards animals she manifested when she was a child. Who can say he or she is never guilty? Who would not seek forgiveness when one is genuinely willing to atone? 'Let the one among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her/him'.We also witness the transition of Poncelet's mentality, from lying about his innocence to acknowledging his crimes, he eventually set himself free by seeking the truth and facing it.The picture deals with the issues regarding capital punishment, the idea of 'an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth', the suffering of all parties as human beings, and the struggle for forgiveness. Sean Penn delivered an absolutely powerful performance which leaves you breathless and Susan Sarandon was as amazing as ever. Much credit must be given to writer-director Tim Robbins, who wrote very, very moving dialogue and presented the images with overwhelming effects. With an ending that expresses that there is always hope and the chance to obtain peace of mind. 'Dead Man Walking' is brilliant.We are all human beings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is also about the murderer admitting to his crime - regardless of the outcome.'Dead Man Walking' is one of my favourite movies of all time because it's beautifully shot and sensitive, and doesn't take sides at any time. It shows the pain of people who have lost their nearest and dearest, their children, and it also shows the murderer as a human being who has no choice but to live with his crime - or die with his crime - and accept it.When you see both points of view, feel for the parents and get to know the murderer as a human being, the issue of the death penalty becomes so much more intricate than you'd think. You want revenge and you want to save the murderer at the same time.Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon's performances are excellent, it is a pity the movie didn't get better publicity when it came out.The soundtrack is amazing - esp if you can get hold of the real score and not the more publicly availabl/commercial version - although very good too, don't get me wrong.Well, that's my view for what it's worth - I hope it will encourage people to see the movie or see it again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't go into the whole plot outline..basically what you need to know is that Sean Penn is on death row for murder, and Susan Sarandon becomes his spiritual advisor.I'll start by letting you know that if you're heavily into action movies, or movies that will keep you on the edge of your seat, than I don't think that this movie will be for you, because it's mostly just talking, for about two hours. But somehow, it never gets boring. At least it never did to me. A lot of the reviews on here talk about how some of the talking parts get slow, but again, they never got dull in the slightest in my opinion. Maybe it's because Sean Penn is my favorite actor, and I love what he did with this character. I love how he played this role. and our two main characters and just interesting, and interact very well.This movie is really a pretty simple one. But it's told in a way that you don't see in many movies. It's pretty bold in the sense that there really isn't a whole lot to it EXCEPT for the two of them talking. And most of it is shot in a way so when the camera is on one of them, you see the reflection of the other on the other side of the glass. It's like Tim Robbins really wanted you to know both of these characters.It's also pretty interesting how this is a movie about the death penalty, but it really never does lean toward either side. It never lets you know if the person who wrote it is for or against the death penalty, it simply tells a story of a man on death row, and the nun who becomes his spiritual advisor.I recommend this movie to pretty much anyone with an open mind. You have to come into this movie knowing what you're getting, and don't expect a lot of action, because you won't find any here...But you will get a lot of drama, and heart.An all around great, great movie...check it out..ps...there are a few parts in here that are pretty emotional, so if you guys are planning on watching this movie with a girl, you better have your "i have something in my eye" excuses ready...heh, wussies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humane, brilliantly acted and continually engrossing character-study.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the scenario won't have audiences flocking to see it world-wide, `Dead Man Walking' is still a terrifically executed death-row drama. What's good is the way it isn't a campaign against the death penalty, but rather a character study of redemption and realisation. The narrative is strong throughout and never gets boring or un-involving. It's been often said that a drama is nothing without high level acting. And this film has that in spades. Sean Penn makes a career breakthrough as the murderer days away from an inevitable death. He is totally believable as a serial killer on death row and was a good choice for the part. At the peak of her `enter-the-public-conscience' roles Susan Sarandon almost outshines Penn in her subtler but equally mesmerising part as the non-habit wearing nun. She has emotional power in her role and does what she does best- sympathise. While she was well due for a much needed Oscar win, I believe Sharon Stone should have won that year for her breakthrough as the call girl in Scorseses' `Casino'. This is followed up by some brilliant camera work by hubby actor-cum-director Tim Robbins who should have won the Academy Award for Best Director that year. This is about as good as prison dramas get.This is engaging without being manipulative and well concluded without going for an unconvincing `Hollywood' ending. The result is a highly interesting drama documentary that definitely deserved the attention that it received. So I recommend `Dead Man Walking' and give it a good 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strangely open-minded portrait of the death penalty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing that blew me away about this movie was how astonishingly open-minded it was about the death penalty.By this I mean: I'm sure DMW can be safely characterized as anti-death penalty. But the movie comes so close to showing the "good" side of the death penalty, that the movie is clearly, distinctly "saved" from being a piece of bleeding-heart anti-DP propaganda. Nothing could do more damage to the pro-life side of the issue than a piece of hand-wringing, doe-eyed dreck; and this movie is not that.DMW does what I expect all good movies to do; using small brush strokes, the movie paints a picture of something larger than the images and words, themselves. And in this case, it's large indeed: The death penalty is a moral hurricane, and it takes someone like Sister Helen to brave those buffeting winds to find the calm eye at the heart of that storm. I'm sure she'd like me to allow that God "pushed" her into that eye: Fine. It's perhaps a high compliment to aver the script/direction gives berth to this interpretation.I've talked at length about this "larger picture" aspect of DMW, but should also point out the well-integrated affective dimension to this; it's not just an intellectual exercise.Anyway, I am going to scare up a copy of the book and read it. The movie was that good.Well.... I have one complaint; Sean Penn did a fine job, but his "southern" accent was a weak point. Sorry. B^)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big supporter of the death penalty, and I loved this movie. It is clear that the makers of this movie are against the death penalty but they don't lie or exaggerate to make their case. ****SPOILERS**** Matthew Poncelet, the convicted, is clearly guilty and unrepentant. This is true for virtually everyone on death row. Most other films (or political campaigns) against the death penalty take the chicken s**t approach of portraying a man who is innocent, then is executed. This film has the guts to tell it like it is, then makes it's case. It says that even a guilty man should not be put to death. I don't agree, but at least I can respect the messenger who fights fair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Susan Sarandon is, for lack of a better word, incredible. In my opinion (and yes I do understand that not everyone will agree with me here), she is one of the greatest actresses EVER and should have at least 2 oscars to her credit. I mean, that was an AMAZING performance in Lorenzo's Oil (but then I think every performance of hers is amazing) and they gave it to Emma Thompson...what was that about??? And by the time she got this oscar, she'd been in the industry for some 25 years. I couldn't think of anyone who deserved it more, especially for a performance as brilliant as her portrayal of Sister Helen Prejean. But then again, she is over and above all the artificiality of Hollywood and doesn't need an oscar - people know she's good anyway.This film carries some very deep, thought-provocing messages, so needless to say it is not to be taken lightly. Tim Robbins, of course, can't escape credit here. You would think that, because of his person feelings against the death penalty, the portrayals made in this movie wouldn't be accurate. However, both sides of the death-penalty debate are given even weight. On one side, you see the interesting side of Matthew, the human side which makes witnessing his death rather heart-wrenching. At the same time, you see the way he savaged his victims and the constant torment of the understandably grief-stricken parents. One word for Tim - BRAVO.A brilliant movie and, like I said, a well-deserved and long awaited oscar for Susan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dead Man Walking is an excellent film, mainly due to the performances of its cast. Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn are simply fantastic as Sister Helen Prejean and the death row inmate to whom she offers counseling. I was also impressed by the actors playing the parents of the couple murdered by the prisoner and his cohort in crime. Overall director Tim Robbins seemed to address the issue of the death penalty in an even-handed way, but I take issue with Sister Helen's strongly-held belief that "killing to prove that killing is wrong is wrong." To me, the larger, more important issue is keeping the innocent safe from predation by vicious killers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dead Man Walking" is a film not about the death penalty, but about the people involved in a death penalty case -- the killer, the families whose kids were killed, the nun who becomes his spiritual advisor, and what happens. It tells the story with little fanfare but a lot of compassion and sensitivity. I have it on DVD, and every time I watch it (not often, it's never an easy film to watch) I'm more impressed by what Tim Robbins and the entire cast did here. So revealing that it could be a documentary, so compelling you can't take your eyes away, so subtle and yet so powerful... "Dead Man Walking" is nothing short of a masterpiece. It doesn't matter whether you're for or against the death penalty (or even have no opinion), this movie will have you thinking about the issues for sure. It takes a courageous screenwriter and director to look this material in the face without flinching even once, and everyone involved in the film pulls it off -- there isn't a single scene that rings false. A masterful film, but don't expect light viewing... to some, the final scenes could be more graphic than anything imaginable, even though no blood or violence is shown. You get drawn into this film and become a participant, and there's a character for just about everyone to identify with. 10/10.</fullReview>

It is easy to say who is more likeable, but it is hard to say who is more convincing. they are simply magnificent.You may think that all killers should be killed or you may argue that life without parole is no life and that death is more merciful. whatever your personal feeling, this movie gives you a chance to pause and reconsider.At the end one simply wants to sit in silence and reflect.

		<shortDescription>WOW</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dead Man Walking, directed by Tim Robbins, is the remarkable story of two people brought together by chance, who change each other's lives. Sean Penn delivers an outstanding performance as Mathew Poncelot, a convicted murderer on death row. Poncelot writes a letter to a nun named Sister Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon) and she becomes his spiritual advisor. Penn and Sarandon are brilliant together. The ability to act without music is mastered by both of them.At first, Sister Prejean doesn't quite know what to think of this man. He keeps insisting that he is innocent and wants a lie detector test. Flashback scenes are used to show Sister Prejean imagining his crime. Penn plays Poncelot well, as the convict gives Sister Prejean a disturbing first impression of himself. There is something inside of Poncelot though, something Sister Prejean, as well as the viewer, can see in his eyes, a living breathing human being, not just a monster. This gradually shows more and more throughout the film as Sister Prejean grows to like him and care about his well being. Many times during Dead Man Walking, the viewer catches a glimpse of the murder scene. Truly dramatic and heart wrenching, these scenes show Poncelot and another man carry out their crime in the pitch black woods and this is shot very realistically.Dead Man Walking focuses a great deal on camera angles. These new ways of shooting give the movie a more creative feel. For example, in one scene, when Poncelot and Sister Prejean are talking across from each other with glass in between them, the reflection of the other face can be seen next to the speaker. These new camera angles are a pleasure to watch. There is quite a bit of intertwining of scenes, yet they are easy to understand and are very creative.Dead Man Walking is a very emotional movie. From seeing the victims' parents tell their stories, to Poncelot himself, the actors show us what it feels like to go through things many of us cannot even imagine; being convicted of murder, losing a child, seeing someone you care about put to death. Penn's portrayal of Poncelot's fear is very scary to think about. The ultimate theme is that killing is wrong, whether it be capitol punishment or murder.</fullReview>

This movie actually caused me to go out to find and read the book (Which is rare for me). Sister Helen exerted more of a spiritual tone than a religious(Which is also rare). And it presented both sides to the issue so that people on both sides who watched the movie wouldn't feel that a point was left out. And we have the director to thank for that. This is not a film for entertainment. But it is film that delivers a message that can reach to the core of your heart. I can't think of another film like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie which gives you a choice - maybe too irritating for some?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read most of the comments I feel like I have a word to say as well.What bothers me most is that most people here are think that this movie is either pro or con to the subject of death penalty and whether it worked with them. I remember having read an article back in 1995 when the film was published (yes, it has interested me so much ever since I heard that it would come out that I have not forgotten about the articles I read back then) in which Tim Robbins said that he did not want to make a movie to convince audiences of neither one nor the other.And I think that is completely right. I have to admit that I believe that in the way he made this film he did tend a little bit to the anti-death-penalty-side, but nevertheless people are still allowed to make their own choice. And this is a very rare thing in American films.I have shown this movie to many people since it came out and I have seen all kinds of reactions. Death-penalty-supporters became opponents or became even stronger in their belief. And many death-penalty-opponents (including me) grew stronger in their belief that death penalty should be abolished everywhere in the world. But I have even seen opponents turn into supporters. This and the fact that people here seem to fight about it shows to me that there are really many ways of looking at it. So whatever effect it has on you, the important thing is that it makes you THINK.This is one of the few movies that really gives you the choice, that does not shy away with a simple path by making the convicted either bad or innocent. This may be a tough thing for people who prefer being entertained or tought a lesson. There is no lesson here you need to find one yourself.Everyone praises the acting, directing and the music but since this has been said so many times the I will not repeat it all again.So if you have not seen this yet, do so - if you dare to be challenged!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>does the punishment fit the crime?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a nun, Sister Helen, and a convict, Poncelet, who's on death row. That and the fact that it is a very good film is surprising, refreshing. It is about much more than just capital punishment- but about poor southern whites, like Poncelet, raised without a loving, responsible father- about the racial divide that still exists, evidenced by Poncelet's bigoted racist speech and Sister Helen's work amongst the poor black children- about the effects of bad company, using drugs and being drunk, which led to the horrid, brutal crimes committed landing Poncelet in prison- and then yes, about death by legal injection as punishment for those who've beaten, raped and murdered. *IF* the film's point was to make the viewers abhor capital punishment, it did not work on me. It almost had the opposite effect. It made me rethink the whole issue. When you see a reenactment (as tastefully done, I think, as it could be) of 2 teens being brutally beaten, the girl raped twice, stabbed, shot in the head, et cetera, and Poncelet staying as callous as he could for years afterward about the whole thing, right up until his date is set for execution, it left me thinking that perhaps capital punishment does indeed fit certain crimes. And I thought for sure the film would have the opposite effect on me, when I first read about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike the majority of people that have commented on this movie, I feel it supports capital punishment. I'll try to explain this view now, but if you have any questions or would like to discuss this, please feel free to email me. I believe this movie shows that without the death penalty, Matthew would not have confessed to what he did. He would never have asked for forgiveness nor made peace with God. In short, he would have spent eternity in hell for his actions. However, after he lost his final appeal, he realized there was no use in playing the part of a tough man, and he broke down. It was at this point that he admitted to the role he played in the killings, accepted responsibility for his actions, and asked for forgiveness. It was only when Matthew was looking death in the eye that he saved his soul, and prepared it for an eternity in heaven. So to me, this movie shows that without the death penalty, Matthew would have had a better earthly existence, but would have spent eternity in hell. As a result of capital punishment, his earthly existence was cut short; however, his soul was saved from eternal damnation. So although this movie is very sad and shows that capital punishment is not easy for anyone involved, it is nonetheless a necessary evil.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on a book by Sister Helen Prejean, it chronicles her involvement with a prisoner on Louisiana's Death Row. Sister Helen gets a letter from convicted murderer Matthew Poncelet and honors his request that she visit him on The Row. After their meeting, he asks her to be his spiritual advisor, and she agrees. It does not turn out to be an easy job for the well-meaning nun. Tim Robbins has done a commendable job in adapting and directing this affecting drama. If you are expecting Dead Man Walking to be a politically correct, liberal plea against capital punishment, you will be surprised by the writer/director's evenhandedness in presenting all sides of the issue. The overt Christ-like imagery near the end is a bit much, but the rest is relatively fair and square. Dead Man Walking also benefits from two superb leading performances. Sean Penn is chilling as the creepy Poncelet, who has a pompadour that Jim Carrey could envy. Susan Sarandon, as sister Helen, delivers, as usual, an unadorned performance that is quietly powerful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't read this until after you've seen the film. It has some info about a relationship between two main characters and is mostly an opinion on an issue taken by the movie's director.People say that this movie is somehow a fair debate of the death penalty, but I don't agree. I imagine that had Joseph Goebbels survived the Second World War and moved to Hollywood he would have made a film portraying Hitler as a good, likable guy. Sure, if you're "fair to the other side" by occasionally showing war scenes, or maybe even a gas chamber, it'll qualify as a "side in a debate," as this movie does. A piece by Joseph Goebbels would certainly qualify as great entertainment, as this movie does. But ultimately, such a movie would be what this movie is: a piece of one-sided, propagandistic garbage that seeks to humanize evil.The criminal in this movie has participated in the murder of two young people, and a rape. In that, he is very much like the people whom the state puts down on the people's behalf. Where he is unlike them is in that he has a soft, human side that "just needs to be brought out" by a symphathetic nun. Hardened criminals don't have a softer side! During the movie the family of the victims, to whom the nun (amazingly) goes to asks her: How can you associate with such a man? Neither her answer nor any answer can satisfy. People who can rape and murder others are fundamentally different from the general public. It is true that many are capable of bad acts, but it takes a different sort to actually go and do it. Has Robbins ever been in a prison? Has he ever talked to cons at length? Has one of his loved ones ever been raped or murdered? Maybe if that was the case he'd be less inclined to chant "free Mumia" or hold candlelight vigils for Timothy McVeigh. Entertainment aside, this movie makes me puke.</fullReview>

The death penalty puts these people in the same position as they put their victims and that is being helpless over whether they will live or die. With the death penalty it is society that determines whether they will live or die. The nun got a taste of how the victims family feels about this killer. They had no mercy. He was only repentant at the end because he knew he was going to die.As far as the acting, Shawn Penn gave a great performance. He is an great actor, who finally won a much deserved Oscar last year.

We are shown a murderer and rapist, a totally despicable man; and the woman of God who tries to fight for his mind and soul. I couldn't get into it at first because I felt no sympathy for him. However, it wasn't about whether I felt sympathy for him or hoped for a successful appeal. It was about taking a monster, an evil man and seeing the humanity in him. In the end, I still felt no sympathy for the man. My opinions on the death penalty did not change. But the journey I took with the character made me both think and feel feelings in ways that few movies can affect me.This movie plays like a documentary, and I feel that showing the victims' families side of things made this movie stronger.On the down side, the plot was very very linear. The bad characters are too evil to sympathize with, the good characters act too reasonably to condemn; so there is little room for debate or moral ambiguity. Plus, the constant religiousness didn't help things much. If I had seen this movie a few years earlier, I would have been bored.6.5/10 (voted 6)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The road to hell . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have issues with the death penalty. I believe in it in theory, but I don't believe in it the way it is administered. There, I said it. So, it's not the obvious anti-capital punishment stance that turned me off to this movie. For a true story, these were the most unrealistic characters I've seen in some time. Susan Sarandon delivers the worst southern accent since Michelle Pfeiffer in Dangerous Minds, and I never, ever saw the reason Sister Prejean was so bent on helping our convicted murderer guy. I'm sure that in real life she had a reason, but I sure can't tell what it was from this movie. This was made-for-television quality at best. The message might have been worthwhile, but the presentation was so contrived that it came across as a propaganda film . . . and I don't necessarily agree with the message, so I'm very doubtful it changed any pro-capital punishment minds. Lame, lame, lame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty damn lame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were a number of problems I had with this film and the first is the political persuasion of the director and two main stars. For some reason, extremely liberal minded people tend to highlight the plight of killers in an attempt to raise sympathy. This theme is automatically off-putting and you need one hell of a script to pull it off.The blatant death penalty opposition was tedious. The continual referral to state sanctioned "murder" and the lethal injection causing a bodily Armageddon really got my eyes rolling and it was abundantly clear that they wished to use this film as an anti-death-penalty platform. Only thing is - this film failed to convince me and I live in a country where we don't even have the death penalty. Even Penn strapped at the end with tears in his eyes really didn't move me all that much. He was a murderer and his crimes were unforgivable. The fact that a "good-hearted" person might be at the core of every murderer doesn't inspire me to express outrage at the laws which proscribe the death penalty for murder. While the film doesn't completely ignore the fact that there were innocent victims, it approached that aspect the story way too self-consciously. It ensured that he really was convicted of a cold-blooded murder, but seemingly did so to ensure that no one would criticise the film for misrepresenting murderers on death row. Yet, the substance of the crime itself was largely used as a precept to the appellate court proceedings through which Robbins, in turn, could spout compassionate, yet legally baseless drivel against the death penalty. Another issue I had was the self-importance. Indeed, the film was ridiculously overlong and I was checking my watch frequently during the last 40 minutes. The plot was simplistic, yet somehow, Robbins hoped that the emotional and poignant texture of the film would carry it. But when a movie that tries to do this has me looking at my watch, I'm not totally convinced they pulled it off.I give it a low rating, but it earns a star for the recreating the steely prison atmosphere without overstating it. Or perhaps the critical praise of the performances in this film have already hogged up too much on the 'overstating' side of things?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Robbins is amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may seem weird that in my one line summary that I said that Tim Robbins is amazing while the film has such great acting and feeling that I mention Robbins. Well, Robbins has proved himself with this film as a incredible film-man, who can act, produce, and now write and direct (even though he made a satire in 1992). He delivers a powerful (if not climatic) film with 2 performances that make this film all the worth while- Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn. Penn (in a Oscar nomination nabbing role) plays a convicted killer of 2 people on death row and Sarandon (in a Oscar nabbing role) as the nun who is trying to redeem him before he passes on. To some it might seem boring that there is no plot and only a story. But to these same people they probably thought Blankman was the best film of the year. A great director (like Robbins) can tell a story and keep (some of) a audience in control and awe. This film does that, without revealing if it is for or against the death penalty. One of the best films of 1995. A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performances, but biased.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching Dead Man Walking again after so many years. It was obvious that Robbins intended to get a message across. That "killing is wrong ..no matter WHO does it" I gathered that much from it. But the movie in MY opinion was biased. I say that simply because the Sean Penn character (well played by Penn)was being portrayed as a victim, even though the character claimed to not want to be a victim. All the performances were great..without question. But while the movie dealt with the grieving parents vaguely, it played to anti death penalty advocates to a degree that I found almost unbearable. I felt absolutely no empathy for Penns character which basically tells of how much of a genius actor he is.But the film for me just reeked of anti death penalty rhetoric as it portrayed the victims families as narrow minded and bloodthirsty which I thought was unfair. It's more than obvious that I am pro death penalty, and I don't believe that this movie satisfied both sides of the argument. Don't misunderstand me..ALL of the performances were great. But in all honesty the film had a bias.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While reading reviews, I saw positive feedback pointing to reflection on the death penalty. I have thought about this issue a lot, and support the death penalty for a multiple murderer. For that reason, I wasn't rooting for Mathew to be killed. However, this movie angered me. It did not make me think. Mathew was cold, manipulative and just arrogant throughout. Not only did he drag a nun into his business and make it her job to save him, he expected her to support him blindly. He had no sympathy for the victims or their families until he had to face them before his death, and even then, he didn't address the rape. Or ever show sadness over that act. He didn't apologise to Hope's family, despite raping her and watching her die. When the sister fainted, he didn't once ask her about it in a caring manor, he was mad it rendered him alone. He angered me the whole way through. But worse, the sister. She was blindly loyal from day one, and she had this sad look on her face the whole time. I could of been sick when she was singing to him, or kissing his shoulder, or telling him she loved him. She visited the families, while going against their opinion, and just dealt with that whole issue wrong. She then sat next to those parents while their child's murderer and herself told each other they loved each other. She didn't once question him, or he anything other than tearful and quiet. I cant help but feel like she was manipulated and that it was a cold, calculated move on Mathews part. He spoke about God, then answered no when the sister asked him if he had read the bible. Overall just.. meh.I did not find this done well at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unmotivated Script - Job Not Well Done!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dead Man Walking", the guard says before an execution, when the accused in a death row walks towards the electric chair or lethal injection.A man, who has been sentenced to death, living a kind of a borrowed life is very close to his death and in his desperation tries to plead mercy before a jury to spare his life. This film, intentionally or unintentionally, is about acceptance of death. A real intense feeling which directors like Kurosawa, Bergman, Wenders and Kiarostami have beautifully explored. But, has "Dead Man Walking" done justice to it? Honestly, I feel if it wasn't for Tim Robbins, this film would never have been made. The content lacked, so did the motivation. The music irrelevant and so was the editing - haphazard.Most people appreciated Sean's acting to a great extent which was not at all visible to me. He bursting into tear, or trying to flirt with the Nun(Susan) was superficial (But not for Tim, he decided to take a close up on that).Anyway, keeping aside the not-so-great acting, un-thoughtful music and too dramatic editing, the film fails at the basic level of content or 'Script'.It wasn't a man's journey to acceptance of death as it is never shown why, in his desperation, when he turns to religion, what peace does he find. What is it that matters even more than life? Does he really believe, under such stress, that there is a heaven where he might go and be away from all this? Some people might say it is just an assumption to think that it was a man's journey to accept death. It might be a love story between the two. Sounds right too. Both of them had similar incident in their past and they could relate to each other and felt the need. Perhaps. But where is the feeling? What am I feeling in the middle of all this? Am I not a part of this film? This goes for most of the films and this being my first review, I wish to judge it in this scale too.</fullReview>

While I believe that our judicial system should let the punishment fit the crime, and I personally have lack of sympathy for convicted murderers (not those who do a person in for self-defense), this movie's story and acting itself is compelling as it depicts a nun who empathizes with both the killer and the victim's families. It delves in the background of the doer and the sufferer with much intense drama.Good acting and tension-filled moments, especially in the fallout of the nun's emphasizing with the convicted killer. But, the plot does tend to drag and there are few surprises in the film. Grade C</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie that will tear you to two parts; a minute you are with killing the criminal and another you are against it because you see his weakness and even when you put yourself in the nun's shoes who is also lost but her duty and religion taught her to accept all God's creatures no matter what they do (Father forgive them for they know not what they do), you will find yourself torn between hating the guy and feeling sorry for him at the same time. The movie is brilliant and this goes to the directing skills of Tim Robbins more than the story itself because the director chooses to take you away from the victims and their parents who only show few times in the movie and focus a lot of time on the murderer (Sean Penn) while objectively showing you his two faces of good and evil letting you decide reasonably if to like him or not. At the end before they kill him the director plays for few seconds the murder scene and shows the victims parents and then shift to the murderer being prepared to die and to his parents weeping. Just like Gibran Khalil Gibran once said: "was Jesus mother sadder than Judath's!" Well, you need to watch this movie and decide to yourself if you are with or against death execution and you will definitely enjoy discussing this movie and topic with friends if you are weirdos like my friends and myself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a hard film for me to rate. It is clearly great and powerful. It is beautifully written and the performances are all top notch. A lot of people have said that this is a sad movie, but I would tend to disagree, instead insisting that it is more of a depressing one. I didn't dislike the story at all, but I wouldn't say it was one I really enjoyed either. The reason that I did not really enjoy it was not because it was bad, but just something that I did not really enjoy to watch. I get that that is pretty much the whole point of the film; you are not supposed to be having a ball seeing what is happening in this movie, so do not think that I am being negative when I say that it is not something that I enjoyed to watch. It certainly did not help that right before I put this movie in for the first time I heard about a real life brutal murder on the news. That made this movie a lot more difficult to watch.One big problem that I did have with this film was with the audio. During many scenes the characters spoke very softly, to the point that I had to turn the volume up to even begin to hear what was being said. That added with Sean Penn's accent made it so I had to re-watch some scenes to hear what was being said. I definitely recommend everyone to check this film out. It deserves a watch, but if you have just heard about a tragic, real life killing, I might hold off for a few days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nobody would quite agree to state that the depiction of a vexatious execution through lethal injection and Christian church's advocacy of revenge citing bible as a reference would make for any kind of serious or meaningful entertainment.But "Dead Man Walking" is still regarded as an important American film which any avid cinema admirer must definitely watch.However,it can be surmised that not all people would be pleased by its subject matter.This is because Hollywood actor Tim Robbins chose to portray an extremely difficult subject of capital punishment which has always had its fair share of supporters and opponents."Dead Man Walking" scores as it is filmed in extremely bright colors and its soothing musical score featuring veteran icons of rock music Bruce Springsteen and Eddie Vedder induces viewers to feel a compassionate sympathy towards the film's protagonist who is going to be punished for his vile acts.A lot of this film's moments of suspense would have died a natural death if it were not for the denouement which throws interesting light about the convicted man's past life.This is something which gives ample value to sister's role played by Susan Sarandon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Matthew Poncelet Wasn't A Real Person......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just to clarify, Matthew Poncelet wasn't a real person, but a character combination of 2 killers who were BOTH convicted and sentenced to die for a murder of two teenagers.I read the User Comments and they react as if Matthew was real. The character is based on a mixture of two killers, Elmo Patrick Sonnier and Robert Lee Willie (who murdered separate people) and the murder itself was based on the one Willie committed. The conflict of both Willie having someone else present and both parties swearing the other did the killing is worked into the story as well.Prejean's approach is unique in that she not only is ministering to the convicts as they wait for their death and aiding them in taking responsibility for their actions, she also reaches out to the victims' families, to help them know that the convict did, indeed feel remorse for what they did-effectively aiding both parties.Everyone posting here seems to have strong beliefs on the Death Sentence. It's not my place to say it's right or wrong-in theory punishing death with death makes some sort of Karmic sense, however denying a person their freedom for the rest of their days, although costly, makes more sense to me-being stuck in a small room 23/7 (with one hour of exercise)for the rest of their days to be reminded of the cruel thing they did seem a more apt punishment-they are technically alive, but denied living. Say someone killed someone so they could get out of the responsibility the person they killed required (like Susan Smith killing her poor kids by shoving her car into a lake). I find it fittingly ironic that they would not get that "freedom" they craved and would now have to spend the rest of their days imprisoned.Prejean's point comes through the story very well. She has my respect-she manages to find that balance-she isn't supporting a killer, she is guiding them to accepting what they did. If they didn't feel some kind of remorse, they wouldn't be asking for spiritual guidance.Ona final note, when Poncelet apologizes to Delacroix parent for killing his son, the parents of the girl who was also murdered mutters something about why he didn't apologize for her death. I think the point was that throughout the movie, Poncelet denies killing both kids. There is doubt in Prejean's mind he did both killings-there is a friend who was sentenced but not to death-my thought is that Poncelet killed the Delacroix boy and the other man murdered the girl-hence Poncelet was taking responsibility for what he did. Had he been responsible for the girl's death, he probably would have apologized for that as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie many years ago and it has never left my list of all-time best films ever made. When I first watched it, I was just beginning what has become a life-long passion for justice. It gave an interesting perspective of the death penalty and also gave me a few things to think about.When you have a cast like this one, you are right to assume it is going to be nothing short of fabulous. This is, by far, the best role I have ever seen Sean Penn play (along with I am Sam). He nails the role, doesn't glamourize his actions while doing so. He manages to maintain a level of debauchery throughout the movie that I think was very important. Up until the very end, he does not try to be seen as anything more than what he is. He is a sick man who regrets his past, but still makes excuses for it. He ends up able to redeem his sense of self-worth as much as a convicted (and guilty) murderer can through the aid of Susan Sarandon's character, Sister Helen Prejean. Her character taught me about good will towards others without making me forget how horrible a person's actions can be and without making excuses for them.The supporting cast was also top-notch. I was surprised to see a small cameo of Jack Black in this film given the funny-man he has become today! I loved this movie for both personal reasons and just because it was a work of cinematic art. And, in my opinion, this is one of the rare exceptions when the movie far out-did the book.</fullReview>

Director Robbins proves that he knows how to handle himself behind the camera with controlling two powerhouses like Sean Penn and wife Susan Sarandon, but sadly there was just nothing spectacular about the story. This was one of those films that I felt like I had to watch because of all the publicity that it was receiving, and when I finished watching it I sat there dumbfounded. This was a good movie. Was it great? I don't think so. Was it one that would give the Academy a warm fuzzy feeling if they nominated? I think yes. That is the only reason I think this film was up for the awards that it was granted. The Academy has never been one to reach out to the smaller, more disturbing films (like anything by David Gordon Green) and award. It was obvious this year too when Lord of the Rings took home all those darn Oscars and the smaller films were left in the dust. Sad.Grade: *** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why DMW is good, but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes the whole is just the sum of the parts. Most of the parts here are very, very good:The Music: the title track by Eddie Vedder and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan is amazing and adds depth, especially during the opening sequences. If there was more of it, particularly during some of the long silent scenes, it would have improved the movie. The long silent scenes tend to get boring after a while, whereas the scenes of the car in the forest with the eerie music in the background are riveting.The Acting: No one should be surprised at Sean Penn. Look at his film bio. He obviously has the chops. And Sarandon gives one of her best performances, which is saying something. Between them they're easily able to carry a 2hr movie.The Story: There's not a lot of story here. There's never any doubt about what's going to happen to Poncelet. There are no hidden twists, no deep revelations, and no "wow, what's going to happen next" suspense. And thankfully the director doesn't try to inject any into the movie in the hopes of making it more intense. The movie is as slow and inexorable as a river. It goes exactly where it's supposed to go.The Point: This is where the movie fails, mostly through concentrating on the last days of Poncelet's life instead of giving us any background on him, the crime he's guilty of, what happened to his accomplice Vitello and why Vitello only drew life in prison instead of the death sentence. Poncelet is "poor" so that's why he didn't have a good lawyer. So Vitello was rich? From a prominent family? Then why was he hanging around with Poncelet? The director just can't take his focus off the two lead characters long enough to answer questions like these. Robbins draws most of his drama from the situation (the execution of a killer) without quite showing why he *was* a killer. Robbins also can't quite explain why Prejean became so fascinated with such a man. Most importantly, is the movie about Prejean or Poncelet? Robbins can't quite make up his mind, and the result is two characters without as much depth as a focus on one could have given us. At the end we have Poncelet the hard guy who becomes remorseful, and Sister Helen, the smitten nun. Ultimately, Robbins can't think of much to say about either character that isn't intrinsic to their roles (killer and nun), and this is why DMW is only a good film, but not a great one.RstJ</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nasty experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much of the praise for this film which I've read here is, I think, deserved. The script and acting are compelling and multi-faceted, the direction effective. It really didn't come off as the shrill, liberal screed that one might expect. But I would echo another statement made by a reviewer at this site, something that occurred to me as well right after seeing it: whatever you may regard this film as, it is certainly not entertainment! It left me with a truly miserable feeling afterwards (wouldn't that make a great quote to print on the video box?). Sure, it's all very tragic. Hamlet is tragic, but I come away from a performance of it feeling stimulated and enriched, not depressed and dirty. As I said to a relative just after seeing this movie: "Very powerful film, but I wouldn't ever want to see it again." Adamant opponents of capital punishment, those who see this film as an anti-death-penalty tract, might regard this miserable feeling as having received its message. I must admit, however, that having no particular regard for religion in any form, I cannot understand Sister Prejean and her motivations. A scene that stands out in my mind is one in which Sister Prejean visits the father of one of the murder victims, Clyde Percy (perfectly case with R. Lee Ermey). Even though he does profess an old-fashioned respect for religion, he firmly tells her to get lost after learning the reason for her visit. This character's motivations I understand. Is he supposed to be a simple boob? Am I for taking his view? Contrary to several comments here, this film did not make me cry. (On that subject, read the amazing IMDb comments for an animated Japanese film called "Grave of the Fireflies," a movie that does indeed induce tears. It's about innocence destroyed by war -- in my view a subject worthy of tears -- and it's a beautiful film that I would love to watch again.) Also, standing Poncelet up in the death chamber with his arms extended out to his sides, evoking the image of a crucifixion, is some really heavy-handed symbolism. This man didn't die for our sins, he died for his. Yes, it's very sad, and it makes you feel lousy, but I think it's probably for the best. It's my fervent hope that if I myself ever sank to such a degraded level, someone would put me out of my misery as well, despite protests from myself and all others. Gosh, such thoughts never occurred to me after watching "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just seen this broadcast on Channel 4. Having seen some of the earlier comments here I think I would like to state firstly that I am not in favour of the death penalty. With that out of the way, I was expecting great things of this film, but it just didn't quite deliver. Dead Man Walking is very cleanly done, with good performances all round, and a good script. In fact it's hard to fault it artistically. However, I felt that although it attempted to confront the issues surrounding capital punishment, it seemed to become sidetracked by the religious/moral stance (hardly surprising given that the main character is a nun). Although I'm not a heartless individual, I didn't really empathise with any of the characters in the story. If you don't take religion seriously then you probably won't see much in this film. I think that Peter Medak's Let Him Have It was a much more powerful and moving film, and I would strongly recommend anyone considering watching this to go and see that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty boring, difficult to connect with and narratively messy - overall a bit of a letdown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dead Man Walking is a film based on a story by Helen Prejan (who is the real life person that Susan Sarandon depicts on screen). Having not read the book, I'm unsure whether this film fails due to the fact that it is a poor adaptation of the source material or whether it's a good adaptation that I just failed to connect with. We'll just say that the jury is out on that for the time being and I'll crack on with the review....The film begins OK with Sister Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon) going to visit death row inmate Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn)when he sends her a letter asking for her to visit him and try to assist him with his appeal when he finds that there are no lawyers that are prepared to help him (the very fact that no lawyers are prepared to help him should be ringing alarm bells). However, as the film progressed I found it harder and harder to invest in. It didn't help that we don't seem to get much insight into Poncelet's character and it therefore makes it difficult to make any sort of connection with him (the fact that he was objectionable most of the time didn't help). We also have no real understanding of why Poncelet wrote to Prajean in the first place - it therefore makes it difficult to make a connection between the 2 characters. This may have been explained better in the book, but the very fact that Robbins doesn't seem to bother explaining this in the film means that the narrative is somewhat sloppy as a result. Another major problem for me is that some of the character's actions just aren't believable; I found it continually difficult to believe that a nun would be so keen to help a death row inmate who 1) Is arrogant, condescending and dismissive towards her 2) Who she doesn't even know 3) Isn't even sure whether or not he's innocent. Prejean tracks down a lawyer to try to take on Poncelet's case even though it felt like Prejean put more effort into freeing Poncelet than the lawyer did. We have Poncelet's mother who hasn't visited him in prison for a long time, but after a visit from Prajean both mother and family decide to start visiting Poncelet and they are all playing happy families when they visit - it just felt a bit phony to me. We then have Prajean and lawyer Hilton Barber (Robert Prosky) who have a week to try and get Poncelet off death row, even though he's already been on death row for 6 years with several lawyers being unable to get him off death row. If he's been unsuccessful for the last 6 years, what are the odds of them being successful in the next 7 days??The worst aspect of this film was the way it ended; just before Poncelet is due to be executed he admits to killing the 2 victims (even though he'd protested his innocence throughout) and then as he's about to be put to death he tells Prajean that he loves her and she tells him that she loves him. What? Where did that come from? A nun loving a death row inmate even after she discovers that he did kill those 2 victims? Come on!!!.There are a few positives; the acting was good (particularly from Penn and Sarandon) and the directing was also good. The problems lay with the messy script, characters that I didn't care about and a whole host of unbelievable scenarios - strange that I found a lot of what I saw to be unbelievable even though it's based on a true story. It's not an awful film, but it's not that good either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dead Man Walking too many was viewed as Sean Penn's breakthrough performance. To other's, it was his greatest role. A powerful film non the less, one of the reasons the film was so powerful was because of Sean Penn. The role demanded so much realistic compassion, the struggle to characterize Penn's performance held up the entire film. Even the setting that the film took place in fell on Sean Penn. The character he portrayed was his settings. The strong and stubborn bars on his cell played off his persona. Even the feel of the style of film making plays a big part in the characters redemption for his final act of forgiveness. The film is poetry, nothing less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much-praised for its liberal "balance," the movie is based on the book that tells the true story of a Louisiana nun who befriends a man on death row. The movie portrays the death penalty as arbitrary and unfair. Still, it does not come out against the death penalty, and the book is a stronger testament than the movie to Sister Helen Prejean's anti-death penalty activism. The movie supports the reactionary "victim's rights" movement and preaches taking "responsibility" for criminal acts. Maoists believe people need to take responsibility for their actions and struggle with self-criticism, but we know this is not accomplished through the imperialist death-penalty machine, even with the help of progressive nuns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good performances in a mostly successful drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't usually bother with Oscar winning films like this as they tend to annoy rather than impress; but I've got to give plaudits to Tim Robbins' heartfelt drama, as the characters are strong and the film does a great job of separating the sin from the sinner, while putting it's audience in the precarious position of deciding which one they hate most. The film plays off its central characters throughout, so it's lucky that The Shawshank Redemption star was able to get two talented performers in Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon to flesh out the script. I've got to admit that I'm not a fan of either of these stars, but I always appreciate good acting, and both have come a long way. Sean Penn got his first big role as a stoner in Fast Times at Ridgemount High, while Sarandon was once famous for performing in the likes of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Both actors' gives performances over and above what you would expect from them given their early film roles, and under the direction of a man that is no stranger to dramatic roles; the film really works.The plot follows a nun who receives a letter from a man on death row who wants to avoid his capital punishment. After meeting the man, she begins to show empathy for his plight; but he is not the only one with a stake in his death, as after meeting the families of his victims; she begins to feel for them also, and ultimately finds herself in the position of feeling both for the murderer and his victims. The film does a good job of fully researching its topic; as it's easy to think that a murderer on death row deserves to be killed, but after meeting his family and learning the nature of his crime; Robbins ensures that the death of his central protagonist is not a happy event. You've got to expect a fair amount of sentiment in a film like this; and Dead Man Walking certainly has it, although it never completely wallows in these elements, and the film climaxes as it should. The relaxed country atmosphere bodes well with the feel of the film, and both the performers manage to fit into their roles. Overall, Dead Man Walking certainly isn't a favourite of mine; but as these films go, this is a rather good one.</fullReview>

Primal Fear is about a 100 times better than this movie, i was expecting maybe a twist to the movie, maybe him trying to escape, but you find out the ending in the 1st half of the movie, then you just have to wait for the credits to scroll down your t.v. screen. I'm still shocked at the fact how overrated this garbage was. I'd give this movie 2.5 / 10, this 2.5 / 10 is gained by Sean Penns Brilliant acting in this movie ( but for no reason ).

		<shortDescription>What do they try to see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this film yesterday, in a scrabby cinema in Budapest, I am confused.Before the film started I was a clear opponent of the death penalty. In the first part of the movie this was supported by the scenes about the inhumanity of the death penalty. This was probably the idea of the film makers. After that, they probably decided not to make a regular 'I oppose to death penalty' film, so they also showed the other side. So fas so good.But then, there is this sudden shift to a religious perspective, which takes the solid ground away under my feet. For some reason, the murderer seems to be set equal with Jesus Christ, because of the similarity in their lifes' end. Meanwhile our vilain starts announcing his faith in Hitler and terrorists and at the end it seems that the bad guy has turned into the good guy again by confessing his sins.The role in these very quick shifts on the scale from good to bad, are probably owed to the nun starring in this film. Towards the end it seems that she is doing the right thing by assisting this 'evil man', but becauseof the constant biblical discussion it is really difficult to make up your mind.What is the meaning of this film? That death penalty is wrong? That there is some good in every person? That you have to look your sins in the face? What is the right opinion of the church, or, who judges correctly: the nun, the families of the murdered children, or the prison's reverend maybe?If the filmmakers intended to give a clear vision of their views of a trial they failed, but if the plan is to control the publics' thought for a week or so, the succeeded. Unfortunately, I am not sure if the latter goal was the case.I still oppose the death penalty, after all.By, the way: a very fine soundtrack, with Indian music, Bruce Springsteen, Eddie Vedder and Tom Waits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frustrating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very well written story. Grade A substance. And the movie definitely has its moments, thanks to the very good acting.But it's frustrating on two levels: the lack of depth of the storytelling when it comes to the highly sensitive and important ethical points, and the lack of a real cinematic experience.I -think I- understand Robbin's preoccupations about being not too manipulative (though all the manipulative clichés are present near the end..!), but this was not an obstacle to find a real rhythm, a real pace. This movie lacks any rhythm altogether. There is no sense of time progression, of the days passing by. Maybe it's on purpose, though I'd then wonder WHY, considering the story. No, I suspect it's sort of apprentice's clumsiness. Robbins was learning how to make movies, I guess. One thing he already has in this movie is acting direction, for sure. Way to go! Now he needs control of space, framing, and time. Here and there premises can be found in "Dead man..". Not enough.I'm looking forward viewing "Cradle Will Rock", because I have the feeling Robbins really has something to bring to Cinema.. it takes guts to direct a movie with such a delicate, sensitive, non-manicheist script as "Dead man walking". I hope he's a fast learner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Susan Sarandon is wonderful in Oscar-winning role as real-life Sister Helen Prejean, an opponent of the death penalty who stirred controversy for befriending a scurrilous killer on Death Row--and finding his heart in the process. Writer-director Tim Robbins, obviously an opponent of the death penalty himself, lays on the life-in-prison propaganda pretty thick and some of his touches are uncomfortable or heavy-handed (especially when killer becomes victim, crucified on the table); however, Robbins handles the actors just right, especially real-life love Sarandon, who has seldom been shown to such an incredible advantage. The snappy repartee in the early part of the picture feels a little 'Hollywood', but Robbins enjoys a good verbal battle and nearly every sequence between Sarandon and Sean Penn is the stuff of powerful human drama. Based upon Sister Prejean's book, this is thoughtful, heady cinema. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent portrayal of death penalty issues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before seeing this film, I suggest the viewer puts away any expectations that the victims of the crimes depicted will get equal treatment and consideration as the perpetrator. There have been many films about crime victims. This one is about the murderer."Dead Man Walking" finds realism in simplicity of the story: there are no crack lawyers coming to save William Poncelet and no dramatic story twists. The film does not attempt to put him in a good light; he is guilty, he is repugnant, is a racist, and was responsible for heinous murders. Given all this, we are asked to do something very difficult: look at him as a human being despite his crimes. In this way, the film challenges the notion that the death penalty provides "justice". Whether you are for or against the death penalty, the film raises questions about whether the guilty can find redemption, inequity in the justice system, and the appropriateness of the death penalty.Great performances by both Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn. In particular the last moments of the film show the true depth of Penn's ability.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has two new features in relation to the message conveyed by other equally good movies about death penalty and executions. Those are the stress also given to the drama endured by victims' parents -- without for that reason disguising the hatred and desire of revenge they feel or lessening the horror that execution represents -- and the Christian vision of all the questions implied. We must also point out that in this movie the sentenced man is not the usual nice innocent person we see in other movies dealing with executions which doesn't lead us to abandon the idea that a penal execution is no more than a legal murder anyway. Last but not least we must mention the extraordinary emotional weight put on the last moments of the execution course with all the catharsis shown by the convicted's last words and the detail with which the act of the execution itself is viewed in a parallel cut with images of the murder scenes in the forest to stress that we are being confronted with another murder so pitiless as the latter but performed in a cold and supposed "legal" way.</fullReview>

Robbins shows us how through the death penalty, his impending death focuses his thoughts and he seeks forgiveness.

		<shortDescription>Close to torture; Penn is the only thing worthwhile.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my main problems with films depicting the death penalty (which I couldn't be more against) is that they have a tendency to try and force the viewer into sympathizing with this character sentenced to death. Furthermore, they tell us that this person is guilty and continue to try and get us to sympathize with them. I may be against the death penalty, but that in no way means that I'm going to feel for a man who raped a teenage girl and savagely murdered a teenage boy. It felt almost like an insult that Tim Robbins shoves this sympathy and religion down the viewers through in an attempt to make me feel for this character.On the other side of the film is it's huge religious method, which only furthered my disconnection with it. It's just the same old preachy, sentimental stuff we've seen a thousand times before mixed with an attempt at forced sympathy for a rapist/murderer. The entire film felt like some kind of bizarre joke, because I couldn't even sympathize with the families of the victims. They were just blood-hungry, despicable human beings as well. Add that to what is potentially the worst score I've heard my entire life and the film is close to torture.I don't understand how Susan Surandon won an Oscar for her performance but maybe that's just because I loathed her character. Another thing that displeased me is the fact that the film moves like a snail. It drags constantly and every scene without Sean Penn felt like a chore to watch. In fact the only thing that keeps this film from being among the worst I've ever seen is Sean Penn's absolutely ingenious performance. It's such a shame that it couldn't have been in a film that actually deserved such brilliance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Susan Sarandon playing a nun? Sure. Only in the land of make-believe, meaning Hollywood or any other movie setting. Well, at least she's being somewhat true to her beliefs - not religion, of course, but a Liberal cause: being anti-death penalty. That's no surprise, especially with boyfriend and fellow ultra-Liberal Tim Robbins directing the picture. Sarandon, however, does an excellent job in the role of "Sister Helen Prejean." The same holds true for Sean Penn, who plays sleazy murderer "Matthew Poncelet." Well, at the sleazy part was more believable from him, but he's a great actor anyway.It's a well-told, powerful story and I really appreciated the soundtrack. There is some great music in here.This is a not a faithful adaptation of the book, as some have said here. A big part of the book by the real Sister Prejean is the Christian forgiveness exhibited by one of the families of the murdered victims, but that is never mentioned in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie Dead Man Walking reveals a perfect example of how just punishment and redemption can work together.Had rapist/murderer Matthew Poncelet not been properly sentenced to death by the civil authority, he would not have met Sister Prejean, he would not have received spiritual instruction, he would not have taken responsibility for his crimes and he would not have reconciled with God.Had Poncelet never been caught or had he only been given a prison sentence, his character makes it VERY clear that those elements would not have come together.Indeed, for the entire film and up until those last moments, prior to his execution, Poncelet was not truthful with Sister Prejean. His lying and manipulative nature was fully exposed at that crucial time. It was not at all surprising, then, that it was just prior to his execution that all of the spiritual elements may have come together for his salvation. It was now, or never.Truly, just as St. Aquinas stated, it was Poncelet's pending execution which may have led to his repentance.For Christians, the most crucial concerns of Dead Man Walking must be and are redemption and eternal salvation. And, for that reason, it may well be, for Christians, the most important pro-death penalty movie ever made." . . .makes you realize the Dead Man Walking truly belongs on the shelf in the library in the Fiction category."

If a person like that goes looking for trouble, then they should be able to take it when it comes to them. I wonder if the nun would have been so concerned with this creep's condition if it had been her family that was slain.

It was bland, tedious, predictable, formulaic and very detached, and left very, very little to think about. Basically, it lacked immensely in character development; things happened too quickly w/o enough explanation and reasoning (i.e. Penn's character admitting to the crimes) and, like I mentioned above, it was detached. They don't let us get to know or like any of the characters, and the producers just didn't try hard enough to make us feel emotion at any point in this movie. In its defense, though, it was probably worth watching since the performances were good (although Penn's was definitely sub-par considering his abilities) and it was fairly entertaining, not to mention well shot.</fullReview>

Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated Susan Sarandon plays Sister Helen Prejean, the woman who tries to find out the reason why he murdered, and to comfort him. He obviously will not listen to all her reasoning and does not completely fear death. It's only when it gets close that he starts to change his mind. But by the time he does, it's too late and he is up for execution (injections).

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.In 1999, Tim Robbins created a wonderful film: textured, self-aware camera, ensemble collaboration, self-referential story. None of the wonderful elements of that film are present here.In this case, he made a valentine for his wife. The story doesn't exist, only a dramatic situation used as an excuse for the two players. And everything is ruthlessly directed to exploit the relatively small range of Susan. It may be that she really believes in this cause -- I presume she does. But the mechanics at work here are of simple maudlin melodrama, where the characters are swept along by the situation and allowed to posture in comment.Just as Penn's character is a waste of life (who wastes other lives) so is Penn himself here. He allows himself to be wasted, in an act of unselfishness that only a great actor could accomplish.There is some genius here: Robbins' control to make his wife look good and Penn's ability to create an unfilled soul. That these were done in the same film is a marvel.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sean Penn has grown tremendously since his graduation from "Ridgemont High". After being nominated herein, and then for Sweet and Lowdown and I Am Sam, he deserved to grab that Oscar at the 76th Annual Academy Awards for his acting in Mystic River.However, other than Penn's performance and an equally engaging one by Susan Sarandon, there's not much to see in this film. The writing is trite, the direction deplorable. Mr. Penn and Ms. Sarandon could have been just as impressive talking to cardboard cutouts. They were great in spite of the poor direction by Tim Robbins. The other actors were not strong enough to overcome it.There are too many cliches, too many blunders. And who was that man caught outside the window in one scene? Not a big enough budget to shoot over?I strongly oppose the death penalty, but that doesn't mean I'm going to laud this soppy and sloppy excuse for a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Faith Hathaway was 17 when she was murdered by Robert Willie, whose story became the inspiration for Dead Man Walking. Hathaway had just graduated from high school and was leaving for the Army the next day. She was abducted after leaving a farewell party in Mandeville, La. Willie and accomplice Joseph Vaccaro had been on an 8-day murder, robbery and rape spree. Hathaway was raped by both assailants and stabbed 17 times. She was raped again after she died.All over the country, news stories bemoan and hype the countdown to execution number 1,000. But where are the stories regarding the ripple effects of the heinous crimes that these murderers were executed for committing? Who is counting the victims?A conservative estimate puts the number of victims of these 1,000 murderers at 1,895. Why do we hear so much about the killers and so little about the victims and their loved ones who are left behind to pick up the pieces?Those who continue to equate the worth of a convicted murder to that of an innocent child sicken me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was awful!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was made out to be so amazing so i decided to go to the movie store and rent it. All the hype from this movie led me to believe that it was going to be great and worth my while. The whole entire movie you are waiting for a catch or a twist in the plot. The entire plot is straight forward and you know what's going to happen. And who is going to have any sympathy for a racist, pro Hitler, raper, and killer???? This movie is terrible and so slow!!!!! Don't waste your time!!!</fullReview>
