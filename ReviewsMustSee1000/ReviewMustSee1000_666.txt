		<shortDescription>A terrific movie about friendship.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie from the first time I saw it, but it wasn't until I sat through it the third time that I figured out why. It is clever, exciting, and funny and is shot in the middle of the breathtaking scenery of the American Southwest. However, the thing that makes it special is its illustration of pure friendship. It may be difficult for some men to cross the gender boundary and connect with Thelma and Louise, yet doing so is critical to appreciating the film. If you can make the connection then you can get its message -- we all need a friendship like the one Thelma and Louise had. This movie will strike a deep emotional chord.....if you aren't afraid to let it. And if you happen to be too emotionally closed off to appreciate what I think the movie says about friendship I think that you will still enjoy the characters, acting, action, and humor. It is a ten out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than an exercise in male-bashing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an important commercial film aimed at blue collar women who feel victimized by both society and the men in their lives. Directed by Ridley Scott, who directed the science fiction classics, Alien (1979) and Blade Runner (1982), Thelma and Louise is an on-the-lam chick flick (with chase scenes), a kind of femme Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), somewhat akin to Wild at Heart (1990) and Natural Born Killers (1994) but without the gratuitous violence of those films. Ridley Scott walks the razor edge between femme-exploitation and serious social commentary. Incidentally, the script is by Callie Khouri who wrote Something to Talk About (1995) and Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood (2002) which should give you an idea of how men are depicted here.Susan Sarandon is Louise, a thirty-something Arkansas waitress with an attitude and some emotional baggage, and Geena Davis is Thelma, a cloistered ingenue housewife with a yearning to breath free. Both do an outstanding job and carry the film from beginning to end. The characters they play are well-rounded and fully developed and sympathetic, in contrast to the men in the film who are for the most part merely clichés, or in the case of Darryl (Christopher McDonald), Thelma's boorish husband, or the troll-like truck driver, burlesques.I have never seen Geena Davis better. Her unique style is melded very well into a naive woman who never had a chance to express herself, but goes hog wild and seems a natural at it when the time comes. Sarandon is also at the top of her game and plays the crusty, worldly wise, vulnerable Louise with tenderness and understanding. Note, by the way, her pinned up in back hair-style, directly lifted from TV's Polly Holliday ("Kiss my grits!") who appeared as a waitress in the seventies sitcoms "Alice" and "Flo."Harvey Keitel plays the almost sympathetic cop, Hal Slocumb, and Brad Pitt appears as J. D., a sweet-talking twenty-something who gives Thelma the script for robbing 7-11s as he steals more than her libido.This movie works because it is funny and sad by turns and expresses the yearning we all have to be free of the restraints of society and its institutions (symbolized in the wide-open spaces of the American Southwest) while representing the on again, off again incompatibility of the male and female heart. The male-bashing is done with a touch of humor and the targets are richly deserving of what they get. The ending is perhaps too theatrical and frankly unrealistic, but opinions may differ.Best and most telling quick scene is when Thelma phones Darryl to see if he has found out about their escapades. Weasel-like, he is trying to help the cops locate them, but he is so transparent to her that all she has to do is hear his voice. "He knows," she says to Louise and hangs up.Best visual is when the black police helicopter appears suddenly, menacingly like a giant fly beneath the horizon of the Grand Canyon. Also excellent were the all those squad cars lined up like armored battalions aimed at the girls on the run.I also liked the scenes at the motel with J.D. and Louise's boyfriend. They were beautifully directed and cut, and very well conveyed by Sarandon and Davis, depicting two contrasting stages in male-female relationships.See this for Geena Davis because she was brilliant, vividly alive and never looked better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Must-See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Thelma and Louise" made a huge splash when it was released and has since become a part of the pop culture lexicon. In it, a mistreated housewife and harried waitress stumble into an out-of-control - but totally liberating - crime spree. As bold and relevant as ever, it remains a vastly entertaining must-see.Callie Khouri's screenplay is a feeling, funny classic and director Ridley Scott lends this road movie epic scope, seeking out the beauty in open spaces.Both leads - Geena Davis as Thelma and Susan Sarandon as Louise - give fine performances. Thelma and Louise become fully realized human beings who share a powerful and authentic friendship. Their transformation into two outlaws is also made entirely believable by the actresses.And what about the men? Harvey Keitel is charming as the sympathetic lawman, Hal, and Michael Madsen's turn as Louise's boyfriend Jimmy is wonderfully nuanced. Brad Pitt also leaves a strong impression as the winsome blonde thief J.D. It's easy to see why this film made Pitt a star."Thelma and Louise" is a film of rare cultural resonance, to be sure. Yet while undoubtedly provocative, this movie is also alot of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somebody said get a life. so they did!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For many years now, women have taken power into their own hands. So I am sure the women that campaigned for freedom and liberty, would have loved the movie, 'Thelma and Louise'. The tradition of the American road trip is shown in such a refreshing way in this movie, with its two lead characters people who are fed up with life, and no longer take any crap from the men that they live with or that they meet. Thelma and Louise is a film that will make you feel warm, but also leave a some what 'bitter-sweet' taste in your mouth.Thelma and Louise are best friends on a desperate flight across the American Southwest after a tragic incident at a roadside bar. With determined detective Hal on their trail, a sweet-talking hitchhiker called 'J.D.' in their path and a string of crimes in their wake, their journey alternates between a hilarious, high-octane joy ride and an empowering personal odyssey... even as the law closes in.'Thelma and Louise' are exceptionally well written characters for the big-screen. Callie Khouri wrote a fascinating script, capturing the 'female power' beautifully. But it is in her characters that I like the most. While, I had feelings for both Thelma and Louise, I also wanted the pair to get caught, and part of me also loved what made the pair the individuals that they were. This is all from the great work of Khouri, who is an intelligent screenwriter. I have watched this film a couple of weeks after viewing another of Callie's movies, 'Something to talk about', another movie from the female point of view that both sexes can enjoy.Yet Callie's screenplay would have been a waste, if the actors did not play their part properly. The main stars here are Thelma (Geena Davis) and Louise (Susan Sarandon), who are some what fed up with the life that they are living, and plan a trip to get away from everything. Things soon start to get out of hand for the women, and when trouble causes them have shoot and kill somebody, the fun really starts. In fact from the time that this incident begins and concludes, the movie to the very end was for me, one great joy ride.Davis and Sarandon share a great bond on the film. Thelma and Louise are great friends, but completely different characters in their own right. Davis plays a ditsy sort of character, who is na?ve, but becomes an individual once again, after the men in her life have been nothing but tragedy after tragedy. Then with Sarandon, I got the feeling that she was the one that had the 'balls' out of the two, making her best friend realise that they should stand for no crap anymore. It was a shame that neither actress won an academy award for their role, but of course they were up against a great performer in another 1991 movie, that being Jodie Foster in 'Silence of the Lambs'. If foster was not there, I am certain that one of these two would have walked away with an academy award.Yet there are other cast members that need to be highlighted from 'Thelma and Louise'. I enjoyed what DJ (Brad Pitt) brought to the film. He was a character that I trusted, but like the girls, I was scorned after working out how bad he was. Then there is Louise's love interest, Jimmy (Michael Madison), who shows his girlfriend glimpses of what she is trying to escape, and that being married to him would be a mistake. Then to round the cast of this film is Police detective Hal (played by Hollywood legend, Harvey Keitel). Hal is genuinely interested in working out the situation with the girls, but realises that these are extraordinary women, in an extraordinary situation.'Thelma and Louise' is well directed by Oscar winning director, Ridley Scott. I feel that he brought out the road trip of the girls well, making it really interesting for the viewer, as we want to know what is going to happen as the girls go from one situation to another. Scott also helps to define what makes the girls tick as individuals, and to why they are such great friends. He also makes it easy for his audience to understand what theses girls are doing is necessary to their freedom and survival.I also like the locations that were chosen and shot for this movie, showing off much of America that we rarely get the chance to see. The American west, which is where the majority of the film takes place, looks partly like a fun place to live, but also a place that holds great danger for the girls. Thelma also emphasises that going through 'Texas' is completely out of the picture. Then when the girls are really on the run we get the chance to see some of the great cannons that America has to offer. The camera work by cinematographer Adrian Biddle is exceptional, and makes wonder what it would be like to visit such a part of the world.There is a lot to like about this movie. Things like its style, story, lingo, characters and conclusion, which are all captivating. I feel that the audience of this movie is on an intoxicating sort of ride here, by the sort adventure that 'Thelma and Louise' allows us to experience. We are affected by what affects this pair. Well I know I was anyway. This movie also proves, by creating more problems, you do not make the situation you are in better, but much worse. Nevertheless, it looks like fun to be on the run!CMRS gives 'Thelma and Louise': 4.5 (Very Good - Brilliant Film)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it anti-male?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people have dubbed this as a "chick flick" but I do not really like that term as it implies that men cannot enjoy watching it. Alien had a female lead and had parts that were sad but nobody would call that a chick flick. Also is every movie about male characters a guy flick? I thought this was a great drama and the acting was superb. No one can deny that this movie is a classic and has influenced the English language. I would also like to mention that I am a man. In response to people who bash the movie saying that it is anti-male; I would like to say that Thelma and Louise is simply a movie about situations that happen to women all too often. Women are raped everyday and women are abused everyday; this movie brings that into the light and says that it is not good enough. I do not believe that shooting the rapist was justified but at least he did not get away with it. The movie shows that by running away from your problems things only get worse. People have also commented that there are no men that are not portrayed negatively. Both the sympathetic police officer and Jimmy are likable characters. The purpose of this film was not to celebrate masculinity but to show two women breaking free from oppression. Not all women are raped or abused but it is something that is very common and it is relevant enough to be a theme of a movie.I was very moved by the movie and I gave it a 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost perfect road movie about two women on the run</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thelma and Louise is a rarity. It is a buddy movie about two women, and it is one of the best road movies to ever grace the screen.Louise (Susan Sarandon) and Thelma (Gina Davis) are two friends who plan a road trip into the mountains for the weekend. Neither one of their lives seems exciting at the moment. Louise waits tables at the local diner and is also waiting on boyfriend Jimmy (Michael Madsen)who is always traveling and seems destined to never settle down. Thelma is a sexually repressed housewife who lives at home with a self-important husband (Christopher McDonald) who doesn't seem to care much for her at all except when she is not fulfilling her house-wife duties like having diner made and the house cleaned.It is no wonder these two decide to take a trip for the weekend to the mountains to get away for awhile and have fun. Of course there is an event that happens not long after they have started their journey, and right after said event, things quickly spiral out of control as the two girls find themselves racing for Mexico with the law quickly on their heels.This movie could've been just another boring road picture, but both Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon along with a fine script and clever pacing by director Ridley Scott, make it much better. Davis and Sarandon have great chemistry together, and the script is loaded with offbeat humor to go along with its clever story. The movie is never boring because Ridley Scott makes it so by slowing the pace down at the right moments, and then picking it back up when necessary. I enjoyed all the characters, including the minor ones which included a cameo by Brad Pitt as the young hitchhiker JD who Thelma quickly falls in lust with.Some people may see this as the ultimate female picture, but I think it is more than that. Harvey Keitel is the inspector on the case who believes that these girls really aren't as bad as some may think, and his character is interesting as well because he seems to understand why everything involving the girls has lead up to this series of unfortunate events. Michael Madsen, as Louise's boyfriend Jimmy, also adds depth to his role as a man who though upset with what Louise is going to do understands and loves her still. These two characters add something more to the story which makes it less of a feminist picture without once taking away from the two leads. If that was even possible.My only gripe with the movie would be the ending. Not the way it ended but how quickly it rushed to the end credits. I for one, like Roger Ebert who stated the same thing in his review of the movie, believe that the ending should of lasted a little longer before fading out. That's my only problem, and it's the only reason why the movie doesn't get a perfect score from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Through his career, Ridley Scott was an eclectic film-maker because he broached (with success) several cinema styles: science-fiction with "Alien", historical film with "1492: Christopher Colombus". Here, he succeeded very well his way to the road-movie and this one is listed among the best road-movies ever made. At first look, the story looks simple and without too many claims: two young women, Thelma and Louise are going out for the week-end with the firm intention of having a ball. But what they don't know is that this drive will soon become a descent into hell... The movie is worth seeing for its two main actresses: Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis, both outstanding and what interests Ridley Scott, is their temperament and their evolution during the movie. At the beginning, a sensitive and fragile Thelma is next to a energetic and realistic Louise but in the second part of the movie, more precisely, after Thelma burglarized a shop (probably the best sequence in the whole movie) in order to grab money, roles are reversed. This is an occasion to make out Louise's wounds and weaknesses. So, don't rely too much on appearances... "Thelma and Louise" is also a movie where Scott takes a lucid look on the hidden side of the American society and especially on men. Scott introduces them to us with their worst faults: either they're macho (Darryl), obscene (the truck driver), perverse (the rapist) or coward (the cop). The only one saved is Harvey Keitel who never falls into the caricature of the American cop usually described to us as merciless or obsequious. Here, he shows understanding and even compassion towards the two runaways, notably Louise because he knows that she hides a terrible secret. A dynamic and panting movie where laugh and sorrow are skillfully married.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare moment in cinema of the total rejection of the rule of law and patriarchy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The road movie is traditionally a male genre, relying on the sense of freedom and independence that having one's own transport provides and which has usually been the privilege of men? What is innovatory about "Thelma &amp; Louise" is the way it reequips the genre for women? Thelma (Geena Davis) is a housewife trapped in a meaningless marriage, Louise (Susan Sarandon) is a waitress in a not very significant relationship? They decide to give themselves a little space by taking off for a weekend? But when Louise shoots a man who is trying to rape Thelma, they are precipitated into a far more radical break with their past lives? The setting of action in the American southwest and the acts of outlawry the women are obliged to commit in order to keep on the run give the film some of the feel of a Western? What makes it nevertheless a women's film is that the relationship between the two principals is at the center of the story? The various men they encounter, both the ones they leave behind and those they meet on the road have less importance for Thelma and Louise than the two women do for each other?Predictably, the film met with hostility from some male viewers, on the grounds that the men were caricatured and that the film encouraged violence?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to give it up for a movie that casts Michael Madsen as pretty much the only sane guy in existence. Thelma (Geena Davis) and Louise (Susan Sarandon) go off from their banal existences to a trip that heads up poop creek really REALLY fast. After shooting dead a would-be rapist, they both head for the hills where the law, personal freedom and, yes, Brad Pitt await! I hadn't seen this in quite a number of years, and it was great to come back to. I remembered a lot of it, but I noticed particularly this time the strong performances of not only of Davis and Sarandon, but of Harvey Keitel, Madsen (who is actually amazing), Pitt, and quite underplayingly, Christopher Mcdonald. Ridley Scott puts these elements all together in one explosive package.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feminist road classic carries a full tank of gas.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THELMA &amp; LOUISE has to be regarded as a pure 90s classic that brought up a considerable amount of risk in creating a first-person feminist formula into a mainstream movie, which is often missing. It pulls off fantastically true in form, with the exceptional Southern character talents of the two lady fugitives on the run, Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon, who may stand out as memorable on the silver screen. Let's not forget that silly truck driver they pass quite often, and of course, cowboy Brad Pitt as a young student. While not needed to be fully reliant on action substances like gunshooting, there is good chemistry within its grasp. Every single minute should not be wasteful, as plenty of refreshing outbursts of enjoyment outweighs the familiar old plot of evading the police. The ending is a definite eye catcher, and also the riskiest ever filmed! Beware of this rip-off called GOOD GIRLS DON'T, another poor B-movie with no redeeming quality. Satisfyingly original, and highly recommended!</fullReview>

Ridley Scott is a great director, and it was this film that really made me love him. It's so good. The filming is great, the art direction is appropriate and the soundtrack is amazing. It's a film about happiness, and how we can be kept away from it. And how women are supposed to just shut up and take whatever they are put through. It teaches you to never give up your dreams, live by your own example and take your life in your hands. We can't just sit around watching life pass by. And when you get the chance - take it. And never apologize for being you.See this film, just see it! It's rather old, I was only 3 when it came out and I didn't see it until it was a few years old.

		<fullReview>Back in the 30s and 40s, there was a kind of movie known as the women's picture. These were typically romantic dramas told from a female perspective, and while they often featured headstrong intelligent women (at least by the standards of typical portrayals), they would often have some kind of moral at the end about being a loyal and obedient wife as a kind of final goal in a woman's life. It was a long time, even years after the era of women's lib that patriarchy in the movies began to be completely deconstructed. The subject of women driven to murder by the actions of men was not a new one when Thelma &amp; Louise was made in 1991. But if you look at a picture like Play Misty for Me from two decades earlier, where a used woman becomes the antagonist in a Psycho-type thriller, or I Spit on your Grave (1978) in which a woman's revenge for being raped could only be shown in a lurid exploitation movie, we can see how far the perspective has had to shift.Thelma &amp; Louise, brilliantly scripted by Callie Kouri, gives an explanation for violence by women towards men, and it does so with amazing simplicity. There are no explicit arguments made. No character makes an overt feminist statement ? the closest it comes to that is a by-the-way reminder by Geena Davis to the abducted policeman to be nice to his wife. The message, as it were, is up there in the screen as the story takes place. And although the basic outline of Thelma &amp; Louise is very much out-of-the-ordinary for most women, if you break it down moment by moment, the men they encounter and the exchanges they have are very much on the near side of normal.A lot of Thelma &amp; Louise's power is in its magnificent cast. Both Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis have a remarkable realism that demonstrates a great rapport between the two characters. When they laugh together, it's the laughter of two friends. Sarandon is brilliant at keeping that mystery to her character ? the secret in Louise's past is bubbling under the surface of her performance long before it is revealed to the audience. Davis does an excellent job of showing character development, growing from the sheltered housewife into an independent woman comfortable with her newfound criminality. And it's neat how her sense of playfulness remains somehow consistent even as she changes. There are plenty of decent supporting performances as well. Brad Pitt was obviously chosen primarily for his youthful good looks, but he can act with it. Michael Madsen is very good too, intimidating in his controlled anger, but radiating a presence that makes his attractiveness to Louise understandable.The movie is directed by that meticulous craftsman Ridley Scott. He manages the movement in the frame with expert control for the right effect. In the opening scenes, the camera follows Sarandon around the chaos of the café. As she moves into a backroom during her phone call to Davis, the movement in the background tails off but is kept going by the chef juggling a can, and then as she moves across further the backdrop becomes the tranquil fish tank. These natural-looking set-ups are carefully controlling the mood of the image. As this road movie progresses, the backgrounds become increasingly wide open and breathtakingly beautiful, in line with the spirits of its protagonists. Scott culminates all this with some wonderful stylisation in the final action sequence. The movie would be in danger of becoming overly technical if it wasn't for his almost constant focus on Davis and Sarandon's faces, such as their quiet smiles as they cross Monument Valley by night.For all its feminist modernity, as a type of movie, Thelma &amp; Louise treads familiar ground. The story of sympathetic criminals running free across the country as fate closes in can be seen in such classics as High Sierra (1941), Bonnie and Clyde (1967) and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969). Really, the only major difference here is that the criminals are both women, not a couple of male hoods or a gangster and his moll. And yet, all it takes is this simple gender substitution to speak volumes about the experience of women in this society. That it does so without resorting to sermonising, and keeping up a healthy feeling of fun, makes Thelma &amp; Louise an outstanding motion picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thelma and Louise blew my mind the first time i saw it and no matter what it is still definitely one of my favourites. One thing that you really have to give credit to is the acting, Davis gave an outstanding performance as the victim of a rape and Susan Sarondan was also very good as her best friend.The movie is basically about two very beautiful middle aged women who are the victims of an unfortunate accident and have to runaway as two former outlaws. I really liked this movie because it really centres in how a woman can be very underrated and not be taken serious and in this case raped. The movie really tells you how your life can change completely in just one minute.The end of the movie was very intense but when Thelma and Louise road off the cliff it really got my heart pounding, at that moment i knew that this movie is definitely going to be known as a cinematic classic and Davis and Sarondon's performances will be counted as one of the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burning Bras and Running Away From Men.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall impressive, but highly over-rated road film has the titled characters (Oscar-nominees Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon) running away from the authorities after a killing at a slummy bar. Davis was being raped and Sarandon shot the man to get him off of her. Thus the duo become victims of circumstance and sorry decision-making. They hit the road as fugitives from Arkansas and dodge FBI man Harvey Keitel and Davis' abusive husband (Christopher McDonald) along the way. They even get to meet a then-unknown Brad Pitt as a womanizing cowboy. "Thelma &amp; Louise" is really fluff for the liberal American woman. When released it was hailed from every direction as being risk-taking and non-conformist. However the movie is really little more than smoke and mirrors. Sarandon outshines Davis throughout the movie and Keitel actually ends up being the most interesting character by the final act. Ridley Scott's odd direction yielded him an Oscar-nomination and screenwriter Callie Khouri actually picked up an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay back in 1991. More of a blockbuster than a deep-thinking cinematic product though. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Thelma &amp; Louise" is not only a classic road movie but also one of the most entertaining journeys to ever hit the big screen. Its delicious combination of drama, action and comedy is brilliantly balanced to create a story that delivers sufficient humour, warmth and exhilaration to ensure that its commentary about sexual oppression never gets so heavy-handed that it detracts from the enjoyment of watching this special film. Oscar-winning screenwriter Callie Khouri deserves great credit for achieving this balance and also for the quality of her script which is intelligent and witty and contains numerous quotable remarks.Timid housewife Thelma Dickinson (Geena Davis) and hardworking waitress Louise Sawyer (Susan Sarandon) take off on a weekend vacation together to have some fun and escape their tedious daily lives. Their trip begins well and they're soon in high spirits. Things change dramatically, however, after they stop at a roadside bar where Thelma has a few too many drinks and enjoys flirting with a local redneck who takes her out to the parking lot where he tries to rape her. Louise follows the couple outside and successfully rescues her friend by threatening the attacker with a gun. When the man continues to be verbally abusive, the keyed-up Louise shoots and kills him and the women immediately go on run because Louise knows for sure that the police would never believe their account of what happened.The two women decide to head for a new life in Mexico and the police and the FBI gather information from Thelma's husband Darryl (Christopher McDonald). Louise contacts her boyfriend Jimmy (Michael Madsen) and he subsequently brings her life savings to her. On their travels the women meet a handsome drifter called J.D. (Brad Pitt) and Thelma spends a night with him in her motel room where he describes the method that he regularly uses for robbing convenience stores. Next day, Thelma's initial state of euphoria suddenly changes when she realises that J.D. has disappeared with all their money and so to compensate for the loss, she robs a convenience store using the same method she'd learnt from J.D.Later, an encounter with a state trooper ends when the women hold him at gunpoint and lock him in the trunk of his squad car and on another occasion, they take revenge on a tanker driver who persistently makes obscene gestures at them, by blowing up his entire rig. Their no-hold-barred journey then continues in the same vein until it eventually reaches its spectacular and very appropriate conclusion.With one exception, the men in "Thelma &amp; Louise" are an appalling collection of characters whose conduct is portrayed as being the trigger for the women's need to escape and it's ironic that the times when the two friends feel most excited and powerful is after having indulged in the types of criminal actions which are most often perpetrated by men.Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis are magnificent in their roles as the two women who've both been treated very cruelly by men and the supporting performances from Brad Pitt, Michael Madsen and Harvey Keitel (as the only decent man featured) are all excellent. Christopher McDonald provides a lot of laughs with his over-the-top mannerisms and Keitel's reactions to them are equally funny."Thelma &amp; Louise" with its wide open spaces and atmospheric music is visually very strong and intelligently paced. It's a marvellous piece of entertainment and unsurprisingly has maintained its popularity consistently over the years since its initial release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thelma &amp; Louise shows how two friends go from having a normal life to being on the run.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thelma &amp; Louise a must see movie that shows courage,crime, and true friendship. When two best friend decide to take a weekend trip to the mountains, to get away from the stress of home life. Susan Sarandon (Louise) who plays a housewife and Geena Davis (Thelma)who plays a waitress, decides to go on a trip they would not forget.this movie shows how two best friends did not give up on each other. they both had it rough with Louise wanted for murder and Thelma wanted for armed robbery they were a pair of bonnie and Clyde (1967) even with the police hot on their trail, they still manage to have fun times together. With Thelma drinking her wild turkey to both of them blowing up a disrespecting, womanizing driver's truck.This movie had me laughing and excited at the same time. today was the first time I had seen the movie and wondered was it going to be worth it. but after viewing this film it was definitely worth it. Ridley Scott could not have directed a better movie.Furthermore, Brad Pitt (JD) plays a hitchhiker who really enjoys Thelma's company and woes her on how to rob local stores. more than they know he robs them for $600.00 and disappears without a trace. going on without any money Thelma stick-up a local store and on they go on their wild weekend trip.With Thelma's husband Christoper McDonald (Darryl) wondering where is his wife and Louise boyfriend Michael Madsen (Jimmy) wondering why do she need $600.00 Jimmy decides to travel through two state to find Louise. and Darryl decides to help the police find them.With all that they had been through they both decide to keep going and face the wrap later. after being in the worse situation they end up at the edge of the cliff surrounded by the police and no where to go so they decide to go for it and drive off the cliff ending their life. the movie was so interesting I was surprised at end because, I thought they would try to make a run for it. Thelma &amp; Louise shows how two friend went from having a normal everyday life, to being on the run.If you have not seen this film, I would suggest everyone view the 1991 movie because, it is breath taking and will have you laughing and crying at the same time. the film was excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recap: Two friends decide to leave their tied up lives for just an weekend and go fishing. Bur one quick stop at a nightclub along the way turns out to be fateful. Thelma, a housewife with an asshole husband, loses up a little and starts flirting and dancing with Harlan. Harlan has a plan though, gets Thelma into the parking lot and tries to get her to have sex with him. When she is unwilling, he tries to rape her. Louise finds them, and with the aid of a gun manages Harlan to stop. But Harlan makes one offensive remark to many, and Louise shoots him. The upset friends runs away and suddenly the fishing trip has turned into a run from the law. But at the same times, as the net closes in around them, they feel more free than ever.Comments: One way to put it, this is a road movie running down two parallel roads at he same time. Both a simple movie with fugitives running from the law, but also a much more deep and complex movie about two women, trapped in their ordinary lives, that finally, at last take charge of their own lives. Unfortunately, they had to break the law to do it, and someone died in the process. Two strong leading ladies, Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon, that really carries this movie in a superb way. Especially Davis manages to show the transformation of Thelma from a tied up housewife through several stages were she basically get cheated and tricked by all men in her life, a woman taken advantage of, to a woman that is strong, free and takes control of her life. And a criminal. Louise's trip or transformation is less pronounced, though she reaches the same conclusion, going back is not an option.Not to forget, they are not alone in making this movie. First off, at the base is a really good script, a script that Ridley Scott handles really well. Some shots are really beautiful, and I like the circle he draws by opening and (almost) ending with the same scene. At least according to the trivia he really made some great decisions and used some good tricks to rally make this movie as good as it is. And Brad Pitt have a small but rememberable part.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this typical American movie at least 20 times and can't stop. Lovely Geena Davis and tough Susan Sarandon gave their best performances so far (does anybody really like "Dead Man walking" or "Little Stewart 1 + 2"? Since I saw this movie for the first time, I dream of touring like these girls through the backyard of America. Perhaps without some of the crimes. It's hard to categorize this movie, as its funny but with a strong blue note and offers a lot of surprises for, even when watching it for the 5th time. So many worthwhile details and words are packed in all scenes and dialogues. Not to mention the amazing scenery with some of Americas most beautiful landscapes. I don't like the end to be honest, as it forbids a sequel. But perhaps this perfect story is not to repeat and we just watch the original again. Congratulations, Ridley Scott. More of this and more discoveries like Brad Pitt. Scott is the best director in Hollywood and I forgive him the awful "Gladiator".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hats off to Callie Khouri, the writer of this great story. This is on my top ten list of movies to keep revisiting. What is so wonderful about watching two ordinary women screw up just one time (ok, homicide is a biggie) only to have their lives snowball out of control? Maybe because the way it all happens, one thing leading inexorably to another (picking up a hitchhiker, committing armed robbery, resisting arrest, blowing up a rig, and finally...) makes you wonder: could this kind of thing happen to me and what would I do in their place? The leads are perfect in their roles. The pacing and photography are magnificent. And the dialog! When Thelma tells the cop he better be nice to his wife, because "my husband wasn't nice to me and look how I turned out" -- the whole audience cheered. An inventive and consistently entertaining movie that effectively mixes drama, suspense,action and humor. You have to see it once in your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>just another shallow, dumbed-down buddy-film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the supposed controversy (i.e. hype) surrounding the release of Ridley Scott's high-octane road film never took into account how shallow and predictable it is. Calling the movie a male-bashing chick flick doesn't hide the fact that it is, transparently, just that: an otherwise routine, gender-bent buddy film, with all the expected clichés intact. Yes, the men are all two-dimensional stereotypes (good cop, bad cowboy, confused boyfriend, insensitive husband), but the two title characters are equally insubstantial, and the inevitable (and again, predictable) merging of their contrary personalities is finally achieved in a convenient, unresolved freeze-frame non-climax designed to avoid the necessity of a genuine ending.Notice how any remorse over the killing that inaugurates their crime spree only lasts a scene or two: convention demands that they be girls who just want to have fun, and because all their (male) targets are cartoon jerks every act of violence is not only justified, but commendable. It might have been interesting to show them blowing away, in cold blood, an innocent bystander of the opposite sex, but that would only jeopardize the contrived sympathy built into their roles.Lively performances by Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis aren't enough to camouflage the formula, and at any rate both actresses are lost behind all the pretty scenery, photographed not unlike an ad for Levi jeans: only another example of how artificial the film is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For starters - There were 2 things (yes, only 2) that I didn't like about Thelma &amp; Louise.(1) Its finale (which sucked).And, yes - (2) Brad Pitt (who sucked, as well).But, with that all said, I must honestly admit that whenever it comes to the portrayal of a truly deceitful piece of slime (like J.D.), Brad Pitt is, by far, a true champion of champions.Anyways - Since I'm already convinced that everyone out there surely knows (all too well) the basic story of Thelma &amp; Louise, there really doesn't seem to be a whole lot of sense for me to bother to repeat it again (for, like, about the umpteenth frickin' time, I'm sure).But, in a nutshell.... When it came to suspense and comedy, I found that these 2 elements mixed surprisingly well in this film about 2 gal-pals (living troubled, caged lives) whose 2-day getaway to a mountain retreat ends up escalating into a literal non-stop crime-spree (beginning with the committing of a murder). And, at this point Thelma and Louise were, of course, forced to hightail it for their lives as the law closed in on them, but fast.You know, I really must hand it to Director Ridley Scott on this one. He certainly hit the jackpot with this "Slick-Chick-Buddy-Flick", although it did become a tad predictable as the story progressed. I mean, when you really think about it, Thelma &amp; Louise rarely ventured too far off the track of the all-too-familiar "road-movie" trail.But, with that all said and done - Thelma &amp; Louise was, indeed, an exhilarating, little "joy-ride-of-a-movie", even though it could have, but did not (contrary to what others might think) go out in a blaze of glory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nearly twenty-five years after it's release, Thelma &amp; Louise is still heralded as a classic, and is on most critics best films list. For years I'd heard about how outrageous and empowering this film is, but I'd never seen it in it's entirety. I've seen bits and pieces on cable and seen parodies of it, but I really never saw anything that made me want to watch it. The story is an interesting one about these two ladies who go on a weekend vacation. The ladies go drinking and partying, which gets them into some trouble and leads to them going on the run. This is one of those films that has those classic moments that really shine over the rest of the film. I found Thelma &amp; Louise to be quite forgettable, but it's those particular scenes that will stay with me. The cast was in class all it's own and I think that's why the critics loved this film so much. Thelma &amp; Louise may have been revolutionary for 1992, but in 2013, it's really not all that extreme, and in the years since, there have been so many copycats, that it's hard to differentiate it from all the similar stories that came after it. Geena Davis is just unbelievably good as Thelma. I love Geena Davis, I think she's extremely underrated, and it's her performance that makes this film work. How she doesn't win the Oscar for her portrayal of Thelma is beyond me. Susan Sarandon wasn't bad either, she's not really known for comedy and too me, she'll always be the one who prevented Bull Durham from being THE ultimate baseball film, but she was impressive. The cast member that was most interesting to me, was the young drifter, played by a good looking newcomer named Brad Pitt. In his first major film, Brad Pitt was so much different from the man we know today, it really showed the age of this film and just how much things can change in a relatively short period of time. It's hard to believe, but it was almost exactly five years after this films release that he starred in Se7en. As I said previously, this film is considered to be one of the best films of all time and it's gain that reputation because of it's performances and stand out scenes. Thelma &amp; Louise have their moments on their little adventure, but in the end, it's familiar, predictable, and forgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thelma &amp; Louise (1991) - Two Girls! Two Crimes! One Car!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis star in this completely awesome crime movie, with two chicks. "Thelma and Louise" talks about a road trip gone wrong, when Louise kills a man, and Thelma robs a convenience store. Now, the whole movie means that they are on the chase of the law. They must avoid the FBI, and see if they can head back home, danger-free. Now, this movie is more than a chick flick, it's a freaking awesome movie. Ridley Scott's direction was mighty-fine, and used a combination of comedy, drama, and action, to make this movie more than just for girls. Both Sarandon and Davis played excellent roles as Louise and Thelma, and the two girls create really good chemistry. But the other great performances came from great acclaimed actors including Harvey Keitel and Brad Pitt. The suspense is real, the script is a masterful piece of writing, and you may think this movie is just a worthless road trip movie, when it's really a high-paced thrill ride. I had a fun time watching this movie from beginning to end, that I just feel like watching it again. With a mixture of action, drama, and comedy, "Thelma and Louise" is the perfect road trip movie to watch again and again. "Thelma and Louise", in my review, "a high-paced thrill movie, a different type of chick flick".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Minor Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thelma and Louise, though not a masterpiece, is one of the best popcorn films of the early 1990s, and definitely a cultural landmark in its integration of a blockbuster road movie with feminist concerns. It combines excellent performances by Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon with the excellent cinematography that one would expect from director Ridley Scott.Perhaps the most effective aspect of the film is the performances by Davis and Sarandon. Sarandon is effective as Louise, giving the right balance of grittiness and vulnerability. However, although Sarandon is the one typically seen as the acclaimed actress, it is arguably Davis's performance that is the more memorable. She makes her character's transformation from repressed housewife to rebel actually believable. Thelma's initial dottiness translates all too well into her later recklessness. Davis's performance is multi-layered, making it open to question whether Thelma's transformation is liberation, or a type of mental collapse brought about by years of grinding boredom as a housewife.Furthermore, Scott brings his typical aplomb to the direction, with beautiful cinematography that captures the American West. He is adapt at presenting his flawed characters in a sympathetic fashion, retaining the audience's support even as they grow increasingly violent.However, the film has some definite flaws. As many people have already mentioned, the depiction of some of the male characters is definitely one dimensional, although this serves as much as comic relief as male bashing. More importantly, the film's tone is inconsistent, with at times jarring shifts from the comic to the serious. The film cannot decide until the last ten minutes or so whether it wants to be an action comedy or a feminist tract.It is worth considering, on the other hand, whether the film would have made as much of an impact without these flaws. Had it gone down the path of a straight feminist drama, it probably would have been confined to art house theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never saw this movie in the theaters and now I know why. I almost turned it off at several points, but I decided to stick it out to the bitter end. I am not sure how this movie is labeled as feminist. These are not feminist characters. First, the movie depicts southern women (with inexpert accents by the actresses) as oppressed and unable to react to a difficult situation without becoming oppressors themselves. Feminism is not about shooting rapists or humiliating obscene truckers. It is a cartoon of feminism (as well as a cartoon of masculine behavior) that reinforces the negative stereotypes of anti-feminists. The movie wasn't horrible but was written, and directed, as if someone hired a right-wing conservative to script what they believed a feminist would write.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a feminist classic in it's own right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm amazed by the wide range of themes in Scott's movies,from sci-fi to this feminist drama,set on a background of magnificent scenery and lonely,dusty roads.Louise Sawyer is a worn-out,sharp-tongued waitress in Arkansas who lives an independent life,not relying on any man to take care of her.She has a boyfriend,but they don't live together. Her best friend,Thelma Dickinson on the other hand,is a timid housewife with a male chauvinist husband who sells carpets for a living and is really not much more than a badly behaved teenager in a man's body(and proud of it,to quote Louise:))She merely has to ask for his permission to leave the grounds.One day Louise asks her best friend to come with her to a cabin she has borrowed from her boss,over the weekend.Thelma is reluctant,Darryl isn't home yet and even if he was he probably wouldn't let her go. But Louise persuades her to go anyway,and so she does,leaving nothing but a TV-dinner in the microwave for Darryl and a note. They set off into the sunset in Louise's blue Ford Thunderbird-66 and stops for some drinks at a roadside bar. Thelma's newly found freedom becomes too much for her to handle and the evening ends tragically as Louise takes to desperate actions to save Thelma from a rapist. They are now in a position where they are not likely to be believed if they claim self-defense,since everyone in the bar saw Thelma and the guy making out and dancing together. Louise has to come up with a plan and soon the oppressed housewife Thelma show unexpected potential. Only one man,a police investigator portrayed by Harvey Keitel,shows understanding and compassion for the now very vulnerable women and also sees what lies behind Louise's actions. It's interesting to see how almost all men in the movie,even those who are benevolent and mean well(such as Harvey Keitel's police officer),show patronizing tendencies...A classic movie about friendship in general and between women in particular.A must-see if you like.</fullReview>

Watch this movie if you want to laugh, cry, sympathise, scream at the screen, and really get involved in a movie. It really does leave you wanting more at the end of the film, which is a little frustrating, but amidst the tears and the smiles it doesn't really matter. I love it. I love it. I LOVE IT!

		<fullReview>The first thing that most people will think of is "chick flick," but Thelma and Louise is hardly just that. Many people may think that it's sexist and harsh toward men, but I would strongly disagree. Although, yes, there were men made out to be the bad guys ? Thelma's chauvinistic husband, the perverted man who tried to rape Thelma and who made filthy comments to Louise, the vulgar truck driver, etc. ? there were men portrayed as heroes. Louise's boyfriend proved himself to be honorable and loving, and the police sergeant, in the end, had a compassion for the women. Still, the men of the story were not the main focus; it was the triumph of two women stepping up from their mistakes and misfortunes, and enjoying the liberation of living for them selves.Cinematic ally, the movie had great strengths as well. Throughout the movie there were hints of foreshadowing, all leading up to those final ten minutes Thelma and Louise shared together on the canyon cliff. There was never a scene that dragged on too long or an incident that happened too quickly; everything seemed to fall right into place. At the beginning, it's almost as if the rest of the movie should not measure up to the major scene of the murder, but it was very interesting how that scene paved the way for what was the come instead. The murder was the major turning point, and thereafter the women experienced a successive changing, which was obvious as the tone of the picture and the actual physical appearances of the women went from bright and beautiful, to more dull and rugged. The ending comes as a huge shock, but yet it fits so well. The journey the movie brings you on is moving and inspiring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scott's Thelma and Louise is an entertaining and amusing film regarding the growing friendship of its female leads. Thelma and Louise start off going on an innocent voyage and end up as fugitives. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon are brilliant. The chemistry between these two women is intense and very impressive. They constantly feed off each other's actions and emotions, which is what makes Thelma and Louise so comfortable to watch. Thelma and Louise are depicted as strong and independent women, consequently making all men in the movie seem powerless. These two best friends always dominated the film's men (whether it was killing them or deceiving them), and ultimately escaped them and life altogether. I wouldn't say that Scott's enjoyable film makes the viewer truly feel for his characters, but it makes the viewer contemplate the innocence of Thelma and Louise. Are they really criminals, or are they just helpless victims? In addition, the film's ending is extremely powerful. These women were determined to be free, and the only way they could do so was to die together.Everything in this film fits together. The acting, cinematography, and directing is superb. The feminist message is evident, but not advocated too passionately. The soundtrack is also excellent. It adds to the whole "go-with-the-flow" feel of the film. Although Thelma and Louise is a particularly long film, it never gets boring. It is a fun and well-written story about the sincere bond between two domineering women.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are endless moments in this film that are classic. Susan Sarandon and Gina Davis light up the screen like a couple of supernovas. With disarming smiles, accents, mannerisms and personas, watching them act together is like watching Astaire and Rogers. They complement each other, counter each other, are SO unbelievably entertaining and real in their emotions, raw, powerful and honest. It is a tour de force of an acting ensemble quite unlike any other in American Cinema. And what an entertaining movie! We are taken on this road trip, we are tossed around, made to grimace in repulsion, made to laugh helplessly, made to watch in amazement not knowing what next to expect--it is entertainment on such a grand level. Feminist? Sure! Is it only for women? No way! Susan's heart-breakingly real beau and Harvey Keitel's sincere caring detective--they more than counteract the boorishness of some of the male characters. My favorite moments: The line-dancing at the pivitol roadhouse bar, Brad Pitt's description of how to do a holdup and his surprisingly erotic seduction of Gina Davis, the stoned bicycle rider, the final freeze-frame and white out, Susan Sarandon asking Jimmy what are the color of her eyes, Gina Davis' declaration of independence....I could go on and on.

Geena Davis as Thelma, does a very good performance, as a meek woman with an overbearing husband, who finds herself with newfound freedom, albeit quite naive and trusting, even after what happened to her.Susan Sarandon shines in this movie as well as Louise, a woman with a boyfriend who turns out to be not so bad of a guy. She also has a past to overcome, and the two of them are drawn together by the events that happen on the run.Brad Pitt had a great performance as a smooth operator con-man, as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My bestfriend and I saw this together and we couldn't believe how much it compared to our lives. Now mind you we wouldn't go driving off a cliff (at least not yet anyway haha). Brad Pitt was an unknown and boy he was cute. I own it on dvd, tape, and copied off the tv. It's an excellent movie. And the girls acting was great!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally got around to seeing this movie a my freshman year of college with my roommate. We had heard it was a different sort of "chick flick", but the film totally caught us by surprise. After watching it, I felt like watching stuff blow up, and being proud to be a woman. This film brings new meaning to the phrase "I am woman, hear me roar!!" Ridley Scott's direction is great, along with stellar performances by everyone in the cast. A must-see for any woman who's looking for a whole new level of chick-flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly breathtaking and heartbreaking film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I am a male, and I just have to say this movie truly touched me inside. I know what it is to have that struggle with other people and truly admire the characters for what they did and refusing to give up, even in the end, because they drove off the cliff instead of surrendering once again to the male-dominated world. Why this movie only got 1 Oscar, I will never know, but it certainly deserved Best Picture and more. Thelma and Louise did get the Best Screenplay Oscar, which was definitely well deserved. There are many qualities to a good movie: among them, is a good script, good acting, good background/setting, good music, among other things. The script was superb, absolutely amazing and touching how these 2 friends stood up for each other and were going to be there for each other all the way to the end. The acting was SENSATIONAL, both Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis gave absolutely stunning performances, no flaws, beautifully done, ladies! As for the setting: Could it be any more beautiful? Set in the Mid-US where there are exceptionally beautiful canyons and scenery..... and the music! I loved Hans Zimmers' haunting guitar music, which was glorious, especially in the final few moments of the moment before they made that historic drive over the cliff. The ending was amazing also...that drive over the cliff to show that these 2 brave women will never ever be confined by men again...plus the clips of happier moments of the pair in the past that followed were simply ingenious! That is why I am proud to call Thelma and Louise my favorite movie of all time. I know that there will never be a movie that will demonstrate courage, faith and friendship as beautifully as "Thelma and Louise" did.Bravo to the whole cast, crew and Ridley Scott, the director!!!</fullReview>

Had the 2 persons been men, I doubt the movie would have been called "the most controversial film of the year". I have the soundtrack--which is excellent, and like to watch this one over and over.

		<shortDescription>A Partial Bio with some exceptions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are so many parallels in this movie to a short portion of my life (except Harlan and his demise). In 1971 my best friend and I traveled 60,000 miles in 6 months in a '67 Camaro not a '66 Bird top down all the way. She was Thelma and I was "Louise" driver. If she is out there in Southern California somewhere, I'd like her to know that I lived happily ever after.Many women should see this movie to awaken the free spirit that is in all of us. I have watched this movie approximately 40 times because there was something about it that irritated me. I realized what it was on the 37th viewing. I hated the fact that one of the g-men was reading a magazine entitled "Boudoir" especially when this movie was dealing with the violence of rape. What kind of a message is that?? To me, the message was that he took the whole case lightly and as a fact of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not JUST a female buddy movie. It does kick butt, but it's also very intelligent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first few times I saw this movie, I loved it because it was two women kicking butt. The last couple times I've seen it, I've found it more thought-provoking. Not all the men are straight-up jerks like Thelma's husband or the guy at the bar. Some even try to help the "girls" out or do what they think they want. Each male character in the movie somehow misinterprets women in general and specifically Thelma and Louise. Jimmy (Michael Madsen in an exceptionally hot spell) proposes to Louise, thinking she's going away because he won't commit. Hal (Harvey Keitel) wants to help them, but treats them like little girls that he has to protect. These two characters are the most respectful of any men in the movie, yet even they don't quite get it. The 2nd most disrepectful man, Mr. Thelma, shows real sadness in the midst of his wife's crime spree. Whether it is recognition of his absolute failure as a husband, or just an idiot's confusion, is not revealed. The most disrepectful man, the unfortunate Harlan (guy in bar/parking lot), doesn't get a chance to realize the error of his ways, but we can assume that he wouldn't have anyway. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a man-hater. I love the movie becuase it's presentation of women in society is so multifaceted. It doesn't present all men as pigs. Yes, many and mostly, but not all. The performances are fantastic. Of course, Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis are at their best. Their (un)supporting cast is also great. For Harvey Keitel, Hal is a bit flat, but effective. Brad Pitt found his break here; billed 7th or something, his JD is 15-minute show stealer. Michael Madsen is superb. Sure, all his has do is squint and talk in a gravelly voice, but who better to do it, really? And he does it so well. Finally, a particular kudos to Christopher MacDonald. As Darryl Dickenson, he is truly repugnant. It takes a certain courage for an actor to create a character with absolutely no redeeming qualities. Couple more thing: it's an absolutely beautiful picture. The dust, the sunsets, the T-bird, the increasingly grubby actresses. The score is great too, and Ridley Scott did just a wonderful job with this one. Oh, and the soundtrack is great. As I've said, I love the theme side of this film, but I do still watch this movie when I'm having boy-troubles. The simple pleasure of watching Thelma and Louise blow up trucks and lock state troopers in their trucks is the best medicine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my all time favorite movies, for many reasons. The first is obvious: the cast. It's too bad even though Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis were both nominated for Oscars that both of them couldn't win. I think they both deserved it. Their performances are the strongest things about the movie. And the supporting cast is also great, especially Harvey Kietel. I also like seeing Stephen Tobolowski (Stephen who?). And I love the ending. Unlike most people, who thinks it's sad, I can't imagine them ending it any other way. If Thelma and Louise had been caught, that would have sucked. But if they had gotten away from the cops, it would have seemed contrived and unoriginal. But having them drive off the cliff was the best possible way to end it. It was very liberating and freeing to see them make a decision and end it on their terms. My score-10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Thelma &amp; Louise' really shows 'girl power', much better than the Spice Girls did. This intense drama shows that a woman can be just as good of a runaway than a man. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon are so dominant in this movie, it is very dramatic. They played the perfect Thelma and Louise, no other actress could portray them the way they did. The end- whether you think it ended badly or beautifully, it still causes tears. It is very powerful, and after it you will think "Wow," because of this movie's passion and force. At times you'll laugh, at times you'll cry, but in the end you will be glad you watched it. Academy Award for best Picture is what it received, and it deserved it wholeheartedly. This movie is a great combination, and is the perfect road movie. "Somebody said to get a life, so they did".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal honesty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of screenwriters, filmmakers, and students ask the question, "What made this movie work?" To me, it was honesty. You could drive through the country and meet people just like all of the people in this film. There's the man trying to make himself better (Madsen) through coming to grips with his true feelings for a small town waitress. A young drifter only looking out for himself (Pitt). A husband who doesn't appreciate his wife until she is gone (McDonald). A guy who never stops believing (Keitel) in women. And a few guys that weren't raised right (Carhart, St. John 'the truck driver', and Pitt again). It was honest here.And, the film was honest about it's main characters Thelma (Davis) and Louise (Sarandon). Here were two women driven, away from every aspect of their lives and over a cliff. Neither one was perfect, yet both new right from wrong and expressed that, down to Thelma littering to Louise shooting someone. Louise never got mad at Thelma although she had good reason and vice versa. Despite their wrongs, they had each other up to the last moment. This is honest, some friendship in this world is unbreakable. It's simply a great movie about brutal honesty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Friendship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't really see it as a feminist film, but rather an empowerment of the human spirit. the world is coming down around them and is it because they are women that they go on the lam? no it's because they are friends who support each other. this is a film about friendship not about the ERA. If it were two men, they wouldn't say anything, it would simply be called a buddy-drama. A good story that you can watch over and over along with a great but too brief Brad Pitt cameo, Thelma and Louise delivers on many different levels. It doesn't talk down to its audience or preach to them. And what about the ending? Amazing! I'm surprised the studios let them even shoot it, let alone put it in the final film. Thelma and Louise is one of those rare gems that will span the test of time and remind us what truly good films and truly great friendships can accomplish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Feminist Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A pair of bored thirty something friends decide on a girl's weekend and in that time become the most wanted women in America. Not that bedding either Susan Sarandon or Geena Davis hasn't got its delightful aspects, but that's not the kind of wanted I'm talking about.The film is shot in some of the reddest part of red state America where gender roles and rules are laid down real specific and you don't cross them. Just these two women going out without husband or significant other partner of the opposite sex means they're loose and available.So when alpha male Timothy Carhart decides after some line dancing at a county honky-tonk that Geena's hot to trot, he decides to do something about it in the parking lot. And if she resists he certainly knows how to bring her in line. But when Sarandon pulls a gun on him he backs down very reluctantly. In fact Carhart's defiant attitude and assumed male superiority snaps something in Sarandon and she blows him away on general principles. After that they're on the run. Sarandon and Davis work beautifully together in Thelma&amp;Louise. Close friends before the homicide takes place, they learn a lot about each other on the journey. They air out finally the way they feel women have been treated in their part of the country. Though I wouldn't recommend women act out quite the way they do, the film remains a great feminist manifesto.Harvey Keitel does a fine job as a caring police officer who wants to bring them in with no problems and before they run up a real criminal record. Christopher McDonald and Michael Madsen are the men in their lives, both in their different ways clueless as to what is going on inside Thelma&amp;Louise. Just the fact they wanted a girl's vacation should have lit up some bulb.McDonald, Madsen are just two of the men these two get to degrade and humiliate on their merry race with destiny. One however that gets the better of them is Brad Pitt in his breakthrough role as a young cowboy they find hitchhiking and give a lift to. Despite their new found feminism, Sarandon and Davis are still quite vulnerable in some areas, as are we all.Callie Khouri won an Oscar for Best Screenplay written directly for the screen. Thelma&amp;Louise got five other nominations including for both Sarandon and Davis for Best Actress. They split the balloting as is what usually happens and Jodie Foster took her second Oscar home for Silence Of The Lambs.Thelma&amp;Louise is destined to be a classic and a feminist manifesto for generations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Badlands</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To escape the unrelenting dullness of their everyday lives, two middle aged Southern women head out on a vacation together. Thelma is a ditsy, innocent homebody married to an unlikeable car salesman. Louise is smart, worldly, distrusting, and a careful planner who works as a waitress.The story starts off routinely as their road trip begins, but takes a non-routine turn when an incident occurs at a restaurant. From then on, the story gradually evolves into a majestic odyssey built on a foreboding sense of desperation, as the two women drive ever westward, through the rugged badlands of the American Southwest. Indeed, this film reminds me a lot of the 1973 classic "Badlands"; except that, as seekers of freedom, Thelma and Louise are far more sympathetic than the two lead characters in the earlier film.Both Geena Davis as Thelma, and Susan Sarandon as Louise, give terrific performances. They imbue their characters with complex traits that present Thelma and Louise as vibrant and believable, flawed but very human. In support roles, Harvey Keitel as the main detective and Brad Pitt as a drifter named J.D. enhance the film's overall quality of acting.Dialogue lends credible support to the story's characterizations, like when Thelma asks J.D. about his previous petty robbery experience. J.D. purrs in an oh-so-non-threatening way: "Well now, I've always believed that if done properly, armed robbery doesn't have to be a totally unpleasant experience". And Thelma's nature is such that her encounter with J.D. foreshadows the film's ending, which is both emotional and noble.Filled with mostly country/western music, the film exudes a mournful tone. I particularly like the songs "Part Of You, Part Of Me" by Glenn Frey, and "The Ballad Of Lucy Jordan" by Marianne Faithful.If the film has a weakness it is a plot that keeps reverting back to the police investigation, and therefore to the men in the two ladies' lives. I could thus have wished for less time on long-distance phone conversations and police questioning, and more time with the two central characters and their on-the-road adventure."Thelma &amp; Louise" is a very American-type film, filled with dirt roads, open highway, expansive landscapes, and two likable women in search of freedom and self discovery. Technically well made, the film has both entertainment value and thematic depth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Let's not get caught." That's the last word that Thelma told Louise.Two women went on vacation for escaping the reality of their life; the reality of being pushed around by boss and mistreated by husband. However, one thing they don't know is that being caught is their destinies. They are already set up to be caught by this society.Two victims of rape. Two victims of the lies of marriage and love.They are caught by "power". Two white women on the road with two guns. They thought those guns can bring them the power, instead they bring them troubles. Not the fault of guns. It is their fault----they are women. Once the thing in women's hand, it isn't power anymore, because power is predefine as what belong to men.They were chased, because they are not "women". They are not "women" because women don't use guns. They are not "men", because they are women. They are meant to be caught, because one is either a man or woman, if one want to change the definition, one ought to be eliminated.They are caught by "responsibilities". House and work chores that are not do any good to them. No life fulfillment, no appreciation. They should do men favors since the society teaches that women are sex objects. If someone ask you "baby, are u ready for a big dick?", as a woman , you should say yes.A man was shot. A man was locked in the trunk. A man's truck was bowled up. A man stole $625.5. A man neglected his wife. A man is in charge of the investment. A man asked other men to chase, to block, to control.They did not want to challenge men. Thelma wants to have fun with them. Louise wants to forget what they have done to her. Even after a couple of incidents that make them "guilty", they only want to run away.They don't want to be caught. they cry out. Let's not get caught. Then, they speed up. Drive away from the side in which all men are guarding with guns. They drive off the cliff. In the air. Where they will land? Where? A place in which a woman says no means no? a place in which rape cases can be justified? Maybe, a place where has no rapist? Sisters, let's not get caught by sexism, ageism, classism, racism, etc.Let's not get caught by injustice, stereotypes, objectification, etc.Let's just not get caught by things we are not sign up to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fantastic Feminist Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably my favorite movie of 1991, THELMA AND LOUISE was an exciting, gripping, and deeply moving comedy/drama/adventure about girlfriends (Susan Sarandon, Geena Davis)who plan an innocent weekend away from their hum drum lives and the scummy men in their lives and due to some unforeseen circumstances, find themselves suddenly on the run from the law. This was the first female buddy movie that completely worked for me...everything clicks here, a smart story and characters you can feel for and relate to. Although most of the supporting characters are drawn as unsympathetic bad guys, it seemed necessary in order for us to sympathize with the two lead characters and the terrible trouble they are in. The leads are superb, Sarandon in particular, gives the performance of her career that should have won her the Oscar, but I think the fact that Davis was also nominated kind of canceled her out. Khalli Couri's outstanding screenplay did win an Oscar and Ridley Scott's direction is equally compelling. There is also a memorable bit by Brad Pitt, in one of his first major roles, who makes a strong impression as a shady drifter the girls pick up on their journey. Abeautifully constructed story of friendship and adventure that demands multiple viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Road Trip Adventure (contains spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I believe anyone who has been seriously wronged, male or female, will relate well with the movie's characters. Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis reserved well deserved Oscar nominations for their roles. The supporting players are also excellent, especially Christopher McDonald and Michael Madsen. Brad Pitt's turn as the sexy con artist is a show stealer. His career took off in high gear after this movie. The movie has much symbolism. Louise kills the rapist in the parking lot because she's never come to terms with her own rape experience. She suffers deep mental anguish and damage from it and refuses to discuss it. Thelma wants to do what's right, but is very influenced by Louise's thinking. Thelma believes Louise is right that society labels people and provides more support to the guilty than the innocent. The Grand Canyon is an excellent back drop to the movie's conclusion. Thelma and Louise are exposed like the canyon and they find there's no turning back. They know the euphoria they've experienced in rectifying society's wrongs will end and they might be in prison for a long time. As a side note, statistics do show that female criminals serve much longer sentences than men for the same crime. Thelma's and Louise's actions have pushed them over the edge (pun intended!) and they'd rather end their lives on a high note. All in all, I highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Female empowerment at its most fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"...you know, something's, like, crossed over in me and I can't go back, I mean I just couldn't live."Sometimes it's a male gut reaction is to avoid this sort of movie. But recently I have enjoyed some of the 'chick flicks' I have seen: ?The Truth About Cats &amp; Dogs', ?Mystic Pizza', and ?Something To Talk About' (which is by the same writer as this one.) Thelma &amp; Louise is another one I can wholeheartedly recommend, even to the guys.This is a classic movie of two types: a female empowerment film, and an American road movie. It follows traditions of both these kinds, but adds a new sort of audaciousness to it all. It gets you right behind the two main characters, experiencing their new-found freedom as they travel cross-country firing guns, robbing convenience stores and evading the law. They are a couple of country women who have been on the receiving end of unfavorable treatment for probably most of their lives, and we witness them take it that one more time before they decide enough is enough, and stand up for themselves. They do it together, and that's what makes their stance work. As good a friends as they are, their stance heightens their friendship even more, and has the audience cheering them on even though they can see them heading further and further towards disaster. I enjoyed seeing the American countryside along the journey. From the dusty roads in the desert, the mountains and open paddocks, to the bars, hotels and roadside stops. It really gives a true feel of what the American rural areas are like. But what makes this movie is the performances of Susan Sarandon &amp; Geena Davis, who are completely winning &amp; lovable. These are the best roles I have seen each of them in. Brad Pitt is good in the role that shot him to stardom, as is Harvey Keitel as the not-so-ruthless cop chasing them. Michael Madsen &amp; Christopher McDonald have sometimes funny and sometimes scary moments as the boyfriend who won't commit to Louise, and Thelma's terrible husband.Initially doubtful on what a film like this would have to offer me, it surpassed my expectations. It is a really well-made film, and with Ridley Scott at the helm, it's no wonder, but he also gives it a lot of heart. I thought the ending was perfect; even when it seems it's getting all too much as these girls are being chased cross-state by more and more cops, they never give in. The ending might be sad to some if they dwell on it, but to me the moment that final scene pauses, I had a feeling of exhilaration.4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great "buddy" film, just do not read into it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that ignited tremendous controversy when it was first released. The two stars were even featured on the front page of Time Magazine and they even gave the ending away. People read great sociology messages into the meaning of the film. Is society really that prejudiced against women? Were Thelma and Louise "outlaws" or really victims? Should women really rebel against a society that they feel is that unjust? My reaction against these "egghead" statements is just hogwash! The best way to watch Thelma and Louise is simply to leave your "brain" so to speak at the door of the cinema and just relax and have a good time. Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis are a buddy team just like Newman and Redford in "Butch Cassidy" (thats the best comparison that I can make to this film) or to Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in the immensely popular Lethal Weapon series. These are two fine actresses who unite and give us one helluva ride! I have to admit that as an American male I really liked the tight jeans and cowboy boots that Susan wore in the film! She was one tough ass-kicking momma! This was one of those "sleeper" films like Rocky that no one suspected would make a dime and made a mint. I remember when this film was playing at one of the last drive-ins in Gypsy, West Virginia near my hometown of Fairmont, they said in the newspaper ad that they saved the best film of the summer for last. I will bet that the people who made this film could have kicked themselves for ending it the way they did. Not to give anything away, but if they had let the door open at the end and let Thelma and Louise get away, they could easily have made a sequel and made millions of more dollars.</fullReview>

It was through my lectures that I heard of the film Thelma and Louise, and I am so glad that I have seen it! Its a brilliant portrayal of two womens fight with the law, although with the clever use of editing and the greatness of Khouri's script, you will still feel so much sympathy for the characters right up until the closing stages. It's a wonderful film, filled with emotion! It'll make you laugh and cry, and no doubt keep you on the edge of your seats!

		<fullReview>Thelma and Louise always affects me, no matter how many times I've seen it. It overflows with talent, from the brilliant script of Callie Khouri to the vivacious characterizations of our heroines by Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon. Brad Pitt and Michael Madsen are often overlooked as the male sparks of the movie, but each shines every time he's onscreen. This is a "moment" film...full of unforgettable incidents. I still hope that they don't drive into the canyon upon every viewing, and even after they do, I still hold onto the belief that hey, maybe they did make it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Legendary grand slam of pure adventure, Best movie ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS THROUGH:I have commented on a lot of pics but almost didn't want to comment on this mainly because it is my favorite picture and I doubt I could do the film justice with a few words.Thelma and Louise is amazing from start to finish. There is absolutely nothing to criticize in this movie, just about every scene is flawless. This movie, besides having created two of the most amazing joyful women in film history Gina Davis and Susan Sarandon(as well as a few others notably a slick, slow talking drifter named JD played by Brad Pitt in his breakout role) takes us on an a journey of joy, adventure, tragedy, adversity, triumph and friendship.They say a good movie leaves it's mark on your life, once in awhile a movie actually alters your life's course. Thelma and Louise was actually the inspiration for myself and a friend to travel across the country and road trip the wild west. We were inspired by the movie and it's stunning road scenery and the vigorous feeling of being totally, euphorically and completely free(fortunately we didn't break any laws along the way!).This movie played a major role in my life, as well as being such an important and moving picture. To me it rates a 20 out of 10.SPOILERS:The ending, as tragic as it was, was the only way it COULD have ended. Although the sentimental part of me would love to see a part 2, the realistic part of me knows this one's better left alone as is. (Although,with Hollywood-who knows what could happen?) Absolutely wonderful acting by all. Perfect songs and musical score, that don't just capture the essence of the film, they become part of it.See this if you haven't,it is a majestic triumphant masterpiece. 10 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>acting out of confusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I met Callie Khouri at one of those symposiums that, for $400, you had the "honor" of listening to self-absorbed industry movers and shakers tell you what a loser you are! Anyway, after one of these sessions, I asked her about my main beef about Thelma &amp; Louise: why did they decide to go to Mexico, whose culture is notoriously misogynistic? She said, "They were probably acting out of confusion." Excuse me? Why were they confused? Why didn't she know? She CREATED them! And why was it set in the Southwest? It would've made more sense if it started out in, say, Minnesota, and have our heroines make a run for Canada (which, like Mexico, will not extradite a foreign national if he/she faces the death penalty.) And the ending is the biggest cop-out! What was the point? That women are oppressed? Sorry, that's up there with "the dog ate my homework." The dirty little secret of the women's movement is that women have participated in their own subjugation for thousands of years. Khouri has no point, no answers, no hindsight, no foresight, no frame of reference, and was probably acting out of confusion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thelma &amp; Louise is one of those unfortunately all too rare movie gems which really engages the viewer. Watch it with a good friend and you'll find yourselves energised by the zest for life displayed by Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon in their stand out performances. Like Thelma and Louise, you'll want to ditch your jobs for the weekend and beg, borrow or steal a classic convertible car, before setting off on a road trip adventure along the USA's dusty mid-western highways.The premise of the film is simple - put two ordinary people in an extraordinary situation and watch what happens as events start to snowball. Davis's bored housewife and Sarandon's diner-waitress are typical of thousands of women the world over. A chance encounter on the way to a run-of-the-mill weekend holiday in the mountains starts a chain of happenstance that thrusts the two friends into a situation where there are no signposts and no rules. Thelma &amp; Louise is often classified as a 'chick flick', but this is perhaps somewhat misleading. Certainly it is true that this is a film about two women, and the men in the story are shown as ineffectual or lacking in understanding (although watch for an entertaining appearance by Brad Pitt which is regarded as his breakthrough role). However one of the main themes dealt with is the emotive and perennially grey area surrounding attempted rape and how the reporting of it is dealt with - this is clearly not the fluff and insubstantiality usually associated with chick flicks. However, despite this and despite the outcome of the film (which on one level could be viewed as tragic), the brilliant and insightful cinematography of Ridley Scott leaves the viewer upbeat and with a tremendous sense of freedom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a pointless movie. With all these rave reviews I must have missed something. Is this really a feminist film, if so, why do the two protagonists kill themselves. This is not a film about overcoming adversity, it is not about good overcoming evil, rather evil which begets evil, and in the end everyone loses. How anyone can even see this as anything associated with feminism is beyond me. What makes this film work is its ensemble cast, and fine acting, other than that, you can keep it. A classic in 50 years, don't think so, I can just see the men and woman of the future taking a look at this and thinking "what a bunch of losers, the whole sorry lot !"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>????simply the best movie ever!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK first of all, i'm a guy (a straight guy) and i have to confess that "Thelma and Louise" it's my favorite movie of all time. Sure is a chick flick but even guys can enjoy it, what i love about this movie is the fact that most people see it as a feminist movie but it's so does not. The movie deals with the reality that most of the women are force to live now a days, first there's Thelma the typical housewives who's life goes around a probably unfaithful husband and all the "to do's2 of her house and does not do anything to risky cause "it might2 get her husband upset. Second there's Louise a 40 something woman who has a though past and leads her to become the strong (sometimes bitter)woman that she is now. And then there's the guys in the movie. I personally think that the grates are the 3 leading man interpreted gracefully by Harvey keithel (hal) Michael masden (jimmy) and christopher mcdonald (darryl) all of them give us a look of what it is the man perception from women's perspective (hal is the guy that seems to be perfect,compressive and brave but in the long run he is a guy and that is show when he talks about the (women shits) with darryl. Jimmy is the typical romantic guy that gives everything for his girl but that's all because he "loves the chase" and then there's darryl who happens to be the typical "macho man" that thinks that women are only on earth to serve their husbands) But anyway the movie in my opinion is just great, great scrip, great performances, great scenarios, and great directing. My favorite part of the movie is that cliffhanging ending that will remain as a cliffhanger perhaps forever. So if you really want to see this movie, ?do it! you will not me regret and i will stay in your heart for the rest of your life. my vote is an outstanding 10 for an outstanding movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This always is a great film, a great story about love, friendship, and most importantly being free. Anyone who watches this and then doesn't want to go out on a cross country road trip is crazy. Great interaction between the two leads and great performances. And most importantly, the ending makes the film as they sail off the edge of the cliff, and "escape the man." A lot of people saw this a feminist man hating film, but I saw it for what it was, two women trying to leave their mark on the world and the lengths they will go to for their undying friendship. I guess there's no chance of a sequel huh? And what a great cameo from Brad Pitt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie, it's excellent. Hats off to Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon for making this movie a hit! The movie stars Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon aka Thelma &amp; Louise, they go to a bar and meet a guy who rapes one of the girls, I forget who. So, they both get together and kill him, than there on the lamb, so to speak.Along the way they meet a very sexy hitchhiker (Brad Pitt) and pick him up on the way, not telling him what there running from. Harvey Keitel is the officer who wants to bring them in for murder.This movie, believe it or not, is one of my favourites, it's got excellent acting from all the stars, mostly the two female leads and Keitel, and its' got a very cute guy in it Brad Pitt, great lines, brilliantly directed by Ridley Scott, and it has a one-of-a-kind story that makes it unforgettable. That's why it get's a 10 in my books. So watch the movie and see if they succeed or don't? Great ending too, by the way, you might want to have a box of Kleenex handy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two accidental female fugitives elude the police while attempting to drive across the Southwest to Mexico. Filmmaker Ridley Scott shows a terrific talent for directing women here, and the performances by Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis are almost uncanny. One can hardly believe that these two haven't been friends for years, their give and take seems so lived in. Salty waitress Sarandon, initially the savvier of the two, is loose and girlie with Arkansas housewife Davis in the beginning; however, their character shadings soon change, with both ladies eventually taking turns playing 'the brains' (I didn't really believe it when, having been pulled over by a cop in the desert, Sarandon's Louise becomes kind of a dingbat, but you accept it for the moment and the movie quickly rolls on). The men in the cast obviously don't get much of a chance to shine, but Harvey Keitel does the understanding detective bit very well (it's almost the same man he portrayed in "Mortal Thoughts"); Brad Pitt has a scene-stealing, star-making role as a cowboy hustler, yet this film took a long time to gain a fully appreciative audience. It did modest business and garnered Oscar nominations for the ladies, but only afterward did it take on some resonance (it's now viewed as a feminist statement and has a loyal following among lesbian audiences). It creaks a little, and the twangy main theme gives way to a ridiculously melodramatic score, but the narrative is so tight and the women are so good that it keeps you watching--and returning. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridley Scott's dark comedy is both shocking and cynical, but incredibly entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Ridley Scott met his rise to stardom after his success with the science-fiction thriller 'Alien' in 1979, and his dystopian thriller masterpiece 'Blade Runner', although it didn't initially receive the proper recognition by critics or at the box office upon it's release. At the dawn of 90s, the awe-inspiring filmmaker decided to steer into another route aside from the sci-fi genre, and that is when he found the courage to tackle on some thought- provoking themes about society and feminism. His achievement is found here in this dark road-trip comedy starring Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis in their anti-heroine roles who are given a mouth full to say about society and it's uncouth treatment towards women, but perhaps not the most orthodox way for that matter. The film centers on Thelma Dickinson (played by Geena Davis), an Arkansas housewife living under the household of her manipulative husband Darryl (played by Christopher McDonald); and her best friend Louise Sawyer (played by Susan Sarandon), a waitress at a local diner who's dating kind-hearted musician Jimmy (played by Michael Madsen) who sadly doesn't have enough for her as his music career always have him on the road. Escaping from their boring and demented lives, Thelma and Louise decide to take a road trip in their 1966 Ford Thunderbird Convertible. Along the way, they stop at a local bar where Thelma meets a handsome young man who quickly turns dangerous when he tries to rape her. Catching him in the middle of act, Louise opens fire and kills the guy, leading to her and Thelma fleeing their hometown. Learning they are now wanted by the law enforcement, the women make a desperate attempt to flee to Mexico with Detective Hal Slocumb (played by Harvey Keital) hunting them down.If you are looking for a high-octane action thriller with gunfights and explosive special effects, then you are probably not at the right place. If you are looking a road-trip comedy with big laughs and charm, you're probably not at the right place either. Though there is some humor and cleverness to be encountered from it's two lead actresses, this road-trip flick has something much more provocative to say than just light-hearted entertaining set pieces. The movie centers on it's two titular character as journey across the country in search of a new life after becoming fed up of their sour lifestyle they endured from their constant maltreatment from the male crowd, and this all leads to a feministic atmosphere as these women fight for power over their lives. This also accounts to to some grim, but fascinating character studies. For instance, one scene involves Lousie imploring Thelma to find way to make it to Mexico without cruising through Texas due to her fear of being in the state after a horrifying experience left her traumatized. From there on, you begin to feel for both her and Thelma as you come to realize they have been victims of horrible crimes that left scars on them, and they won't heal. Although their cynical views on society and callous behavior don't make for the most likable characters, Ridley Scott does a pleasant job as providing them with a heart and humanity rather than savage criminals, and successfully maps a compelling character-driven plot up to it's shocking finale. Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis are both give endearing performances in their roles as does Harvey Keital as the Detective who hunts them down on their odyssey. Michael Madsen and Christopher McDonald are not bad, but not given a whole lot work with due to their limited screen time. One of the biggest surprises though, is the young and handsome Brad Pitt as the young heartthrob who acquired the attention of Thelma, and like most of his roles; he gets the job done.Thelma &amp; Louise is a smart, outstanding work by visionary director Ridley Scott, with mesmerizing performances, an awe-inspiring direction driven by Scott's ingenuity, and an overall successful ability to tackle on thought-provoking subject matter. While the film does evoke a cynical atmosphere and shock value that probably won't be everyone's cup of tea, it's still incredibly entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feminist movie uses too much patriarchy to get point across</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh what a confused, sometimes wonderful movie this is. At times, one believes this movie is beneficial to women and the feminist cause in general (I'm a feminist accidentally born with testicles, in case you were wondering). Too often, though, the movie falls back on patriarchal norms to advance its narrative.And, not to spoil the ending too much (if you don't know how this movie ends, get a job and stop living underneath a bridge!), the fate of the women protagonists is, ultimately, the fate of any woman who stands up for herself in a patriarchal society -- total doom.The movie begins on an excellent note. Two women have decided to take a vacation together. The younger of the two, Thelma, does so at the risk of angering her typical knuckle-dragging patriarchal husband who, gag, watches football.The women stop for food and some drinks at a bar and Thelma, enjoying her freedom, gets a little too drunk. A complete sleaze-a-thon takes her to the dance floor and spins her around until she's dizzy and feels the need to vomit. He accompanies her to the parking lot under the guise of helping her, and then, surprise, attempts to rape her.Here's where the movie gets complicated. Louise shoots the rapist before he can go through with the act. Initially, she aims the gun at him and tell him to let her friend go. Of course, the use of the phallis, the gun, is already a flaw in the film. The women should be able to protect themselves without resorting to the oppressive tools of the patriarchy. When the rapist says something rude to Louise, she kills him. Now the women are in trouble.What follows is a Bonnie &amp; Clyde-like adventure across the southwest. While these types of films are enjoyable, they are, essentially, patriarchal fantasies. In one of the movie's more problematic story lines, Thelma goes to bed with a young Brad Pitt just a day or two after she is nearly raped. Any survivor of rape will tell you that's most likely not going to happen, even if it's Brad Pitt!The film builds the relationship between the women but never releases the latent homoerotic nature of their relationship. This is also a flaw.And, as stated, the women are not allowed to get away clean despite the fact that they wished none of the horrible things that happened to them on themselves.Oh, and Harvey Keitel is thrown in to appease all the uncomfortable men who still believe they are somehow not complicit in patriarchal oppression.For entertainment, this is a great movie. For political purposes, it fails tremendously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Feminine Road Trip Film That Is Worth The Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thelma &amp; Louise is a wonderful film about two best friends from Arkansas. Thelma (Geena Davis) is an unhappy stay-at-home wife and Louise (Sarandon) is a waitress. Thelma sneaks away from home without letting her husband know that she is going on vacation with Louise. The two girls end up getting into some unexpected trouble which forces them to become fugitives. Harvey Keitel is the cop who is trying to make a deal with the two girls. This film has both some funny moments as well as a few dark moments. The film could be considered a "feminist" film although I would not classify it as such a film. It is mostly just a fun film about two women escaping from a bad situation but only getting into more situations. As bad as things seem, Thelma &amp; Louise find the freedom they both have longed to find. The only real problem with "Thelma &amp; Louise" is that it deserves a better ending. Davis and Sarandon give top notch performances as do Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, and a young Brad Pitt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tale of Friendship and Freedom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thelma &amp; Louise is a take on the road-trip movie genre with one interesting difference, both of the protagonists are women. When you consider all of the films in this style, from 'Bonnie and Clyde' to 'Rain Man', this is the first time that we have followed the journey of two ordinary, working-class women. It puts a nice twist on a type of film that is usually full of twists itself. Adding to that is Ridley Scott, known for making technical marvels, trying his hand at something much more human and sensitive. The story follows our title characters as they break the shackles of their ordinary, dull lives and hit the road for a weekend of fun. Thelma is upbeat but na?ve and controlled by her overbearing husband Daryl, whereas Louise is much tougher and resourceful despite her relationship with a musician going nowhere fast. Both girls have large contrasts but they seem to fit together despite that. They're characters are well-formed and emotive, endearing because they feel like real people who are simply trying to break away from their repressive lives. Importantly their characters transform as they experience more and more. They have to rely on each other and they begin to take each other's characteristics as a result. Of course things are never that straight-forward and the women are soon on the run when they kill a would-be rapist. Pursued by the police, they decide to keep on moving forward whether that includes breaking the law or disrupting their romantic relationships. Callie Khouri's script already has two interesting leads, but the acting can't be underestimated. Both Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon inhabit these roles with all the passion and wit that you would be hoping for. They work together flawlessly which helps make their friendship seem all the more plausible. Sarandon especially stands tall given how she manages to capture the weariness and yearning of Louise whilst giving her relationship to the more innocent Thelma an almost motherly edge.Along the way the girls meet a handsome drifter played by Brad Pitt (in an enjoyable early performance) who soothes Thelma's sexual desires, but then robs them of all their money. Harvey Keitel is as solid as ever playing the detective how has sympathy for their plight. He doesn't want their situation to become increasingly worse. The issues with the film come with the male characters. Though Keitel's cop does come across as genuinely concerned his colleagues don't share his sentiment. Pitt's drifter basically lies and tricks them. Thelma's husband is overly bitter and aggressive towards her for little reason. Even Michael Madsen as Louise's boyfriend seems prone to lashing out rather than calmly resolving the issues. These male characters all seem to be edgy and hostile in some way. It's not to say they're badly played or totally unrealistic, but they all appear to against the women when there is little reason or logic for them to be.Scott is a visual master and he brings his A-Game here. For a filmmaker so used to neon colours and atmospheric murkiness, it's satisfying to see him visualise the dusty trails and open roads of Southern America. The opening credits scene is simply overlooking a long road leading to a canyon. Yet it's sheer scope and its vibrant blue sky makes it the perfect introduction. There's plenty of dusky Blues music to fit the scenery and it usually sits nicely alongside Hans Zimmer's score.Sadly I really have issues with the films ending. The idea itself is fine and it is a conclusion that we don't often see and I like how everything isn't wrapped in a neat little bow. Yet the film has hit its end point and screen just fades to white after just a few seconds. It is far too abrupt. After having spent so long with these characters, growing to care about them and seeing their journey change their lives in so many ways, it almost feels like we've been duped by such a hasty final shot. It doesn't completely derail the precision of the film, but it does help stop it from reaching the true heights it was so close to.Putting its ending and its portrayal of its male characters aside, I think Thelma &amp; Louise is a very enjoyable film that tackles subjects that aren't usually handled well and takes itself seriously. The title characters become memorable, in part due to a well written script and some wonderful acting from both actresses. It is mostly a film about friendship and freedom, something these two very different characters have in common. They escape the numbing grind of their everyday lives for something that lets them feel free, even if they break the law doing so. It's difficult not to at least appreciate a film that tells a story like this and even though it doesn't quite soar, there's still a great deal to admire about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful, memorable and engaging story about female friendship and liberation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my favorite 90's films. Commonly described as a feminist road movie, "Thelma and Louise" has some important and meaningful things to say about feminism and female friendship. A strong, bold screenplay Oscar winning screenplay matches up with two strong, engaging and fully believable Oscar nominated lead acting performances by Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis. Davis has the more fully realized character here, a small edge over Sarandon's character. The trio of women behind this film: writer Chali Khouri, along with actresses Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis make for a powerful, bold and engaging film. Visually stylish cinematography from director Ridley Scott (of "Blade Runner" fame). With a slow start, the film has a number of impactful moments when it kicks into higher gear, spread throughout the film. The weaknesses are few and the strengths are many in this memorable, bold film. It's ending may seem oversized to some, but it suites me just fine. Thelma and Louise keep their friendship real until the end. "Thelma and Louise" represents Chali Khouri's feature film screen writing debut.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who is afraid of Thelma &amp; Louise?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When last Friday my girlfriend suggested watching "Thelma &amp; Louise" together, I started sweating. I had been avoiding this film for a long time, mostly because of the feminist brouhaha that surrounds it. Yes, I had taken for granted that the film was a feminist manifesto, that it was about women empowerment and all the sort - just google "Thelma &amp; Louise" and discover by yourself what I'm intending to say.But the fact is that "Thelma &amp; Louise" is almost everything, but definitely NOT a feminist film. The main characters are two dumb persons who are not able to make sensible decisions. With a little effort the screenplay could be turned into a comedy, as the trailer suggested it was, but then the main characters should be men. The audience would not laugh at two stupid women doing stupid things and acting with rage and violence. Women are supposed to be smart and sensible; men are stupid, rough and impulsive.Under my opinion, "Thelma &amp; Louise" stands for "equality", in a broad and authentic sense. Never ever before this film was made, two women were depicted as dumb bastards, as men often are. Of course, there had been silly housewives in the movies, and mischievous heroines too. But for the very first time two women could be treated just as two cheap cowboys or two disgraced delinquents.What went wrong, then? How is it that two dumb housewives became two champions for a whole generation of feminists? Let's go a little further.Once stated that Thelma and Louise wouldn't be Tom and Lou, there was only one possibility left: the two women were entitled to be victims. So, almost by definition, all the male characters became villains. Here is where the feminist brouhaha started. And it all grew like a huge snowball.Somehow, the screenplay had the chance of being chosen by a great director as Ridley Scott (by the way, the Coens or Tarantino would be my best choice for a remake). Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis are simply magnificent in their characters. The film, beautifully shot, became a great success. And yes, the author of the screenplay got her Oscar. Her career seems to end here. Have you ever heard about (let me google it again) Callie Khouri? Nor did I, until I was interested in this film. Since then, she has written a lot... about "Thelma &amp; Louise", her great (and unique) success. It seems that Ms. Khouri has had time enough to think and re- think about her screenplay and about the reactions surrounding it. The feminist message (intended or not) seemed to work, at least on the surface. Let's feed the beast!SPOILERS AHEAD!Two friends, Thelma and Louise, set out in a convertible for a short vacation. Thelma is married to a man who treats her like a child. Thorough the film we shall discover that Thelma behaves indeed like a child and is unable to take care of herself in the way an adult would. For instance, she takes his husband's gun despite she doesn't know how to use it, so she lends it to Louise, believing that she will protect them both. Louise is older and works as a waitress. We are induced to think that she is the smart one, but eventually we'll discover that she is as dumb as the other woman.When they stop for a drink in a roadhouse, Thelma dances with a guy they've just met. They both get drunk and go out to the parking lot. Thelma seems not to be aware that he intends to have sex with her. When she refuses, he slaps her and attempts to rape her. Fortunately, Thelma appears with her gun and scares him. The drunk man stops, but as the two women go away he insults them. Unfortunately now, Louise loses her temper and shots him to death. Twice. The murderer decides to fly away from the police and Thelma follows her. Eventually we discover that she finds it exciting and behaves childish in order to improve the "adventure". When Louise lies to her boyfriend and manages to convince him to risk his life to help her (he is a convict under parole and shouldn't be caught helping an outlaw), Thelma leaves a stranger alone with Louise's life savings in her motel room. Even when the man steals the money Thelma doesn't realize she's done wrong. Instead of leaving Thelma (the cause of all her trouble), Louise lets her "take care of the situation", which means robbing a convenience store in the first place. It seems Thelma takes her chance to become a criminal, too.They continue acting in the most stupid way. Instead of surrendering to the police while they are not still charged with murder, they keep flying away in the very same car. Though they intend to go to Mexico, incredibly they avoid Texas (we learn that something bad happened to Louise somewhere in Texas, but it would be advisable to avoid just the town when it happened, not the whole State). They keep overreacting with violence; instead of throwing the accusing gun away, they keep using it. They lock a policeman in a car trunk in the middle of the desert and make a truck explode just because the driver insulted them (twice; the first time as they casually passed him, the second time when they sought for it). Well, it's not the best way to hide from the police.In the end, rather than be captured by the police and face their responsibilities, they decide to drive off the Grand Canyon. We assume that they intend to commit suicide, but as it is Thelma who suggests to "keep going", perhaps she believes that the car can fly. Unfortunately the film ends here and we'll never know if the two women managed to escape. Finis.</fullReview>

I began to watch this film with the worst intentions. however was utterly surprised.I loved the character development of Thelma and Louise. and even the side characters of Madsen, Keitel and Pitt were all fantastic too. they all felt human and showed true raw human emotion. This film oddly reminds me of "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest" because of its great ability to make you feel happy and sad, there are very few films that can do this for me, and when it does it makes the happy bits better and the sad times sadder.This film may not look it, but it is great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Thelma and Louise" is all and none of the things as which it has been described. It is about the friendship between two women, about female independence and male sexism, but it is neither a simple "chick flick" nor a monument to feminism (although I have to admit that watching it can have an almost therapeutic effect when you've just about "had it" again with the male slightly-less-than-half of society). Most of the men that Thelma and Louise encounter are two-dimensional cartoon characters, but "Reservoir Dogs" and perpetual tough guys Harvey Keitel and Michael Madsen (of all people) are cast against stereotype. The movie also features some absolutely stunning pictures of the Southwestern scenery and mostly takes place on the road, but it is not just a "road movie" (feminist or otherwise). More than anything, this is a movie about the things that shape the way we are, and about the consequences of our actions. Had Thelma learned to use her brain before and not after their encounter with Harlan the rapist, she would have seen him for what he was and avoided him from the start. Had Louise not been raped herself, she would probably not have shot Harlan at being provoked by him, after the self-defense situation was already over. Impulse? Fate? Justifiable homicide? Hardly. Thoroughly understandable? Absolutely, at least from a woman's point of view.But above all else, it's a movie about two humans getting caught up in a maddening spiral of events that have taken on a life of their own - a perfect parable for what's happening all over the world, day in and day out. You set something in motion and from that moment on it's beyond your control. Thelma and Louise's only "triumph" is their acknowledgment that they have done this to themselves. They don't say so of course; but their final action says it for them. The plot could've also been one dimensional and uninteresting, but writer Callie Khouri again made of sparkle with inventive sequences, a solid mix of action, laughter and drama, and crackling dialogue. And the direction by cinematic director Ridley Scott is audacious. The last sequence is one of the most beautiful images in cinema, and it brought a bit of a tear to my eye. Whilst there are some laughs along the way to endure (such as the pair blowing up a foul-mouthed van drivers vehicle up), Thelma And Louise stands as a compelling and riveting drama.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The two leading ladies Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis looked absolutely stunning in the movie. I loved how their relationship became stronger and stronger to get away from the police and their other 'lovers'. I found the rape scene was really intense and sick, it does show how Sexual assault affects individuals mental health. I was really glad that Sarandon's character shot him because he was such a sick pervert. Unfortunately it isn't easy as that, there are a lot of Jimmy Saviles all over the world and it just makes your heart break when you always see it on the news. What a bad world we live in!Even though I liked the film, I really thought it was dragging on. Maybe if it was one hour and 40 minutes long, that would be better!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my all-time favorite films, absolute perfection! Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon are absolutely incredible in their roles, they were totally deserving of those Oscar nominations. This movie has so much heart and soul and emotion packed in it, I cry almost every time I watch it. Screenplay and the script and the dialogue between the well-written characters is absolutely amazing! I Cannot even begin to describe the acting and how spot on every actor is with their performance. This movie is in my top five favorite movies of all time just because it's so well-made and well written! Brad Pitt does a great job and his role as well, I really enjoyed the way he portrayed his character. Everything about this movie is exactly how it should be, it's entertaining, it's thrilling, it has good action sequences, it has some romance in it, and it really truly captures the meaning of true friendship. If this movie doesn't make you cry, then nothing will. If you decide to watch this movie, then I can guarantee that you will not be disappointed! It's really a movie to watch with your best friend. I'm so glad the Academy decided to recognize this masterpiece. I will not spoil the ending, but the ending is so clever and moving and touching, and I love it! 10/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridley Scott Goes Tarantino</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised to find out that this is not based on real life events. People tend to talk about this film and these two women in a way that makes them seem real. They get mentioned a lot along with Bonnie and Clyde or the Wild Bunch. As if they were real, which is a huge vote for the film's advantage. Though I'm not exactly surprised that many people might be operating under the same assumption as I was. Because the whole film has a feel of real life to it. The way the events play out, the natural progression of conclusions and happenings, seems so logically random that it could very well have happened.As for the film as cinema, it's very good. The best way to describe the style would be to say that it's Ridley Scott emulating Quentin Tarantino. Though, perhaps that's simply because the film has Michael Madsen and Harvey Keitel. That always helps. Nevertheless, it has a really good grasp on the classic Americana style, with great love for open roads, gas stations, bars, stetsons and sheriffs.But, what really makes the film work are the two leading actresses. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon are both fantastic as Thelma and Louise, respectively. Both are given very good, fetching characters, but what I really like is how they evolve during the course of the film. Initially Thelma is the meeker one, while Louise has a more aggressive attitude towards life in general. But, both have their high and low points, and when they are low, the other is able to pick up the slack and keep them going, both in their own way. Two beautiful characters and the perfect duo.Thelma &amp; Louise is a great film to check out if you like Americana, crime duos, excellent drama with a good sense of humour, chases, strong female characters or just fine cinema in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An iconic film about friendship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie for everyone, not just women. I don't understand why a movie that stars mostly white males, like 'The Right Stuff', is expected to be enjoyed by everyone including women, but when the leads are women only other women are expected to enjoy it. I am NOT white male bashing here, it's just that the assumption is annoying. Having said that, this is a movie that does speak to women in a way that men can't comprehend. I have had the pleasure of seeing with other women who are watching this for the first time, and the reaction has been powerful without exception. On to the movie.Many women were considered for these roles, including Jodie Foster and Jessica Lange. These were parts that many women in Hollywood instinctively knew were incredible. Callie Khouri, the script writer, said she thought of the entire movie in one night and just wrote it down, like taking dictation. Geena Davis originally wanted to be Louise, and pleaded with the director Ridley Scott to try and get the part. When Susan Sarandon auditioned, Geena thought to herself, "Oh, that's Louse. She had such a commanding, self-assured presence, I thought 'what was I thinking?'" Callie originally didn't want Ridley, she didn't believe a male director could pull it off. He reminded her of another visionary movie that he made, Alien, featuring Sigourney Weaver as the lead. She agreed. The rest is history.There are many great scenes in this film, but my favorite are two scenes in sequence. It is night, and they have just passed a truck driver they have scene repeatedly, he is an ass. Cut to the daytime, Thelma is a bit toasted, and starts laughing and talking about how it was hilarious how Louise blew away her rapist. Louise says 'Thelma, that's not funny''. Thelma says that's what happened to you, right? In Texas? Louise forcefully tells her to mind her own business. Thelma submissively complies. Earlier, Thelma had robbed a store with great authority, and now we wonder, if anything has really changed. Throughout the journey, it is Louise that has carried the naive non-streetwise Thelma. They soon get stopped by a cop for speeding. This is bad. They'll be taken in when he finds out they're fugitives. He takes Louise to his car and has her sit in the front seat. As he picks up his radio, Thelma intervenes, with a gun. The look on Louise's face says it all, Thelma has been transformed. The best line of the movie is spoken here. The officer pleads with Thelma before he is forced into the trunk, Thinking he is about to get killed he says ' Please I have a wife and kids!" Thelma says 'You do? Well, you're lucky. You be sweet to them, especially your wife. My husband wasn't sweet to me, and look how I turned out.' Brilliant scenes.This project had many powerful supporting members. From the nice score by Hans Zimmer, to the powerful performance by Harvey Keitel, everyone chosen for the project was excellent at what they did. But that does not matter if the lead actors don't have it. And at that point in time, in this movie, it was Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis that made this movie an icon. No one else could have pulled it off.The only quibbles I have with this movie is the choice of music. Not the score, which is quite beautiful and evocative of the American Southwest, but the songs they chose. It does not stand the test of time, very cheesy 80's music, which I hate with a passion. Other than that, watch this movie, and enjoy the ride.BTW, ever since IMDb went to their new system of logging in, I have been unable to, and had to re-register. I have been a member since 2007 under 'abbywts', but now have to start all over. Thanks for nothing IMDb. Way to invade privacy.

		<fullReview>"Thelma &amp; Louise" makes for one of your better road movies (to say the least), but the real jewel in this crown is the heavy-duty bond between these two women. Both are well cast and they play off of each other well, but they're layered characters, and the story grows ever more interesting the deeper in trouble they find themselves. Their thirst for freedom is what really lends this movie its impact. There's en undeniable feminist streak running through this film - an outlaw awakening - but what's nice is that the message doesn't usurp the entertainment. It's not such a cut-and-dried "men are sleaze" platform (Keitel and Madsen are sympathetic males). This is really a buddy movie at heart.And a good one.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thelma &amp; Louise, R. I. P. It's almost 25 years since "Thelma &amp; Louise" hit the big screen in May 1991and instantly became a hit, with sublimely paired performances by Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis. Callie Khouri won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. T&amp;L has big bawdy action, two all-American rough-and-ready heroines? Sarandon shoots the bad guy in the chest, just like that, a righteous shoot if ever there was one?and a searing final scene that tears your heart out. T&amp;L is crazy and unbelievable, with a sophomoric silliness about the plot twists, and the spectacular you-didn't-see-it-coming ending that defies straight thinking. I think T&amp;L is a captivating invitation to do some serious out-of- the-box sympathizing with two women who finally get some potent excitement in their lives, who are tired of getting the crappy end of the stick, who know with depressing exactitude just exactly where they were going right and just exactly where they went wrong, who understand that Harvey the cop wants to help them, who realize that the only help they're going to get is from each other, who finally understand that holding hands and pedal-to-the-metal is as good as it gets?. I think "Thelma &amp; Louise" demands respect, I think it gives every viewer a chance to think hard about what's-good-in-my-life, I think it opens a window for every viewer to imagine what it would be like to finally have it all, with someone you love, if ever so briefly, even in mid-air?.

		<shortDescription>Ridley Scott directs some of the best performances of the 90s from his stellar cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thelma and Louise is one of those movies you know a lot about going in. Its been heavily parodied for its iconic scenes, most notably by the Simpsons episode "Marge on the Lam" and pretty much everyone knows how it ends going in. But just like other iconic 90s movies with well known endings - The Usual Suspects, The Silence of the Lambs, Titanic - its the journey to the final act that makes the film so enjoyable, and renders surprise at the ending unnecessary.This is a significantly unusual film for Ridley Scott, director of action/sci-fi blockbusters like Alien, Black Hawk Down and Gladiator. But it earned him one of his Best Director nods (a lone one, as the film didn't earn a Best Picture nod) and I am satisfied that he deserved it. If the job of a director is to get the best performances out of his cast, then he does a hell of a job (more on that later). The film is well-paced, the shots are amazing and the artistic choices are perfect. I loved the film's cinematography and editing, the beautiful shots especially in the Grand Canyon at the film's conclusion. That one shot of the Thunderbird blasting across the sand with dozens of police cars in hot pursuit is iconic for a reason, it really is a beautiful shot. Scott does a remarkable job with his juxtapositions throughout the film. The two ladies flee the scene of a crime and Louise chides Thelma for littering. The two ladies lock a state policeman in the trunk of his car, apologising politely for doing so. It makes for some very funny moments in what is essentially a crime drama, and all credit is due to both Scott and Khouri (writer of the Oscar-winning screenplay).But the director's main job is to get strong performances out of his cast, and he does wonders for Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis. We mark the differences between the two women at the start, and thanks to some wonderful chemistry and the direction that Scott takes them, they grow more and more similar. Take a look at the poster. If you are like me, you have to double check which is Sarandon and which is Davis. But at the beginning of the film, you'd never know that. They are worlds apart - Davis is a prim, pristine dresser lugging bags and bags of ziplocked clothing, whilst Louise is a chain-smoking, messy packing waitress who bundles it in and damn the consequences. Thelma's baptism by fire (the distrust of men and her run ins with the law) brings her closer to Louise, allowing her to think and act at times where Louise cannot. By the end of the film, Thelma has ditched her pristine clothes for a baggy, dusty singlet, and is sucking down cigarettes and alcohol just like Louise. Similarly, Louise's reconciliation with her loyal boyfriend Jimmy makes her realise than men aren't all as evil as she thought. The best part of this film is that with little effort at all, you don't know which of the ladies is the stronger one, nor do you know which one is running and which one is following. Halfway through, Thelma asks Louise not to run out on her, mirroring the exact question Louise had posed to Thelma at the beginning of their problems. Its a remarkable performance by Davis - sexy, gentle, fiery and cheerful - and in my opinion, she is the most impressive of the cast. Were it not for Jodie Foster's iconic performance that year in The Silence of the Lambs, Davis would have a second Oscar on her shelf. Sarandon is brilliant in this film as well, in a less showy but no less impressive role. You can see the hurt bubbling below the surface and the hatred and distrust of all men that motivates her actions. The rest of the cast is also great - Brad Pitt is easily charming and more than a little arrogant, drawing the audience into trusting him just as he seduces Thelma. Timothy Carhart is essential as Harlan - another example of Scott's direction, Carhart's aggressive body language during his dances with Thelma foreshadow what is soon to come. Twist my arm for a weakness, and I'll say Michael Madsen's Jimmy, who flopped back and forth to suit what the script needed him for. Many point to Thelma &amp; Louise as the quintessential feminist film. I have to agree, and would far prefer people to use these two as feminist icons than Danaerys Targaryen. The film does a great job of being pro-women without being anti-men. It shows two women who are very capable of looking out for each other and themselves when all the men in their lives are lazy, stupid or mean. I feel that the character of Hal (Harvey Keitel) was a vital one, despite his non-showy role, to keep the film from being grossly biased in its depiction of men. The final shot, with Hal desperately sprinting to save them, is a beautiful moment for all - he wanted to save them, but they'd already decided to save themselves. Thelma &amp; Louise is a film I kept on putting off watching, but I'm very glad I now have. You could write essays upon essays on the themes and transformations of this film. I finally find faith in Ridley Scott's abilities as a director, and the acting performances of Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis will go down in the history books.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being such an iconic film and a poster film for strong female characters, I was glad to see that Thelma &amp; Louise was a great film after all. With plenty of great performances, one killer and unique Hans Zimmer soundtrack, and a road trip for the century, Thelma &amp; Louise is definitely one of the defining films of the 90's and of the past half century. Not to mention the fact that it has one of the most, if not the most iconic selfie of all time. I'm pretty sure they started it all. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon star as two women who want to temporarily escape their simplistic lives and get away for a weekend. When one of them has a little too much fun, chaos ensues and suddenly they are fugitives.I don't think it's a problem to draw comparisons to other buddy films, but make no mistake, this isn't your prototypical buddy film, there is plenty of harsh realism on display. Our protagonists aren't your clichéd heroes that do no wrong. Thelma and Louise both do plenty of wrong, and guess what, it actually takes a toll on them. We don't find them blinded by the lifestyle, although they do have quite a lot of fun, but all of it impacts them significantly. Often we see tears and stress hinder their ability to keep driving, but they had no choice. I think it was great that this film not only gave us great characters, but it also played on the stereotypes and gender issues we have today. The reality is that a lot of people wouldn't believe that Thelma was being raped. It happens oh too often still to this day nearly 25 years ago. It's hard to imagine a time when women are finally treated the same as men, but hopefully one day.I also really enjoyed the performances of Brad Pitt and Michael Madsen. For Pitt, it was early on in his career, and he was no doubt doing a completely different role. I'm pretty sure it was the beginning of the Pitt madness of the 90's, but I thought this was more a showcase of his acting talent than anything else. Of course, he also served the role of duping the girls at one point, but I was glad to see in the end, the girls weren't really duped so much as they were let free. The last shot of the film, although definitely controversial, to me was a symbol of just being free to make your own choices. These two women were sick and tired of being controlled and told what to do from their husbands, and this road trip served as a getaway not just for the weekend, but for good. The only real problem I have with the movie was at times I felt the balance between drama and comedy was shaky. I know it can be a satire, but I almost would have liked a more straight drama with comedy sprinkled in then a balance of the two. Don't get me wrong though, this film is quite the ride.+Strong female leads +Their actions take a toll on them +Realistic characters +Pitt &amp; Madsen's supporting roles -Too much comedy at times8.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the build up in this movie, or as Thelma calls it: "snowballing". From the moment the car leaves the drive way you can tell that these girls have both a conservative side and a radical side, and the movie explores the transitioning from one to the other.Something bugged me about the ending. While I had been spoiled the final outcome, and the movie does prepare you for it, I still thought the last conversation they have before the movie is over was a bit off. Maybe it would have been better if they had looked at each other knowingly? Or would that be the easy way of solving it? I don't know.As you'd expect from a movie made 20 years ago, it does seem a bit dated - but at the same time, I can't see this movie being made today.Oh, and great performances from the cast.

		<shortDescription>An Effective Mixture of 'Fun' &amp; 'Serious'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surprisingly, I didn't actually know anything in particular about this film when going into it, the only thing I was aware of was the fact that this film apparently evoked 'female empowerment' and arguably feminist-related views. This initially made me slightly doubtful about the film as a whole, predominantly due to the fact that every "feminist" I have ever encountered in real life clearly didn't know what "equality" stood for, and therefore I was expecting a somewhat weak plot line and a biased representation of characters (e.g. following the formula of featuring only 'misogynistic males' and 'misunderstood females'). Fortunately, the film does not take this specific route; it instead explores both genders in a respectful manner and furthermore features many more perks which made it utterly enjoyable and unexpectedly compelling.Many elements of this film worked wonderfully for me, mostly the characters and their respective 'quests' and mishaps, as well as of course the journey of our two female protagonists and their 'adventures'. Every occurrence or character action/motive is dealt with either a serious and thought-provoking approach, or with a somewhat "silly" and at times genuinely funny approach. Surprisingly, this unusual blend actually works, which is especially surprising as I personally prefer a completely serious approach to important issues represented in film. Additionally, the film is aesthetically pleasing with convincing sets and gorgeous locations throughout, which... is technically one of those features that every road trip movie MUST get right, and this one certainly does. Furthermore, it truly felt like an 80's film, with its delightful, well-fitted and captivating soundtrack, as well as certain scenes creating abrupt yet very effective comedy. Therefore, the film supplied me with a very entertaining and light-hearted tone throughout, whilst simultaneously providing social commentary (in terms of equality for women) in an appropriate manner. The fact 'Thelma &amp; Louise' genuinely felt evocative of the 80s (or at least very early 90s) arguably made the film even more enjoyable for me.There are a few minor negative aspects, but they are so insignificant that they never actually distract from the character or plot development... these are basically 'nitpicks'. There are potentially one or two scenes in which Geena Davis' acting felt unconvincing, there is one scene which felt slightly forced only to further expand on the social commentary, and Michael Madsen's character seemed to lack exposition. However, despite the nitpicking, it's safe to say that all of the acting maintained a great standard throughout, and all of the characters contributed to the film's entertainment value significantly. To conclude, 'Thelma &amp; Louise' is an impressively crafted film that effectively blends 'seriousness' with 'fun' whilst never distracting from the film's plot OR overall message/social commentary. It is simultaneously an incredibly enjoyable and thought-provoking film with stellar performances all-round, I highly recommend it to everyone.</fullReview>

But there is a lot to like in this movie, not least some great performances, and possibly the first "selfie" in the movies.Plot in A Paragraph: Louise (Susan Sarandon) is working in a diner as a waitress and has some problems with her musician boyfriend Jimmy (Michael Madsen) who is always on the road. Thelma (Geena Davis) is married to Darryl (Christopher McDonald) who likes his wife to stay quiet in the kitchen so that he can watch football on TV. One day they decide to break out of their normal life and jump in the car and hit the road. Their fun journey, turns dark when Louise kills a man who tries to rape Thelma. This is a well directed movie with a great score. Both Susan Surandon and Geena Davis giving the performance of their careers, and can both consider themselves unlucky to lose the best actress Oscar to Jodie Foster (for her, in my opinion, over rated turn in "Silence Of The Lambs") and I was surprised Harvey Keitel (The only decent male character in the movie) was not even nominated. Christopher McDonald is perfectly cast as the domineering chauvinistic husband whilst Brad Pitt shows his early promise and takes his first big step towards superstardom in his scene stealing performance as J.D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thelma &amp; Louise: Feminist sexual fantasy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bought the movie from a pile of discount DVDs as the name carried some good reputation. I was expecting a crime flick in the style of Bonnie and Clyde, but the film proved a great disappointment.First of all, Thelma and Louise might have been striking if it had been filmed in 1960's. However, for the modern times, with all expressed consent legislation and no means no laws, the premise that law enforcement would not believe a woman's claim of having been raped is simply not at all believable. The burden of proving innocence lies solely on the man. Nevertheless, this supposed female oppression forms the basic premise of the film. Unfortunately it does not simply work anymore in a legal system dominated by feminism.Rather than from the point of victimhood, the movie should be in my opinion seen as a feminist fantasy of violence and sexuality. From the point of the shooting onwards the movie tears away from realism. The two deepest wishes of the women are fulfilled: Louise is asked the question and offered the ring by her long time boyfriend, and Thelma befriends a young and exciting bad boy hitchhiker, having great sex with him. With their emancipation from the conventional bounds of morality the women actualize their deepest dreams and desires. This part of the movie ends at the hotel breakfast, where Louise, after having said goodbyes to her boyfriend, is described by the waiter as almost as hot as to set the room on fire, receives Thelma who glows with satisfaction having been "properly f**ked" for the first time in her life.However, after a peak experience like this, normal life with a passive aggressive beta husband seems such a bleak choice that for Thelma there is no longer turning back. The decision to continue the life of violence is made at this point, when Thelma decides to emulate the exciting bad boy criminal and rob a store. There is no longer any convenient explanation or justification for the deeds of the women. Their circle of violence and depravity escalates with drunk driving, speeding, an attack against a police officer, and finally blowing up a truck the driver of which made unpleasant sexual gestures towards them. The inevitability of their choice and rejection of ordinary life culminates in the final drive to the canyon.If one wishes to see Thelma and Louise as a feminist flick, however, it does not give a very good picture of the qualities of women. Thelma and Louise suffer from a total lack of control in their life decisions. Every problem they face in the film is caused by their own mistakes: Too early and unconsidered marriage, excessive drinking and flirting, lack of emotional control in the shooting, inability to assess the situation and report the rape charge to the police, when all the signs of violence and blood are still visible, leaving a considerable amount of money unguarded in a room with a confessed robber, resorting to criminal activities to get money, phoning the police while knowing that the call is being traced etc. So, rather than looking at the movie as a depiction of female victimhood in the hands of an oppressive society, one might look at the movie as a comprehensive critique of modern womanhood which refuses to accept accountability and responsibility and escapes in a dreamworld, finally rejecting all reality even up to the point of driving to a canyon. However, the problem with this outlook is that the main characters are not very pleasant to follow. Their stupid and irresponsible decisions one after another mainly raise furor in the viewer. The best redeeming quality of the film is the scenery, which is absolutely fantastic, but is is not enough to raise the film to the position of a classic which has been attributed to it. Therefore I'm giving it an IMDb score of 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

Their journey, however, turns into a flight when Louise kills a man who threatens to rape Thelma. They decide to go to Mexico, but soon they are hunted by American police. This original story is one that tests the bounds of freedom and happiness. "Thelma &amp; Louise" is a sweet and cheerful film that fails at the end and drags on a little too long but will keep you completely entertained and if you have an analytic mind it will call you to decide if your life is fulfilled and free. First off, Susan Sarandon and Gena Davis have wonderful chemistry together and work beautifully here. Both of them give dramatic and funny performances to portray ordinary women stuck in their lives. At times they also have fun with their roles. Ridley Scott directs this fun film with a fun energy to it. He doesn't make it seem too realistic, but visually tells a good story that writer Callie Khouri would be proud of. She creates a dazzling original story that not many writers would think of. If it were little more violent it would feel like a Tarantino flick. Khouri develops Thelma and Louise well at first, but once they hit the road she doesn't quite make us grasp for them due to carrying on the story a little too long. It's still a great story. The film overall tests us to ask ourselves if we're satisfied with life and how in order to survive in this world you must be happy and have friendship.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feminists on the road</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I generally like the on-the-road genre of movies and this film did not disappoint me. It is very feminist, perhaps more than necessary but I like the plot, the camera shots and the play of the two actresses. Their growing self-confidence and their determination to regain their dignity and their own lives even at the cost of death is something that is shown very well, in a convincing way. There is no happy-end, but because of their heroic struggle, I was not depressed at the end. What I did not like was that the tempo was too slow in the first half of the film. And somehow the introduction to the whole story is too long. Also, I think that the film would have been much better if the two leading characters had been more intelligent and deeper. They are too shallow and superficial and this prevents their drama to reach its full potential. In this way the movie becomes less dramatic?this is my point. And probably because of this, the authors have put car chases which are out-of-place in this film. Because this is not an action and should not be! The scene when Louise gives her jewelries to an unknown old man, without the two exchanging even a word struck me as artificial and totally cut off from the plot. There are other small weaknesses but in all, it is a good, moving film which is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a pretty good self-defense movie where friends Thelma (Geena Davis) and Louise (Susan Sarandon) go on a weekend getaway they will never forget. In protecting Thelma, Louise shoots crook Harlan (Timothy Carhart) for attempting to rape Thelma. Due to the incriminating circumstances, Thelma and Louise attempt to escape from the pursuing authorities.Callie Khouri's Oscar-winning story provided a lot of excitement and thrills for this countryside-setting movie, making the audience captivated by the endurance and perseverance of Thelma and Louise as they banded together to deal with the overwhelming odds against them and rediscovering the strength of their friendship. Alien director Ridley Scott directed a nice piece of work filled with misadventures, drama and some memorable actors, including a young Brad Pitt.Overall, it's a powerful film showing the bonds of friendship and the complicating circumstances of self-defense.Grade B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome movie, and not worthy of the criticisms!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I happen to adore this movie. The scenery alone made me want to explore the American South West, and the transformation of Gina Davis from docile housewife to adventure seeker is simply something to behold; I've never seen her so radiant. If I got nothing else out of this movie, that would have been enough. But the film is also extremely funny; how can you not love the scene where Gina says " ... I just feel like I got a knack for this sh*t" after robbing the store? Sure, her husband is a caricature, but he's as funny as hell. Keitel is understated, and the other cop (Tobolowsky) is delightful. The car is beautifully presented (yes, even the car is a star...), and the road scenes are outstanding. I personally think the 'truck driver' scene is over the top, but it's a bit of light relief. So why do some people hate this movie? Beats me ... I'm a 55 year old guy and love it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Louise (Susan Sarandon) is a diner waitress. She takes her friend housewife Thelma (Geena Davis) to a nice quiet cabin that belongs to her manager. When a slick cowboy tries to violently rape Thelma at a truck stop, Louise takes matters into her own hands. This sets off a chain of events that ends with the iconic leap over the cliff.This is a road trip through the beer-swilling football-watching truck-loving underclass of the American south. Director Ridley Scott expertly films the action and the landscape. Davis and Sarandon provide the chemistry. It's a dark take on the traditional buddy road movie. Harvey Keitel plays the police detective Hal investigating the murder. It has since become notable for Brad Pitt's big breakout role as the hustler JD.There is some action but it's not a big action movie. This is really a buddy movie between the girls. Their friendship is where the big action is. There are slow sections in this movie. But the superior actors make it worthwhile. And Geena Davis has some hilarious moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excuse my repeated use of the adjective "Iconic" but this movie contains several characters that have become just that. The women, the last scene, Brad Pitt's sex scene, even the car are film and cultural legends. Few movies create iconic characters that become part of our lexicon but, when people say someone is a "Thelma" or a "Louise" or they are a "Thelma and Louise" you know exactly what they mean. The last scene is iconic cinema if there ever was. You definitely don't want to pull a "Thelma and Louise" in your car! Brad Pitt exploded onto the scene in this film and he has been a sex symbol ever since. I re-watched Thelma and Louise nearly twenty years after its release and it was as poignant and funny as it ever was. If you have never seen this movie then by all means help yourself to a chunk of American culture and if you haven't seen it for a while then watch again, it has aged pretty darn well. (Warning: guys with fragile male egos often hate this movie.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't expect this movie to be this good. At the beginning it had sparks though, i really felt this 90s feeling. They caught the viewers by their hand, you had this constant feeling that you wanted to watch every scene in the movie, it was always interesting and had something, like comfortable sounds, music, character, fights, sex scenes, it never got boring. The story went like a straight line, it got somewhere, not taking detours. This movie was about two girls, one who seemed to be a housewife with an asshole husband who mistreated here (Didn't get the impression he physically abused her) but was never home, worked a lot and we rude to her). The other girl was a very distant girl who seemed odd and had been through something bad, it's safe to say that both were unhappy until this trip turned their lives around, at first it was bad, they felt remorse and anxiety but as time went on they started to get used to the "wild life" and just being open minded and lived for the moment and developed a very close and open friendship in the end. I actually kinda knew how it was going to end (Thank you Simpsons for that episode who you copied from this movie) but thought the ending was perfect, emotional and they chose to end things on their own term.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Often thrilling, but the melodrama holds it back. Sarandon shines.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It feels like Thelma &amp; Louise's reputation precedes the film itself. It's another iconic film from the 1990s that I knew more from parodies and references. When I finally looked it up several years ago while I was getting into film, it surprised me that it was directed by Ridley Scott and starred Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon. While their identities are clearly on the film, the characters and themes seem to have transcended the stars' reputations. Scott's trademarks are definitely imprinted firmly here with his kinetic style of editing, great soundtrack and the humid cinematography where you can feel the heat from the screen. It's surprisingly cinematic. Unfortunately with two protagonists the story does go back and forth more than I'd like it to and it has a heavy melodrama that's involving but often too melancholic and this mood holds the film back quite a lot. The story does have its hits though and the best scenes involve Thelma and Louise's transformation such as when they apologetically put a cop in his trunk while they drive away. While Davis and Sarandon do share the film, Sarandon is the real highlight and gives a brilliant performance that feels truly genuine.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a movie one would expect of Ridley Scott</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen most of other Ridley Scott movies, it is quite surprising he has made this. It is a perfect case study for movie students with its highly structured screenplay, hardly any innovation or experimentation (theme maybe new for its time but my point is on execution), template characters and a highly predictable but a perfect end.Thelma (Geena Davis) and Louise (Susan Sarandon) are friends but leading un-fulfilling lives. One day they go on a weekend vacation where things go horribly wrong after a dreadful incident. When they realize they have nothing meaningful to go back to, they become fugitives suspected for a murder and decide to take the road to Mexico. New acquaintances, an obsessed police detective on pursuit and some amateur mistakes make them reachable by the had of law. Watch the movie to know if they surrender meekly or take the fight back to the law though most of you know what happened to them even if you had not seen it.Never a fan of Geena Davis but she is quite a charmer in this. Susan Sarandon is always a good actor and she sleepwalks through this template character. Though there were many other movies of a similar genre like Butch Cassidy..., Bonnie and Clyde etc, it fills the periodical slot for the insatiable demand for such movies by audience. It may have worked for the time, but I felt the dialogues, screenplay, background score etc felt too generic to stay back in my mind after watching the movie, though I loved the subtle camera work.Not a movie one would expect of Ridley Scott, but being a great talent he is - made this too look quite interesting.</fullReview>

But when someone tries to rape Thelma, Louise kills her. And so they become fugitives of the law as they try and escape to Mexico.I found Thelma and Louise to be too much of a commercial film for me to love. But besides that, it does have a lot of memorable scenes and I did quite enjoy it. The acting was great from both Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis. I felt Michael Madsen was out of place and didn't suit the character, Harvey Keitel's accent was pretty brutal and I felt they over exploited Brad Pitt. As much as I like all three actors, and I really do, I felt they didn't quite fit the film.I thought the film was good. I quite enjoyed watching it and, as I said, it does have a lot of memorable scenes. It's well directed and well written. But I felt, it got too many Oscar nominations. It was good, but not that good. It progresses along nice and smoothly and always keeps your interest. The ending was pretty good and their was a few mildly amusing scenes. A solid 7/10.</fullReview>

Other than that, it doesn't plow any new ground, but the Oscar-winning script by Khouri is an entertaining mixture of action, drama, and comedy. As the renegade duo, Sarandon and Davis are terrific not only individually but also playing off each other. As a hunky hitchhiker, Pitt makes an impression, showing flashes of his impending stardom. In a departure from his usual weirdo roles during this period, Keitel plays a likable cop. Although he doesn't do anything exceptional, Scott provides steady direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a road movie with a sizable dollop of feminism thrown in which, judging from the comments here, produces a very mixed response in viewers. The general theme appeared first and best in "Vanishing Point" (1971) but there is plenty of originality with this. The screenplay is pretty good although I have a problem with Louise shooting the would-be rapist simply because he was insulting her - surely while holding him at gunpoint she would get Thelma to call the police? You don't just shoot people because you don't like them. And things get silly at the end, but not irritatingly so. The car, a 1966 Ford Thunderbird, is one of the nicest looking from the 1960s, I cringe at the thought of any of them being wrecked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thelma and Louise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thelma and Louise innocently begins with two best friends and their plan to spend the weekend together. This drastically changes as the twosome become wanted criminals. A major concern of this movie is challenging gender roles. When the girls are first at the bar, the waitress is sure they were not associated with the murder because she says those two nice women were not the murdering type. This is implying that murdering is only a men's job. The treatment of Thelma from her husband Darrel exemplifies the existing role of the woman in the household. She is believed to only cook and work for her husband. Thelma's actions crush this stereotype as she becomes an independent woman and even commits a burglary. Most of the men in the movie are poorly portrayed. There is the obscene truck driver, the rapist, the neglecting Darrel and the pathetic cop. This movie successfully challenges the existing gender roles in society and closes the gap between men and women.</fullReview>

I enjoyed watching the two interact and how Geena Davis' Thema broke out of her shell and dramatically changed from the beginning to the end. From a submissive wife to a smoking, drinking wild woman. I also enjoyed Susan Sarandon's Louise and how she mothered Thelma and how in the end their roles had become equal if not switched. The explicit scenes were well done in that they showed just enough to get a rise out of audience but not to offend them. As an audience member I felt that the end of the first explicit scene was just the way it should've been and that I would have taken the same action as Louise. I also enjoyed the scenes with Brad Pitt. Who wouldn't?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How many tough female characters can you think of, in cinema history? If we're judging on 'action' and not REaction, then I could probably count mine on the fingers of one hand. Thelma and/or Louise would have to be included in and amongst them... Don't any guys be fooled into brushing it off as a 'chick flick', though, as the male characters are just as important to the story; and, in a pleasing surprise, not ALL unsympathetic scumbags - as I had half expected before I viewed... The whole thing demonstrates how women should be treated as equals. If you're a guy who doesn't think this already, it seems perfectly obvious to me that you have more problems than a film can fix, so you shouldn't be watching this in the first place...The ending isn't the only thing about this that's iconic (perhaps Brad Pitt, amongst other things, for you ladies!) and to accomplish the feat of connecting so resoundingly within only a decade and a half is extraordinary in itself. Some may wish for a more 'just' resolution, but both female characters realise that after the change, there's no going back...The movie never slows for scenes of quiet introspection about this 'bond' that they share, so I say this movie is less about friendship, and more about the extraordinary human resistance to hardship - given the obstacles that both women as individuals have to overcome. There will be those who shout: 'Girl Power'; but such dogged tenacity can be an inspiration to EITHER sex, and both Kietel and Madsen - in heartening 'sympathetic' roles - underline just what good can come from an understanding disposition...In a film like this, the dynamic between the two female leads should be a shoe-in for most eye-catching element; indeed, in most other films, it would be, as two great actresses do excellent work. Special mention to Ridley Scott, then, for managing to steal the movie himself with his broad direction. It oozes 'mass appeal', while never trivializing the sub-textual undercurrents that have been looked at time and time again. A neat trick for sure, and just maybe one example of why he tends to be forgiven when he has projects that aren't received so well... ('Legend' is one, for me... ) It's good that we have such types of lasting celluloid heroines, however few they are; and it's something that certainly makes 'Thelma &amp; Louise' stand out; but don't let that obscure the fact that it's a cracking road movie on OTHER terms, also... !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently watched Thelma and Louise. I found this movie to be a very easy to watch and enjoyable film. The two main characters who were played by Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis truly made one watching the film feel as if they are lifetime friends. These two women are traveling across country on a liberating road trip away from the control of men and eventually this innocent trip turns into a run from the police. This movie is a powerful movie about friendship and feminism. It showed how women are becoming more and more like men. This movie in some ways was very similar to another movie I recently watched, Myra Breckenridge. It shows how women are now having more control over their lives and are now controlling men rather have men control them. The movie had a mix of action, drama, and comedy which makes it a great movie for anyone to watch and enjoy it.</fullReview>

I was very impressed by Keitel, whose smiles (Keitel smiling!) may be a bit conceited, but that's more to do with Scott's broad-brush storytelling. Equally, Chris McDonald's Darryl shone, undergoing his own, narratively subordinate but as important transformation from spoilt boy to pitiful (in both senses) man. This in direct but understated analogy to Davis' chintz-neurotic-becomes-outlaw: whilst both Sarandon and Davis give rich performances, it's Davis who has, ostensibly, furthest to travel and really demonstrates the character transition from beginning to end.As I've already pointed out this film looks exquisite on the screen. Not much in this vein can be said for the original score from Hans Zimmer: I'm no fan, but I come into these things ever hopeful. However, the denouement, needing something really quite special, is of disappointingly flat and regurgitated 'emotive-crux' stock, both in its content and orchestration.

It stars 2 first class actresses together on the silver screen, Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis. The western scenerary is fantastic. The performances by Sarandon and Davis are unforgettable and the actresses should have both won the Academy Awards. This movie should have been nominated for Best Picture of the Year by the Academy. There are classic moments that are not repeated in other movies such as the state trooper, truck driver, the bicyclist, driving and talking and waving to the airplane and of course, especially the ending sequence. The ending is both sad and uplifting and is a must see. The dialouge is pure classic. This movie was risky only because the film industry made their circumstances risky.Ridley Scott, the Director, deserves a lot of credit because he directed this movie and made the movie for what it was about.Sarandon and Davis are the best and their performances set the acting bar at the epitome where no one has come close too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With Kubrick gone (RIP) Sir Ridley is the greatest living master. This is his touchstone film, the movie that marks the end of a shrewd designer with geek-appeal and the beginning of an artist who has finally broken free from the shackles of his TV commercial conditioning. It not only recalls but elaborates on the films of John Ford. It's a revelation, to anyone familiar with Ford's movies. Those of you who aren't -- presumably you're the ones with your knickers in a knot over the "man-hating" aspects of the script. What a puny vision you have.It took me a while to appreciate Sir Ridley's genius, pre-disposed as I am to rolling my eyes at so many beauty shots stacked upon each other, but I'm learning to get over it.Unfortunately, most of the directors he's inspired have not taken anything from the man but his taste in design, much as some pornographers today believe they're following in the footsteps of Helmut Newton.The mistake I made for a long time was to judge Ridley Scott through the prism of those who copy him. That's like hating Led Zeppelin for spawning speed metal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Weightlifter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to call everyone's attention to the very muscular sweaty guy who is lifting weights (I believe he is doing dumbell curls) in the gas station parking lot while there is a fire raging in the background. Many people don't even notice him, but most of those who do just shrug him off as a random unexplainable image. I, however, beg to differ. I believe that the "weightlifter," as I shall dub him, is the embodiment of the message of the entire film. He is an incredibly strong man, no doubt with extremely large cajones, and he represents all that is wrong with male-dominated society. The world is literally on fire with oppression and injustice, represented by the fire in the background, but male society, represented by the weightlifter, doesn't give so much as three dollars and fifty cents worth of a care. (In other words, he doesn't care at all.) All that male-dominated society cares about is making itself even stronger, as the weightlifter shows by pumping away at the iron in spite of the huge fire and women in distress (Thelma and Louise) that drive past him in their car. It is an homage to the feminist hopes for the future: the male is so bull-headed and self- centered, and has a cleft in his tongue that only the devil could have put there, that all he cares about is becoming stronger, even if that means the rest of the world will burn down because of his negligence and because he feels no need to perform the duties that come with his enormous power.Also, what's the deal with Geena Davis? Does that woman have hooves or what? I mean come on. Am I right or what?Am I not merciful?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is not about Women, but about Freedom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I ve seen this perfect roadmovie at least 20 times and I will never get tired with it. Every time I discover new hidden details or sentences I never noticed before. Things waitresses say or what Louise does with her hair at a certain stop. I just love every dialogue, as they are never boring or dull. Brad Pitt and husband Daryll are alone worth watching this movie, but even without them it would be perfect enter- tainment. And I surely think its no pur women-movie. This story is just about poor people in the heart of America without any perspectives and surprises in their life. Thelma and Louise experience what the absolute majority of American middle classe never will, a kind of freedom and self-esteem. So watch this movie and you may understand, why 30 times "Thelma and Louise" are better than two times "Star Wars", "Lawrence of Arabia" or unacceptable "Fight Club".</fullReview>

"Thelma &amp; Louise" said what gay men/woamn were afraid to say, but it took shape and force, these silent voice through film &amp; in to the world; it gave a voices to the the hundreds broken hearted, lonely hearted, wild hearted people wanted to say. These voices came thorugh the bodys of two of the most beatifull woman sill under-rated by Hollywood and praised by critics and silent film buff's worldwide, "Geena Davis" and "Miss. Susan Sarandon"!!Bravu "Hollywood for you"!Screenwriter Callie Khouri, here's a tip, make soemthing that was what "Thelma &amp; Louise" had. IT had orginiality, it had led to millions of discussions over java and milke shakesand late night dinners.A new cult film was born of 1991!Please Hollywood realease it!!

		<shortDescription>So-so</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't hate this film but I didn't love it. Though superbly acted, directed, and filmed, this film suffers from a lack of editing: plainly put, the scenes are way too long. I found myself fast forwarding through scenes in the very middle and, you know what? I didn't miss a thing. This movie could have easily been cut by 30 minutes, which is how long it took me to watch it. No, I wasn't bored by the beautiful scenery. Rather, I was bored by the overlong conversations.I know this film is emblematic. I know it is a feminist statement. However, I felt the lead characters were, at times, just plain mean without explanation and that their rage, which is sometimes funny and sometimes tragic, is taken to extremes that are inconsistent with their characters.There are a few plot problems. The most aggregious of these is that one character does something toward the end of the movie that leads to the climax and that action is inconsistent with previous actions (I'm trying to to spoil the movie) but it is not clear that this action was anything other than a mistake, not an intentional action brought about by some fundamental change within the character. This was disappointing but, looking back, I'm not sure there was any other way to end the film the way it ended. The writer was stuck. The characters were simply too lucky and intelligent.I didn't hate this movie because it is too good too hate. But if you are about to see this film for the first time, I recommend you see it, but lower your expectations and prepare to use your fast forward button.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Margaret Reines: Great Female road trip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film struck a strong chord with (mainly) female audiences - I suspect. - possibly as a compensatory device for the many films which portray females as the recipients of action rather its perpetrators. Probably it has/had a cult following for this very reason. One can imagine the woman stuck in not-so-domestic bliss fantasizing about taking off on a road trip. I have done it myself - though not lately. I think the picture would certainly be not so appealing without a very interesting and compelling musical track wherein somehow the producers were able to 'match' songs with particular scenes. eg the section where they were going thru the mountain played the evocative 'Ballad of Lucy Jordan' departing from the full-on honky-tonk blue collar' feel of the film to a sensitive harmonious esoteric experience. Another point of interest is the co-dependence of Thelma and Lousie 'to get them thru the night' as it were. eg when one dithers - the other takes over - and they interchange roles by doing this (a sort of survival thing.)Christopher McDonald was wonderful and added a lot of unintentional humour, eg in the first conversation with Hal Slocumbe, Harvey Keitel's laughing was genuine. I loved the ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the hate that I came across reading the boards and the reviews absolutely justifies the reason of existence this movie. This movie might be a feminist movie but in no way it is sexist against men. Not all male characters are portrayed badly except for the rapist, the husband and the truck driver and I have totally seen these guys around! Louise's boyfriend and the police officer are descent character's and Brand Pitt's character is definitely charming and at least he has manners. And to all those saying that if the leads were male the movie would be sexist I only will ask them one question, are males being raped and abused every day? Cause women are and this is the whole point of this movie. How neglected women are in our society and how this is driving them to a dead end! And If you really can't see the sexism against women in our society then you must be blind. Just read the hate comments across the boards and the reviews and you will be enlightened. Women must always look good and be ready to pleasure men, they must always obey and If they want to have fun they are w****s and they must be punished for that or at least that's what many seem to believe! Do women go to the boards of every stupid sexist movie that comes out and moan about it being misogynistic? No, it's only males that passionately throw hatred at every single feminist thing. When any woman stands up to sexist behaviour from men, wants to be independent and doesn't center her life around pleasing men she is immediately called a man hater, feminazi, lesbian and many more. I'm so sick of this! Good news is that the majority recognizes this film but there is still a lot of work to be done for misogyny to be extinct. And nobody said that their actions are right, they are just trapped in this situation and you can see their despair and lack of options and trust me this is how many women feel in real life and that's why this film is such a genius!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A spiritual journey?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two decades later, Thelma &amp; Louise continues to absorb our attention. We can analyze it, admire the acting, praise the cutting, remember the story. But that doesn't tell us why it remains such a cult movie. And not just the feminists, who claimed ownership. Its appeal is universal, and I believe it is because it is laden with symbolism that engages those who, deep down, have a mystical experience. The main symbol is water. To many, water means baptism, purification, cleansing. T &amp; L, throughout, shows water in many forms. Washing, of course, but there's irrigation, wet paving and rain. It appears at crucial times. Watch for the women as they wash hands and faces; note the changes in the drama.Would the Bard have approved? I think Shakespeare would have loved this story. It has his kind of ending, his kind of humor, his kind of 'cast-reduction plan'. It is a very funny film. OK, some of the humor is too targeted to the stupidity of the men. Is that why some feminists like it? But there are some comedic lines and risible clichés. Those of a religious bent will recognize the dramatic elements of purification, retribution and revelation. When the women stop to admire the view over the canyon, do they experience that moment of glory to which many of a certain belief aspire? Their faces, their embrace, tell us that. If you want to analyze, note the moment when Thelma adopts the leadership role. Drama is about change; this has it in spades. This feminist came out of the hard-top smiling 20 years ago. In 2013, my third viewing, T &amp; L is still a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Transgression is freedom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a story of a two women who went for a short trip to get out of an everyday senselessness and ended up in a thrill.At the beginning Thelma is somewhat naive housewife, open and vulnerable like a child. Which is not particularly surprising since she spends most of her life at home and her relationship with her husband (Darryl) is akin more to that of between a growing teenage daughter and father than between a couple. The way she sneaks out of the house, not daring to tell Darryl about her trip, leaving a note instead and the way Darryl reacts when he learns about adventures of Thelma are good illustrations of the nature of their relationship.Although most of the movie, Thelma and Louise are running from immanent danger, they are more free then ever in their lives.At the end of the movie Thelma and Louise, both confess that they feel like having awoken. What have they awoken from? Maybe they have awoken from a dream which they did not even knew was a dream and now that they have awoken, they not only understand that it was only a dream but a nightmare too. It was a dream of structured lives, of everyday routine, of boundaries and limits, of life's purpose, of American dream...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apparently, the same male crowd who openly cheers as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid rob trains and banks, repeatedly dodge the law, and go out in a final blaze of heroic movie glory, have somehow taken umbrage at this as feminist propaganda. We really are a bunch of blowhards sometimes.Yes, some scenes are corny as hell. Yes, the stereotypes do not flatter anyone, or the sometimes juvenile jaded air.On the other hand, this is fun. It is Scott's best directed after Alien. You will know it as about two human beings who in their desperate, goofy, misguided journey to 'awakening', create their own wish-fulfilling space, the draught of desert air that takes them over the edge. Scott has taken measures to ensure we do not read the film as taking place in the wounded imagination of Louise (the photograph glimpsed before the plunge), but we know better. I like to think of this as helter skelter a mix of things happening and subjective impressions of a gonzo narrator. Note to that effect, the two most widely used cameras on the journey, bird's eye horizon and mounted on the hood of the car.Film noir bent through the angry desert mirage of Alfredo Garcia/Vanishing Point. Not as good as either, but good on its own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hell of a ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most clichéd sayings when it comes to describing a film is that "they broke all of the rules". However, if there was ever a movie that this term applied to, Thelma and Louise is the one.This masterfully written, directed and acted extraordinary film starts out very ordinarily. Louise is an ordinary blue collar woman with a sharp tongue, Thelma is an ordinary bored housewife. The two women set out for a weekend to escape their ordinary boring lives. And then something happens.The girls stop for a drink at a local bar. Thelma, clearly enjoying the temporary liberation from her housewife prison indulges in the fun that she craves- drinking, dancing and flirting with men. Unfortunately for her she naively encounters the wrong patron who takes her out back and proceeds to brutally rape her. She is saved by Louise who brandishes a gun and tells the man to let Thelma go. Out of harms way the girls begin to leave and then man taunts them. Enraged, Louise shoots the man, killing him instantly.Prior to this incident these two ordinary women followed the rules, which resulted in very little happiness in their lives. Neither had much money. There are no characters who give these women the love that they need. No parents, children or other family members are mentioned. Louise's boyfriend who we meet later does seem to care about her but is incapable of showing it. Thelma's husband is shown as nothing less than complete buffoon to a cartoonish degree.This is a film that does not come out and tell the audience certain important details but it makes them very obvious, again, thanks to Ridley Scott's directing and the performances of the two leads. We know that Louise motivations are a resulted of a traumatic incident from her past. We are never told what it was or when it was, that is up to the imagination of the viewer. We do know that it was traumatic enough to haunt Louise on a deep and personal level.After the incident at the bar the real journey begins, both for the two lead characters and for the audience. The ultimate morality rule of films- when rules are broken, consequences are to be paid. In this film we as the audience understand why these two women were broken, we were there and we sympathize, even cheer them on. After all, who among us has not broken the rules? But fairness does not make anyone above the law, especially not ordinary people and not these women. Thelma and Louise may have started out as ordinary but they have now become outlaws and it is now only a matter of time before the law cataches up with them. The women decide on running away to Mexico and the story becomes about the encounters obstacles they face in reaching their destination. There are many moments of unpredictability, particularly when the characters backs are against the wall. These two once "ordinary" characters do what they have to do, including robbing stores for money and locking a policeman in the trunk of a car. Always breaking the rules, but always justified.Yet there are also notable moments of fun, particularly when the women pick up a young drifter played by Brad Pitt. Pitt's performance and screen presence left a tremendous impact on the audience and launched him into super stardom.One unpredictable character in particular comes in the form of Harvey Kietel as the sympathetic chief of police. His character is the most conflicted. His job is to bring in these women who broke the law. But at the same time he sees the reasoning behind the women that the audience sees.Of course, this film is also infamous for its ending. After spending two hours rooting for these two characters, the law catches up with them and we as the audience know that they will not escape to Mexico. We have witnessed their transformation throughout the film and by the end we understand their unwillingness to go back to the lives that they had. And yet it is still a shock when (SPOILER ALERT) they decide to drive their car into the canyon, taking their own lives.The ending is ambiguous, do we cheer for these women because they made their decision? We've all heard the slogan, "Live free or die" but we rarely see people make that choice.Its an ending that may not be satisfying but it is certainly interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Girl Power' from Ridley Scott... Really works!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridley Scott directed some of my favourite films and so I thought I'd take a look at some of his other works. I must admit to having seen this one before, but I only remember bits and pieces of the story. It was nice to see it again so I could cast my critical eye over it. It's great to look at with some iconic American scenery, not to mention Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis! I enjoyed it although there were a couple of niggles that I will tell you about after this brief summary.Repressed housewife Thelma decides to not tell her husband, Darryl, when she goes off on a trip with her friend Louise Sawyer. They are headed to a cabin in the mountains for a couple of days fishing and chillin' out. On the way they stop at a bar for something to eat and things get a bit out of hand; I won't say how or why (spoilers), but it is pretty serious. They make a break for it and hole up in a motel while they decide what to do. Eventually Louise makes the decision that they will escape to Mexico. For this they will need money and her boyfriend, Jimmy, proves to be the solution to that. Meanwhile the police, in the guise of Hal and Max are on their trail. Add to the mix a young hitchhiker called J.D. that Thelma takes a shine to and we got us a road trip to remember! I won't say any more or the Spoiler Police will be tailing me right to the edge of the Grand Canyon.As I've already mentioned, this film is beautifully shot with some fantastically cinematic moments. Ridley Scott certainly has an eye for these things and they are a feature of all of his films. I couldn't fault any of the performances either; Susan Sarandon as Louise Sawyer and Geena Davis as Thelma are both fantastic. Harvey Keitel did an excellent job as the caring cop, Hal, as did Michael Madsen as Jimmy. Also worthy of note were Christopher McDonald as Darryl and Stephen Tobolowsky (whose podcast is great by the way?), as Max. Oh, and there was this young actor? eye-candy (for the ladies) really? some guy called Brad Pitt played the part of J.D.I said at the beginning that I had a couple of niggles, well, here goes, one is that the film starts off really well and then has a bit of a dull stodgy middle part before picking up again towards the end. I see this far too often in films and it's beginning to get a bit old (for me) I'm afraid. Secondly, I found the film a little too long, cut out some of the stodgy middle and I would have been a little happier. OK, that's all for the niggles. I found there was a lot more humour in it than I remember, but it was quite sporadic. The ending was very touching and did make up for some of the niggles, (but not all of them). The musical score mostly consists of Country songs, but I much preferred the incidental music by Hans Zimmer, in fact I had a bet that he wrote it while I was watching the film! I now owe myself a pint. Over all, though, I still thought this film was great, superb performances, great cinematography, some great music, oh, and a pretty good plot too? Recommended.My Score: 7.8/10.IMDb Score: 7.3/10 (based on 50,471 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 92/100 (based on 50 reviews counted at the time of going to press).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absent the Attitude, Still a Good Movie: SPOILER?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thelma &amp; Louise was a sensation when it came out, partly because it was a female buddy movie with a distinctly feminist attitude. Twenty years later, the feminist underpinning is less appealing. Murder, robbery, overpowering a police officer, exploding a gas truck because the driver is a male chauvinist pig seem distinctly less admirable than they might have been in 1991. But Geena Davis as Thelma and Susan Sarandon as Louise are excellent actors and inhabit their roles: Geena as a naive, sexy and more-than-slightly ditsy housewife dominated by an overbearing husband and Louise as a street-wise waitress anxious for more than life has given her. The presence of Brad Pitt as a handsome, hitchhiking thief provides a bit of audience appeal, though any good-looking young actor could have done as well. After Louise murders a bar fly who attempts to rape a drunken Thelma outside the bar, they begin a flight from the cops that becomes increasingly urgent once Thelma robs a store at gunpoint to restore some of the money stolen from her after sex by the handsome hitchhiker. Ultimately cornered in the desert on the edge of a canyon, Thelma persuades Louise to go out in defiant style by driving off the cliff. Despite the desire of some of the film's fans for a happier outcome, it's an appropriate ending for a feminist fantasy film that remains hugely entertaining, largely on the strength of outstanding performances by the two principals and a story which, however improbable, equals a lot of male buddy movies which preceded 'Thelma and Louise".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scott proves again what a diverse and skillful director he is, by taking on yet another genre different from those he has dealt with before, and masters it, as he has those he worked in before. While this is one of the only road-movies I've seen, it is definitely the best. It follows two women that finally fight back against the crude, nasty and foul-mouthed men that have always held them back. The film does not take a stance on their actions, it merely displays them, leaving it up to the audience to judge(though without leaving any doubt as to the fact that they are in reaction to the continued abuse that they have suffered). You might perceive the plot as simple, but it comments a lot on the environment and the types you meet in this. It's well-told, and the pacing is excellent. The acting is marvelous, there's not a single performance that is off. Even Pitt, in the role that got him noticed, is spot-on. Davis contributes enthusiasm and warmth, and Sarandon convinces as being a more reserved person. The characters are well-written, fleshed out and credible. I must compliment Zimmer on his effective score, which helps this be immensely engaging. There is mild violence and sexuality(with a little nudity), infrequent strong language and some disturbing content in this. The DVD comes with a couple of trailers and an informational commentary track by Ridley, and you can also choose to hear his thoughts on the interesting enough alternate ending included. I recommend this to any fan of anyone who helped make this, as well as all feminists. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two iconic characters justify women finally calling the shots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Call it a chick flick, call it aggressive feminism, label it whatever you like, but "Thelma &amp; Louise" is a classic story of female companionship and liberation that challenged what was and in many ways still is a male-centric movie industry. Roles for women in film have expanded over the years, but Thelma and Louise proved women can even be outlaws starring in a fugitive adventure thriller.Societal messages aside, however, it doesn't change the fact that Callie Khouri wrote a fantastic character-driven script with unexpected twists and turns and an unforeseeable ending. "Thelma &amp; Louise" might be far from a blood-pumping fugitive crime thriller, but action and excitement is not what this film hangs its hat on.Even director Ridley Scott, who directed probably the greatest suspense movie with a female lead of all time in "Alien," recognizes that "Thelma &amp; Louise" is relationship drama at its heart as two women discover themselves as they push each other over the edge.Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon star as the titular characters, one a suppressed housewife and another a chain-smoking waitress who plan a weekend getaway together only to end up trying to get away from the authorities after Louise shoots a man at a bar who tried to rape Thelma. After deciding there's no way to come clean of their crime, they run for the Mexico border as authorities (led by Harvey Keitel) try and track them down.Davis and Sarandon are an incredible duo playing the most detailed of characters. Davis as Thelma is the best of the two as she takes Thelma through a complete transformation from warm, acquiescent housewife looking to let loose to a fully committed armed criminal. Sarandon plays Louise as a colder, self-assured type who learns that she really doesn't have it all together. The two work in perfect balance creating strong, relatable and fascinating characters whose flaws make them so human.Not much has to be said for Scott's directing, he gives these characters the attention they need to blossom before us and does just enough to keep us guessing when they'll do some sudden and unpredictable.Yes, in this process of self-discovery, the girls both literally and symbolically give the middle finger to the male establishment. From shooting the abusive trickster that attempted to rape Thelma to Louise turning away her boyfriend (Michael Madsen) after he finds her and proposes to her, there's little sympathy for the male characters. Only Keitel's detective gets Khouri's vote as he defends the ladies (despite wanting to catch them) when a young Brad Pitt gets mixed up with them. Some of it might seem unnecessary such as the trucker who makes crude gestures to them along the highway, but considering Hollywood's abuse of the femme fatale, innocent girl and other female thriller/adventure genre archetypes, I'd say it's a fair trade, especially when these characters are actually very thoughtfully conceived. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning drama with sensational acting and filming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a road trip, Thelma (Davis) and Louise (Sarandon) set out on the run from the police after committing murder.In 1992 the Oscars were dominated by Jonathan Demme's masterful The Silence of the Lambs, a cold mystery thriller with the most famous flesh eater of all time, Hannibal the Cannibal, played with such coldness and sophistication by Anthony Hopkins. The film also demonstrated a marvellously intellectual leading role to Jodie Foster, who beat two of the finest actresses in Hollywood to the coveted prize, Sarandon and Davis.The pair certainly cemented themselves in Hollywood with this film. A powerful leading duo who make this film what it is and whilst the conceptual nature of this film is fascinating, the American actresses make this film so.Sarandon's sharp and opinionated Louise thrives the film forward with her independent mindset. This is finely balanced against Davis' Thelma who holds back and questions the course of action and can never seem to think for herself. The balance in personalities and the emotional setback the pair go through justifies the Oscar nominations and add something deep and meaningful to this movie.This Ridley Scott picture is certainly powerful when looking at a real life perspective. The two leads escape their hard lives for a mountain trip but are sidetracked when Thelma gets raped in a bar car park. This controversial realism shows the balance of strong and weak with lust against desire to make t quite horrific in a sense and Scott isn't afraid to back down on the dialogue as cursing and a sharp bullet in the chest show. This act sets the film in motion and from here on in, this is a fascinating changing drama.This dramatic implementation of murder resolves the in-depth motive of the mountain trip to be changed into a desperate journey to safety as the pair explores their options.This dramatic change and realistic example of drama is one of the main reasons why this picture won n Oscar for best original screenplay as the tension and drama really sink in.The pace continues to mount as the friends descend to desperation in order to survive. After a delightfully amusing Brad Pitt makes a mockery of the pair does the real tension set in and soon the pair cross the boundaries of innocence as they explore their options and descend to illegal activities, with the store robbery a highlight.What is also impressive about this picture is the cinematography. The sweeping settings are well used to add to the feeling of freedom when the pair enters the Grand Canyon and the operating factory the pair drive through to elude the cops. The filming is staggering and is a wonder right up until the infamous final shot, which is arguably shot of the film as Scott goes for all out in gasping climax.With Sarandon and Davis on top form and with the stunning settings and dramatically tense and exciting plot, this picture is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First and Best Female Buddy Picture Ever!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The firestorm of controversy that erupted over the release of "Thelma &amp; Louise" took British director Ridley Scott, first-time scenarist Callie Khouri, and principal co-stars Susan Sarandon &amp; Geena Davis entirely by surprise. Men and women on both sides of the issue whether feminist activists or otherwise weighed in on the combustible argument. Some said it degraded men, and other heralded it as a testosterone-laced female manifesto, while still others "Time" magazine critic Richard Schickel devoted three pages to the "white-hot debate" seething "over whether Thelma &amp; Louise" celebrated "liberated females, male bashers?or outlaws." Schickel concluded that Scott's film possessed "a curiously unselfconscious manner about it, an air of not being completely aware of its own subtexts or largest intentions, of being innocently open to interpretation, appropriate and otherwise." Moreover, Schickel went on to say that its "makers, without quite knowing what they were doing, sank a drill into what appeared to be familiar American soil and found that they had somehow tapped into a wild-rushing subterranean stream of inchoate outrage and deranged violence. Indeed, when Scott decided to helm "Thelma &amp; Louise," he wanted to "raise this film from being about two girls in a car to something with a little bit more of a statement." As for Khouri, she reacted to the male bashing assertions as "shocking." Nevertheless, this gender bending controversy didn't harm the box office. Budgeted at $6.5 million, "Thelma &amp; Louise" generated $20 million in revenues in less than a month and eventually grossed $45 million. Ironically, despite its notoriety, Khouri noted later that "Thelma &amp; Louise" didn't open up more roles for women.Fed-up coffee shop waitress Louise Sawyer (Susan Sarandon of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show") and her claustrophobic housewife friend Thelma Dickerson (Geena Davis of "Beetle Juice") plan a weekend fishing trip. Louise has an on-again, off-again romance with a sweet-hearted musician boyfriend, Jimmy (Michael Madsen of "Reservoir Dogs"), who suffers from a commitment phobia. Meanwhile, Thelma contends with a domineering husband, carpet salesman Darryl (Christopher McDonald of "Grease 2"), who keeps her on a short leash. These gal pals load up Louise's 1966 T-Bird convertible and paranoid-minded Thelma packs a gun. Our heroines don't get very far before they slake their thirst at a country &amp; western roadhouse with a band and dance floor. Thelma flirts with a charismatic redneck, Harlan (Timothy Carhart of "Witness"), who winds up assaulting her in the parking lot. Louise saves her girlfriend before Harlan can sodomize Thelma. Momentarily, everybody backs off in an uneasy truce. What we don't learn about until later is Louise has concealed an incident in her past that she has never resolved. When the would-be rapist insults Louise with a derogatory dog reference, she shoots him dead cold dead on the spot without a qualm. Our heroines hightail it without a second thought.Thelma insists that a jury would blame her for enticing Harlan with her flirtatious manner and provocative apparel. As fugitives on the lam, our protagonists embark on a cross-country journey through Oklahoma and New Mexico, carefully avoiding Texas, for the sanctuary of Mexico. Everything goes awry when they pick up a sexy, Stetson-wearing, denim-clad hitchhiker, J.D. (Brad Pitt of "True Romance"), who steals their money when Thelma has her mind on his hunky physique. At this point, Louise relinquishes her role as the stern mother figure and Thelma?who had been in the daughter figure role?takes it over. Since they have no money, Thelma decides to put into practice J.D.'s formula for robbing convenience stores to use and holds up a grocery store. Darryl is shocked when the FBI shows him the videotape of the robbery.Thelma and Louise's odyssey of liberation turns into a tragic manhunt in the tradition of the modern-day Kirk Douglas western "Lonely Are the Brave" (1962) where a lone cowboy is chased by cars and helicopters across the wilderness. Eventually, a posse of heavily armed lawmen, among them a sympathetic Arkansas State Police investigator, Hal Slocumbe (Harvey Keitel of "Mean Streets"), who has tried to reason with them, corners them at the equivalent of the Grand Canyon. Rather that capitulating to justice and inevitable jail time, our heroines refuse to surrender. Literally, they take flight, launch themselves off a cliff, and plunge their car into the oblivion of a canyon and certain death. We never actually see them die. Scott concludes this larger-than-life epic on a freeze frame of the protagonists soaring through air in their automobile, reminiscent of George Roy Hill's memorable freeze frame at the end of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" when the heroes charge an army of soldiers. Appropriating the male bonding movie formula, "Thelma &amp; Louise" reversed its sexuality so that women rather than men bonded, shared life-altering experiences, and savored a taste of freedom that neither sought to forsake despite the consequences. Previously, the buddy picture had been exclusive domain of men with examples such as "Thunderbolt &amp; Lightfoot," "Smokey and the Bandit," "The Sting," and "Easy Rider." Scott's film, however, irrevocably changed the landscape, and nothing comparable to "Thelma &amp; Louise" has been produced. Previously, Scott had made a pioneering foray into feminism with "Alien" (1986) when he cast Sigourney Weaver as the survivor. "Thelma &amp; Louise" emerged as a cautionary tale about what can happen when men refuse to treat women with respect. Callie Khouri not only won the Oscar but also a Golden Globe for Best Screenplay. Sarandon and Davis received Best Actress Oscar nominations as well as Golden Globe nods for their performances. Ridley Scott received a Best Director nomination for the Oscar as well as the César--French equivalent of the Oscar. Amid all of the kudos for Khouri, Sarandon, Davis, and Scott, the most overlooked person in "Thelma &amp; Louise" is actor Christopher McDonald who steals the show with his hilarious performance as Darryl, much of which was?according to Scott?improvised by McDonald on the set.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very well-made and compelling.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis shine in their roles as two unsatisfied women who go on the road to escape their doldrums of lives for a simple weekend. Tragedy strikes early, however, and soon Thelma and Louise are on the run from the authorities with really no direction to go.The acting here is very good with Sarandon and Davis playing their roles perfectly. It is impossible to think of any other actress being these two. Sarandon perfectly captures the dark past and ambitious feeling of the waiter Louise and Geena Davis is so charming and bubbly as Thelma, the housewife controlled by her demeaning husband. The supporting men here are strong as well, especially Harvey Keitel as a detective on their trail, Michael Madsen as Louise's boyfriend, and Brad Pitt in a star-making role as a sweet-talking hitchhiker.All the elements work well together but I think director Ridley Scott deserves a lot of praise for creating this type of movie into one that is now considered a classic after all these years. Scott paces the movie just right, perfectly cutting between the two women and the people on their trail. We also get some nice sentimental moments between Louise and her boyfriend Jimmy, who do love each other but cannot be together. This is a formulaic story but the movie mostly avoids being a formulaic movie. I must say I wasn't impressed with the ending, but for the most part I really enjoyed this story and got involved with the characters. As a fun joyride, though, Thelma and Louise has to be one of the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thelma and Louise was a near flawless amalgam of talent in almost every piece of the movie. Where to begin... First things first, the plot: Well, there's not much I can say without spoiling the plot, but what I can say is this story of friendship unfolds fast, and carries the viewer through the entire adventure on the edge of his seat. There's also a hint of suspense in many parts of the movie which could not have concluded any better than they did.Acting: The actors fit the role like fingers in gloves; both Susan and Geena played convincing parts and deserved the nomination they received. The other characters of the story were introduced fittingly, and contributed their share accordingly. Some moments were so genuine, it was hard to believe it's only a movie.The cinematography: The camera work was smooth and artistic. The shots used were fitting to the mood, and the transition was excellent. There were no moments that seemed unfitting.Last and most definitely least, the bad: The flick left a few questions unanswered, and there were a few plot holes if you look carefully - but nothing that will stop the movie in it's tracks.I definitely suggest giving this movie a watch, its much better than anyone could expect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>part entertaining road movie, part decent Lifetime-channel movie, good acting all around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thelma and Louise was director Ridley Scott's attempt to step out of his perceived 'box' of sorts- that he was mostly known for sci-fi/action pictures- for something more character-driven. This goes without saying that Thelma and Louise has its moments of big action and chases and even a HUGE explosion at one point late in the story. But for what Scott was going for, he accomplished his goals of making a good, character-driven story. If the movie may ultimately appeal to some more than others (i.e. women), then perhaps that's more-so by design of the screenwriter, Calie Kohouri, than the director who tries often to deliver in whatever form a blockbuster again and again.Some of the decisions and little twists may seem absurd or silly. Hence the likely connection to be made to a Lifetime TV movie. Granted, there are stretches that don't go for the kind of wretched sentimentality of those tearjerkers and soppy things. And the ending, however iconic so many years later, veers near being over-the-top. But luckily the script has a lot of inspired bits and characters, and every part is cast well, or surprisingly so. Granted, the male parts (Keitel, Madsen, McDonald, newcomer Pitt) are fit like gloves, which are the detective, the low-rent boyfriend, the sleazy husband and the hot hunk of feminine fantasy flesh respectively. Davis and Sarandon, on the other hand, are a really great pairing, with Davis delivering one of her best (however sometimes limited) and Sarandon totally in a commanding turn.Maybe not the modern-day classic some may call it, and as a "statement" on the feminist condition it's in equal terms bleak and sweet and ludicrous. As a cool Hollywood road movie, there's been a helluva lot worse, or more contrived.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Girls night out gone bad - mostly excellent entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you can imagine a blend of "9 to 5", "Smokey and the Bandit" and "Bonnie and Clyde", you should come up with an approximation of "Thelma and Louise": a mix of adventure, humor and comrade in the style of the Bert Reynold's chase movies, and getting even with the stereotypical men who try to abuse, control or recapture these two women intent to enjoy a short escape from their boring lives. The possession of a pistol or two and some daredevil driving enables them to silence or elude most of the men who want to abuse or capture them or simply have fun with them. Clearly, Louise and Thelma initially have very different attitudes toward the strange men who try to seduce them. Loiuse makes it loud and clear she wants no part of these amorous come ons, whereas Thelma, especially after a few drinks, is often flirtatious and sometimes willing. But, Thelma eventually learns that fooling around with strange men can have traumatic consequences, and joins Louise in rebuffing further come ons. According to the DVD commentary, many in audiences cheered or clapped when Thelma's would be rapist is shot dead by Louise after making threatening remarks in the aftermath of Louise's breakup of the rape attempt. This clearly confirms what we may conclude from the popularity of confrontational westerns and action movies; that lethal vigilante justice, when done in appropriate circumstances, is considered justified by the majority of people, regardless of what the legal system thinks and does.One gets the impression that even if this duo didn't face probable long prison terms, they might have become permanent runaways from their unsatisfying lives. It is significant that neither had children, which may have alleviated some of their dissatisfaction, and which made their overblown girls night out adventure gone bad practical. The fact that both women were often foul mouthed, smoked and occasionally went to seedy bars turns off some viewers, who label them as brainless white trash who perhaps deserved some of the misadventures they suffered in their attempt at a short escape from their boring lives.Brad Pitt and Michael Madison provide two handsome hunks for female viewers to drool over, though very different. Brad represents the perfect con man who exploits naive vulnerable women both sexually and financially. He is the perfect bad boy for Thelma to find release in. Michael represents a man who isn't willing to settle down to a permanent one on one relationship, but who is willing to make occasional sacrifices for the women he has relationships with.The ending seems appropriate for this duo. Like Bonnie and Clyde, the pair eventually knew that they were doomed to long prison sentences and perhaps lethal injection, or to die in a shootout, car accident or by their own device. Like Bonnie and Clyde, they were prepared to try to elude their pursuers for as long as possible, and then to engineer their deaths if capture seemed imminently certain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Ridley Scott's best films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An Arkansas Waitress Louise (Oscar-Winner:Susan Sarandon) and an bored housewife Thelma (Oscar-Winner:Geena Davis) are going camping for the weekend. Which these two woman only wants to relax and have some fun. But their weekend trip turns deadly serious, when Thelma is nearly raped by an drunk redneck (Timothy Carhart) and Louise shoots the rapist by self-defense. Instead of turning themselves in to the police and confess, they go on the run instead and trying to go to Mexico for an new life. But an determined police detective (Harvey Keitel) tries to find and help these two woman before they get into more trouble. But Thelma and Louise's trip to Mexico isn't easy, since the police are looking for them. Thelma got seduced by an charming thief (Brad Pitt), who stolen their money to start all over again. Thelma and Louise have to turn to crime by trying to reach their destination. But this detective, police and the FBI are closer of catching them.Directed by Ridley Scott (American Gangster, Black Hawk Down, Kingdom of Heaven) made an extremely entertaining, road film with plenty of humour, drama and heart as well. Sarandon and Davis gives excellent Oscar nominated performances in this film. Which both actresses were nominated for Best Actress for their strong roles. The film also has fine supporting by Keitel, Pitt, Michael Madsen, Christopher McDonald and Stephen Tobolowsky. This road movie is certainly familiar but it's made uniquely by two lead performances, strong writing by Callie Khouri (Mad Money, Something to Talk About) and Scott's visual style received an Oscar Nomination for Best Director as well.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has two interesting commentaries tracks. One by producer/director:Scott. Second one is by actresses Sarandon &amp; Davis and Screenwriter:Khouri. DVD also has 30 minutes worth of Deleted/Extended Scenes and Alternate Ending with Director's Commentary. But this DVD is 2004 edition, which 2003 edition has an documentary and music videos as well. Which 2003 edition is now out of print. Khouri received an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. This film also received two Oscar nominations for Cinematography from the late Adrian Biddle (Aliens, Event Horizon, V for Vendetta) and Best Editing for Oscar-Winner:Thom Noble (The Exorcist 3, Red Dawn, Witness). This is probably the funniest film of Scott's work and also the most touching as well. McDonald is a hoot as Thelma's sleazy husband. An young Catherine Keener appears as Keitel's wife in one of the deleted scenes of the DVD. Don't miss this incredible film. Panavision. (**** ?/*****).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first 50 or so minutes I was about to find something else to do, giving this a 4 star.With the introduction of Brad Pitt the movie becomes twice as good as the first rather dull part. We see the two female leads stick together through a strong bond of friendship, and Pitt helps things with his small role but believable slick cowboy/robber type.As Thelma and Louise decide to really up the ante and go on a bit of a crime spree we can really see by bringing up their past how they have got to this stage, Thelma's no good husband and Louise's abuse in Texas, which of course explains the first crime she does.To think I could have missed a great movie, something needed to be done to improve the first part. Even if you only watch the second part, the movie is a great thrill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Certainly one of the most memorable 'road movies' of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Thelma &amp; Louise' is another directorial effort by, now, well known director Ridley Scott. Although you can't go back to this film and state that it was too near the beginning of his career to warrant any criticism (He'd already done 'Alien' and 'Blade Runner'), I got the feeling you don't have to as it manages to stand tall all by itself.A few days after seeing Thelma &amp; Louise, I slowly began to realise how much it broke away from typical Hollywood storytelling. Although this is, after all, a 'road movie'; that didn't detract from the eerie realisation I started to feel when I realised this film carried certain neo-realistic qualities. What that means is that it emphasises the everyday and unspectacular; a feeling I certainly got once they were deep into the middle of the desert during which the film hits a segment of pure unpredictability, in a very entertaining way. The acting talent is also pretty close to un heard of with Michael Madsen, Brad Pitt and Geena Davis all still relatively unknown in Hollywood; how quaint then that the two heavy weights of Keitel and Sarandon do most of the bantering when things get really tight and whilst the 'unknowns' of Pitt and Davis develop their own relationship.The film is suspenseful, but suspenseful in its own unique way. Little battles, problems and dilemmas the two women face along their journey are dealt with in an entertaining, if not unspectacular and often logistical way but it doesn't detract. What adds to this unpredictability are the little love stories that open up about a third of the way in. The character of Louise (Davis) is developing the whole time as friendship/love relations with another man other than her obnoxious husband open up; not only advancing the character in a satisfying way but also paving the way for the next event to occur that kick-starts their adventure once again.What's more, as each situation that comes along (The meeting of J.D. (Pitt), the fact they loose all their money and have to do something about it and the interaction with the state trooper; to name a few) the better it gets. The two women grow in their confidence and ruthlessness whilst the scenarios grow more and more intense. The reactions of the two women to these scenarios also escalates to the point that they do something so extreme; it threatens their lives.With plenty of things going for it, the film almost seems scared to veer too far away from its roots. The overuse of cheery music of the pop and country variety adds to my theory that the director wanted to keep everything fairly light-hearted. As each desperate situation occurs, I feel less of the light music and more of a darker decent shown by the two women would have suited the film much more. Alas, the film remains in its 'happy' state and the closing montage before the credits signalling the 'best bits' from the film/the two character's relationship only adds to my point.Ridley Scott had Sigourney Weaver defying female film stereo-types in Alien as she went around saving the day and acting as the hero/focus; in Thelma &amp; Louise we have an equally good example of that from the same director, only this time there are two.</fullReview>

Things go wrong, the meet a jerk (brad Pitt), and they can't go back to normal. That's when it really gets interesting and fun. I never tire of this film and watch it over and over. It is an outstanding feminist caper that shows the importance of bonding and friendship. It was also a welcome variation on the standard road picture or the usual male-dominated buddy flick.</fullReview>

We get to care about the characters and wanting to know more what will happen to them. The mishaps that Thelma and Louise are up to are believable and yet very tragic. This film grips me all the way without making me lose interest, despite its length. Amidst all the action, there are also humorous moments as well.

		<fullReview>This is a great movie, though not for the reasons you usually hear. From the first fifteen minutes, I knew that Thelma Dickinson and Louise Sawyer were *not* hardcore rebels in any way, shape, or form (much less that "feminist" nonsense). They run into the wrong man, don't take it as well as he hoped they would, and from there things get interesting.What I really liked was that these are regular human beings just trying to work through a difficult situation any way they can. They're unhappy with their lives, of course, but that's nothing unusual. They don't put up with crap, but that's not unusual either; in fact, it's downright refreshing. They're under pressure and don't always make the right decision, and sometimes there's no right decision at all, just the least bad one (what they did to the highway cop, for example).It's a remarkable and memorable trip, with only a minimal amount of violence until the showdown at the end. And even though the trip ends very badly for our heroines, it's hard to feel unsatisfied. They made their point and ended the game on their own terms. As close to victory as anyone in their situation could hope for.Could Thelma have aimed more carefully and avoided any need to flee in the first place? Could they have ignored the hitchhiker, thus avoiding landing in further hot water? Of course. But where's the fun in that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most enjoyable movies I've ever seen. The gripping story, the action, the well developed characters, the great acting, the dramatic tension and the dark humor kept me on the edge of my seat. I've never seen any other Ridley Scott movie, but this one is surely great.Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon were amazing. Davis created a character with whom you empathize immediately. She can be a bit dumb, but she's sweet. Her crying scenes are very believable, as is the amazing transformation her character suffers during the movie. Besides, she has a great comic timing and can be very funny. Sarandon shows a down-to-earth attitude, and her eyes are incredibly expressive. Har character changes realistically during the movie, and her crying/confused scenes are very touching and heartbreaking. They have a really great chemistry together, and their characters balance each other.The supporting cast is good too. Brad Pitt is incredibly hot (as always), and he has just the right look and mannerisms for the role. Harvey Keitel is just there, but his voice fits in the little time he has of dialog. Christopher McDonald is incredibly funny and believable, I loved his performance; the way he walked, spoke and dressed was perfect. Michael Madsen played is character fairly well in the touching subplot he had. Timothy Carhart as Thelma's rapist had a sinister intensity and charm that was great.The direction was amazing. Ridley Scott shot a road trip mostly with a dusty, yellow look. He had some surrealist moments (the Jamaican guy smoking pot in the desert) that were very cute and enjoyable. The rape scene was very intense and disturbing. The dramatic tension you can feel comes in good part from his direction. The music was good and created the right mood for the film The locations were great. They showed poverty and lots of dirt and decadence, but the desert was beautiful. The stunning cinematography helped giving the movie its full of style look.The argument is great. The storyline keeps you increasingly interested and the characters are touching and you cared for them. The dialogs are sharp and well written. The only problem is that some of the subplots shouldn't have been there.The last thing I wanna say is that some moments were clichéd. Like, when Thelma is talking to Louise on the phone, she opens the door of the fridge. This is not too bad, but sometimes it gives the movie a not realistic quality. But, on compensation, there are some incredibly original moments, like when Thelma robs a store. Overall, one of the most enjoyable movies ever, great direction and performances 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't know how I managed to miss this on its first release, but I saw the DVD the other night and it's dazzling - well-constructed, full of great dialogue and quotable one-liners. The rapport between the two excellent leads is clear to see. Keitel is terrific in the role of the only completely sympathetic male character. The ending is inevitable and sad, but at the same time oddly exhilarating. Considering the forces arrayed against them, where else can Thelma and Louise go? Something will have to change in the world: women must stand up to their oppressors, sure, but men must witness and understand the oppression for justice to be done. We're in this together.Coming to the movie for the first time some fifteen years late, I have the interesting experience of knowing what was to come in the career of Brad Pitt. He shows himself to be a confident young actor who can hold his own in his scene with Keitel. It's no surprise he went on to bigger things. I can't help thinking that he's better in supporting roles, as here as in TWELVE MONKEYS.The only cavil I have with THELMA &amp; LOUISE is a small one: Michael Masden seems to be sleepwalking through his pivotal role, much as he did through his more decorative one in KILL BILL. He really is a lot better playing thugs with a surprising side to them (DONNIE BRASCO, RESERVOIR DOGS) than he is playing softer, more complex characters. If only, say, Matt Dillon had been cast opposite Susan Sarandon, the scenes would not slightly sag as they do.But otherwise: what a great movie! Worth waiting for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The part of Darryl played by Christopher McDonald has been overlooked in this great film and needs to be highlighted. First we see him playing the self obsessed, selfish, chauvinist pig type character in the early scenes. We laugh at him as he stands in his pizza as the cop tells him his wife was seen leaving the scene of the crime. Then there was a wonderful moment when they are all watching a movie and he flicks to the sports channel only to be met with looks of disapproval from all seated. The macho cop stereotype comes crashing down as all are engrossed in the romantic Cary Grant movie. This time we laugh with him as opposed to laughing at him. We begin to warm to him as he starts to bond with these men that have temporarily taken over his household. And finally the poignant moment as he looks into camera, tears rolling down his face as he slowly realises the wife he knew and most probably loved very dearly, was not going to come out of this alive. If only he could have been a better husband, if only he treated her better. Buts its all too late for him to make things better. He has lost her.A sad moment indeed, if only the director lingered on this moment a little longer. I think it would have made the movie even better.Does anyone else think his part was too overshadowed by the main characters or just by the right amount?

The dessert is so vast that women feel free from the rules and their roles as women. Thelma (Geena Davis) is a married woman and a housewife and appears to be fed up with the routine, cooking, cleaning,and serving her husband at home. Louise(Susan Sarandon) is not married but working at a pub, and as a woman has to put up with sexual harassment all the time. Ridley Scott is very successful with the use of symbols in the movie. The city life represents socially established rules (marriage, law etc)and the burden women have due to their sex roles. Dessert on the other hand with its vastness offer a temporary freedom for them, yet unfortunately they cannot escape from the law.

		<shortDescription>Great Adventure Movie For Gals (and Guys)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a rare movie that puts women in the drivers seat and provides an interesting, and entertaining, spin on the repressed southern woman who has had her fill of abuse from men and won't take it anymore. Louise, a waitress, and Thelma, a repressed housewife, embark on a girls only vacation to a cabin without telling their husbands. On the way (the movie is set in the Southwest), they stop at a honky tonk bar where a flirtatious Thelma finds herself in the arms of an apparently (to her) charming man who winds up abusing her in the parking lot. Louise happens upon the incident and takes matters into her own hands. Suddenly, the women find themselves fugitives from the law, running from a bunch of well-meaning (and somewhat condescending)cops. The women do not go down without a fight, pinning their hopes on an escape across the border to Mexico. Along the way, they find strength in each other and deal with a number of conniving and piggish men (including a young Brad Pitt) and play cat and mouse with the cops. It is amazing to me that people find this movie to be full of male bashing. Forgetting for a moment all of the negative portrayals of women in film, while there are a number of embarrassingly dopey and idiotic men in this movie, especially Thelma's hubby Daryll, Louise's hubby Jimmy is somewhat sweet and remorseful and the cop played by Harvey Keitel is especially concerned with the women's safety and,at first, seems willing to cut them some slack. That is a far cry from "every man is a pig." And, the women, especially Thelma, don't always come across as heroic geniuses. Thelma is so naive and gullible at times that you want to reach through the t.v and knock some sense into her. But all of this is to miss the point of the movie, which is the bond between these two women that, while strong at the beginning, gets even stronger as they face their fears and use their wits to escape capture. There is a certain resignation that crops up from time to time where you feel the hopelessness of their efforts, but they manage to stave off this feeling of impending capture with hilarious scenes of revenge that are best left for the viewer to discover. ENJOY!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely wonderful and extraordinarily breathtaking!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thelma &amp; Louise is such a great movie with an enjoyable storyline and it truly is one of the best films I've ever seen. Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis were perfect for their roles and they both gave the film a fantastic performance. The excitement begins after the two of them go to a club to have a few drinks one night and when some guy befriends Thelma and asks her to dance, they begin dancing along with other patrons to country music while Louise goes to the bathroom. Thelma steps outside of the bar with the guy who asked her to dance and he sets her up onto the back of his car and tries to rape her after she refuses to kiss him. Louise appears behind the attempted rapist with a gun pointed at his head and demands him to let Thelma go. He takes his hands off of Thelma as she walks away and Louise begins walking in the same direction as her. At that moment, the guy makes a sexually crude remark to Louise which provocatively insults her and she shoots him dead with her hand-held gun. After that, the two of them leave the scene of the crime in Louise's 1966 Thunderbird while being followed by the cops. Thelma and Louise is thrilling and exciting all the way through and has such an intense yet tragic conclusion. One of the most amazing things about the story is the fact that Thelma and Louise have such an unbeatable friendship and they will stop at nothing to fight for their freedom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Thelma and Louise" is now one of my favorite movies. Why??? Because the whole movie clicks from start to finish... each character couldn't be better cast, the songs blend right into the feelings in the movie, Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis were born to play these two parts and they are just right for one another too, everything was perfect. A lot of feeling, laughs, heart-pounding, empathy..... Harvey Keital was great, especially at the end when he realized what they were thinking and he started running..... I consoled myself at the end by telling myself the car made it to the other side of the canyon, yet knowing it couldn't have. Did this movie win an Oscar for anything??????</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thelma and Louise is a stereotypical action adventure movie that replaces the traditional male outlaws with two women. It has all the "big blockbuster" elements of explosions, shootings and car chases. The plot is simple and intends to portray the fugitives as victims. Thelma and Louise did not leave their homes with the intention of becoming outlaws however after a man attempts to rape Thelma, Louise shoots him. Though rape is a heinous crime, I just couldn't sympathize with their situation and felt that the murder was unjustified. Overall, there was nothing revolutionary in this film. The themes of bored housewives, international fugitives, female companionship and living life to the fullest are nothing new. On a positive note, the acting performances were rather good and convincing. Davis and Sarandon displayed female companionship to the fullest and Brad Pitt's performance was also enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why women shouldn't go to roadside bars or trust blond men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two girl friends, steady headed waitress Louise (Susan Sarandon) and repressed, somewhat simple [allegedly thick] Thelma (Geena Davis) try to have a weekend get away from the former's often absent musician boyfriend Jimmy (Michael Madsen) and the latter's unappreciative husband Daryl (an unrecognizable Christopher McDonald). While stopping off for dinner and a drink at a roadside bar, a seemingly charming but violent, horny Southerner gets Thelma drunk and after dancing with her for a while, he takes her outside rapes her [through her derriere]. Louise comes to Thelma's rescue and shoots the ba****d, which starts off a cross country chase with the police after Thelma &amp; Louise for murder. Although Thelma initially wants to go the police and tell them that the shooting happened in self-defense, Louise shoots that idea down because Thelma had drank so much that most everyone at the bar who saw her would say that she was asking for it. Louise gets Jimmy to wire her her life savings to Oklahoma and then the two make plans to head to Mexico, but Louise doesn't want to go through Texas, which is the only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico (it is implied that Louise herself was brutally raped in Texas, but it is never said flat out). Hard nosed lawman Hal (Harvey Keitel) is sympathetic towards the plight of the two women, but unfortunately, he appears to be the only man who is sympathetic to them. Along the way Thelma catches the eye of a pretty boy loner named JD (Brad Pitt), a thief who tells her about how to rob a convenience store, seduces her, makes love to her and then makes off with the money Louise got from Jimmy, who had proposed to Louise but ultimately Louise convinces him that they need time apart. Then Thelma robs a store in order to make up for the money JD stole from them and things only get worse as Thelma steadily gets a little crazier and then she actually locks a policeman in the trunk of his own car when he tries to arrest Louise. Will the girls survive? I cannot say.Sarandon and Davis are first rate, as are Harvey Keitel and Michael Madsen (it's hard finding films where Madsen gets to play a sympathetic character). Some may feel that Geena Davis overcomes her rape experience too easily, but I suspect that her steady change in a gun toting tough gal is her response to the incident. Brad Pitt mostly does what he does best, which is look pretty for the ladies. The film is full of observations on society and how women view themselves, find strength in their friendships, get frustrated in their relationships with men, the quest for a happy/fulfilling life, and the state of the law. Other messages in the film is that women should not go to road side bars, other wise they'll get drunk and raped and also that women should not trust blond men because those men will make off with their money after having the one night stand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What? You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma, but you don't want to go through Texas?" &lt;Thelma to Louise&gt;</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My summary line, a quote from the film, captures much of the tone of this film. I viewed the regular DVD, a free loan from my local library, not the special edition issued earlier in 2003. "Thelma and Louise" is a good movie, but NOT a feminist movie, as many believe. It is a metaphor for any of us, male or female, who somehow feel repressed and want to just be free to rebel against the 'norms' imposed upon us. It may be a wife whose husband who acts more like her owner, as in Thelma's case. Or the waitress, Louise, who is in a deep rut in life. Or some teenager who is tired of the dress code policies at school. Or the business man who has attented one too many luncheon business meetings. Michael Douglas played an extreme version of this in "Falling Down." Sometimes we just want to get away and do something a bit different. Louise and Thelma just wanted to go to the mountains for a few days, hang out, do a little fishing, get away from the rat race long enough to recharge their batteries. It just didn't work out that way.SPOILERS follow, read further at your own risk of future disappointment (although, it is unlikely anyone still doesn't know how the story ends).Set in Arkansas, Louise is the older, logical, tough and smart one. Thelma is pretty but an airhead, and is controlled by her cheating husband. They just leave without telling anyone, and when they make their first stop, a dance hall, both drink a little too much, the nice man Thelma met and danced with helped her outside for air, he tried to rape her, Louise gets gun that Thelma had brought, gets the man off her, but he is defiant, curses them, makes a very lewd suggestion, and Louise just shoots him through the heart. It wasn't right, but she just snapped. Their road trip really begins with that. In a series of events they are broke, Louise arranges to get her life savings, $6700, which is promptly stolen by Brad Pitt's character, a parole-jumper. So Thelma uses Pitt's scheme to rob a small store along the way. Surveillance video captures it, cops on their trail, and in a brief phone conversation Louise tells Harvey Keitels' cop character, "Can you believe it was all an accident?" There is another incident, with a lewd truck driver, who pulls over with them, they demand an apology, he laughs at them, Louise first shoots his tires, then the trailer, and the contents explode and burn. (Never mind that it is highly unlikely that any truck would be carrying fuel cross-country to California. That just doesn't happen, too expensive, instead they simply trade equivalent quantities in different regions.)So, with the murder, the armed robbery, the destruction of the fuel truck, Louise realizes how deep a hole they are in. While the cops try to get them to surrender, she knows what prison life will be like and she doesn't want that. Cornered in what they think is the rim of the Grand canyon (actually Dead Horse Point at Canyonlands National Park, the same location Tom Cruise was rock-climbing in MI:2), they take off and go shooting off the ridge, on their way to a long plunge to death. It is interesting that particular location was chosen, where centuries earlier cornered horses sometimes also decided to jump rather than remain captured.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** Thelma and Louise are the best of friends. Both girls are both in relationships, but decide to take a break together and go away for a while, taking a road trip. One day on the way though, Thelma gets talking to a guy who ends up nearly raping her, so Louise shoots him. Instead of taking the break away that they intended to do, Thelma and Louise now decide to go to Mexico, so they won't get arrested, etc. The American police are on hot on there trail though, trying to hunt them down.Thelma and Louise features an Oscar winning cast, including Susan Sarandon, Geena Davis, the brilliant Harvey Keitel and of course Brad Pitt in his first major movie role here. They all give great performances.Thelma and Louise is a great comedy movie about friendship. It really does show you what the best of friends will do for each-other. The whole cast make everything seem so real and the movie is one whole adventure all the way though. The movie is really funny too has loads of great moments, especially when Thelma and Louise lock the policeman in the car and when that weird guy, gets his truck set on fire by Thelma and Louise.Watch this, have a laff and try to connect to whats happening on screen, you'll ever do two things with this movie, you'll either love it or hate it, i personally thought that this movie was great tho :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect film. I wouldn't change a thing about it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw THELMA AND LOUISE back in 1991 at the age of 8, I absolutely loved it. Eleven years later, I still do. It's an absolutely perfect film and I would not change a thing about it. The story is compelling, but a mere description of the plot does not do the film justice because one cannot simply recount the friendship that is at the heart of the film. It must be seen to be believed. It is an utterly touching, moving and heartfelt friendship that marks this film and takes it to heights few films can ever reach. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon embody their characters with such conviction that they become Thelma and Louise. Both earned well-deserved Oscar nominations for Best Actress. By the time they are clasping hands at the end of the film, their T-bird speeding toward a freer and more uninhibited existence, I am sure everyone will be moved because of how well these women and their friendship have been depicted. The screenplay, which won an Oscar, is absolutely brilliant and makes it seem as though the road movie is an altogether new film genre. The film suffered much criticism in 1991 (despite strong reviews) because of what many saw as its sexists message, and it even made the cover of Time, with Davis and Sarandon on the cover and a caption that read "Thelma and Louise: why it strikes a nerve." I think it's good that it got the attention, since it probably helped it at the box-office, but I do not think this is an anti-male, feminist film. Keitel's cop character as well as Madsen's boyfriend character are both quite nice and helpful to the girls. Everyone should give this film a try as it is not just a girls-gone-bad chick flick. There is no such thing as a chick flick or a guy flick. Only good and bad flicks. And this one is good indeed. THELMA AND LOUISE the movie, as well as the characters, will live forever as movie icons. Grade: 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though the film delivers a feminist message, it doesn't feel preachy. So I wouldn't call this a "chick flick." I don't really believe a "chick flick" genre exists, but for those guys who do--don't worry, you have nothing to worry about. Plus, it's directed by Ridley Scott, so there's action elements scattered here and there. There's a big truck explosion towards the end, since you can't have a Ridley Scott film without any explosions. It's just against Ridley's nature. The story involves a studly but abusive man at a bar getting shot after attempting to rape Geena Davis and a greasy, perverted truck driver getting his truck blown up, but I still didn't feel the female screenwriter was heavy-handed in delivering her message about females being treated inferior to males in society, and her fantasy about females empowering themselves and overcoming the oppression that men put them through. Because you really feel a connection to these characters--whether you're a man or woman--and you want to cheer for them every step of the way. The cast is first-rate. Susan Sarandon is superb as always, and so is Geena Davis--and man, is she HOTTT!! My man Harvey Keitel is cool as the hard-nosed Arkansas detective. Michael Madsen is also a really cool actor, and he's great as well, though he couldn't grasp a Southern accent. I'll let that slide. Chris McDonald delivers a delightfully farcical performance as Davis's aggressive but bumbling husband. He delivers most of the laughs in the film. I just felt the movie could've been trimmed about thirty minutes. Plus, it's mainly dialogue-driven and it does tend to drag at points. Nevertheless it's funny, exciting, touching and one wild ride! And it has a good message--not just about the roles of females in society but also about the power of friendship. Unfortunately, I knew the ending before watching this movie today for the first time. It has one of those landmark endings that everyone talks about--I'm just not going to mention it here because it would be considered a spoiler. But I was still very entertained. My score: 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thelma &amp; Loiuse, in spite of being considered a chick-flick, can be enjoyed by men as well. Being a lad I find utterly inspiring that another one (Ridley Scott) would make this movie. It's an original, fast-paced and funny road-movie by two women on the run. Both Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis give superb performances. The soundtrack is cool, too. Being a guy, I can't see how some claim this movie is not for them because it portrays two women setting themselves free of a life where their hubbies were making all decisions without even asking their wives. Any bloke seeing this movie and feeling attacked or disappointed hasn't really gotten into it, sorry to say. Open your mind, ok? It was a time a movie put male chauvinists where they deserve.The only aspect I don't like is the end. If it was up to me the last scene would have been the two women coming to Mexico in the sunset. Had this been a too optimistic finale, or what?8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good overall, a little frustrating (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(SPOILERS)A really great "buddy" movie, obviously heir to "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid." I believed nearly all of it: why they fled instead of going to the cops (this comes out over the course of the film), and why things were escalating the way they were. All of the actions taken by T &amp; L were directly related to the changing of their characters.Two complaints: First, I did not buy Louise's final phone call to the police. She knew the phone was tapped; even if she HAD to call to settle in her mind the question of how severe the situation was, she did not seem to be urgent at all. This and the whole bit with the obnoxious fuel trucker just seemed like useless flag-waving for feminism. I am quite convinced that, even with the changes these two were going through, once J.D. had taken the money, or perhaps once Thelma had robbed the store, these two would have had a serious tete-a-tete and established that they needed to lay low and get serious about fleeing. What actually happens is they seem to dilly-dally even more. I found that frustrating.Secondly, although I prefer the ending they had over the alternate ending, it was a bit of a rip-off of Butch Cassidy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star power rules this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridley Scott has always been known for big projects. Everything he makes is a huge project. He even has to be the biggest when it comes to commercials. In Thelma and Louise, he brings together an excellent cast to make an enjoyable road-movie.Yes, I know, a road movie isn't usually considered a "big film". But with a cast like this, it's really hard to screw up. Geena Davis is Thelma, housewife who is ruled by her controlling husband (an oddly cast Christopher McDonald). Susan Sarandon is Louise, a waitress in a diner whose boyfriend (Michael Madsen) cares for her a lot more than she expects. One day, they decide to leave on a small vacation, only a couple of days. They stop by a country bar and Thelma dances with a guy who takes her out. There, he attempts to rape her, but the girls shoot him. There starts their odyssey to get to Mexico, to flee from the law. Along the way, they'll pick up a two-bit (but polite) thief (Brad Pitt, who speaks like he has no teeth) and elude more than once the cop who's trying to track them (Harvey Keitel).This film is widely considered as a "feminist" film, but I don't really see what that's supposed to mean. Yes, our two protagonists are women. Yes, they commit crimes against men. Yes, those men are depicted as pigs. But, there are many other films who follow that kind of, say, "guidelines" and yet are never commonly known as feminist. However, these are only my opinions, so if you are a feminist, then "feminize" away.The real problem of this movie lies in the two main characters. For such a character-driven movie, there are many times where the two women take weird swings that completely negates what their characters were supposed to be. There are so many mood siwngs, character turns and misplaced emotions that by the end, you just don't care who they are inside, just who they are outside.That said, we can dwell on the high points of this film. As mentioned, the performances are spectacular. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon are utterly believeable, even when the material runs out. Brad Pitt (in one of his first major roles, even if it a supporting role) is perfectly cast and Keitel, even though he is completely out of place with his Noo Yawk accent, fills his surprisingly small part well.Thelma and Louise is a very good film, feminist or not. If you can look past the few major foibles, you'll have a good time. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How easy it is to become a criminal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My impression of this movie is not one of feminist propaganda. Rather, this movie demonstrates the ease by which an individual, male or female, may become a criminal. The greatness of this movie lies in its strong writing, plot, and superb acting. While this movie could be classified by some as a typical "fugitives-running-from-the-law" formula, it has enough depth of characters and great dialogue to set it apart from other movies of its genre.Furthermore, Scott does not sugar-coat Louise's criminal act. If Louise had shot a man while he was raping Thelma, that would be the typical melodramatic drivel, suitable for the Lifetime Network. Such a script would likely climax with a courtroom scene in which Louise would be exonerated, with the assistance of a silver-haired compassionate defense attorney. Instead, Scott gives us a Louise who shoots a man: a man who has retreated from his attempt to commit a rape upon her friend. The man has backed away after seeing the gun-wielding Louise. However, when he utters offensive language, she shoots. Of course, she realizes she has no legal defense to her murder of the man, and thus, she must flee.The greatest part of this movie is the transformation of the character, Thelma. At first, Thelma, the weaker character, feels compelled to flee with Louise, though Thelma herself has committed no criminal act. Of course, she goes along with Louise, perhaps because of her own guilt and feeling of responsibility for having placed Louise in this predicament. After all, Thelma perhaps feels that she created the circumstances under which Louise felt compelled to shoot the man, due to Thelma's placing her safety in jeopardy through her drunken waltz to the alley with the bar pick-up. Perhaps, Thelma feels compelled to go with Louise, because, after all, Louise saved her from the hands of the would-be rapist, or perhaps, Thelma feels compelled to go with her simply because she has nowhere else to go. One gets the impression that Thelma lacks legal knowledge sufficient to realize that she is not complicit in the murder of the man. In any event, Thelma follows along with Louise, and through their fugitive journey, she becomes a stronger, more independent person. Davis does a wonderful job of portraying the transformation of this shrinking violet, into a bold, gun-toting criminal.This movie also demonstrates that an initial criminal act, will most likely result in subsequent criminal acts for the individual. For Louise, the criminal acts that follow in the wake of the murder, are ones of necessity--the criminal acts are a result of Louise's feeling that her life is spinning out of control. The criminal acts are miniscule in comparison to the homicide she has committed. As she has committed the most serious of crimes, what are a few robberies in comparison? However, for Thelma, the subsequent criminal acts are ones of personal empowerment---the criminal acts are a result of Louise's feeling that she is finally taking control of her own life. Thus, Scott masterfully gives us the comparative workings of the criminal mind in two individuals--one who is relinquishing control of her own life through her criminal acts, and another who is finally gaining control of her own life through her criminal acts.Finally, for those men who posted on this board who seem to find this movie unsettling, I suspect that you identify with one of the male characters in the movie, rather than Thelma or Louise. Your negative comments about this movie are telling. Perhaps, you should watch it again and discover which male character with whom you identify. You may learn a lot about yourself.I am a woman and my favorite movies are The Good the Bad and the Ugly and Patton. I identify with Blondie and Patton, despite our gender differences. The GTBTU and Patton contain no major women characters. A woman is beaten by Lee Van Cleef in one scene in the GTBTU, but no other women come to mind in that movie. As for Patton, there is a single scene with the General being surrounded by a bunch of old English biddies.In closing, I would suggest for any men or women who enjoy a good tale and fine acting, Thelma and Louise is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with the comments that the ending could be better, but no interaction with cops and driving off the canyon makes it mysterious too.I would not say these women acted dumb, its just that they were put in a situation they have never been in.

		<shortDescription>So much potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, and particularly the ending, had the potential to be so much better than it was. The first time I saw Thelma and Louise it didn't strike me as feminist but simply humanist. Despite some corny dialogue, a weak script and a group of somewhat shallow supporting characters, the movie did manage to hit a few emotional chords. But the best thing about this movie was the cinematic side. Outstanding performances from the lead actresses, breathtaking scenery, superb direction from Ridley Scott and a brilliant musical score by Hans Zimmer make this a must see for anyone who appreciates good movie making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think just about everything could be said about this movie has already been said, so I just want to make a few small points.First, I love this movie. There are few movie as exhilarating as this one -- pure emotional exhilaration without the whole "good beats evil" garb. Second, this movie is unabashedly feminist -- good for you! "Feminism" has been smeared into such a dirty word today (especially in the US), it's such a relief to see such a proud feminist film. I'm a man, so I can't say I understand everything. But one thing I do understand: there's nothing dirty about being a feminist, just like Thelma and Louise have discovered (it certainly does NOT mean man-bashing, as Keitel and Madsen's characters can attest; Pitt's character is -- interesting -- at least certainly not negative). Third: anyone remember one of the last car chase scenes, as the two women's car rushes unflinchingly forward, more than a dozen police cars follow them, raising a cloud of sand in the desert? It just seem so fantastic to me -- so unbelievable, yet so gripping. It, for some reason, reminds me one of F.S. Fitzgerald's passage in "The Great Gatsby" -- I don't remember the exact words, something like "the unreality of reality?" A fantasy fused so closely and convincingly with reality, its name could only be hope -- no, determination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon are at their best as the title characters, two women that might be on the verge of the nervous breakdown! The two gals decide to go on the road to self- discovery because their lives are pretty much dead-end. On the way, Louise ends up killing a rapist who has his greasy sights on Thelma, and this results in a high speed pursuit by thecops. Along with two "Resevoir Dogs" stars (Michael Madsenand Harvey Keitel) to share the spotlight with, Davis andSarandon literally light up the atmoshphere of the movie with their warm nature and easily understandable inner anguish. A pure enlightening drama, "Thelma and Louise" is the quinsenttial chick flick. Not that there's anything wrong with that!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an absolutely perfect screenplay. I predict that in 50 years or so, this will be viewed as one of the all-time best. As a man, I probably cannot identify personally with the feminist issues the movie raises, but the storyline is amazing from every standpoint. Scott's direction is superb, the performances are flawless, etc. This is a movie that will stand the test of time, and it's hard to believe that the Academy chose "The Prince of Tides" over this film as a Best Picture nominee (thank goodness it won for Original Screenplay). The only thing I would change in the entire film is Scott's choice of the happy-moments montage over the closing credits. Although some people may dislike the ending, it's the only possible ending and it's so sobering that the montage distracts from its impact. For a detailed analysis of this film, I'd suggest Syd Field's book "Four Screenplays." Like "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" and "Bonnie and Clyde," this is a true American classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A road movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie five times. The first time it just looks like a strange road movie, but from the second time on I understand how deep it is.Thelma &amp; Louise are living mediocre lives until they decide to go out for a weekend. In three days their lives will dramatically change...What I find in this movie is strong female characters with fine acting performances, a good soundtrack, wonderful scenery and good action scenes, all in a simple but very effective story talking of true friendship, freedom and female power. A particular mention deserves to Geena Davis playing the transformation of Thelma from a repressed silly housewife to a self-conscious independent woman (maybe you can find something similar in her character(s) in "The Long Kiss Goodnight"). What really bothers me are all the male characters. With the only exceptions of Jimmy and Hal Slocumb all the men seem to be jerk and the real cause of all the girls' troubles. I'm a man, and I know all the men are not as idiots as shown on this film.In conclusion, one of the most touching and intriguing movies I've ever seen.9/10.</fullReview>

It's that very last scene, just before the fade to white, that sets me off. It's not because it's sad, I find it so beautiful. Thelma (Geena Davis) lives her whole life in the 2 days depicted in this film, and she dies a happy woman. Apart from this, I think this is probably the best movie script of the 90's, the actors are all fantastic, and the cinematography is just fantastic. I love it!</fullReview>

I nearly wet myself laughing every time I see it!Interestingly, on the Region 2 DVD version of the film, there is an "extended ending" as one of the extras. It seems that the director originally had the audience actually seeing the results of the final shot but decided (rightly, IMHO) that some of the impact of the ending was lost as a result...Definitely one of the way greatest films in history!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still crazy after all these years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd guess I've probably seen "Thelma &amp; Louise" 30-40 times since 1991, and it remains my all-time fave. Although I see a good number of movies, I tend not to relate all that well to female actors, and this was the first time Susan Sarandon ever really grabbed me. She is luminous in this film, and I haven't missed a movie of hers since (although there were one or two I wish I had).The material is just as fresh and edgy now as it was 8 years ago when I first saw it. The camera work in the New Mexico/Arizona lanscape as night fades into morning is stupendous, as it is at the Arkansas bar where the adventure begins. My dismay at the aftermath of Brad Pitt's visit to Thelma is as palpable now as ever it was, and my heart sails with these incredible women each time I see them launch their new lives at the end of the movie.Much is made of whether the end of this movie is depressing or exhilarating. I vote wholeheartedly for "exhilarating": I don't know if I'd have the cojones to do it or not, but Thelma and Louise bring their impossible situation to a satisfying close on their terms, and they do it with gusto. I feel certain that the tears I shed every time I see this movie are joy, not sadness.Kallie Khouri richly deserved her Oscar for screenwriting, and I've always felt that both Sarandon and Davis were robbed. Jodi Foster, you may remember, won best actress in 1991, for her portrayal of Clarice Starling in "Silence of the Lambs." There have been Oscars that Foster deserved, but Clarice was not her best role, and it certainly wasn't the best role played by a woman that year.I think, too, that this movie, aside from being the greatest buddy movie ever made, is a great feminist manifesto. The male characters, with the exception Hal Slocumb and Jimmy, are total buffoons, and I've known a thousand men like them. This is a story of two women who fight back against the oppression of idiot losers, and live their lives honestly, justly, and on their own terms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent (plus trivia!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first women's adventure film from a progressive director's point of view. An often-overlooked aspect of this 1991 feminist classic is that the portrayals of almost all the men -- specifically characters played by Brad Pitt, Michael Madsen, &amp; Harvey Keitel -- are tender, heroic, or both. (Come on, TELL me Pitt isn't the erotic hero of this film!)Geena Davis followed up the next year with the other 90's feminist classic, "A League of Their Own." In 1996, Davis returned to "Thelma &amp; Louise" to reprise some identical images, lines, and situations in her Samuel Jackson thriller, "The Long Kiss Goodnight." Unfortunately, this includes the mock-macho "suck my..." line (which Demi Moore also re-uses in "G.I. Jane" in another hidden tribute to "Thelma &amp; Louise.") I can't imagine a non-fictional feminist using that phrase under any circumstances, but ah well, nothing's perfect! Scott &amp; Khouri's film comes close enough for me.Also see the very same teal-green T-Bird appear in Jodie Foster's "Contact" -- another quiet tribute to this fabulous film about women launching themselves into the unknown. I'd give it twenty stars if I could. Probably best seen letterboxed with stereo to truly enjoy the great scenery, cinematography, and soundtrack.</fullReview>

Each successive time the encounters are portrayed to reflect the state of each of them. The last one provides a rather satisfying product.The movie deals with two women who want to take a breather from an oppressing society.

She was asked several times for the truth, but never relented, whereas in most movies I would expect some sort of teary confessional. Better to leave it up to the imagination. Plus, her unwillingness to even speak of her past made the pain of it more genuine. Good movie, I didn't particularly admire Thelma or Louise, but they were fun to follow around.</fullReview>

One day they decide to break out of their normal life and jump in the car and hit the road.However, their journey turns into an escape when Louise accidentally kills a man who threatens to rape Thelma. They decide to go to Mexico, but soon they are hunted by the police.The road and buddy movie that is different as it is original and refreshing in the sense that women are the lead characters.It shows how two women on the road achieve growth and independence as they learn more about each other and themselves.Aside from that,we also get enjoy their adventures as they meet different characters and personalities on the road.And finally,this is a definitely a picture that has feminism as one of its primary themes.The performances of Davis and Sarandon were spectacular in this film as they have provided energy and vibrancy in the portrayals of their roles. Scott's direction is also great as he was able to show that he can make great character study films with a balance of action,drama and comedy.And worthy of the mention is the cinematography as we see the dazzling visuals in the background. Overall,this is one of the best buddy and road film ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you see a movie different times, each time stirs different emotions, or the same ones but with different intensity. It's your present condition and mood, together with your past experiences that influence the way it gets to you: in this case, with "Thelma &amp; Louise", the original strong emotion I felt when I first saw it many years ago, was strengthened by the vivid remembrance of an amazing on the road journey, I have recently made with a friend, of those infinite roads leading to nowhere, those desolate lands, those squalid motels and houses appearing as ghosts in the middle of nothing, stirring a sense of deep nostalgia, but at the same time making the movie more intense and vivid. The two protagonists,Thelma and Louise, represent the best possible existing form of friendship between two women, because not stained, as it often is in real life, by the cancer of human feelings, envy: their condition gets growingly more dangerous and desperate but their deep solidarity remains untouched by external events: they feel, think and act as if they were one body and one soul. Their story and inner struggles penetrate in the viewer's perspective as if we were there, driving with them, as if we could feel that wide range of sensations, from freedom, to fear, from joy to desperation, a whole category of human feelings concentrated in a single journey, and the emotional impact is truly intense. The scenery is, obviously, breathtaking: those infinite spaces, that for Europeans are so unconceivable, cannot leave you without a sense of the smallness of human beings towards the absolute and infiniteness of the universe, they may either amplify your inner struggles, or help you downsize them, but in either cases they cannot leave you untouched. Gena Davis and Susan Sarandon are simply superb, magnetically paired, extraordinarily over the top: I think women could learn much from them about the real significance of female friendship and solidarity. A must see movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Infamous female-buddy movie, where two listless women hit the road for some adventure, only to end up on a bigger personal journey. After a hasty moment of anger at a country bar, they take to the road from the law whilst their husband and boyfriend try to figure what to make of it all. Along the way a hunky drifter plays with the emotions of one, while the other tries to hold things together. The film has plenty of those signature moments that make a great movie, but unfortunately really drags between them. The leads performances are good (Sarandon is sexy as hell in that sleeveless white-T), but nothing spectacular. And the ending...ho, that's another story. It's so abruptly finished that it leaves you with a definite "That's it???" being screamed (most due to the end credits hitting the screen literally seven seconds after the climax). The two more striking things about the film are the score and especially the cinematography. Zimmer's twangy, subtle tones fit like a glove, and Scott manages some extremely amazing wideshots of the open road. Dust and dirt flittering from the tires of the girls' Thunderbird, plus stunning vistas and sunsets. But there just isn't enough going on to hold my interest, and at two hours, it indeed was a long trip. The flick takes a lot of "male-bashing" flack, which is I think is ridiculous. Madsen and Keitel come off great, and the few jerks on screen...well, us guys can be like for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since much has been said about the feminist arguments around this movie, i will not add anything except to say that this is an empowering film with strong female characters made in the time before the girl power movement went wrong. Nowadays female strength seems to be shown by their ability to take of their clothes- well done. Was this movie and others like it made for nothing? Today's actresses, singers, female celebrities have taken advantage of the women who actually had a thought in their heads, and seem to think they are strong because their clothes have a habit of slipping off, and make-up slipping on.But that's not for me to argue, as i'm only a man. The film itself is one of the best road movies ever, not because the central characters are women, but because they have such a strong relationship, made more powerful by the fact that they are escaping the patriarchy. The script is excellent, every performance is worthy of an award, and the cinematography is beautiful, working well with the soundtrack. Scott is known for his ability to capture an image, and his visual style here is very strong.The plot sees two women going on a weekend trip to get away from their mundane, housewife style everyday lives. When a man is killed after an attempted rape, they find themselves on the run, wondering whether they should give themselves up, or continue together. As the film moves on, their bond grows, and the ambiguous ending will continue to be discussed for many years. One of the best films of the nineties, and worth watching again to remind ourselves of the time when Feminism actually meant something.</fullReview>

It's about two female friends who go out to have a good time, and make many serious mistakes along the way. What makes this movie so engrossing is Thelma and Louise's gradual departure from the norm that was their lives. It began as a fishing trip and then ended with the famous car-off-cliff scene. In between each of those scenes is a study of not how women think, but how people make choices. Obviously, Thelma didn't choose to be raped. But still, the chain reaction from that unfortunate moment on is incredible. They both just went a little crazy.There is some damn fine acting in this movie. Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis give us some career performances. But Harvey Keitel also rocks as the detective who sympathizes with them. Brad Pitt and Michael Madsen also support well. The action scenes are not "action-movie"-ish. The rape scene is a little too real, but director Ridley Scott had a reason not to hold back with it. On the lighter side, keep an ear open for the Cowboy's (Pitt) description of how he robs a store. The payoff that comes later is hilarious. The movie does get a wee bit over the top toward the end, starting with yet another sleazy trucker scene. Still, that doesn't in any way make the film crappy.Ranks up there as one of the best fugitive/chase movies. A true work of technical and thespian art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My top desert island movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eleven years after I saw it, Thelma &amp; Louise is still my favorite film. You can have the Godfather, Citizen Kane, the English Patient, whatever. No other movie thrilled me as this one did. And it still gratifies. Sure, I'm a feminist, and it's exhilarating on that level, but this movie scores on so many levels. Take just one element: That Cast! Susan Sarandon, Geena Davis, Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Brad Pitt!! Then there's the script by Callie Khouri -- great dialogue, plot is nuanced, action moves right along. The directing by Ridley Scott. The cinematography. The music. This is a beautifully layered movie, and I always thought it deserved more credit. A movie about friendship, yes, but also about women who are strong and don't take any crap -- this film was a long time coming and restored my faith in the power of movies. I guess you can tell that I LOVE this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thelma And Louise isn't the type of film you would really expect from Ridley Scott, but he does it well. The film is visually stunning like most of Scott's films and it has a very interesting story of independence and freedom. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon are great in the title roles and there is a heart felt supporting performance from Harvey Keitel. This film has moments that will make you laugh, moments that will make you cry and moments of pure action. I went into this film not expecting much and got more than I could have imagined.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>women's choice in the men's world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two friend's holiday turned their lives into a sudden turn and self-discovery,that is the main story. But it was quite hard to watch being a woman myself. They couldn't control anger(killing the man who tried to rape Louise), their plan to run away to Mexico failed(partly due to another man who steal their money), and the final choice. I felt their anger, fear,hopelessness and desperation with all my heart. Maybe, they are not the best example of women(and all the men are not the jerks as shown on this film), but Thelma and Louise showed aspects of unfairness and suppression women do feel in our male-centered society. The final scene was so sad. It was a brave, shocking breakthrough in a film. But in real life? I really don't know. Because we don't/can't do what we feel we should do, do we?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Girl Power, Ridley Scott Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The critical scene in "Thelma &amp; Louise," and the one I think the screenplay got most wrong, is the one in which Thelma (Susan Sarandon) interrupts an attempted rape of her friend, Louise (Geena Davis), in a bar parking lot. The attack is over, the women are walking away, and the attacker calls Thelma something (I forget what), after which she turns around and shoots him. The way the scene plays out, "Thelma &amp; Louise" could have been an interesting movie, putting the audience in a quandary. The sympathy we're obviously supposed to feel for them would struggle with our desire to see Thelma and Louise face the consequences of their decisions. But the film doesn't go that route. Instead, it drags out a cliché back story for Thelma involving a past rape, so that we have an easy and tidy way to justify away her sociopathic behavior. This removes responsibility from the women, takes choices away from them and presents them to us as victims of an uncaring society. A most UN-feminist viewpoint, if you ask me. Still, Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis give two superb performances as the women on the run, and director Ridley Scott always knows how to keep a story moving. The male characters aren't worth mentioning, since the screenplay treats them as disposable. I guess since they were making a "feminist" movie, the filmmakers thought that they couldn't possibly have a positive image of a male character without somehow weakening their point. I sincerely hope those interested in truly feminist works of art expect more from them than this film has to offer.Grade: C+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is fantastic. It is a wild, emotional ride through the friendship of two women who go on a journey of self realisation. It also shows the strength of true friendship and how you should never give up. This movie is great as the two heroines are women, women who admittedly have their problems but grow to overcome them. This is a must for everybody. I cannot give this movie enough praise, it is definitely one of those movies where you are left dumbfounded after the credits have long finished. You will definitely come away feeling empowered. This movie is also a great for women as it shows that we can overcome even the most disgusting of men, and to an extent come away with something of greatness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Story To Remember</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure by now that Thelma and Louse have become archetypes of feminine liberation, and deservedly so. While I don't think this story is feminist in nature (I find it rather universal) it undoubtedly struck more than a few nerves when it was first released, owing to its "good girls gone bad" theme. But to label and moralize this film, or any art for that matter, is to miss the point entirely in my opinion. What we have in Thelma and Louise is a true testament to how life can take us on some unforeseeable excursions, regardless of our intentions, and to how the unexpected can actually end up being just what we needed. Kudos to the screenplay, cast and crew, as well as the American landscape which was an integral part of the story, for conspiring to make an epic film that won't soon be forgotten. Hans Zimmer's hauntingly bittersweet score is deserving of merit for setting and maintaining the mood for the film.</fullReview>

Susan Sarandon gives a flawless performance as Louise and I was hardly surprised, after her performances in such movies as Rocky Horror, Atlantic City and Bull Durham. She's a bankable actress and the best in the game, as far as I'm concerned. Geena Davis is also the perfect Thelma and the two just go together so well. Male bashing? I don't think so - Jimmy was so sweet and I felt real sympathy for the policeman Hal as well. I've seen this movie countless times and know it word for word, but I've never tired of it.

		<fullReview>Susan Sarandon is a delight as always, with her exopthalmia and perky nose. Geena Davis, in her first big role since her appearance in "The Accidental Tourist" is also good, and yummy in a toothy sort of way. The movie is fun to watch but it's silly in a desperate kind of way, slapping each other's palms and going "Wheee!" as they sail off together into the Grand Canyon. (The photography is sunny and splendid.) More important than the performances, more important than the photography, more important than anything else about the film is that it is a perfect illustration of a sociological point -- It is impossible to have bonding without an enemy. People not only bond WITH one another but AGAINST others. (Anyone into social psychology should check out Muzafer Sheriff's classic "Robber's Cave" experiment before seeing this flick.) That's why the president's hooper rating always soars after a national crisis such as a terrorist attack. Suddenly our bonds with each other as "Americans" become more important than internal differences in regional or political viewpoints. This principle goes unspoken in the film. How could it possibly be articulated? We would find ourselves sleeping with the enemy. But the message is there, covert as it is. There isn't a truly sympathetic male in the movie. Harvey Keitel is a relatively benign authority figure, but he is distant and powerless to do do anything other than his duty, which is evidently to put them in a position where they feel they need to turn into part of the scenery. Michael Madsen tries to be understanding and helpful but -- MICHAEL MADSEN? (How about Timothy Carey?) His looks, his demeanor, lightly rasping voice, his smoking, belie his dialogue. We recognize the face of the beast when we see it. That's why Costa-Gavras was nailed by critics for casting the sympathetic looking Yves Montand as a CIA-sponsored torture instructor in "State of Siege". The husband is a stereotypical idiotic patriarchal male. A hitch-hiker, smooth and apologetic and cute, turns out to be a thieving moral idiot when his glands are satisfied. A would-be rapist is a greasy gargoyle. A truck driver is something out of the barroom scene in "Star Wars." The flaw lies not so much in the movie, which is filled with breezy chatter and is exhilarating, and not in the script either. The deeply disturbing aspect of this motion-picture event is the audience's and the critic's response to it. What -- ultimately -- is there to applaud about a movie that tells us that the two genders are by nature or by fate enemies of one another. That one is oppressed and exploited by the other? And that the resolution of the conflict lies not in negotiation but suicide? If that were true, there would be no audience around to clap when Thelma and Louise do their joint nosedive. Yes, it has brio and leaves you feeling amused and happy most of the time, but it leaves a sour taste afterward. In the end this is a tragedy, not the comedy it was meant to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Feministic Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Friendship is something wonderful. We can fill the emptiness of our hearts with people, without it being as complicated as a romantic partner or be as distant as an acquaintance. Female friendships have been glamorized and broadcasted in media for quite some time now, such of those of Sex and the City movies, but one of the strongest movie friendships began in the celebrated chick-flick that takes a strong stance on feminism and male lack of respect for gender equality. This movie is of course, Thelma and Louise.Now let me get this straight, Thelma and Louise may be categorized as drama by the Hollywood Foreign Press and may be advertised as a female thriller-action movie, but no other film has made me laugh so frequent and so urgently since A Fish Called Wanda. I was laughing out loud at the simplest line deliveries that we've probably heard a million times before in movies, but Thelma and Louise puts its own stamp on such scripted lines or situational scenes and makes them shimmer a little brighter than the rest.Which brings me to Thelma and Louise's biggest asset: the screenplay by Callie Khouri. It exploits strong females and their voice in the world. Khouri writes two stereotypical women characters: a housewife and a waitress, then transforms them in a way that they can finally express themselves, which they probably have never done in their entire lives. Thelma and Louise is about the repression of women by men and the male dwindling of their importance to either sex or property. The film proves there's more to women than what they are allowed to expose by their husbands or society's rules. But don't get me wrong, it's a fun, fun, movie, not a boring lecture on feminist views.The two actresses who lead the picture with courage, Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis, excel, taking this picture to new heights in female-driven movies. Sarandon is a force to be reckoned with as Louise. Though many have said she's too old for the part, Sarandon puts her soul into the role making her as grounded as she becomes wild. Davis, though isn't as impressive as Sarandon, commits to Thelma thoroughly. Thelma and Louise is an exciting, hilarious, and interesting experience to take with these two characters. The film's biggest fault is that it lags in the middle, when the two characters split up with two different men. As the men control the picture for those fifteen minutes, the movie almost dries up and shrivels like wet paper. Thankfully, the section ends, the girls are reunited, and their bond becomes even deeper as their crime world deepens. Thelma and Louise aren't bad people, but women pushed to the point which they end up at the film's closing. When men demean women's intelligence and significance to the world, Thelma and Louise is an exaggerated statement of may happen. Ridley Scott, directs the picture with great accessibility for the audience to join in and rejoice in these two strong female characters.Rating: 9/10Grade: A</fullReview>

It is never less than hugely entertaining, with a sparkling script, an arresting story, great direction from Scott and lovely cinematography and scenery. Also Hans Zimmer's score, while not his best, is quite nice and somewhat different to what I have come to expect from him. The cast are wonderful, Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon are brilliant leads, and Harvey Keitel is solid. It was also nice to see a young Brad Pitt. I know Thelma and Louise caused controversy at the time with the issue of the sight of women with guns, but that makes no difference to me. All that matters is that the movie entertained me and it did that superbly. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Daryl the Dipstick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Darryl, Thelma's husband, is the ultimate dipstick in Thelma and Louise. Not only is he an arrogant drama king, he is dangerous. So Thelma does not let Darryl near the coffeemaker or the microwave. Darryl is bad enough in his own way. The guy in the parking lot is an entirely different species of jerk, and he has no limitations in the way he treats women. So after a slam "bang" with the iridescent Thelma, the roughneck or longshoreman is real quiet while Harvey Kietel looks the situation over. By then, Louise and Thelma are heading for better pastures.After Kietel interviewed the waitress, and she makes her final statement about Thelma and Louise, the viewer gets the idea that Louise's experience in Texas was a major motivator. Because the detective is now beyond establishing the fact that one of the women was playing Saturday Night Special with the real thing. So the detective(Kietel) is trying to define a "clear" motive for the shooting. Since nobody else seems to be a witness.Enter Jimmy. Louise's boyfriend promises a big bailout for Louise. Must be nice...I mean...anyway. So the two are on their way to meet Jimmy somewhere in Arkansaw. Thelma picks up quite a bit of liquor.The detective on the case is talking to his boss and the idea of "The Bureau" comes up and this obviously means the FBI. Thelma and Louise have headed down south. Way down south. Thelma calls the ultimate dipstick(her husband Daryl), which is a mistake even though they are married. Finally Thelma tells Daryl to go do something. Not nice to print it here.Enter Brad Pitt. No name, no number, but a list in several precincts and plenty counties. Pitt becomes a large part of the story, but he teaches Thelma a few things. Soon the two female outlaws are back on the road with a fistful of diamonds.What's great: In a movies listed as comedy, the trucker is pretty hilarious, but severely bombs out with the two outlaws. One who is sweet, kind of flighty, and the other who is nothing but business. Geena Davis is a tall drink of water.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is a "chick-flick"...but it is well done....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a story where, when you stand up for yourself, everything seems to go wrong. Thelma and Louise are two ordinary types...one a housebound wife, the other a worldy-wise restaurant waitress. They decide to make a get-away for the week-end. Thelma, the more timid of the two, does not ask her husband, knowing he has a short fuse. But they head out just the same. At a road stop, Thelma is almost raped in the parking lot by some guy from inside the bar. Louise steps in, with the pistol neither has used..but which they brought along for protection...and stops the rapist. They try to go on their way, but the rapist mouths off with profanities and insults galore. Louise gets ticked, and shoots and kills the would-be rapist...and they make their escape. The rest of the film deals with how they handle themselves in the face of adversity. Their belief is that they can't get any fair treatment or justice, and they were probably right to some extent. But, afterall, the guy would have raped Thelma if Louise had not intervened. But now, Thelma and Louise are wanted criminals on the run, and the action escalates to the point where they no longer resemble the simple people they were at the beginning of this story. In a way, the story takes on an anti-male tone but, to their credit, their actions are taken mostly against those guys who have exhibited some real "cave-man" type of behavior. Soon, Thelma and Louise are committing crimes as a matter of survival...and not just simple solicitation, either. It was an interesting watch, because of the sympathetic portrayal of two ordinary people who just got in over their heads. And after they had passed a certain point, it was simply too late to turn back...to their way of thinking. This is a surprisingly good film, and how Sarandon and Davis both lost out on the Academy Awards to--of all people--Jodie Foster ,is a mystery that stupify Sherlock Holmes. One more thing, Harvey Keitel is woefully miscast as a southern police detective. He cannot shed his Brooklyn accent or New York attitude, and he just does not come off as believable in this vehicle. This may be the worst performance--or the worst casting--for Keitel that I have seen. He is otherwise very good in the roles that he plays. Other than that, this is an OK film and it merits a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thelma &amp; Louise was made around the time when Ridley Scott, a foremost visual stylist, trendsetter of cyberpunk and atmospheric epics, was beginning to make films with contemporary settings to prove his capability of producing good work without the aid of special effects. It reveals the perceived untapped talent of Scott for high-spirited humor and pulsating American visuals. He reimagines the buddy film with such novelty and vitality that the genre gives an absolutely fresh impression. He discovered unforeseen assets within both of its stars, Sarandon and Davis, who are artlessly paired as the lively and unique title characters.Thelma &amp; Louise also seemed to come at a time when Hollywood liked hard-hitting social conflict in the form of epic journeys through the country...Wild at Heart, Kalifornia, Natural Born Killers. Since the earliest movies, train travel was a popular motif, due to cinema's fascination with movement. When cars and motorbikes became more widespread, movement could be intimately connected with a character's individual development, and from the 1940s onwards, outsiders were continually portrayed as motorized nomads. Similar to the western, the road movie generally concentrates on solitary men who only feel free if they're in constant and restless movement.This classic picture is the version of that genre that either hadn't been made yet or in a way that reached people. Its central voyagers are renegades from an oppressive, male-dominated culture. They become intoxicated with freedom from double standards, fragile egos that must be gratified at the expense of their personal feelings, meaningless tradition, that they defy any and every rule they find themselves theoretically or practically confronting. From our introduction to this meek, submissive housewife and struggling waitress to their evolution to heat-packing fugitives impulsively destroying gas trucks, we've witnessed an epic journey in some sense on par with Ridley's literal epics. Increasingly more desperate, yet increasingly less confined, they show their true primal colors and awaken to themselves. One of them encapsulates it quite well in her own predisposed context: "You've always been crazy, this is just the first chance you've had to express yourself."The film develops a double perspective. The first follows the two best friends, who become more daring, more independent and less tolerant with every obstacle that crosses their path. Thelma begins to get the hang of being free and getting her own way. She locks a policeman into his own trunk at gunpoint when he tries to arrest them, and then blows up a petrol tanker when the driver directs a stream of sexist comments at them as he drives by. The second perspective shows the police investigations. Detective Slocumb's a sensitive cop who suspects the truth and tries to mediate, but he's powerless to stop the machinery of the FBI once it begins to roll. Frankly, this just seems like a point-counterpoint argument, where the filmmakers feel compelled to flesh out one male character as a non-chauvinistic guardian angel, an anomaly discounting potential grounds for accusations of an offensive stereotyping of men. The story would've been sufficiently effective were it to purely follow the two protagonists on their own subjective excursion. We understand why they would view men this way. Did Schrader feel compelled to supplement an altruistic black character to Taxi Driver to offset Travis' racism?Nevertheless, Keitel's scenes are very strong. Early on, he has an unusually strong scene where he questions a waitress at the club where the two women commit their first crime. Whether or not his character's established for said reasons, his characterization's not that shallow. Keitel gives it as many dimensions as he has the allotment to. The interaction of the cast is predominantly very engaging. Ridley seems not only to see his landscape, his visual style, but the essential nature of his leads, and the difference between moments which connect with that essence and don't, and whether or not Davis and Sarandon are always authentic or not---again I think that has more to do with the sometimes mawkish writing---they connect to their deepest resources, trust the moment, even when it may feel hackneyed. Their dynamic between each other, both on-screen and subtextually, is always handled sincerely and sensitively.And yet, I think we're only offered maybe three or four complex and layered characters in all, who undergo change throughout the plot, while the rest are eyeroll-inducing stereotypes of some degree of dirty, chauvinistic, beer-bellied men and other stock characters who unconsciously act antagonistically upon the two main characters virtually like an exploitation film. The essential flaw of Thelma &amp; Louise is that it attempts to straddle the line between the two renegades' subjective immersion in their liberation and the realities of the outside world. With realistic characters who intermingle with total clichés, it becomes alternately a social issue drama that periodically doubles back on itself, and a fascinating road movie about self-actualization.Regardless, it undoubtedly touched audiences very deeply and has earned its status as a contemporary classic for that reason. The elements of Thelma &amp; Louise that are effective are extremely effective, to the point that its minor shortcomings can be swiftly excused in the bigger scheme of it. I'm still uncertain of the last shot. It's a freeze frame that fades to white, which is fine, except it does so with ungainly hurriedness. I can't help but agree with Ebert that it's disconcerting to become engaged in a movie that takes 128 minutes to bring you to a conclusion that its makers seem to be anxious about. But fading to white doesn't stop it from having happened as the conclusion, and it's a beautiful example, in terms of our two main characters, of high romance and how to end a story. What matters is not the tying up of loose ends, but the ultimate reaction to the whole sequence of events.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wonderful MisAdventures of Thelma &amp; Louise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was, indeed, fantastic. It's no wonder that BOTH Geena Davis (Thelma) and Susan Sarandon (Louise) got nominated for the Best Actress Oscar. Though it's unfortunate that both lose, in this special case, that's completely acceptable for two solid reasons: Jodie Foster, who won her second Oscar for The Silence of the Lambs rightfully won for the role of her life and that it would enormously hard to decide between the two ladies of Thelma &amp; Louise ? they were both EXCELLENT.I want to make something clear from before: this is NOT a chick-flick. And this is NOT Bonnie &amp; Clyde. This is a movie of two going nowhere ladies who finally put their hair down for a weekend away ? but run into an enormous series of unfortunate events. It's a story of justice, injustice, survival, redemption, saviors, trust, love, bonding and non-sexual life partners. In reference to the "Bonnie &amp; Clyde" remarks I've heard attached to this movie, I have two words: Phooey! B&amp;C planned things out..our T&amp;L heroes reacted to their environment to survive, rarely (until the final quarter) were their "bad deeds" intentional or maliciously.Oh, and I've heard that this movie is a man-hating film filled with vengeful, dare I?, bitches. For that, I have four words: Go to hell. These girls were mistreated, viciously at times, by males, yes, but they did not seek out revenge on them ? they wanted to be free of them. Free of pain, solitude, abandonment, rudeness and abuse ? mentally, physically and sexually. They had NOTHING against all men, but if you put such redneck, back wooded, narrow/simple minded fellas in front of them?be somewhere else.Louise is neat and straight-laced. She's a waitress, which might seem dead-end, but she's thoroughly content. Thelma is high-strung, a child in a woman's body and trapped (settled) herself in a loveless and abusive marriage. Louise's plan is to get away for the weekend and take her BFF to a cabin to have some wild nights. Thelma, of course wants to go, but is worried about controlling husband Darryl (McDonald) saying no. Taking a chance ? one that will change everyone's life, soon ? she agrees and slips away while he's at work.Justifiably antsy ? she practically forces prudish (with reason; sit back to watch the layers unravel and discover why) Louise to stop at a honky tonk. Unable to contain herself, even for seconds, Thelma overindulges in alcohol and becomes victim to a regular's, Harlan (Carhart), unwanted advances. In comes Louise to the rescue while stripping one layer on her current way of life.And that's all I'm revealing and that all takes place in the first, say 20 minutes with another 110 to go. Discover the magic all on your own. See the incredible depth of both Sarandon and Davis. I couldn't even begin to describe how well they preformed. Though I loved (for once ? meaning, I have liked her a lot in the past, but here it was genuine love) Davis's performance, it was Sarandon that shot to the top of my favorite actresses at the time. If you could not feel her angst, if you could not see Louise was alive and aware and weary of the future and her mental breakdown of the walls she put up ? you?are?blind.Each time I watch this movie, I pick up on something new. Perhaps, I did see it before ? but it's always fun to experience such greatness for the first time, more than once ? but in this viewing, there's a beautiful and dramatic scene of Louise standing alone in the dark desert surrounded by complete silence. The sun is rising. I have a feeling she wanted to see the sun rise for the final time as she felt she was tired, so tired. Not just of running, but maintaining the wall she built. Maybe she wanted to experience God's gift, but I'm going with my first theory.Did I mention beyond the wonderful depth of the characters ? ones that will be etched in my mind with warm memories until I die ? there was an excellent soundtrack (one I have listened to literally hundreds of times, and I really don't favor country at all) and a beautifully mournful score, suburb cinematography ? even though I hate the desert, they made it magical, and it had a PERFECT blend of comedic tones mixed with serious moments. These types of moments, I've experienced myself. I've been through some extreme times in my life, and instead of blankly crying about it, which was hard to hold back, I had to make some loud joke and laugh until I did finally cry. There's a beautiful scene, where you think its set up for Thelma to joke/crack up and she laughs her ass off and mimics the gun sound (BANG!) that came from the weapon Louise used to kill a man, not so long prior. Louise doesn't find this funny one bit, in which Thelma agrees. It isn't. But what are you going to do? How are you going to handle it? These are scenes, some small and subtle, some larger, that are real life. Director Scott and the leads captured this with nothing less than perfection.Despite its minor and I mean very, very few, flaws, such as how quick the Keitel character both tracked them but kept up with them (believable in 2010, but I don't think so in 1991) and some over-the-top clichéd characters floating around ? making it easy for our heroes to hate and disseminate, the greatness in this movie pushes it straight to the top of my rating board and directly into my top ten of all time films.Watch it. Experience it. Love it. Learn something about how films should be shot, how acting should be taught and perhaps, about yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thelma &amp; Louise breathed new life into old genres while vividly reimagining them.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This brilliant film puts women in the driving seat. The story is about two bored small-town women (Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis) who go on the run after a fun weekend together goes horribly wrong, and one of them shoots a man who was trying to rape her.Thelma &amp; Louise is an exhilarating, adrenalin-fuelled road film with Sarandon and Davis making the most of the exuberant characters gifted to them by writer Callie Khouri; it's a welcome aberration in director Ridley Scott's career, but he doesn't put a foot wrong, and the film's elevation to classic feminist tract seems utterly merited. The British Film Institute published a book about the film in 2000, as part of a Modern Classics series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some may ask, why on earth is that dumb axx using this summary for his comment and be triggered to hit the report button. But go slow and easy, read my comment.I was caught from the very first scene to the magical end. I cried and I felt an inside happiness, like I haven't felt once in any movie before.This road trip was also a road trip into my own soul. Carried by those 2 great actresses I was able to slip any restraints of so-called manhood. With Harvey Keitel as the major male protagonist as a backup for all man, I am able to state, what I did in this summary.From the very first moment, when Keitel enters the house of the waitress and discovers this left scene of a womans dream, Keitel explains that gender never should be a frontier in understanding. Just with passion and emphatic understanding, Keitel understands from the very first moment, to get all men into this story and to follow the dream of 2 women until their very end.So yes! I am proud to be a man and to wipe my tears. I did that often in this movies. My absolute highlight-moment prior the ending was undoubtly the night scene in the dessert with the muscic and Serandon behind the the steer wheel.A masterpiece of Roadmovie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My god! I wasn't expecting Thelma to do what she did to that licentious truck driver who had been making funny gestures at Louise and her. When they pointed their guns at him, I was expecting Louise to shoot him dead. Like she shot Harlan. And I was quite sure she would do it for what had happened to her in Texas was now known. Anyways, I was also expecting both the women to spare him because they had already been charged for homicide and they knew it. So I was like maybe they won't shoot another man, they are just going to rob him of all his money and clothes and stuff and give his truck some flat tyres and drive away. And then I was also expecting each one to pump at least 2-3 bullets into that man. But then, what Thelma did was incredible. She shot at the tyres, Louise shot at the tyres too. And then Thelma does the unthinkable. She shoots at the oil tanker and blows it up. That was? that was amazing.But then, THELMA &amp; LOUISE is amazing. Every moment of it. What these girls do on the run, their encounter with other people, the things they talk, everything makes up for a superior movie-watching experience. Some scenes and lines are so fresh in my mind. I liked the final Grand Canyon scene. It was evident that neither Thelma nor Louise had seen the Grand Canyon before and had just heard about it. The look on their faces tells it all. This scene is quite ironical because it sort of gives away the ending. It sort of tells the viewer that after coming so far, after having the drive of their lives, after seeing this spectacular Grand Canyon, these girls are of course not going to give up, not going to return. And that is what happens.The lines, I think, are quote-worthy. Lines like ? "when a woman's crying like that she isn't having any fun", "Think you've found your calling? Maybe, the call of the wild", "You be sweet to your wife, my husband wasn't sweet so look how I turned out" and "looks like the army, all this for us" stay in mind long after the film is over and they keep coming back even after days and make one smile and thoughtful.Thelma's transformation from an un-worldly-wise housewife to a woman who learns to take control of situations (and her life) and also rob a store after being 'properly laid' then duped by JD is both humorous and tragic. I liked the scene between Louise and Jimmy in the hotel room. Jimmy has flown across three states to see Louise and Louise doesn't want to return to him. I like how Louise pulls Jimmy's head and they kiss. Plus, the tension between Louise and Jimmy in one room and Thelma having the sex of her life with JD in another room have been put together with nice effect. There's a couple trying to bring their love-life on track in one room, and there's a runaway housewife having a wild romp with a good-looking stranger in another room.THELMA &amp; LOUISE may be about friendship. But it is also about learning to face things, learning to take control, about standing up to something wrong or undesirable, and it is about emancipation. A great story, told very effectively. And, yes, photographed excellently.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wish I could say I felt better about this film{{Spoilers Possible}}</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first caught this movie at the campus movie theater(discount admission,can't beat that!),it was somewhat fresh off the movie theaters,not yet on video(this was 1991,of course)and the controversy that swirled around this film was still pretty fresh,so I went into watching this with some trepidation. I was a nineteen year old boy who had little to no clue about females(one could probably say that much hasn't changed for me),and what I knew about this film was that it was considered by some critics to be "mlae bashing" and unfair to men,stereotyping them as either rapists or abusers. After seeing this the first time,while I was impressed with the sharpness of the film's dialog,acting and unique story,I still came away feeling depressed,though I couldn't really put my finger on why,expect for the fact that the ending was quite depressing. As I found it,I didn't find this film to be THAT male-bashing or anti-dude. I just found it a downer,in short.Sixteen years later,watching it again on TV,I found myself not feeling a whole lot differently,which amazes me,since usually when I see a movie again after a gap of time,I usually find something about it that I didn't before. Precious little if anything did I find new about this show,save that I found that WHY I found this depressing was much more nebulous. It wasn't one thing,it was everything,chief among them the fact that the fate of these two for whom you've probably come to like or deign some sympathy for are INEVITIBLY destined for a tragic fate.The adventure that begins as a simple Girls' vacation between best friends Thelma Dickinson(Geena Davis,post-Oscar,pre-pre-pre "Commander in Chief") and Louise Sawyer(Susan Sarandon,kickin'it at forty-four,hot as ever and tough)turns into a fugitive run as the ladies avoid a rape,kill a guy,get robbed,hold at least two different men at gunpoint(one of whom is a highway patrolman)on the highway and do damage to an oil tanker. All the while,they're pursued by a feckless fed(HArvey Keitel,in what seems to be role #776 of a thousand),seduced by a wayward slikster(Brad Pitt in his first major role,shirtless nearly the whole time)and fretted over by the girls' respective boyfriends(Christopher MacDonald and Michael Madsen). As they keep on running from their lives,they start to realize there's no turning back as their bond gets stronger.I think it bears some repeating: while I believe this movie is basically well-done and captivating,the harrowing and depressing chain of events really strike me as being a delightful movie ONLY if you're some sort of nihilistic feminist with a slight streak of sociopath.IN sum,this movie--sporting impressive direction by Ridley Scott and a daring script by Callie Khouri--is what I'd call a downer. Not for any specific reason or quality,but for the whole total package.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>..I wish I had a friendship like this..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thank heavens they saved most of the negative opinions for the end of this site. Like many of the "users", I can enjoy this movie whenever. Once I find a film I love, it doesn't matter whether I truly understand it or not....if the characters are well-developed, and I can see their importance to the story - and the storyline is something different than my mundane life - I am hooked to the end. Fortunately for most American viewers, they have not experienced some of the almost accidental situations in life which can turn to be unsavory and life-threatening.I was not familiar with the plot of "Themla and Louise", but knew it was extremely popular. A personal situation hugely influenced me to love this movie: I love to drive cross-country, even alone. I have friends who are about as different in personality as "Thelma and Louise" were....I have visualized the same kind of journey as the two girls take, purely for fun, without the desperation of their dash for Mexico - just get in the car and start from the Pacific Coast and drive East. What a blast it would be to act nutty and fun-loving, as these girls did, in a world that is quickly becoming true insanity.....that Themla and Louise could zoom across our country, as close as two people could be without being lovers, enthralled me. Didn't and won't ever happen - well, maybe. I'm ambivalent - my personality changes to the atmosphere I'm in. So, I thoroughly relate to "Themla and Louise".Every scene was filled with dedicated actors/actresses who did their job well. If you read the homepage of this site, you'll discover Susan Sarandon made suggestions about many of the scenes, Ridley Scott being the wiser for accepting her insight. By now, I suppose everyone knows the story of a world-wise waitress whose very happy relationship with her man couldn't prevent a "fishing-trip" with her friend, who was trapped being married to a smart-ass-cheating husband. "Louise" (Susan Sarandon) takes only a few personal things; "Thelma" (Geena Davis) takes everything but the kitchen-sink. She could have had a premonition she would never be "home" again, the trip providing her escape. Along the way, "Thelma" convinces "Louise" she desperately needs a couple of drinks. They party at a country-western roadhouse with line-dancing patrons. Fun start for the trip, but things get ugly in the parking-lot - won't say what - which shocks "Louise" into a deadly-serious incident, necessitating the dash for Mexico without driving through Texas - she won't say why. This prevents them from traveling on major highways, but provides us with the gorgeous panorama of The West. "Thelma" is already a nutcake; to see "Lousie" shaky and unsure certainly sets the scene for some exciting activity."Thelma" gets the hots for a hitchhiker while "Louise" is telephoning her man for money....he doesn't wire it, he takes it to their motel in Oklahoma City. A scene between "Louise" and her love-without-question man is bruising and tender. The scene between "Thelma" and the hitchhiker (whom "Louise" has allowed "Thelma" to persuade her to let him join them on their wild journey) is screechingly funny - and sexy - and innocently instructs "Thelma" with the plan to regain the money "Louise's" man has brought, and the hitchhiker (Brad Pitt in his young beauty) makes-off with. In a scene which shows us "Thelma" isn't as ditzy as we believe, the dash for Mexico resumes. The girls are smart enough to realize they are "wanted" criminals - their back-and-forth telephone-conversations with the cops, who eventually catch-up to them, is the basis of some wild chase-scenes that too soon puts "Thelma and Louise" at the end of their road....."together".........Pitt is a "pretty boy", but plays his role to the hilt. Brava to Davis and Sarandon! Harvey Keital escaped his usually "heavy" roles and showed a real empathy for the few intelligent cops there are. Whoever played Sarandon's lover - never heard of him - was touching in his manly, overly macho role. There is so much I can't write about without giving away the plot.All that action with the cop-cars and 'copters in the "chase"-scenes was amazing and added the necessary desperation to the girls' situation. That they evaded it all until they came to the point where there was no escape only cemented their friendship - TOGETHER, no matter what. I repeat, I wish I had a friend like that.The ending of this epic film could not have been different, totally making a sequel impossible - it could never have been as vibrant as this movie was. Leave it alone! and revel in this "road-show" (?) as it speeds across our beautiful country. The movie is more than a herald to the way our women have evolved. The movie deserves another, major release with all the red carpets and hoopla - viva "Thema and Louise".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very upsetting sexual assault scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>a decent movie, but it is worth noting that the attempted rape is VERY traumatic to watch, even though the attempt is interrupted. For anyone who is sensitive to watching sexual assaults, this one will be hard to forget or get past in order to concentrate on the rest of the movie. and it is also depressing because the woman who is assaulted ends up dying, which is just rotten... she didn't even shoot the guy. so you feel bad for this poor woman on many levels, and unless you consider death to be a victory, it can leave you feeling pretty beat up.I would recommend fast-forwarding through the assault scene, and not even listening to it at all. it's revolting. but worth watching the rest of it.</fullReview>

Does this bother anyone else? I think anyone who has been in that situation isn't so quick to jump into bed with anyone (even if it is Brad Pitt)....I think this part of the story line was put in to show how free and liberated Thelma was; however, I think its quite implausible. I'm very surprised this was allowed to stay in the movie, especially because a woman has written/directed the movie. Does anybody else feel this way or am I overreacting and not allowing myself to realize its "just a movie?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Road movie with a twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thelma &amp; Louise is a celebration of life. Ridley Scott makes a very different film once again and seems to refuse to be pigeon-holed. There is much comment about this being a "male bashing" film. I would say ignore it: I have found this movie to provide great entertainment each time I have watched it. The protagonists are likable and, as with every good anti-hero, we start wanting them to get away with it. Road movies usually appeal to me but they can be variable in quality. Thelma &amp; Louise is one which holds you from start to finish. The storyline is far fetched at times but I doubt that the film was intended to be super realistic, rather to provide an engaging thrill ride. They got the job done without question.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thelma and Louise are the best of friends. Both girls are both in relationships, but decide to take a break together and go away for a while, taking a road trip. One day on the way though, Thelma gets talking to a guy who ends up nearly raping her, so Louise shoots him. Instead of taking the break away that they intended to do, Thelma and Louise now decide to go to Mexico, so they won't get arrested, etc. The American police are on hot on there trail though, trying to hunt them down.Thelma and Louise features an Oscar winning cast, including Susan Sarandon, Geena Davis, the brilliant Harvey Keitel and of course Brad Pitt in his first major movie role here. They all give great performances.Thelma and Louise is a great comedy movie about friendship. It really does show you what the best of friends will do for each-other. The whole cast make everything seem so real and the movie is one whole adventure all the way though. The movie is really funny too has loads of great moments, especially when Thelma and Louise lock the policeman in the car and when that weird guy, gets his truck set on fire by Thelma and Louise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guys can learn from what they may not like about this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I really love this movie. It is tightly written, has beautiful cinematography, and is incredibly emotionally involving. I know that many men dislike this movie, and I don't blame them. They are placed in the uncomfortable and unfamiliar position of having no role models of their own gender, where every male is the movie is seriously flawed, underdeveloped, stereotyped, and peripheral to the action of the story. Well, guess what? Welcome to the everyday life of a woman watching almost any Hollywood Movie. Consider all the movies out there where every woman is either a sexual fantasy, the hero's rewards for his labors, a middle age corporate bitch, the loving giving woman with no personality or life of her own, a prostitute, etc etc. Women in most movies are serously flawed, underdeveloped, stereotyped, and peripheral to the action of the story. Take the recent horror movie What Lies Beneath (which is excellent, by the way). When was the last time Hollywood made the concerns and fears of a fortysomething woman the central driving force of a story? Do you think Hollywood matches nineteen-year-old actresses with sixty year old male stars because that is what women want to see? I know that the only way that men can enjoy Thelma and Louise is by trying to identify with the female characters (which can be done, but requires an effort). Women would also like to see movies where we don't have to be able to identify solely with the male characters in order to enjoy it. Many men are also disturbed (and rightly so...it was supposed to be disturbing) by the way Louise chose to solve her problem with Thelma's rapist, but were they disturbed by the scene in Total Recall where Arnold Schwartzneggar shoots Sharon Stone point blank and tells her, "Consider this a divorce"? I didn't hear all the public outcry over that mean spirited bit of misogyny. Men are just not used to being treated in movies the way women are treated on a daily basis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Chick Flick for Guys!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How's this for twisted .... Take two of Hollywood's brightest actress. Gussy them all up so they look hotter than ever. Give them a cool car. Put a gun in their hand. And take them on a hot road trip across the southwestern United States. And then, call this feminist propaganda. It's like telling a guy not to touch the lap dancer! Pure torture!Thelma and Louise opens up in a hick town somewhere in Arkansas. The title characters are best friends. Thelma (Geena Davis) is a neglected housewife. Her husband treats her bad and most likely has affairs on the side. Louise (Susan Sarandon) is a waitress in a greasy spoon. She's the smart one who obviously gets by well on her own. The story opens as they are about to embark on a weekend fishing trip. When they stop at a local honky tonk for a few drinks Thelma is pursued by a local lunkhead who just can't take no for an answer. When he tries to rape Thelma out in the parking lot he is stopped by Louise, who pulls a gun on him. The local lunkhead has a filthy mouth and uses it to the point where he offends Louise. Louise shoots him dead.From here the story motors on. The girls run into one anti-man adventure after another. Harvey Kietel is the only man who can truly see what they're all about, but he's the cop who wants them in custody. Brad Pitt, in a debut role is a charming bankrobber who teaches Thelma a thing or two about... er .. a thing or two.Thelma and Louise is a great film, and no doubt about it, it ranks up there with the great action flicks. The acting here is first rate! Both Davis and Sarandon give their all for these characters. You can feel their tears, their laughter, their pain and their fear! Their Oscar nominations were justly deserved. Who was better though? Hmmm ... tough question. they seemed to compliment each other so well.The film is beautiful to watch too. Ridley Scott directs a picture that captures the landscapes of industrial Arkansas and barron New Mexico, with a story that never stops. OK, so the film is a little preachy, and yes slightly feminist. But I enjoyed that. I found myself cheering right up until the climactic end (which you probably know about already). Take it seriously if you want to, but I say enjoy. This is a fun flick!</fullReview>

The cast for this film was perfect Thelma (G.Davis) Semmed to be a quite vulnerable and then steals the lead by becoming the hard gal Louise (S.Sarandon) is the lead in the beginning and Thelma takes over for a while and at the end they compare as one and stand for what was right 'WE ARE NOT GOING DOWN EVEN IF IT MEANT THEY DIED' THEY DIED FOR WHAT WAS RIGHT Thelma and Louise is a must see movie 10/10 about fighting for what right.</fullReview>

Maybe that is a little harsh, but Thelma &amp; Louise stand up and face the music and outrun the law until a final wonderful touching scene. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon are a perfect best-friends team, and their friendship shows through their parts on-screen in the decisions that they have to make.

		<fullReview>Although it had potential, the good cast just couldn't save "Thelma &amp; Louise" from mediocrity. The story is about two girls: Thelma (Davis), is an inexperienced girl who is married to an oppressive husband, Darryl (McDonald), and she now longs to enjoy two days of freedom offered to her by her more rebellious friend, Louise (Sarandon). Louise has invited Thelma to spend two days in her boss' house; unfortunately, when they begin their excursion, things turn nasty soon: Somebody tries to rape Thelma, and Louise kills him in her attempt to save her. From that moment on, the two girls have become fugitives. Among those chasing them is Officer Hal (Keitel) who sympathizes with them a little, Darryl, who has become berserk, and Louise's erstwhile lover, Jimmy (Madsen), who wants to make up with her.Although the plot sounds good, it completely fails to deliver. More specifically, the film becomes an incoherent following of the two girls' mischiefs, who become more and more improbable in the passage of time. Despite the director's best intentions, the viewer has difficulty in empathizing with either Thelma or Louise, as their acts do not make any sense from some point onward. The actors deliver an above-average performance, although I would expect more from Harvey Keitel.The film gets just a pass grade, 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>--Spoilers ahead--Those who claim that Thelma &amp; Louise is a chick flick or a feminist movie must have just tasted the latest fancy drug. Thelma &amp; Louise are 2 poor-frustrated-uptight ladies, who accidentally-unfortunately commit a crime. So that, after a moment of panic, they try their best to flee from the police, which they keep being afraid of till the end. Their getaway yet makes them reveal and express themselves on the loose. But at the same time, they can't help going on phoning their sweet husbands/men, before phoning back just to talk with the brilliant policeman who's after them and give him enough time to find where they call from. Oh yeah. Meanwhile, they don't forget to behave as righters of wrongs with a dull teamster (what a sweet message), to have great conversations like 'how beautiful a night', 'you are wonderful', 'I'm awake, you know, wide-awake like I've never been before', 'we've already lost all that we had to lose', or, with Brad Pitt, 'Thelma how is it you ain't got any kids? I mean God gets you something special, I think you oughta pass it on' (cause women are only made to make babies you know) and so on. And of course, we quickly learn that Louise has a heavy past actually, in Texas, yes she's been raped in another time. Therefore, you know, she's a victim, hey, that's why she shot the man, it's a ?legitimate-- revenge (oh, OK, I see).Afterwards, their marvelous road trip allows them to outrun obviously-stupid police cars in such gorgeous shots that show dozens (if not hundreds or thousands) of cops cars and a helicopter behind their nice and lonely little car. And guess what, they eventually realize they've taken a road that leads them to nowhere but to the top of a huge cliff above the Great Canyon. Terrific. So, after once more being portrayed as 2 poor victims by the so-smart Harvey Weinstein's character ('stop making them suffer' or 'hey you're gonna shoot women', hey right, feeble women can't be shot), they kiss each other, weep a little bit (coz feeble women ?a pleonasm certainly-- are used to weeping you know) and throw themselves into the emptiness. What a great script. Mix the whole thing with tons of moralistic clichés and some unbearable pop country music and you got it. This outstanding final metaphor just aims at making sure that you understand how appropriate and conventional, ie impoverished and empty, this insipid guys flick is</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thelma and Louise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without spoling too much.An absolutely terrible movie about two depressed lesbians driving around having arguments with men in a desert.There's a bit of a police chase, but that's right near the end. Fast forward it if necessary, or stick with more familiar films of the genre such as 'Death proof' or that one with that truck in it. At they still retain elements of the super natural (like the magic car or winged beings) but this lacks everything, no real plot, no explosions or no shocks, just depressed lesbians shouting at men in a desert.Awful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hateful Trash - Only A Woman Who Hates Men Would Like This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a sick-minded bigoted anti-male tome by a small-minded hateful writer (I will prove this claim simply by quoting her in a moment and you can judge by yourself). Nothing justifies writing a hateful film yet that's exactly what Thelma &amp; Louise writer Callie Khouri (by her own admission) does here - as you will see in the quote I'm about to show you (which I can't even quote completely because - while IMDb provides the complete quote elsewhere, it won't let its reviewers use the same vile language!!! Tells you something, doesn't it?). In fact, her response to those who are offended by this piece of trash (namely the quote I provide below) is so offensive in and of itself that it surpasses the offenses of this film. I would hope Hollywood pays attention to what Callie Khourie has to say and shuns her for her hate-filled mind. No bigotry should be tolerated - anywhere in our society - and Ms. Khourie admits to bigotry when she tries to justify the hatred she expresses in Thelma &amp; Louise in this quote (FYI: you can find this quote on the IMDb site itself - just click on Khourie's name where she's listed as writer and scroll down to her quotes):"Kiss my a**, kiss my a**. I was raised in this society. Let them get their deal worked out about the way women are treated in films before they start hassling me about the way men are treated. There's a whole genre of films known as 'exploitation' based on the degradation of women and as a whole bunch of redneck critics extolling its virtues, and until there's a subgenre of women doing the same thing to men in numbers too numerous to court, as is the case with exploitation film, then just shut the f*** up."Very nice language, Ms. Khourie. You're a real class act. And, in quoting you directly, I think I've proved my point. Khouri - in case you missed it - is saying she's justified in putting out hateful trash, movies like Thelma &amp; Louise that is, and present men as foul unredeemable pigs because she thinks that's how women are portrayed in other movies. Really! Well at least she pleads guilty to her sin, that of portraying half the world in a hateful light. We need not prove that she did so as a result. The question then remains: do we want writers like this in Hollywood? (This is precisely why people are no longer flocking to the movie theatres. They don't want to be offended by trash like Thelma &amp; Louise.) Shame on Hollywood for putting out this kind of trash by a writer who reveals herself to be a hater of men and someone without a stitch of humanity or class. Hate is hate is hate and it is no better because the hater is female than it is when the hater is male. And - by the way - what movies is Ms. Khourie referring to, the ones she's bashing? Let's find out - because I bet that you that in and of itself will reveal how very warped she really is. Meantime - Ms. Khourie: we don't need your films, thank you. If you want to vent your bile do it elsewhere. All I can say is viewers like myself have a choice. And I choose never again to be victimized by Ms. Khouri's hatred - and I will exercise my rights to this by avoiding any movie she's associated with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feminist malarkey posing as road flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Sin City came out, feminists were in an uproar. Why are men the heroes and women the prostitutes, murderers, and hookers? They asked, well, this is just as guilty of such treason with such neo-feminist malarkey posing as a thriller. Here, the men are depicted as low-lives, perverts, rapists, abusers, boozers, murderers, robbers, and wussies while the women are heroes! Puh-lease. Thelma and Louise is an unrealistic melodramatic waste of time. They kill a man for unjustifiably and sadistically, rob a store for no reason, and taunt others, while we're supposed to root for them? Give me a break. In a modern age of feminists who want to depict women as heroes and men as simpering morons, this just takes the cake as a real waste of time. It's just ridiculous. Had this film even been remotely feminist as it aimed to, in the end they'd have taken their medicine with all their might instead of romanticizing suicide. What a waste. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Original Crime Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The crime drama Thelma &amp; Louise is directed by Ridley Scott and stars Susan Sarandon, Geena Davis, Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, and Brad Pitt. The film takes place in modern day Arkansas.Thelma (Davis) and Louise (Sarandon) are best friends and really need to go on a trip to escape the pressures of everyday life. Thelma's husband is extremely controlling and does not value her at all, so she is reluctant at first to go on the trip but eventually accepts. Louise's boyfriend Jimmy (Madsen) is a cool guy that really loves Louise and it is safe to say that if Louise doesn't love him she definitely feels quite strongly about him. While the two are at a bar Thelma gets quite drunk and a man tries to take advantage of her in the parking lot. Well when everything comes to an end Louise shoots the man to protect Thelma but they must go on the run. Can a police detective, Hal (Keitel), solve the murder and put the women in prison? Or will they escape the grasp of the law and make it to Mexico? The screenplay for this film by Callie Khouri is very original and a great twist to the crime genre. While watching the film you really get a sense for the characters and their personalities, and they never do anything outside of their character. On the surface it is just a basic do a crime and run type of film but with the added characterization and the relationships the characters have with their husband/boyfriend it adds another layer to the film. One thing that bothered me about this was its resemblance to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid in the plot loosely and the finale loosely as well.Ridley Scott is one of the best directors Hollywood has to offer and this is a film that shows his range as a director. At the time he is really known for great science fiction films like Alien and Blade Runner but he decided to mix it up with this one and I love it when directors spice it up. Like usual he has many great shots which develop the characters of the film allowing the audience to really know and become attached to Thelma and Louise. Now is this one of Scott's best films? Certainly not. But it is definitely worth noting when talking about his impressive career.Susan Sarandon really shines in this film as the role of Louise, and the film put her on the map. Before this film she was known but after she became a superstar who went on to win an Oscar. With this film she showed her talent and earned an Oscar nomination as well as a woman who wants to just take a break and have some fun, but obviously that isn't what she gets. Her facial and voice expressions in this film were absolutely remarkable and this is definitely my favorite film I've seen her in even though I have not seen much of her repertoire.Geena Davis delivers a superb performance also earning an Oscar nomination for her role as Thelma. She was fun, cute girl escaping from her husband and having a good time even after she almost got raped. Her accent was great and the chemistry between her and Sarandon was absolutely wonderful. It is a shame that her career never became anything more than this, the only film I can remember her in after this is with Michael J. Fox in Stuart Little. She is definitely a great talent and I would love to see her come back into the spotlight.The supporting cast did a decent job as well, but nowhere near as good as the leads. I was kind of disappointed by Harvey Keitel as a nice guy detective. It didn't feel like he gave much of a performance, just put on a sympathetic voice when talking to the women. Michael Madsen is always good and he was in this as well, though he was not magnificent or anything. I always respect Michael Madsen because he is a working man actor whose name isn't big but still gets around. He is still kind of a tough guy in this and he is not as good as he is in Reservoir Dogs or Donnie Brasco but this was earlier in his career and he grew as an actor. The film features Brad Pitt's first major role as a cute guy thief and he does a decent job. Nothing good really but for a first major film definitely not bad.Overall I give this film an 8/10 and I recommend it to anyone who likes crime films, films with female leads, and original films. It is fun at parts and the ending is a classic, and you kind of have to see it if you have any liking for Ridley Scott.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Ridley Scott, the man who created dark and brooding sci fi masterpieces like Alien and Blade Runner comes a story about two southern housewives on the run from the law in the wide open midwest. Wait what? The name Ridley Scott is synonymous with darkly innovative science fiction so it's always weird to see his name attached the most unlikely of projects such as Thelma &amp; Louise. I'm not complaining though because Ridley Scott or not, this movie is actually pretty good. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon play Thelma and Louise, respectively. The movie gives us little initial backstory, but we know enough to get into the story. We can figure that they are two long time friends who have probably lived in the same little old town for their entire lives. What we know for sure is that they have had enough and now figure it is time to hit the road and seek some real adventure. So they do just that and the main plot excitingly kicks off. Everything is going great until they stop at a bar and one of the patrons starts to get a little too friendly with Thelma. Before anything terrible can happen, Louise saves her friend and the whole situation seems to be resolved until the rapist gives a little too much lip and Louise shoots him dead. The two panic stricken ladies flee the scene and after calming down they resolve to flee to Mexico. But of course the law gets involved and they are right on their tail for the majority of the film. It's definitely a fun story with its fill of excitement and adventure.The two leading ladies are characterized very well as the anti-heroes, and Sarandon and Davis pull off these roles excellently. They're a joy to watch and their chemistry is riveting. Their progression through the movie is also very interesting to watch as they flip flop roles throughout the film. At times Thelma will be the strong and controlled type, but at other times Louise will have to take over this role while Thelma gets her head on straight. The mishaps these two have on their way to Mexico present increasingly more complex dilemmas to work out of, and the excellent performances of Sarandon and Davis keep it entertaining most of the way through. The rest of the cast, for what it's worth, are good too but the main focus is on Thelma and Louise. This film seems very anti-male, however. Pretty much every male character in this movie is either a scoundrel, a liar, or a cheater. I guess that's fitting for a movie that focuses on two strong willed and self sufficient women, but I had to scratch my head and think, jeez... we're not all this bad are we? But at least you can clearly see the film's intentions.Thelma &amp; Louise won an Oscar for best original screenplay and I can't argue too much with that. It's a well deserved Oscar because the dialouge in this is definitely something worth noting. It captures the mindsets and attitudes of the midwest population very well. The script has a lot of life to it and even if Thelma and Louise were the only two characters in the film it would still be entertaining for a while to watch them interact. As for the story itself, most of what happens keeps it interesting, but it seems to drag towards the middle and becomes somewhat tedious. But it is all worth it when you reach the end where you realize what might have seemed tedious before was actually just build up for a riveting ending that sent chills through my body. The ending is absolutely fantastic and is no shorter or longer than it needed to be.Thelma &amp; Louise is a worthwhile watch. It's a fun adventure story with two great main characters who you will fall in love with and be rooting for the entire movie. The portrayal of men is a little discerning, but it's also fitting to some of the central focus of the film. The film may seem redundant towards the middle but it's all worth it in the end, making this movie an all around good ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool movie, horrible hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two strong, smart, and sexy women face incredible odds after a chain of ill-starred events. T&amp;L is bona-fide "buddy movie" in which the buddies are female in roles typically reserved for male anti-heroes. They're tough and savvy...and flawed for sure. That's why we root for them. The Southern twang, the convertible, the desert highway, and the law in hot pursuit: Cinema Americana at its best! In 1993 Thelma &amp; Louise was on the syllabus of my women's studies course as required viewing. A neurotic college town rallying cry was: "Thelma &amp; Louise Live!" To be sure, there were overtly "feminist" themes in the film, such as sexual assault, domestic violence, patriarchy, women breaking free of the "nice girl" repression, and women fighting back. However, in the end, it was just a Hollywood road movie and an awfully thin soup for a Power-to-Women manifesto! When it turns up on TV, I still have trouble divorcing the film from the pitiful pop culture legacy from the early '90s.Watch T&amp;L and enjoy it for what it is. Keep your eyes on road and don't look 15 years back in the rear view mirror!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting, Sincere And Stylish Female Outlaws Road Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Louise Sawyer and Thelma Dickinson are girlfriends in the Midwest who take a weekend trip together in Louise's green 1966 Ford Thunderbird. At a truckstop, a man tries to rape Thelma and Louise shoots him. Fugitives from justice, the girls head for Mexico, trying to figure out what to do and how to put things in perspective.This is a stylish, highly original, confrontational picture, with a great script by Callie Khouri, who won an Oscar. What I like most about it are the questions it asks - when Louise shoots the slimeball it's not in self-defence, but neither is it a premeditated act; he simply offends her so much that she decides to do it. This prompts both the characters and us to reflect on who they really are and what they really want to be (typified by the line, "We got what we settled for.") and taps into a rich vein of female emancipation. It works both as a fantasy outlaw story and as a thought-provoking drama. Louise is smart but uptight and Thelma is naive but kind-hearted, but they both seem very real, and Scott and his director of photography Adrian Biddle (both of whom are British) capture the endless American landscapes with abstract precision. Sarandon and Davis are both sensational, somehow intense and goofy simultaneously, and Keitel and Madsen are brilliantly cast against type as the sympathetic males (although for me Keitel's character is just a tad too compassionate for a detective). There are nice bits too by McDonald as Thelma's irredeemable husband Darryl, and a young Pitt as a cocksure cowboy. Scott was an interesting choice to make this movie, a world away from Blade Runner or Black Rain, but it was both a commercial and a critical hit for him, although it's the two stars' movie all the way. Sarandon in particular is riveting in this film, really living and breathing the character, and giving arguably her best performance in a long career of distinguished work. Shot in fabulous desert locations in Utah and Colorado, and featuring a fine albeit underused score by Hans Zimmer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to believe it's been over 15 years since this film came out. A deft touch was used throughout this movie, by all those involved. The music, the photography, the locations, the editing, the acting, and writing are all exceptional. The action keeps the movie going at a fast pace, but somehow many poignant scenes manage to sneak in there. The great hotel scene with Jimmy and Louise, the scene where Louise notices the old ladies watching her, the scene where she gives the old man all her jewelry. You can see her contemplate her own life, and her own aging. A great aspect of the movie is watching the women shed the trappings and constraints of their ladylike existence, and transform into something much stronger. The film has it's share of funny moments, specifically when Daryl is told of his wife's' crime, he says "What?....WHAT?" as he steps in his pizza. A great role by Chris MacDonald. The movie manages to touch on many existential themes: Aging, dashed dreams, fractured relationships, bad choices, friendship, love, womanhood, manhood....The visuals capture an America of a fleeting dream or memory, we know that it exists like that but it's almost impossible in it's openness. This is a true American film, deserving of the highest accolades, it's never pretentious, its very accessible, but makes us look at ourselves, and contemplate life, and the beauty and ugliness and all the things in between.</fullReview>

Louise's reaction when Thelma asks her what happened to her in Texas is a little bit excessive in comparison with Thelma's question. In these two scenes we can see the anger in Louise's eyes. That's why I guess that Louise was rapped in Texas.

		<fullReview>I first saw this film when I was 13 and wasn't aware of just how terribly men could treat women. You've got Thelma who is married to the biggest jerk in the world and who is nearly raped by a disgusting pervert by the name of Harlan. Then there is Louise who blasts Harlan away and goes on the lam with Thelma. But something happened to Louise a long time ago that she won't tell Thelma. A warning to all other men out there. Take note of what you see and learn from it. Learn how women wish to be treated and see how abusive and sick some men are. Watching 'Thelma and Louise' has had a huge impact on me and has given me a great and important lesson in life. Plus it has a terrific cast including Geena Davis, Susan Sarandon, Michael Madsen and Brad Pitt in his movie debut. Watching 'Silence of the Lambs' and 'Terminator 2' as well as this proves that 1991 was the best year for movies</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good movie,but an empty script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS!This 1991 female power movie is all in all nothing more than a remake of both EASY RIDER and BONNIE AND CLYDE.It has the deep message of EASY RIDER and the storyline of BONNIE AND CLYDE but in both cases it isn't as good as the originals.Ridley Scott(BLADE RUNNER,ALIEN,GLADIATOR)shoots some great scenes of southern USA but forgets to put in some believable stories and that's the biggest minus of this movie. The acting isn't the problem.Both Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis play well although it gets over the top on several occasions.The supporting cast is in good hands with Michael Madsen,Christopher McDonald(whose character is really funny) and a young Brad Pitt playing The Marlboro Man in a very convincing way and showing his great acting skills. But the greatest actor of them all is Harvey Keitel,he is my favorite actor anyway and he shows why.Although he's not much present in the first hour of the movie(which is a shame)his acting in the second part of the movie is superb.Still,his character is very badly worked out.I mean why is he helping these girls? what is his history? All the men in this movie are sexists except Harvey,why is that so? Not good characterization.When you look at the movie the only really important scene is the last one when Thelma and Louise hit the pedal to the metal into the Grand Canyon.This last freezing shot of the car falling into oblivion is obviously an hommage to BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID but it also has got the same ending of EASY RIDER and BONNIE AND CLYDE,only now the leading characters choose to die. The channel upon which the movie was on ruined the last shot because the freeze wasn't there,they had to show trailers of other movies! I hate commercial channels.Anyway,a fun movie with some sort of message although I think it would have been a better idea when Scott had been replaced by a woman. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film immensely. It is funny, sad, revelatory and many more complimentary adjectives! Sarandon and Davis were perfectly cast and were primarily responsible for making the film a great paean to lower-middle class feminist empowerment. I for one only support the feminist movement as far as Margret Sanger Women's Christian Temperance went. I do not support Gloria Steinem, Betty Friedan, et al. They have caused a rift between mankind and womankind that has exacerbated relatively minor differences. They are like the shipwreckers of old supplying false charts to the navigator and are therefore leading our ship of state (the nation) to perhaps final and total shipwreck. Whether they are doing this intentionally or inadvertently I cannot say with absolute certainty. That their poisonous ideologies must be discredited is indisputable, however. Whoops! I sidetracked a little there. I recommend this film strongly especially on the limited or special or whatever new edition DVD I saw it on. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert I have watched many movies of the mold that Thelma and Louise was from, prior to seeing this movie. I hoped for another of "Jessies Girls", "Dixie Dynamite" or "The Great Texas Dynamite Chase", which are about pairs of women or in one case, female outlaw gangs with four women. However, in Thelma and Lousie, we got this depressing story that puts down both men and women and creates a very depressing outlook. The movie mad me mad and depressed, so I have only seen it once, as opposed to the dozens of times I watched, the three movies above.In Thelma and Louise, men are all rapists, criminals or just plain super pigs, except the super sensitive character played by Harvey Keitel, who would have been perfect character for a Norman Lear television show or to guest host on Donohue.I also found the portrayal of men, very unrealistic. The type guys that I hung with that like to fight (fight club types) are not presented in this, and you know they are out there, because there are streets you might not want to walk down tonight. Normal everyday hard working and decent men are not presented either. As stated the men are presented very negative.The women, well Thelma and Louise are also presented negative. They are copy cats. They act and react to those evil men around them, by copying the way men act. They even quote precise diologue taught by Brad Pitt's Character TJ when robbing a bank, after he robs them.The movie says loudly, men who are all evil will be copied by women, so we have a lot of evil, all around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was sitting there at the Gorge in George, Washington sixteen years ago, enjoying Neil Young, and some gal plunks down beside me wearing a picture of Thelma and Louise, guns drawn, on her T-Shirt, and the caption "Thelma and Louise, Meet George Bush." Now, I don't give a big one what your politics are, but I remember telling this gal that I was old enough to remember the assassinations of JFK and RFK and MLK, and that her shirt was disgusting.Well, you can imagine the joyful noise that came out of her mouth--fascist pig, Republican, hater--you get the picture. She stormed off and I got a dirty look from my date. Was it worth it? Yup.I finally sat down a few weeks ago to watch Thelma and Louise, the hugely popular renegade movie by Ridley Scott. I found it just about as offensive as that gal's shirt, but not because it was a two-hour insult to men (we need a good insult every once in awhile!). I just found it numbingly stupid.Now, "stupid" is one of the most over-used words in the English language, but about the thirtieth time Louise (or was it Thelma?) made a decision that edged the two gal-pals closer to a fiery disaster, I just gave up trying to explain away the dumb choices and started muttering "stupid!" TAL is such a lazy movie! Scott tries again and again to infuse meaning to excuse stupidity, background music to replace logic, and cigarette smoking to demand for the principals the respect they deserve. If you look closely, Thelma and Louise is more style than anything close to substance. Gunplay and dirty faces replace any deep understanding of just how damaged the two main characters really are; it's infuriating and wasteful.Which brings back the memory of the gal at the Gorge. I hope she's gotten beyond using ugly, bumper-sticker mentality to make a point. I know Thelma and Louise never got any farther than the feminist version of one of those old "blacksploitation" flicks from the early seventies, with women now as empowered ex-victims, wielding shootin' irons, and men cowering in fear.Bumper stickers never solve anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst thing about this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really don't know if this movie set out to be a male bashing film, but I didn't see any man in the movie who was nothing less than a creep. Every man in the movie was made out to be an a-hole or a pussy like the cop who cried. The movie wanted to make a statement, but I was more interested in the storyline which was actually pretty good. As far as why they felt it necessary to commit, suicide, I didn't find that move convincing at all, but it was entertaining. Now if you're a guy, and you want to know worst atrocity of this film, it was the ending when they committed suicide. For Christ sake, did you see that car they were driving?? It was a beautiful classic 65 Ford Thunderbird convertible, and those 2 bitches trashed it. They should have parked it and jumped off the cliff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I may not know anyone named Thelma, but whenever I meet someone named Louise, I will probably be tempted to remember "Thelma &amp; Louise". This story of two women (Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis) who have to go on the lam after one of them kills a rapist in chauvinistic Texas truly shows the potentials of life.I guess that the main question is not whether or not "Thelma &amp; Louise" is a women's empowerment story (although it certainly is). Really, it looks at our deep-down capabilities. Solid performances by Sarandon and Davis, not to mention Harvey Keitel and an up-and-coming Brad Pitt, and solid direction from Ridley Scott make this one of the best movies of 1991.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thelma and Louise is interesting in both its blatant shallowness and in the subtexts inadvertently created by such an attitude. Ridley Scott finally has a decent script and a strong enough cast to make a movie that rings its own bell.Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon are an interesting pair, with Sarandon constantly having to mother Davis until she gets on her feet and starts thinking for herself. Their interactivity is one of the best ever done in a major film like this.Scott has always tried being a visual worker, here his camera is as strong as in Alien or Black Rain, but not as good as Blade Runner. The editing is also strong enough to keep the movie going in all of two hours.Feminism in a film like this is a touchy subject. While on the surface the idea is proposed of feminine strength (much like Tootsie), but underneath is a social commentary on socially unacceptable men. J.D. and Thelma's husband represent both the obvious and not-so-obvious sides of the matter.Overall, better than average film with enough strength to punch through whatever weakness the script--Brad Pitt in particular--can throw at it. 3.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie, however I really did think it was a bit on the sexist side. There was not one good man in this movie. I can't think of one movie with good male characters and all the women are jerks (unless they are also movies about heroism or power in an abstract way). So I don't understand those who claim this to be a role reversal. If there IS a movie with good male characters, and all the females are rotten or witchy, I would have a big problem with that too. "The Man Show" is one of my least favorite TV shows on this planet.This whole "I am woman, hear me roar" doesn't make sense. Could I say something along the lines of "I am man, hear me roar". Women are equal to men so why is it they need to convince themselves threw statements of power? Companies use this to sell products... NIKE comes to mind with, "it's a woman's world" slogan, and people fall for it. I'm sure men would do the same thing in this situation. All I know is when Thelma and/or Louise refers to "men" in a negative light... or even if it's implied, it sort of hurts my feelings because..... I'm a man!?However, the movie was great! I do think it's good to see two strong female leads who are willing to (spoiler) die for there cause. Women don't tend to get a lot oh hero roles... most men do, yet most men play the villain characters as well. I watched the movie with two smart, wonderful women (smarter than me)... and they hated it! They thought it's message made both men and women look bad. So, just so you know... you don't have to be a man to think it's sexist.For the sake of my children, if I should just so happen to have a boy, I would want him to be proud of being a man. I wouldn't want him to feel like he was born criminal, or there's something wrong with him. I would also HOPE that if I have a girl, she would feel proud of being a woman. I don't think movie's, TV shows and commercials with a message like the one that's implied in this movie are good for that. Whether it's male or female. However overall, it was a good story.</fullReview>

They hate their lives and instead of doing something to improve them, they take off on a road trip that soon turns into a running nightmare including murder, armed robbery, attacking a cop and blowing up a fuel truck.The saddest moment is when that beautiful T-Bird goes sailing off into oblivion. What a waste of such a beautiful car. Of course, the women are in the car at the time and their road trip ends in their untimely death.They could have found better lives with a different approach.Of course, that kind of message movie would have been a lot harder to write and probably drawn a smaller audience.Instead we got the violence and hopelessness that is Thelma &amp; Louise.I only decided to finally watch this movie because Geena Davis is so good at playing the U.S. President in the ABC network TV drama "Commander in Chief".Now I wish I had not seen this film. It will be hard to disassociate her from the miserable character she portrays in T&amp;L.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I felt compelled to add a comment here as I was coerced to watch this film again after having not seen it since its initial release. My lady friend insisted that my dislike for the film would change and that my first viewing (I left the theater nauseus with anger) was with a jaundiced eye.Well, I'm here to say that either my eye is more jaundiced than ever or this really is pretentious tripe. No, this really IS pretentious tripe. In the theater I applauded Thelma and Louise's choice of self-immolation; NOT because I so deeply felt their pain and hopelessness, but simply to rid the world of two self-absorbed, nasty, narcissistic losers. Brought to you by the folks who brought you the end of Western Civilization the message here is: it is better to die than to live having to buy dresses off the rack or Donna Karan knock-offs. It is better to kill oneself than to work with aid's patients, teach poor children to read, aid the disenfranchised, or do anything for humanity. No, your victimhood is FAR more important and ultimately the measuring stick by which you should judge your ultimate existence. Good Lord. Thelma and Louise are dead, and we are to see them as tragic figures instead of badly written screen characters with no redeeming values or reason to live.Tripe.</fullReview>

That women can also capable leading violent lives? If this is liberation then women should be weary. Had the Geena Davis character left her abusive husband, forged out a new independent life for herself and found happiness, now that would have been inspirational.

The funny thing is since "oppression of women" is largely a myth they really should not be getting even for anything. The movie seems to keep in line with reality when it comes to women seeking revenge over imagined slights.Now men on the other hand should be thinking about getting even since we have been treated horribly by women for years. They should make a film called "Tom and Jack" where men go around breaking the law and acting crazy. The only thing is that movie would be over in 15 minutes since the law would react viciously to any man doing what these women did.</fullReview>

But since it's two women, they get away with all the male-bashing you can take.*Spoiler Alert*When Geena Davis picked up Brad Pitt, I knew that he was going to rob her blind the morning after. I guess she was too stupid and guy-struck to realize this, though. I damn near jumped out of my seat and cheered when her and her equally-idiotic friend drove off the cliff. Two less idiots in the world makes a happy ending for me! Now why not cut out the first seven-eighths of the movie out, just show us the suicide run, and you'd have a pretty good movie.

		<fullReview>I should love this movie, but I don't and I'm not sure why. I applaud the feminist statement it makes, but it just misses for me.That's not to say that it doesn't have some great moments and fabulous acting. The cinematography is awesome, and the soundtrack is perfect. It keeps you guessing.It has an extraordinary way of making you root for these woman, forgetting that they killed a man (OK, that one was justified, the guy was a jerk), robbed a convenience store, and blew up a guys truck (and, yes, that guy kinda deserved it too!). But the bottom line is that if they had turned themselves in at the beginning, after shooting the man who was raping Thelma, then the rest of the movie wouldn't have happened. It was self defense, and they wouldn't have done much jail time, if any (OK...they would have done time, it was set in Texas!) It's always a pet peeve of mine in movies where, if the person just used common sense in the beginning, then the rest of the movie wouldn't have happened.The other thing that prevents it from being a 10 for me is the end. SPOILER ALERT!!! DON'T READ FARTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING!!!!! I wanted them to get away to Mexico, not go off the side of the canyon to certain death. By that time, I KNEW they wouldn't give up to the authorities, and really didn't want them too. I would have preferred them just barely escaping into Mexico and disappearing, only to find them lounging on the beach with drinks in their hands.*sigh* I do understand why that couldn't be the ending, but the hopeless romantic in me wanted a happy ending.Definitely worth seeing, maybe even seeing several times!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated film with likable leading ladies......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a shame that this movie seems to have been selected as somehow being a feminist, female empowering movie. I say this because the movie actually performs a dis-service to real honest to goodness feminist ideals and to movies who show actual female heroines.While both the female leads, Sarandon and Davis are likable and winning in their title roles, the writing ultimately causes the film to fall short of what it could have been: a female Butch Cassidy &amp; Sundance Kid, which it is most decidedly not.The problems start very early on in the movie. When Sarandon's character winds up killing the would be rapist, it's hard to believe that our two female leads would decide that their best course of action is to get into their car and flee.There is nothing in either of their backgrounds that has been presented to believe that the characters would feel it was smarter to get in that car &amp; run than to deal with the situation. This is the film's fatal flaw and the plot twist on which the whole movie hangs. If you don't buy the fact that the characters would get in that car in the first place, then the whole movie is going to be one long demonstration in stupid people doing stupid things and while Thelma &amp; Louise are not presented as brain surgeons, neither are they portrayed as out and out idiots. Their fleeing is simply the (female) writer's idea of what she believe's a "downtrodden" woman would do. It undermines the credibility of the female leads as being able to handle their own problems &amp; instead must run away from them.But accepting this hard to believe plot twist if we're to have a film and moving forward, we're presented with the considerable talents of Davis &amp; Sarandon. They're chemistry is great and the scenes are generally played lightly. Davis picking up a young Brad Pitt playing a male bimbo is one of the movies finest and a genuine sexual role reversal. Ironically, it's probably the role for which Brad Pitt has been best suited. Suspending disbelief and simply enjoying the movie is certainly possible and that is the way this movie should be watched. **SPOILER AHEAD***Knowing beforehand, that the movie ends with the stars again implausibly committing double suicide by driving their car off a cliff actually helps the viewer not become totally enraged by the visually fun but incredibly stupid and unbelievable ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not enough of the spectacular desert scenery was shown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the movie ages ago, enjoyed it, and forgot about it. Years later, after I had visited Moab, Utah and learned that some movie scenes were filmed near there, I viewed the movie a second time to see if I could recognize any filming locations. My fascination with place recognition and spatial orientation was the driving force behind this second viewing. A few scenes were familiar, but overall I was disappointed with the way the physical scenery was handled: the movie is filled with close-up shots that usually omit the scenery.One familiar scene was the one in which a policeman stops the fleeing women to give them a ticket and ends up in their car's trunk. That was shot in the Courthouse Towers area of Arches National Park, on the main park road. I wonder how much inconvenience to the public was created by this filming.Another familiar place appeared in the scene in which the two main characters are driving along a dirt road, surrounded by reddish rock terrain. A pipeline of some type lies on the ground next to the road. That road is on the private property of the potash mine (near Moab) owned by Intrepid Potash. The rusty pipe line has something to do with the mine's operation.The third familiar scene was the very last one: Thelma and Louise are trapped, with police on their back side, preventing escape, and a deep river canyon in front of them. I have read that the movie gave the impression that this was shot at the Grand Canyon. It actually took place at a turn-out on a rough dirt road that runs parallel to the Colorado River southwest of the city of Moab. The road leading to the turn-out is San Juan County Road 142, sometimes erroneously called Potash Road or Shafer Trail. The area of the turn-out has the traditional name of Fossil Point and is located southeast of and 1600 feet below Dead Horse Point State Park. It is on land managed by the Bureau of Land Management, not in Canyonlands National Park, as one reviewer says. (The park is about two miles to the west.) Because of the movie's notoriety, Fossil Point is often called "Thelma and Louise Point." Having been to this area several times, I consider the scenery there to be "mind-blowing." I was sad that so little of the terrain was shown in the movie. But showing lots of beautiful scenery might have distracted from the plot, which concerned personal interaction and friendship under trying circumstances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If your idea of a "great" movie is one that defies all standards of quality while blatantly fondling your "hot buttons," this film might be your cup of tea. Everyone else will see it for the agonizing mess that it is.It is NOT the message that I object to; I believed in equality of the sexes back before it was even a topic of discussion. But IF I took this idiotic film seriously, I'd have to feel embarrassed about that position. As others have noted, if you substituted two men for the two female protagonists, angry mobs would probably have shouted this film out of theaters. This film does for feminism what Billy Jack did for pacifism.Aside from this, the film has almost no entertainment value. As others have pointed out, the heroines here are both unlikable and unbelievable. The story is negligible, and what little there is somehow manages to be both preposterous and tediously predictable. The ending is stolen from much better films (Butch Cassidy; The Wild Bunch; Vanishing Point; even Paperback Hero...), but makes no sense in this context, other than to (apparently) convince the gullible viewer that they've had a Great and Meaningful experience.That leaves only the heavy-handed "message" to win audiences over. Alas, if your position on sexual equality is so precarious and so poorly considered that this film makes you feel good, you probably need to re-examine your entire philosophy of life. Not to mention your rather low taste in cinematic arts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The last scene, in which Thelma and Louise accelerate the car toward the cliff, reminds us of Ecclesiastes 1:2: "Vanity of vanities, says the Teacher, vanity of vanities! All is vanity" (NRSV). "Meaningless! Meaningless! says the Teacher. Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless" (NIV). I can hear Thelma and Louise's lament. They are crying when they smile. They want to stop fleeing and suffering, and they want to find real freedom.Thelma is a person who eager to be loved. She is looking for a person. She is seeking after the love which she is not able to find in real life. She is easily manipulated by men who pretend to love her and gets hurt more and more. Louise is a strict, closed person. She might have been raped before and be stuck in that deep wound. She has big anger inside, and the wound leads to her close-minded character. She is even not able to accept the proposal of marriage from a man whom she also loves.The move makes me raise the question of what good and evil are. Thelma and Louise are suffering from their past and from other people. They are victims of society and culture. Even though they commit sins such as murder and robbery, are they evil? I recall the words of Ecclesiastes 4:1-3: "Again I saw all the oppressions that are practiced under the sun. Look the tears of the oppressed ? with no one to comfort them! On the side of their oppressors there was power ? with no one to comfort them. And I thought the dead, who have already died, more fortunate than the living, who are still alive; but better than both is the one who has not yet been, and has not seen the evil deeds that are done under the sun."The last scene makes me cry. I can feel the great pain of Thelma and Louise and the desire to be free.Many men in the movie are described as people who just want to have their fleshly desire, sex. Most of people in that movie just care about themselves, their interests, and their own well-being. I agree that people are depraved in this world. We cannot find good in this world. It is hopeless world. Is there any hope? Let us consider Ecclesiastes 12:1, 13-14: "Remember your creator in the days of your youth, before the days of trouble come, and the years draw near when you will say, 'I have no pleasure in them' The end of the matter; all has been heard. Fear God, and keep his commandments; for that is the whole duty of everyone. For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every secret thing, whether good or evil."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An alternative end for the two women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the car is falling to death, an alien ship beams the two women in it's interior. Soon, Thelma and Louise are carried in a planet far away from our solar system. The residents of this planet look like the people of the earth, but the women were much more uglier than the earth women. The conditions may look like these on earth, but a few earthmen can survive for long. So the 2 women will undergo some tests about the possibility to survive. Some tests are very cruel, including exposure to high pressure, pain, and high and low temperatures. In some other cases they are infected with dangerous virus. They're also both penetrated with big plastic tools. But the most suffering stage was the test of the slugs. The "tools" of this endurance were some disgusting creatures that looked like earth slugs. There were 10 inch long and 1,5 inch wide. The smell and taste of these creatures were too unbearable even for the aliens. In this time, each woman had to swallow 10 slugs. The slugs will cross the women's bodies causing great pain, and finally emitted from the vagina. Louise couldn't stand this torture. She completely failed even to put a slug into her mouth. She vomited in every attempt. Thelma, an 1.83 height girl, with very strong organism, and great body, endured all the tests easily. And she didn't seem to be seriously affected by the smell and the taste of the slugs. She swallowed the 10 disgusting creatures without much effort. And she endured the terrible pain the slugs caused in her body before emitted from her wet vagina. Her performance really impressed the aliens. They considered her a superior female. But it was sure that Louise would not live for long after these experiments. She also failed to pass the laboratory tests. So the aliens put her to death with horrific tortures. (Mutilation and burning). Thelma was forced to watch the tortures, standing. Soon after the butchery of Louise, Thelma was placed in an alien bordello. According to the aliens, she had to spend 3 earth years in this bordello before returning to earth. For being much more prettier than the women of the planet, Thelma met great demand for her sexual services. By the first month her bordello became the most famous in the planet. She became very expensive for the male residents of the planet. In a typical day in the bordello, Thelma was sexually satisfying 50-80 rich males. But the numbers were insignificantly increased if she was having sex with 3 or more men simultaneously. Her endurance to sex was amazing. Thelma offered a very high level of sexual performance. And she found great pleasure in her job and the money she could get. Many of her "activities" were also filmed and showed on the global planet TV. In her free time, Thelma always watches animated porno in the huge 400-inch 3-D screen in the 2d floor of the bordello. The tall woman won the prize of the whore of the planet and became very rich. We don't know if she ever quits her "services" and leaves the planet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm no expert on women, but there are some things that you just don't do. You don't say things like; `Yes, she is prettier than you', `But you are fat' and especially `I think Thelma and Louise is stupid.' So in light of this I have decided NOT to mock this film, as it will make me enemies.Instead I'm going to suggest how it could have been better (CONTAINS SPOLIERS):Firstly, I found all the male characters unrealistic. I mean, if I were married to Geena Davis, I'd pay her more attention and might even be a bit afraid of her. My friend Dave told me that she's 7 foot tall, but he also told me he was in MI6, so it might not be trueAlso a lot of people complained about how stupid the ladies were in this film, but I think that's unfair. People make stupid mistakes all the time. Only last week I decided that ?All you need is love' and didn't buy my girlfriend a birthday present as my love would surely be enough? When I got out of hospital I realised that I'd been stupid, but you learn by your mistakes. The next time the Thelma and Louise shot a potential rapist, they could use a silencer or make sure that no one found the body, and thereby learning by their mistakes.Another thing is that I've tried shooting at petrol tankers and they don't explode. Well, when I say shoot, I mean throw rocks at them, but either way no huge fireball. Perhaps instead it could have been a truck full of nuns, who had an oxyacetylene gas cylinder inside. That would go up with a real bang! Instead of lewd gestures, the nuns could have been singing ?All things bright and beautiful' except in the wrong key. That'd be a good reason to open fire.Finally I thought that the ending was too downbeat. If I had written it, I'd have had the two ladies stop at the edge of the cliff, and Geena's husband could run up and say: `I forgive you darling. Look, I've brought you a TV for the kitchen so now you won't feel so lonely, and we'll pay someone to do the ironing.' She'd of course see that he was trying to make her happy and fall in love with him again. And Harvey Keitel could have married Susan Sarandon and then made sure all the charges got dropped. Hooray! Everyone's a winner!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really, really, really, bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very popular movie, and I don't see why. It had good actors and actresses in it [with the glaring exception of Brad Pitt - this guy simply can't act], but the story was vapid to the extreme. The whole thing was silly and boring with, however, an interesting and unusual ending. A fitting end for these 2 dumb broads. I suppose it had plenty of action to it, but is that enough to carry it? I don't think so. Thumbs down all the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misandrist Propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two women drive off a cliff rather than live in a world that has men in it.That's about it, really. This is an absurd, violent, shrill, hysterical, ugly squawk of a film: All men are evil, it turns out. Did you know that? Who would have known it was that simple? But yes, evil, deceitful or incompetent.Well, good to be told, anyway.It's become clear, looking back, that this is simply a product of its times the way all the communist scare films of the fifties were. Which is how the age of political correctness - which we are still in but which first really came to full power around the turn of the nineties - will be seen by the history books.As well-rounded as a 1920's rally for the Ku Klux Klan, as gripping in its depiction of human complexity as the SCUM Manifesto, I look forward to the day when this film is seen for the vile &amp; hateful misandric propaganda that it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hailed by women, to me seems one of the worst examples of mindless man-banging in existence. In style with the anti-men/pro-women tv-series like Cagney &amp; Lacey and other frustrated-women-strike-back productions of the last 15 years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching this piece of garbage and at this very moment I happen to feel the heaviest duty on my shoulders to spread ultimately negative reviews on any site that gives its users the chance to attribute profane adjectives to a movie. Oh my god, what was it exactly? It wasn't a movie, I'm sure. That wasn't even a pre-film. That was 130 minutes of ghastly depicted horrible unbelievable joke.I'm not going to talk about story (sorry to insult the holy name of story) because I don't want this comment to be a spoiler. I'm writing this for people who haven't seen this disaster of a movie. Lucky them indeed! Thelma &amp; Louise was without any doubt the worst motion picture I have ever seen in my entire life and I have seen a lot of rubbish too but this one is the godfather of them. I'm just begging you to not try this unless you are a thrill seeker and want to experience the most illogical screenplay ever put on paper. The choice is yours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film isn't pro-female; it's anti-male.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wish I could give negative stars. Joe Bob Briggs was right: the only thing distinguishing "Thelma and Louise" from the crappy flicks that Gilbert Gottfried and Rhonda Shear used to present on USA Up All Night is that the makers and promoters of the latter didn't intend their over-the-top misandry to be taken seriously.This film's heavy-handed political correctness speaks volumes about the zeitgeist of the early 1990s, a time when the mainstream media treated Marxist feminist Catharine A. MacKinnon as an unbiased expert on male sexuality and celebrated the infamous Lorena Bobbit as something of a folk hero worthy of emulation. Students of the 1990s as history will find "Thelma and Louise" of interest, but I can't otherwise recommend this film to anyone but the most ardent man-hater. Even the tendentious "Higher Learning" was better written and more entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perils of the pop cultural echo chamber.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thelma &amp; Louise exists as a chuckleheaded farcical pastiche of Bonnie and Clyde, Easy Rider, Duel, Badlands, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Smokey and the Bandit, plus sundry other movies. The ludicrous crude script should be posted as a warning to the perils of the pop cultural echo chamber. The acting reeks as strongly as any I have experienced in a mainstream film. Even the celebrated sound track reaches but sporadic mediocrity. Excluding the vistas in John Ford's Monument Valley, this failed comic strip translates into a very ugly film, among the worst in film history.Incidentally, the boy crook, a young Brad Pitt, possesses a bland moronic face twitching atop a lumpy, weight lifter's body ... and absurdly bowed legs, which could be the best actors in the movie. Pitt's eulogized sex scene hinges on his pathetic puppy expression and tired jump cuts. Originality in this movie proved an expletive deleted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the worst ever made. It could have been decent if it had given some respect to at least one or two of the male characters in the movie. I was frankly insulted watching this piece of trash. It infuriated me to think that some women could actually view men this way. I don't know any men who in any way act like the sick characters in this film. A resounding BOOOOOOOOO to one of the worst films ever made!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie really sucked. Brad Pitt, Michael Madsen, and Harvey Keitel were the best things about it.So what has either Saranwrapdon or Davis done since 1991? Nada. They're sticks, I tell you, sticks of wood. 'Twas a perfect ending to two not-so-great careers.Julia Roberts is headed the same way.Finally. I can't believe she, Mira Sorvino, Frances McDormand, and Gwyneth Paltrow aka Fishstick won Oscars. It ain't right.And that's a good thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, I liked the car...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overlooking for a moment THELMA AND LOUISE's blatant sexism: all the men are liars, cheats, rapists or morons; all the women are "Victims" with a capital "V" -- even as they kill, rob and vandalize their way across the US Southwest.And setting aside that Callie Khouri's Oscar-winning screenplay is nothing but a collection of tired cliches from two separate genres: the male buddy film ("bang bang boom boom) and the whiny chick flick: "weep weep sob sob").The question that comes to my mind is why this is, in any way, considered to be a "feminist" film. These are, after all, two of the stupidest women who ever stumbled across a movie screen. The are not in control of their lives as some have suggested: they are on the run from the law, on the run from taking responsibility for their own reckless and criminal behavior. They are stupid and they are cowardly. They are not role models, or even typical "oppressed" women. But because they chose men as their victims -- and stand up to the men only when they have guns in their hands -- they are applauded for their boldness. Two men who only terrorized women would be dismissed as creeps.It is one of the perversions of feminism that women measure their success by the standards set by men, even when they would otherwise condescendingly criticize that behavior as being negative and/or macho. In this case, adventures that would be mocked as sexist if perpetrated by men, are embraced as being empowering when committed by women. Also, it is the added dynamics of the situations: if Thelma and Louis victimized any women, their defenders would not praise their actions because it would be a violation of the "sisterhood." It is only the targeting of male victims that earn this film its praise: Surely pure, unadulterated sexism -- or is that feminism? It's hard to tell the difference.Not that THELMA AND LOUISE isn't without good points. Anyone who appreciates Susan Sarandon's acting skills and/or Brad Pitt's sculpted torso will be gratified. Perhaps the only real star of the film, however, is Thelma's mint 1966 Thunderbird convertible; a gorgeous classic that deserves a fate far better than what is served up by this pathetically mediocre film. When Louise and Thelma meet their ultimate demise, one wishes they had had the common decency to get out of the car and jump off the cliff by themselves. The loss of that beautiful car is the real tragedy. As for Thelma and Louise? Good riddance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thelma &amp; Louise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oscar and BAFTA nominated director Sir Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator) directs an excellent road movie starring two of the most unlikely heroes I know in any film. Basically Thelma Dickerson (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Geena Davis) a house wife, and Louise Sawyer (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Susan Sarandon) a café waitress are best friends, and decide to secretly go on a fishing trip together. Unfortunately, on the way Thelma is nearly raped and Louise killed the man who attempted it. They are now driving as far as they can to avoid the police, they obviously think their guilty of murder. Thelma's husband Darryl (Christopher McDonald) eventually finds out what his wife has done, and detective Hal Slocombe (Harvey Keitel) is probably the only one who knows their situation and wants to help. Along the way to Mexico, Thelma and Louise meet J.D. (Brad Pitt) and give him a ride, who steals their money given by Louise's love Jimmy (Michael Madsen) forcing them to rob a store, they hold a cop at gunpoint putting him in his trunk, shoot and explode a truck, and in the end, drive off the Grand Canyon to avoid capture, with an iconic freeze frame to white ending. Also starring Stephen Tobolowsky as Max and Timothy Carhart as Harlan. David and Sarandon are brilliant leads, the supporting cast, especially then little know Pitt, do very well too, and it is great fun to watch. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Film Score for Hans Zimmer, Best Screenplay - Original and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay - Motion Picture, and was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Susan Sarandon was number 25, and Brad Pitt number 15 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Pitt was also number 5 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, he was number 52 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 30 on The World's Greatest Actor, Thelma &amp; Louise (Heroes) were number 24 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains, the film was number 41 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments for Davis with Pitt, it was number 76 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 78 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Outstanding!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>.... But at the end of the day THELMA AND LOUISE is a chick flick road movie that strikes a chord with women so it`s difficult for a man , especially a cynical hetrosexist one like myself to empathise with . I couldn`t help noticing how routinely Ridley Scott directs this movie , it`s not badly directed and unlike a lot of other Scott movies he concentrates on directing his actors , but compare the visuals in this to movies like ALIEN , BLADE RUNNER , GLADIATOR and BLACK HAWK DOWN and you`ll notice apart from the very end there`s little imagery involved</fullReview>
