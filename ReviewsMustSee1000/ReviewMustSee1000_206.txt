		<shortDescription>U can save her?Déj? Vu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a real shame that everything I had read about Déj? Vu concerned the high-powered explosions and loud clatter of guru/producer Jerry Bruckheimer. No mention, except maybe as a footnote, was given to A-list director Tony Scott and the magic he has woven in his past three films. The man who brought us Top Gun has seen a sort of revival in style lately with the entertaining Spy Game, the amazing Man on Fire, and the kinetic Domino. Scott has taken the quick cuts of music videos and has infused them into his shooting style. His editor better be making some good money as these films fly by with filters, jump-cuts, grain, and camera angles swiveling at every turn. Greatly overshadowed by brother Ridley Scott and his more serious, award-winning epics, Tony has been pumping out some of the most solid and entertaining films of the past couple decades. With a reuniting of semi-regular star Denzel Washington, Déj? Vu proves that when Bruckheimer is paired with a like mind, his usual drivel can become great. Scott shows us how to hone the explosions, noise, and clutter to an effective level and gives us a helluva ride.Déj? Vu could have easily reduced itself to timetravel farce, going by the books to show a time warp in order to solve a crime. The far-fetched premise of being able to see the past as it happens four and a half days later should seem crazy and by watching the previews you are given the idea that it will be just a series of do-overs. Fortunately the trailers these days show a totally different movie than what has been crafted. Scott and his screenwriters have not only developed a sci-fi tale seeped in enough reality to at least be looked upon as plausible for the sake of the story, but they nicely tidy up any chance of their being a plothole. Our story begins with a devastating domestic terrorist act upon a ferry carrying over 500 people, Navy and family. Washington's ATF agent is brought in and discovers that it was no accident. Intrigued by the efficiency he displays, an FBI agent, played with nicely effective restraint by Val Kilmer, calls him in to check out a new toy they have to find who the perpetrator is. During the use of this screen of the past, Denzel acquires a feeling of obligation to do all he can to prevent what he sees from occurring in the present, no matter what consequences that might entail for the future. The quest to stop the violence begins with an attractive young woman who unknowingly has become an integral part in what will ultimately transpire.The beauty of this film is that with multiple timelines being shown parallel to each other, there are many questions that desperately need answering. To credit all involved, they appear to have put themselves in the audience's shoes and piece-by-piece wrote in a reason for everything. Anything that is seen either in the past, present, or future has a reason for being there and will be intelligently explained. Also, the performances are stellar, Denzel and Kilmer as well as a quietly maniacal Jim Caviezel and the emotionally exasperated Paula Patton, and the visuals unique. While Scott has toned down the ultra-kinetic cuts and filters for the main action, his style is still stamped on the graphics of their screen showing the past. The motion trails and speed scans lend a stylized digital editing program feel and are gorgeous to watch. Déj? Vu's best sequence, however, is the crazy car chase during the present in pursuit of a vehicle in the past, definitely a rush and orchestrated almost flawlessly. Even though Ridley gets the accolades and Tony gets the hack/overproduced label, I must say, while they are the best directing duo in Hollywood, I might have to give the edge on pure cinematic entertainment to the younger Tony. He is on a roll and doesn't seem to be stopping anytime soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd say this movie definitely lived up to expectations I had from the ad trailers. A good mix of science fiction and cop drama, with the occasional good joke. Both my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Denzel entertained as usual, as did Adam Goldberg. Don't be turned off by the professional reviewers. Those guys can never seem to enjoy a movie that's content with being slightly unbelievable. If I always wanted believable, I'd stick to documentaries or the news. There won't be any Oscars coming out of it, but it was a action-filled thriller that kept me guessing till the end. If you liked the Island, this is right up your ally.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb and brilliantly crafted thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been quite a while since I have seen a film that was this beautifully crafted and nearly flawless. The acting is very convincing and the storyline follows quite closely to a Michael Criton-esquire novel. I was rather surprised at the 6.8 rating this movie has received thus far, and I hope that more positive reviews will come in order for the score to be bumped up to at least the mid 7's. I can guarantee you will not be disappointed by this film. For one thing, it stars Denzel Washington, Jim Cavizel, who I felt did a marvelous job at playing the antagonist, Val Kilmer, and Bruce Greenwood. With these four actors, you typically cannot go wrong. I notice that these four are also never in the tabloids and don't get caught up in the typical Hollywood tripe that is so prevalent today. They have raw talent, are not just getting by on their looks, and their performance, especially in this film, shows it. "Deja Vu" is one of those rare films that grabs a hold of you from the very start and does not let go of you until the very end. People even clapped after the film ended and such applause was well deserved. If you do anything at all this Thanksgiving weekend, then by all means, put going to see "Deja Vu" on your shopping list. I can promise you that both you and your family/significant others will be blow though the very back wall of the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deja Vu is a great ride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was also at that Century City screening last night, and I was probably one of the people who were saying they thought this movie was awesome. I enjoyed it immensely. It has been described as an action-adventure-romance-sci-fi pic and it truly is all of that.First of all, the cinematography was stunning. Tony Scott and his DOP, Paul Cameron, do fantastic work -- every shot is beautifully composed. And all the footage that involves a cast of thousands (meaning the crowd scenes) is masterful work.I don't know why I started with commenting on the photography (also the editing) of this movie. It's probably because that is what struck me from the very beginning, particularly when there is so much going on in the opening sequence. Yet you never get lost. Above all, the performances and story are great and really suck you in. Yes, this movie requires a fair bit of suspension of disbelief. I would go so far as to say the plot was far-fetched, but the heart of the story just takes you along for the ride.For the record, I felt Scott's most recent teaming with Denzel, Man on Fire, was one of the best movies of 2004. I don't think Deja Vu is as good as Man on Fire, but it's right up there as one of the most entertaining and thrilling movies I've seen this year.For sheer entertainment and an intriguing (though not flawless) plot, Bruckheimer, Scott and Co. sure have DELIVERED the goods.I recommend you see Deja Vu on the big screen with a big, loud audience for maximum enjoyment. Part of the appeal last night was exactly that; hearing the audience -- as one -- laugh, applaud and sigh along with this movie and getting swept up in that communal experience.post scriptum -- Any fans of Otto Preminger's wonderful 1994 classic Laura may be delighted by the echoes of that storyline in Deja Vu.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute thriller...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start by saying that I was reluctant to even see this movie but after some insistence by family, I sat and watched in pure enjoyment.Articles, reviews, trailers, TV spots, DO NOT do this film justice. Denzel Washington pulls out another great performance as well as an aged Val Kilmer. While some will point out that the plot is hard to swallow, it doesn't matter because it's wrapped up in sheer entertainment. You feel for these characters. There are no holes to be found in either the plot or it's twists. It's believable at the same time unbelievable. If you can get past the middle 20 minutes or so while they explain what the team can do, you're in for a great ride.I can't, in three paragraphs, paint a picture like Deja Vu. Of the many films Mr.Washington has put out over the last 4 years or so, this is by far his best if not one of the best of the year.Highly recommended for the open-minded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dumbing Down Of American Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I kept my hopes low for this mediocre time machine movie and my expectations were not exceeded! I realize the filmmakers are solely in it for the money. Film is now, for the most part, a commodity like toothpaste and paper towels - and it shows! I wouldn't even be surprised if Hollywood stooped so low as to hired Public Relation firms to write fake positive reviews on internet sites like this one! While I have no complaint with the acting, the storyline is just utterly ridiculous, and boring as tears. I don't think it is asking too much for a story to make some sense, instead of treating the movie going public like a bunch of teenagers looking for some cheap thrills!Where do I begin? This highly professional terrorist has no motive for his madness. He pops out of the blue, belongs to no organizations or movements, and has no ideology, no allies, and no one helping him. Our meany terrorist quotes Thomas Jefferson, claims he's not killing people because the U.S. military hurt his feelings when they rejected him for being "too much" of a patriot (I kid you not), and all he wants when he's captured is to confess like he's talking to a priest. (Plus a cigarette, of course - don't all bad guys smoke these days?) Oh, please, give me a break! How sanitized a story can you get? The filmmakers and screenwriters of Deja Vu have absolutely no guts, whatsoever, to make any kind of statement other than that terrorists are crazy and get hurt feelings! Wow! What an interesting insight! Next, The U.S. Government has a time machine that uses so much energy it caused the last Canada to New York blackout while doing experiments with just small animals, which, in-turn, all end-up going into cardiac arrest, and dying. But when our fearless hero, Denzel Washington, goes back in time the energy problem miraculously disappears. Keep in mind a single piece of paper was sent through time a couple of days earlier, and it knocked out a whole city's power! The dying problem is also solved too, with a full recovery taking less than a day. Keep in mind, when most people recover from going into cardiac arrest, they are usually not strong enough to waltz out of the hospital a couple of HOURS later! But Denzel is special, and he doesn't even have super powers! When Denzel is shot by a rather large caliber bullet, he begins losing blood fast. So fast in fact, that it's obvious to everyone he needs to make a trip to the emergency room, pronto! Instead he goes over to his women's home because of time constraints. There they wash his wound with water and dry it with paper towels. He miraculously stops bleeding because he washed his wound. No need for stitches or compresses, just soap and water stops bleeding from gunshot wounds. Imagine what other miracles would have occurred if he had the time to wash the rest of his body!I think you get the picture. This is such a dopey film because the stupidity is non-stop! It's a shame films are not rated based on cleverness and intelligence. If they were, perhaps filmmakers would start making more interesting movies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Well-Produced and Compelling Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This richly dense action-thriller has Denzel Washington as his typical but well cast character in this well thought out script that uses the idea of time and space in a superb manner. In one of the best genre thriller of its type, this consistent execution, high-quality production provides an intellectual and mostly satisfying experience. the movie also contents musical strains reminiscent of the intense and action-focised Bourne Identity series (2002) that also offers a similar strength and sharpness the movie's appeal. Except for a "Stargate" (from the movie and television series) like structure that unnecessarily detracts from the scene and the obvious impossibility or at least gigantic leap of science two-thirds way through the movie, such lapses are minor compared to the intensity and small deja vu clues that actually enhance the movie till the end. Sometimes predictable, but nevertheless, it's in the execution that matters here. A solid eight out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reality Crime Thriller With Neat Sci-Fi Twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually like sci-fi when it's pure sci-fi. I usually like present day drama when it's believably real. Disaster, at least for me, looms large when sci-fi meets real life drama. So here we have a present day crime thriller crossed with sci-fi time travel...And, this movie kicks butt, works so well, in fact, it's nuances should be studied in film school. It's original enough to be compelling-where we are not in some distant future, but the here and now.The story, the characters, and the effects mesh well to suspend belief to the point that you "get on-board" and enjoy the ride. This is the way to do sci-fi with believable real life situations. The cinematography, the implementation of technology, and even a beautiful (but presently dead) damsel in distress, combine to give the actors, who are uniformly good to excellent, the boost to put this in rarefied good sci-fi territory. Genre fans are shoo-ins and those who think they don't like sci-fi should enjoy this one too. 7.5 to 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting more of this film based on the title and the trailer but ultimately came away feeling a bit taken for a ride. I read Sci Fi, I understand some of the time travel stuff they write so would like to add some thoughts.To begin the whole process the ferry must blow up and he must travel back in time at least twice. The script writers get lazy in adding the ambulance and the stuff at the flat in the wrong time loop. They are compressing the two time loops into one time loop and using some of the elements to explain stuff that is logically wrong. Why two time loops and why is the film wrong? because the dead girl and the stuff at the flat and the ambulance all exist in the same time stream in the film. Why is this a problem: she must have been alive to help put it in the flat which he finds before he time travels but her dead body is in the morgue, so where was this other alive version of the girl in his current time stream???? She can't be the same girl in the river with fingers missing as that should already have happened. Now there are two of him at the end, but only because he time travelled, she never did, so there can only ever be one of her in any one time stream or loop at any one time. He saved her with the ambulance therefore its in the wrong time stream loop if she is also dead in the same time loop, so there must be two time loops, one where she is dead and one where she is alive. (now some might try to get round this by saying she was killed after going to the flat with Denzel and then placed in the river, but I don't think the timing and the positioning of the bomber will support that very well, and of course that didn't happen in the film)The whole sequence would make more sense if it went like this. start: A note arrives from the future on his desk, his partner gets it. His partner disrupts the bomber, gets shot. Bomber can no longer use the car. This makes the bomber go for the girl and her car. The car is changed the girl dies at the hand of the bomber she ends up in the river and found later but too early for the ferry explosion. There should be no traces at the flat. There should be no ambulance at the bombers place. Science team get him on board, he starts the investigation, he sends the note into the pastLoop 1 He travels back in time. He gets the ambulance. He saves the girl from the first death. They go back to her flat, he arranges the letters and leaves the blood etc. Bomber still rides across the bridge (very very important for the logic) They try and save the ferry they fail (and die) The ferry blows up (again).Logically this should have happened to have all the elements available at the start of the film to travel back a second time, where everything in the past is in place, so he can now see all of those things in the past that he put there and changed. So the time travel trip shown in the film should actually be the start of the movie (as it fits all the requirements for the first time loop) not the one leading to the shown ending which should logically be the end of the second time loop and the continuation of the time stream and exit from the time loop that could potentially go on for ever if the ferry keeps blowing up.NB Bomber riding across the bridge: In reality if he had succeeded in stopping the ferry from blowing up as shown in the movie he would not have been able to see the bomber ride across the bridge on the CCTV(future part) as he was changing the past in real time, eg Bomber is now on the ferry. (remember the two are linked in real time, they said so). The ambulance, bandages at the flat, phone call etc must exist in the same loop as the bomber riding across the bridge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Characters are made dumb, just like in horror movies and bad soap operas...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider time-travelling movies particularly interesting most of the time. I like the idea of a bridge between past and present, that turns communication possible, as well as timeline branching. I can remember "Frequency", that i found an amazing movie and recommend to those enjoying this subject. About this movie, there are a few things i particularly dislike. It's particularly annoying when characters are made stupid so that screenwriter get the story the way he wanted. Why was that paper sent to a place where Denzel would be just in that instant? After that "forced failure", why didn't they try to send the paper once again to a place he could certainly see it... his home for example... didn't he ever go to sleep? Then to solve all the problems... it was made possible sending him to the past... well i can't comment on that, i'll just assume it as a possibility in movie's reality, though it would be kind of impossible to imagine it after so much trouble sending the mass of little sheet of paper. But even when he was sent to the past, after the girl's rescue, the screenwriter created suspense by making characters once again stupid and complicating everything. Why didn't Denzel try to contact ATF and just warn to abort that ferry travel so that they could safely dismantle the bomb, without risking all that people's life... Well i'll answer that, because screenwriter wanted to break people's heart after his death, just when love between he and "Claire" (Paula Patton) had been set. And of course even more important was to make him appear once again, so that all people get happy again... I can't like movies that get their suspense or any other type of emotions, by turning characters dumb, this is usually done in bad horror movies. These and many other reasons don't make this movie a good reason to go to cinema. This is a Sunday's afternoon movie to watch with the family while pictionary is played, so that we don't take the movie too seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..and I say that after much thought - it's not just a knee-jerk reaction.I'm a sci-fi and action movie fan OK? And I have no problem suspending my disbelief if the story is good. But this was utter rubbish. The storyline is so weak and huge gaping plot-holes abound in this turkey. Once the "technology" was explained (not very well I might add, by Adam Goldberg's supposedly comic-relief techy) I thought, "Why not just send a message back to the cops warning them of the explosion? Or the ferry captain?" And whatever happened to acting? Denzel is sleep-walking, Val Kilmer has so few lines but he manages to invest them with all the emotion of a cabbage. And who were the others again...? Sorry, they seem to have slipped my mind.Oh, and it didn't look THAT good.All in all, a waste of ?10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top notch action flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a terrific movie, plain and simple. It kept you thinking and guessing at what was really going on, and in the end, all the holes close. That is unusual for any kind of "playing with time" kind of film, and all those involved deserve credit for doing it right. While the whole premise of the science involved has a deep flaw in it, it's not the sort of flaw that precludes the suspension of disbelief. Denzel Washington, Jim Caviziel and Adam Goldberg give memorable performances. Of course, there is no one better than Tony Scott when it comes to telling a story with pictures, and he's as good here, if not better than in Enemy of the State.10/10 because I finished my popcorn before I even noticed it was running low.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has potential, but fails miserably</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was embarrassing to watch. The thing that annoyed me the most was the fantastic time machine. Right, a video in HD-quality with sound that can be fixed in every possible angle and even zoom in so you can watch the digits on a phone display. Inside a house! And if you put something that stupid in a movie; don't try to explain it using real physics. It just makes matters worse; especially if you know physics. And this video system from the past was something a couple of guys had put together in a couple of days. Not to mention that these guys were the typical ubersmart morons you see in every sci-fi B-movie.I tried to look beyond that and enjoy the movie, but it was hard. Denzel and Val Kilmer's performances are OK, but the rest of the actors are somewhere between bad and horrible. The story has so many glitches you lose count. But toward the end the moral seems to be that no matter what you do to change the past, the final outcome is the same; actually a clever idea (although not an original one). But then he sends himself back in time (yeah, likely) and saves the day and the girl (not to mention himself). Seriously; the ending was a complete disaster. In the end nothing makes sense at all.Finally; who the heck was the bomber anyway, and what were his motives? I gave this movie 3/10 because it was partially entertaining. But it was mostly annoying. Do not see this movie unless you have a 13 hour flight and nothing else to watch. Or you can have a competition and see who finds most glitches in the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the opening credits. and they try and be clever. it doesn't work.our cast: Agent Doug Carlin is played by Denzel Washington who seems to be sleep-walking thru this movie with the occasional sudden inexplicable deviation of character. Val Kilmer has not aged well as Special FBI Agent Pryzwarra, a thickly-jowled pot-bellied cardboard representation of the one-dimensional G-man. Adam Goldberg tries (and really, really fails...i mean...oh boy) to pull off the super-brain heart-of-gold physics professor "Denny". Paula Patton makes great eye-candy damsel-was-in-distress and flashes us a nipple. the rest of the cast? meh...who cares?so how is the movie. eh. a 5/10 and that's being generous.here were the big problems:* the science was...well...utter crap AND inconsistent. why could they only see in the New Orleans radius and how exactly did the portable rig work outside of this area? why could a laser pointer go thru the main "screen but they needed this big-ass nuclear toaster to send that sheet of paper back? and, oh, the paper was the utter maximum we could send back but we've changed out minds and now we can send Denzel back but he has to be in his undies 'cause his shoes would weigh too much. wha? and if you want to emphasize that sending the laser bean, sheet of paper and Denzil use HUGE amounts of energy, don't use the same "aerial view of the city blacking out" all three bloody times.* there is NO character development in this film. none. nada. zilch. and Denzil's character has these unprecedented changes of emotion and character "quirks" that makes it nearly impossible to relate to him.* Denzil creates mayhem and carnage on the streets of New Orleans with a tricked-out Hummer (with enough product-placement stickers on it to make the movie's endorsement agent shudder uncontrollably with logolistic ecstasy) with impunity. he prolly kills several dozen innocent by-standers and doesn't get as much as a reduction of his expense account. and it's BORING! Tony Scott has sucked every atom of "thrill" from the whole sequence. oooh...here comes a semi-truck, head-on. will Denzil die? hell no...AND the Hummer will still be drivable afterward!!!* in the final climax, where the HECK did the bad guy get the kelvar vest, automatic weapons, and ammo? he didn't have it when he ran back onto the ferry.* and while we're talking about magic guns, and why would Navy personnel, on their way to Mardi Gras, just happen to be wearing full combat gear and toting M-15s?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another great Tony + Denzel combination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing "Man on Fire" I was looking forward to a movie from Tony Scott and Denzel. The movie was worth waiting for. I have seen this movie at a theater with no empty seats. The story is great, the acting is pretty good. There were a few moments where the story was broken but was not a big issue within the whole story. The story is about a terrorist blowing a ship where there was a celebration of the Navy. Denzel investigates the crime and finds some clues that don't make sense. He is invited to work with a special investigation unit because he is a local (and a smart detective). There are pretty original action scenes that were shot clearly (unlike "Domino" where the camera was shaky and fuzzy all the time). If you like an action movie with some good story, this is the movie for you. TRIVIA: The word "Dejavu" is not mentioned even once, in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moderately Entertaining, but you have to overlook too much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though moderately entertaining, there are too many things you have to overlook to make it one cohesive movie. So let's begin. Let's first overlook the fact that the movie butchers physics- you would think they'd at least bring someone on staff that knows SOMETHING about wormholes etc. to at least attempt to ground this movie in science. They didn't. Since it's a fictional movie- this is forgivable - we'll overlook that it (producing wormholes) can't possibly happen and the science behind it is laughable. Secondly, they never really explain why there are two of him - is this some sort "The Prestige" rip-off? My thought is if you send someone into the past - that's changing the past and there is only one of the person- you're not cloning someone - they use all this fake science mumbo-jumbo to make you try to answer your own question or just ignore the fact there's two of him. Give me a concrete answer on why there's two of him (and how he makes it back to the future when it hasn't worked before--why this time? because it's Denzel?) It also seems they kind of just ignore the fact he most probably killed his partner, probably 40-50 people on the highway by driving recklessly(if not killed, paralyzed) to save the girl that he had a crush on (real romantic). Let's also overlook all the scenes where they spied on the girl in the shower and changing - because they should be arrested for that considering that's pretty illegal and inappropriate. I'm going to start rambling so bear with me- she pulls a gun on him- and he makes a joke that he didn't know that was going to happen - but he really should have, they pass it off as a joke because they can't explain that scene. The ending where they drive the truck off of the boat - in a stroke of divine intervention- they crash through all the immobile cars -with the distance they had - maximum they could be going 15 MPH - yet they plow through and manage to not only drive the truck OFF the ship, but get it way up in the air to flip around. That's impressive! My last huge qualm about the movie is- when he heads towards the bayou at the end, he's in SUCH a hurry - yet - at the girl's house they spend so much time bandaging him and are in no hurry. That scene would lack ANY suspense if they hurried up at her house and didn't park right out front of the Bayou.In my opinion, this movie would have been better served having Denzel die - the girl get sucked into the ships propeller (to have her fingers cut off) and wash up on the ocean shore to show that you can't mess around with the past or to elaborate more on the 'human sacrifice' line of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A complete disaster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am really sorry if I offend some of the commentators' tastes, but for me this movie was a complete disaster.Tony Scott, Denzel Washington, these names to me mean reputation and a guarantee of a decent, solid entertainment. I wasn't expecting anything deep or any food for thought, but pure, perfect entertainment. How disappointing! A time machine?! Ability to watch the past?! Through the walls?! Plus audio?! The scene where Denzel uses his laser pointer to unveil the truth about the real function of the machine and then exclaims in such a dramatic tonality "Can anyone tell me WHAT-IS-GOING-ON-HERE" was just...funny and made me literally fall of my chair... Please don't see this movie, for sake of your well-being. Remember "The Village" from 2004 and the disappointment of it not being an intriguing horror movie, but a piece about some isolated place in the national park...? After seeing "Deja vu", you'll enjoy a similar aftertaste of disappointment, ridiculousness of the content and waste of your money as well as time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can we really appreciate a movie?......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, am i wrong, or is the comments area in IMDb there for commenting a movie? What can i say? Some of the people in here are not commenting the movie, they adapt it to our own reality and try to make sense out of it. I will not make the same mistake....The movie itself is a complex of thriller-drama-action-SciFi and i have to say that Tony Scott did a very good job (especially for his action scenes). Denzel and Val are very good but the applause goes for Jim and the new girl Paula Patton. She actually steals the first role from Denzel. And Jim who plays for about half-or-less an hour makes you think immediately that he is the bad guy. What more can you expect from an actor?The film has a fast pace that doesn't let you get bored and although it lasts about 2 hours, it's coming to the end quite quick. I have to admit that there are some errors (the-country-hurt-my-feelings explanation for the bad guy turned to a terrorist is at the least laughable, the time-travel theories cannot be minimized into a 2 minutes analysis such as portrayed here), but after all, when you see a film of this kind you do not expect everything to be clear as the stars in the night sky (without clouds of course).And that's the BIG question. Do you watch this kind of movies for entertaining reasons, just simply to pass your time relaxed, make your mind forget the things you worry about the rest of the day etc, OR you want every single movie you watch - even a SciFi-action-thriller like this one - to make you think about our cosmos and the universe and the societies and the world and whatever?Answer the question, what you REALLY want and expect for any given kind of movie and i promise that you will find yourself to be more amused after you watch any film from there on.....For myself speaking, this film deserves a brave 8. It was pretty amusing - and that's really the whole point, isn't it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, But Extremely Contrived</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This crime-time travel movie was interesting all the way, but I can't help thinking it could have been much better. There were just too many holes in this story, too many clichés and implausible things that made it less enjoyable than it could have been. It wasn't an intelligent time-travel story, not like "Frequency," or "Somewhere In Time" or a bunch of others. For instance, when the killer has his two adversaries right in front of him and walks away without checking to see if they are dead, it isn't smartly written. When everything important happens at the last possible second, literally, then it's too contrived. The movie is filled with contrivances, and it's too bad because it good have been an excellent film. Hey, I like happy endings, too, but this is too much and an insult to any viewer's intelligence.For pure amusement, I recommend this. You'll be entertained. But don't be surprised if your intelligence is insulted a number of times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wrong Approach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lets get to it.What initially intrigued me about the movie was the time-machine gizmo could only be used to view the past. This is new as most time-machine movies involve going back to the past to change things, which I find to be very annoying.The movie would've been much better if thats all the time-machine could do. And even when it was established that you could interfere with the past, the movie explored the theme that you cannot change the past, which would've also been adequate, but we all know this is Hollywood. You must save the world, so they basically messed up what could've been a great movie.And the terrorist guy seemed to also hint at the theme of not being able to change the past, but for some reason the story took the mediocre, uncreative, dull approach.Very disappointing movie, its watchable, but I'm giving it a 1 because in the beginning it looked like it could be a classic, but degenerated into mediocrity, so I think thats a tragedy.Don't watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent thriller with the right amount of twists in it, yet an amusingly corny packed ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was pretty much what I expected. Nothing too serious, just a fun ride from the beginning till the end. The plot has this good twist in it, which makes the movie interesting and there is overall pretty much the right amount of sci-fi and thriller blended together.What to expect from a movie produced by Jerry Bruckheimer? Explosions, gun fights, car chases and over the top dramatized scenes. Well, that's pretty much what you get from Déj? Vu. The movie's enjoyable, but like said before, it's nothing too serious. Denzel Washington is entertaining as usual, a right man for the role indeed. Don't expect this movie to contain any phenomenal role performances, as that is really not the case when it comes to movies like this one. This is just another perfect example of a movie which is only made for entertaining purposes. If you want to see this and you see this, it's what you expect it to be, nothing more or nothing less, you finish the movie with that usual smile on your face. Your entertain level is satisfied.The movie's a big cliché overall, quoting myself on what said before; Over the top dramatized scenes. I mean, it's so predictable. The cinematography almost does that all for you; Fast forwarding, slow motions, shaking the camera, the screen flashing white every now and then.. I could go on and on, but oh well, you get the point. That is sadly pretty much what the cinematography always does in these kind of movie nowadays. It's like every possible way of cinematography is already used before and no-one tries to make anything unique anymore. You could always just cut down the cliché(ish) ways and keep it simple and normal. Well, then the movies like these wouldn't actually be movies like these, so the cinematography does what it's supposed to do after all. You can't complain about that, now can you? The music is also used to make it more over the top and it's just a bunch of corny compositions put together to make the movie more emotional, but for me it's more like a bad joke. Overall the music is also so predictable, giving a random example of that; "Now he sees a dead man, now his eyes freeze, now he walks next to the body, close-up shot of the body, corny piano music starts playing, close-up to the main character's eyes, now a tear drop, oh how sad" Yup, got it right again. So predictable. Well, you can't complain as then again, you get what you order.Like I mentioned before, the plot has this good twist in it and it does make the movie interesting. It's also a bit unique in its own way. Though it is surprising at first, it's all downhill after that, as then it catches that famous predictability. Well it's not as bad as you may think from that last sentence, it's just is what it is. Despite from all of this negative feedback I'd still recommend the movie if you're looking for an action packed ride with a bad ass lead actor in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exact deja vu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I seriously get tired (bored) of some stories, because the stories of such movies are always the same, nothing new or different and some of them is lack of entertainment or action or both which is unbearable. We go to the cinema or buy DVDs to see action movies or thrillers and to be entertained, but... Deja Vu is the most tasteless action thriller ever made to me which is surprising because the director is Tony Scott who I enjoyed almost all of his films that I have seen so far. The movie looks good, but not stylish. The movie was not fun at all to me, because many parts of the movie take place in a research center, scientific institution where Carlin spends most of his time to illustrate the case. I very seldomly call a movie boring, but these scenes are boring, there is only one, yes one action scene in the movie which we can see almost nothing, because Carlin sees the present and the past at the same time in this action scene. This scene is also pretty short. I don't know how can I explain this, but the movie was crude a sort of. The action thrillers about time travel are usually very bad, even if it is not as bad as Deja Vu, Next was very bad, but at least pretty enjoyable. The plot of the movie is based on a psychopath who detonates a bomb in a cruise ship and a cop who tries to stop him. What a cliché and banal story, oh dear, extremely dated. Didn't they realize that the story itself is a real deja vu? Why they don't give up writing same stories about a man who detonates somewhere and people who race against time? The Dark Knight was the same either, wasn't it? Almost all the people who watched the film say it is a fun ride. Is it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Washington and Brokheimer, a winning combination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deja Vu is a high-action, crime-drama, sci-fi, thriller which is exactly what you would expect from Jerry Bruckheimer, producer of such action-adventures as "Con Air," "Enemy of the State," "National Treasure," "Pirates of the Caribbean," and another Denzel Washington favorite, "Remember the Titans." The story opens with an explosion on board a New Orleans Ferry, and takes the audience back through an unfolding of events that leads up to the tragic scene. Even the most modern technology hasn't gone as far as the storyline takes us. The premise is thrilling and the implications stimulate the imagination. For example; "how would altering the past impact people and events of the present?" The acting is superb, with Denzel Washington and Paula Patton as romantic leads. James Caviezel does an extraordinary job as the villain, which is a departure from his role as Jesus in "The Passion of the Christ." There is plenty of action and some of it violent. Be prepared to see a few corpses like those on television's "CSI" or "Crossing Jordon." There are gun fights, but with a minimum of blood. While the movie is certainly intense, much of the severe action is implicit and takes place off camera. For an action packed, PG-13 movie, I was particularly impressed with the limited amount of rough language. I imagine with Denzel and James in the cast, there was an effort to keep it "clean." This is one of the few remaining Touchstone Pictures releases. Parent company, Walt Disney Studios is committed to producing action movies that appeal to a wider family audience. We're awarding "Deja Vu" the Dove Family-Approved Seal at for audience members over age 12.(www.dove.org) Parents should look over the violent content issues before deciding whether to bring tweens along.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a major surprise! I hadn't heard of it when I watched it with about 30 people &amp; I noticed of those around me, that the sense of suspense I was impressed by, was seemingly much broader appreciated, as you could have heard a pin drop, &amp; looking around twice, I noticed every eye was engaged on the evolving plot of cleverness but delicacy on the screen! Time &amp; again, I didn't see how the plot was about to unravel! I doubt it could succeed. But I was pleasantly surprised, time &amp; again. It did! It did succeed! My only reservations being the flawed improbabilities of the car chase scenes. All I can say is that a 10+ movie in my eyes, became a 10/10.I looked at the protagonist gazing at the images of the past projected before his eyes. He was questioning, even sceptical. But he kept churning through the possibilities into impossibilities! So did the car seller amidst her innocent emerging predicament of trauma into tragedy! And potentially, much more tragedy! Hero &amp; heroine, beckoning, but not without individual flaws! So surely realistic. But evolving into their transformed existences of abstract suspicion but not total distrust, that would have served the interests of powerful interests that covered up most of their conglomerate dealings to their fullest intent of deception, into more deceit &amp; injustice! I was impressed by the time travel aspects presented but acknowledging its shortcomings! I didn't see how it might be sufficiently drawn together, but it was! At least to my satisfaction.A night at the movies I thought would be without much merit, but turned out to be a masterpiece!Personally, I thought it was the superb drama of "Three Days of the Condor" updated 25 years! My only reservation being, that I would have given "Three Days of the Condor" 10+ that I cannot give this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific underrated thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The late Tony Scott and Denzel Washington collaborated on five films, the second last of which is underrated sci fi thriller Deja Vu. It contains Scott's trademark visual style, all skitchy sketchy frames, deliriously rapid editing and deep, gorgeously saturated colours that pisses a lot of people off in its garish, flippant aesthetic. I for one love his style, and here he is coming down off the high that was his masterpiece, Domino, exercising restraint that was no doubt mandated by the studio bigwigs. Nevertheless, the same unmistakably heightened forces of filmmaking that flow through the veins of this crackling thriller can be found in most of his work, just in smaller doses here. The film tackles a lot in its unassuming narrative, from terrorist bombing, an elliptical story that's put in an otherworldly trance by a plot point involving a high tech time travel capability, and a surprisingly heartfelt undercurrant that somewhat sneaks up on you. During a captivating opening credit sequence, we see a horrific explosion onboard a navy transport ferry in the New Orleans harbour, killing over five hundred people including women and children. ATF Agent Doug Carlin (Washington) is called in to investigate, and before long his cunning intuition catches the eye of FBI Agent Pryzwara (an unusually calm Val Kilmer) who is spearheading a very hush hush investigative technique that's being used to track the terrorist in the days leading up to the incident. What Kilmer doesn't tell him is the mind- bending metaphysical implications of it, but keener Denzel gets wise to their act, and throws himself headlong into a quest to stop the bomber, save the mysterious Claire (Paula Patton, just phenomenal) who was murdered and has ties to the event, and reverse time. Denzel is an implosive wrecking ball of determination, his ingenuity and reserve made me wonder why Carlins career aspirations stopped short of the ATF. I don't know why Patton isn't in more films (she recently starred alongside Denzel again in the super fun 2 Guns), she brings a battered resilience to her work, and is a radiant beauty to boot. Peppy gerbil Adam Goldberg is the obligatory one liner spewing techie who's got more going on than his exterior may read, and Bruce Greenwood is all stern bluster as the FBI honcho in charge. This film doesn't often come up in discussions of either Denzel's or Scott's greatest hits, but it's ripe for rediscovery and praise. Propulsive action, far fetched sci fi intrigue that's hard to digest and follow, yet simultaneously wicked fun, and like I said before an emotional core that takes you by surprise. There's a sentence that I internally intone to myself whenever I see a film, or aspects within a film that fire up my adrenal glands, tear ducts or simply rouse my soul. Be it a banger of an action sequence, a romance that hits all the right notes, a good old fashioned fantastical invention or visual flights of fantasy that stir wonder within me. That sentence is "This is why I watch movies". I get no greater pleasure in my cinematic escapades than being able to say that to myself as my heart pumps to the tune of whatever grand spectacle I'm witnessing before me on screen. I can tell you, the sentence was uttered while watching this one, and now that I think of it, pretty much every film in Scott's portfolio. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the makers of this movie couldn't decide whether they wanted to make a science-fiction or some kind of political-fiction film; what would point to the first of the two genres is of course the whole concept of time traveling but unfortunately there is too much effort put into placing this in reality (a reference to energy blackout in Canada, the date is shown on several occasions). The result is that the viewer doesn't believe what he sees and one loses the interest in the whole story - if the science-fiction rules of telling the story had been applied along the way this could have been a good, watchable movie.Denzel has made three films with this director and each one of them is worse than it's predecessor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hampered by unoriginality and mismarketing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is hampered by unoriginality and bad marketing more than anything else. For anyone who's keeping count this is Denzel Washington's 4th role as a tough guy cop with everything on his hands in 3 years.To review them: In Out of Time, he plays a cop who is in love with someone who becomes a victim. In Man on Fire, he plays a jaded cop who sees his personal redemption as keeping a certain girl safe. In this film, he plays an Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Agent (I know, big change) who sees his redemption as saving a woman who's about to be murdered, who he's also slowly falling in love with. The recycling of plots and inability to find something new for Denzel Washington to do is the most appropriate use of the title Deja Vu, because it really doesn't have much to do with the plot.The film is actually more of a time travel movie, in which Denzel Washington and company are able to look through a window in time back 4 and a 1/2 days and try to travel back in order to prevent a massive explosion. Doesn't that sound much cooler? It is in fact much cooler but there was absolutely nothing about that in the plot description at the movie theater. My cousin, who i went to see it with, thought that that was because sci-fi movies don't sell. Personally, I thought it was because the perfect title for the film "Out of Time" was already taken.One of the main gimmicks that makes the movie cool is the use of surveillance technology featured in the film, that also made the 1998 film "Enemy of the State" so cool. And what do you know: The same director (Tony Scott) AND producer (Jerry Bruckenheimer) were the filmmakers of that project too. Deja vu all over again.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, when it comes to the gimmick of going back and forth in time, inevitably the writers are confronted with something called "logic." That "logic" is missing in droves in this movie and suspension of disbelief is more than an unusual occurrence.Also, I think it is time that Denzel Washington stops playing cops, whether they belong to the federal branch or not.His acting has become predictable and worse, boring. He is a good actor whose talents are going to waste.Every character in this movie is predictable and never hint to any kind of originality.To make the movie even more unpalatable, Val Kilmer, who is in his own right an extremely talented actor with a powerful range, is totally wasted in this film.He could have e-mailed his lines.Also, I don't know whether he gained weight for the role, but his leading man good looks were left at home and in their place was a pudgy, overweight mug of someone who does not care what he looks like. In Hollywood, that can be dangerous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tony Scott reaches new peaks of lameness with this thriller. Tony Scott also directed the somewhat more successful Enemy Of The State, which by the way has a similar theme, and the abysmal Domino.True, it has a good pace when it comes to action and suspense, but all this is really negligible when you look at such small things as the premises for the story.When science is used to create a plot twist, the producers should really use a scientific consultant, instead of going "Hey, that would be cool! And what if we make the gizmo do THIS kind of fancy trick ..." The results are invariable laughable and lame, not to say insulting to the viewer's intelligence.Well, plot holes aside, what about the handiwork? The editing and camera-work is above average, the music is a bit annoying (what IS it with that backwards piano sample that fancy thrillers use these days?), but the visual effects are very good.As for the casting ... We don't get to know Denzel Washingtons character in any depth. Actually, all the characters are quite flat, except perhaps for Paula Patton's character Claire. Denzel also has strange uncharacteristic outbursts of laughter at very misplaced moments, that gave me that uneasy feeling that he was downright insane. That wasn't the intention, was it ... ? It's just as if Tony Scott said: "Hey, I was not entirely satisfied by the performance here; let's shoot that laughing sequence again, laugh *harder*, and cut-and-paste it into the original scene." It is actually disturbing to look at. Val Kilmer is horrible as always (do something about that mole, for crying out loud, and smarten up!) and some of the one-liners are really off the scale in lameness. (For example something like "It's a really bad week to quit smoking hash" from a science-guy. Hardy-har.) Jim "Holy Man" Caviezel is actually quite good in this flick. He was scary sometimes.Bottom line: Annoying movie, but enjoyable action when you forget about all the negative things for a minute.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am sorry to write that this was a very very awful movie, full of stereotypes and self-contradictions. It was a real disappointment for me. Why is that a director and/or the scriptwriter lets things happen in a movie as things happen in this movie: inconsistent, illogical? Why is that if someone wants to play with the time-flow, he is so unprepared. This movie is one of the worst movies playing with the time. Maybe the director should have watched e.g. 12 Monkeys (at least once) to learn how to make a good and consistent story when changing the timeline.I recommend this movie only for those people who would like to see an (below) average B-movie, but not for those people who are irritated by huge mistakes in scripts.SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILERJust a few questions that arose in my head during the movie, but cannot be answered in a logical of life-like, realistic way:1. I don't want to mention the fact that the main 'axis' of the movie (ie the time-vision or rather past-vision machine) is contrary to the laws of physics itself. Not in this film, OK. But above that it is unclear: if you cannot send back any thing to the past (the experts said), how was it possible to send back that slip of paper with the notes? OK, the crew finally managed it: they put the paper in the appropriate chamber and transported it back. Then our hero, Doug wanted to jump back in time. He climbed into the chamber (he was allowed tho wear some clothes, that means, the machine transports not only the body, but also other materials on it, but not the gun, of course!) and jumped back in time. Of course he made it! But how could he change the past pointing simply with his laser pointer on a simple screen (ie not through the chamber!)??? How was it possible?2. The mobile past-vision machine was so complicated that only one member of the crew was able to handle it. Maybe he was the only one who could drive a car or who could turn a simple button on and off! (That was the only thing Doug had to do with it!)3. Then Doug took the ambulance and crashed into the building with Claire and the bad guy in it. He was lucky enough not to run over Claire lying on the floor totally bound and spilled over with gasoline. Then he took her body and jumped out of the building successfully even after the whole building exploded. It didn't matter that Claires clothes were totally wet of gasoline and she should have caught fire from the smallest spark (or the charming eyes of Doug) and should have burnt like hell.4. After getting back to her apartment she should have smelled like a gas station very likely but that was not disturbing because she didn't even take a shower and didn't want to change her clothes.5. Of course this was the most simple way for Doug (who was shot) to drive to the ferry and hinder the crime himself instead of dialing 911 and reporting 2 simple things: there is a car full of explosives on a ferry, and the perpetrator is watching it from a bridge nearby.6. Women kidnapped by a terrorist, then freed by a strange policeman (driving an ambulance instead of a car) always want to kiss the policeman after knowing him only for 2 hours.7. Confused women mentioned before who escape from a sunken car (and leaving behind a policeman) are not surprised even a bit when the smiling double-ganger of the fellow appears in front of them.It's only a fraction of the questions I would like to ask from the movie makers (who made this terrible thing called movie). It is possible that I am the only one who wants to see an action movie with a real, life-like hero.</fullReview>

Instead the movie was a big disappointment, the storyline too simple and basically the whole movie felt like a mix of X-files and some other sci-fi TV series.Val Kilmer grew very old in this movie and is not up to any action in this movie, besides watching some big computer monitors and running around his office table. While Denzel Washington does compensate, he is not able to carry the movie as a whole, so if you expect a complex Deja-Vu, don't go, if you are in for a mere action ride thrill-seeker, well then go check it out.

		<fullReview>A terrorist act starts the movie off with a bang and in the earlier stages we were entertained with some fine forensic work. Jerry Bruckheimer brought CSI to the big screen perhaps.In the acting department, there were also some solid performances from Denzel Washington, Adam Goldberg, Val Kilmer and Jim Calviezel.The initial science fiction element was a treat for fans of multi-dimensional time observation and travel, and it also provided us with some interesting paradoxes.Unfortunately, we then get into the last third of the movie. It's predictability was an unwelcome jolt to enjoyment I was getting from the film up to that time. The man goes back in time to rescue the beautiful damsel in distress and he succeeds admirably. I'm sure that the two of them will live out their days together in nirvana.It seemed that the actual prevention of the terrorist act was secondary compared to the developing relationship between Denzel and his damsel.This last part of film in my opinion spoiled what in many ways could have been one of the industry's better thrillers.The changing the past element of the movie could have been handled more effectively without the falling in love element. It begs the obvious question - If the damsel-in-distress wasn't so stunning and beautiful, how quickly would Denzel's character offered to transport his body on a 50-50 do or die mission to go back into the past to rescue her. Would he have gone back just to prevent the bombing?Oh for the days of "Quantum Leap" and "7 Days".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting idea with too many plot devices and TNT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Doug Carlin is an ATF agent investigating a bombing of a crowded New Orleans ferry which left over 500 people dead. He joins a new, highly secretive investigation unit that can literally look into the past with a new high-tech machine as they try to solve the crime.It starts as an interesting thriller, but the misleading marketing becomes very apparent very soon. The trailer reflects a different movie and the much hyped "mystery of deja vu" is nowhere to be seen. The whole "big secret that he government doesn't want you to know" is hokey by today as it has been in science fiction since the 1940s. The plot line is admittedly interesting, but favors gimmicks, plot devices, and pyrotechnics over something truly interesting. Basically, you're run of the mill Bruckheimer flick and it is getting quite old by now. Also the plot sounds interesting, but like mentioned before, the ambitions presented in the trailer are merely marketing and go nowhere in the actual film. But they do get you to buy a ticket so Jerry Bruckheimer can add to his his Scrooge-size mountain of cash so remains happy and eager to squeeze out his next turd.The only real good part is Tony Scott whose kinetic direction adds some decent flavor, but it is nearly ruined by some truly bizarre things. In the car chase cars get flung up to in the air for no reason, they just literally BETWEEN TWO CUTS appear to be on the ground and then all of a sudden in the air and then they land in a heap of twisted metal. However, soon after our hero gets slammed head on by an 18-wheeler and he and his car remain virtually unscathed. I mean, please, I don't want 100% realism, but you have to keep things consistent WITHIN THE FILM.That stuff would be forgivable if the story was good, but ridiculous plot devices push the story to a sappy end and that effectively destroys the interesting premise. 3/10Rated PG-13: violence and intense action. Gets pretty close to an R though. Maybe after he is done blowing everything up, Jerry Bruckheimer will invent a new rating: NC-13. Just a thought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you liked Deja Vu, you'll LOVE Pastwatch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pastwatch: the Redemption of Christopher Columbus is a science fiction novel by Orson Scott Card, dealing with time travel and alternate history. It's easily the best piece of fiction I have ever read from any author. It is one of only two books that had me crying for joy by the end.The book's focus is the life and activities of Christopher Columbus. Much of the action deals with a group of scientists from a doomed future Earth who use their TempoView device to see events in the past. When the much improved TrueSight II comes out, they find they are having an effect on the past by using it. After concluding that Columbus' disastrous contact with the Native North Americans would make an ideal candidate for changing history, they decide to travel back to the 15th Century.Highly, HIGHLY recommended reading for fans of all types of fiction. A thoroughly enjoyable read!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An insult to anybody who finished elementary school</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have recently been watching a string of movies dealing with time travel/parallel universes, such as Primer, La Moustache, The Machinist. Deja Vu seemed to fit the category, so I decided to give it a try. While most of the other movies were a bit obscure, this one had a sizable budget and did well in the box office. A 7.1 looks good, so I was expecting something meaningful. Boy did I get burned. This movie is atrocious.The protagonist is Doug Carlin, also known as DIAPR, Denzel In Another Police Role. In the beginning it didn't seem too bad. A terrible 9/11 like terrorist attack kills 543 men, women and children in New Orleans. A team of specialists are assigned to tackle the investigation.Enter Doug. A loudmouth, annoying, overpaid ATF agent. He drops in shouting ''who's in charge'' like some sort of action hero, then laughs when it turns out to be some fat dude, which is always cause for hilarity, and goes for coffee. (let's get our priorities straight, eh?) He proceeds to watch footage of what appears to be a suspect for the terrorist attack, at which point some other dimwit cop makes a joke about how he's taking a leak on the highway, and Doug bursts out in uncontrollable laughter.Can it get any more unprofessional? Over 500 people just died in the greatest attack on the USA since the Twin Towers, and nobody seems the least bit shaken.But it gets worse. We finally get to the time machine bit. Of course the scientists don't bother explaining how it all works to Doug, because they quite rightly figure out he's not the brightest bulb.Then the really good part. Doug decides to point a laser pen at the screen, which of course CAUSES THE SYSTEM TO CRASH. Hunh?! So is this screen a direct portal to the past, or something? I'd say NOT, seeing as how they have a special chamber to teleport small animals and pieces of paper to the past. So what exactly is the logic behind this? There is none.Then Doug gets enraged, and demands to know how this machine really works. They try to tell him. But no, even the dumbed down, layman's terms explanation are too much for Doug to handle, and he demands an even simpler explanation? What? Was this movie targeted at preschoolers? Which part of ''space time continuum'' is so hard to understand? Is the folding paper example really necessary? It's obvious the writers didn't have a clue what Quantum Mechanics are, nor did they hire a consultant to help them with it. They oversimplified and altered the entire theory so that any Joe Average can understand it. What's the point of technobabble if it's crystal clear to everybody what they are saying anyway? Anyway, Doug continues to be out-of-control angry, and even smashes up an expensive monitor to have an example of what ''death'' means. Broken monitor means dead. Brilliant. I guess the taxpayers won't mind if you randomly destroy government property for no real reason, with no repercussions. It was at this point that I switched off the movie.This garbage is an insult to anybody with half a brain. I realize this is an action movie, but when the protagonist is such an unlikeable bastard who I wish got a bullet to the brain, it's obvious I'm not gonna enjoy the rest.1 out of 10 stars. Don't waste your time on this, not even as a joke</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a two hour music video. Jerky so called documentary style shooting and an edit every 8 frames or so. Even an epileptic experiencing a seizure could hold a camera steadier then what's presented here. I'm not sure if it's the ego of the D.O.P. the editor or the director that for so long this style of film making has been popular. Get over it folks....move on...this is a completely hackneyed look. So much of the viewers attention is brought to what's going on behind the camera instead of what's going on in front of it. To compliment this style of shooting you will find included a music score that never stops. I understand why though....this movie is so poorly put together that without it dictating how we should be feeling at any given moment we'd be completely emotionally nonplussed.I almost walked out on this film but I was hoping that with so many apparent holes in the plot line that it would somehow miraculously pull itself together with a surprise ending that would at least bring some intelligence to the film. It doesn't.The movie is dedicated to the spirit of the people in New Orleans. I think they could have done without this vote of confidence.I give it a two because I did for a few moments find myself enjoying the movie but ultimately the premise of the movie is so retarded that it was impossible to suspend my disbelief.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie, not expecting much and believe it or not that is exactly what I got. This was another Hollywood attempt to be creative and imaginative. They came no where close... Like in the past, with 'Back to the Future', Deja Vu attempts to have fun with the prospect of time travel. But unlike 'Back to the Future' this was not fun.I am a guy who loves his science fiction movies, from Donnie Darko to Primer. I was blown away by these films...Jeja Vu was a non-stop, time traveling disaster. The plot was weak, the characters you couldn't care less what happens to them and as for the science behind the time traveling... well... lets just say they bought a book called 'Time Travel for Beginners'. There was no suspense and everything seemed to fall into a perfectly neat package. Oh and as for the shocking ending, as Jerry Bruckhimer said on a interview, I'm still waiting for it.If you want to just switch off the brain because you had a hard day, watch this film. If you are a time travel fanatic and sci-fi buff avoid at all costs. Because you will end up wanting to go back in time to tell yourself not to go see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILERS* I went to see this movie because of Denzel Washington. I walked out at about halftime, I couldn't take it.Basically, it starts off as a decent detective movie, with nice directing and all. Denzel is good. Then, after about 30 minutes or so, they walk into an FBI center type thing, where there is a machine that is able to display the past (!), but only 4.5 days back (?!), by using satellite imagery. There goes the cop story. At this point I asked my GF whether we could leave, but she wanted to stay a few more minutes. A few minutes later in the movie DW discovers that the machine is actually a time machine (?!?!). Then one of the characters started off with the same old explanation about space-time and demonstrated it by folding a piece of paper. They used words like entropy. At this point we couldn't take it anymore and walked out.According to other posters here, later in the movie DW actually time-travels into the past and changes the future. GREAT.

		<fullReview>This movie was a piece of work. Up from the very beginning we get a surreal image of New Orleans' people being "grateful" about Katrina. That is pictured by a slogan saying "Katrina only made us stronger". Then, there's the Fox News helicopter being the only one covering the ferry. Of course, the whole movie seems part of the relentless post 9/11 scare mongering tactics. Too many direct and indirect allusions to "support the troops" and "mission accomplished" makes it a blatant propaganda piece. The little sci-fi part was absolutely pathetic. Don't get me wrong, I like being lied to for entertainment's sake, but way too many trivial things didn't add up.The acting, while backed by names like Denzel and Val, was not anywhere near what the standard of a "good movie". The only thing the movie had going for it, was the very good job Tony Scott did with the action scenes. All in all, go see this one if you're a lobotomized action fan. Otherwise, better skip it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deja Vu is NOT to be missed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As most great movies, Deja Vu may be enjoyed on many levels. Many will just enjoy the pure fast-moving entertainment value of the movie - Denzel Washington puts in another stellar performance, and is supported by an excellent cast. About the only thing negative I'd have to say is the lack of depth in the other characters... but that's simply necessary in a 2 hour movie with so much to tell.Many (especially us guys!) will enjoy the sci-fi aspects of the movie... and leave the gadgetry at that. Which is a shame. Because there's so much more that is being intimated here.Of course, there are the romantic aspects that Hollywood must have... and the predictable ending.But the part that excited me most, and I hope gets some others thinking, is what makes this a GREAT movie rather than just another predictable Hollywood moneymaker.And that is those elements that get us thinking... maybe there's really more than just what's in front of our eyes in this experience we call being "human"? The movie does a really good job at opening up a line of questioning that leading Scientists have been approaching over just the last couple decades... and that many folks exploring "off-the-beaten-path" forms of spiritual thinking are doing in greater and greater numbers today.Witness the surprisingly massive audience for best-sellers like Neale Donald Walsh's "Conversations with God" series, and more recently Gary Renard's "Disappearance of the Universe" and "Your Immortal Reality" book series.As these authors and some leading Scientists explain, there may be more to heaven and earth than meets the eye! These authors confirm Deja Vu's premise that parallel threads of "reality" are not only possible, but happening as we speak, simultaneously with the only existence we seem to be conscious of in this moment.And as explained in the great spiritual text we would all do well to read, "A Course In Miracles", the "reality" we seem to be experiencing here is but another dream, and we are the dream makers... so we get to make it up in new and different ways as much as we want. Our job here is to awaken from the dream, and become aware again of who we really are (spiritual beings have a brief, human experience) and where we really are (with God, and all God's sons and daughters).And if that's a bit too far out for you, then just enjoy the movie at whatever level you choose... it's all good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Algiers, New Orleans, after the explosion of a ferry transporting the sailors from the USS Nimitz and their families with 543 casualties, the lonely AFT agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) is assigned to investigate the terrorist attack. Without any lead, he is informed by Sheriff Reed about a corpse of a woman that was found one hour before the explosion, but burnt with the same explosive. He is invited by FBI Agent Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer) to join the surveillance team leaded by Jack McCready (Bruce Greenwood) in the investigations, using a time window and Einstein-Rosen bridge through seven satellites to look back four and half days in time. He discloses the identity of the mysterious dead woman called Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton) and decides to follow her last moments trying to find the criminal. Along the surveillance, Doug falls in love for Claire and tries to change destiny, saving her life."Déj? Vu" is a great deception, with a flawed, shallow and corny screenplay. The paradoxical story is full of inconsistencies, but the worst is the ridiculous and incoherent conclusion. I like time travel movies, but the plot of this overrated flick is full of holes. I believe the misleading title "Déj? Vu" refers to the role of Denzel Washington, very similar to many others of his movies. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): "Déj?vu"</fullReview>

I'm not sure what writers get paid these days but obviously not as much as the special effects guys. Who needs a good story anyway? This one was more likely to appear on Days of Our Lives than the big screen. Clumsy, awkward, forced, contrived, devoid of pretty much any redeeming quality unless you can wear ear plugs and watch the movie purely for the special effects. By the end of the movie I was laughing out loud at the ridiculous plot developments and had several times convinced the two people I was with (a man and woman 25-35) to stick through the movie in hopes there was a redeeming ending.

		<fullReview>Déj? Vu. A film directed by Tony Scott and starring Denzel Washington. A 99% chance right there that this film would be an enjoyable even if you had never seen any trailers for it, and it was, just like the other films the two had worked together on before, from Man On Fire to Crimson Tide. It was one of those combinations that just seemed to work every time.Unlike the previous films, however, this time Science Fiction is brought into the equation with the topics of parallel universes and time travel being major parts of the story. Right there should tell you that it's a film that needs to be paid attention to, and if you don't you'll be lost as soon as the story starts to kick in with the whole time travel aspect.Now, I've seen movies that deal with the time travel theory and they can be very hit and miss because some of them try to be too clever for their own good. They become over-complicated and you end up just losing interest. Others, though, are enjoyable and while they do get complicated, they don't over-do it.Déj? Vu is one I'd include in the latter category.The overall story is an enjoyable one, and even though there are some slower moments scattered throughout the film, at no point in time does it ever get boring. On the flip side, parts of the story move at a much faster rate, especially when the time travel aspect is being explained. Either way it always keeps you interested right from the start. It's also a pretty clever story and there are a few subtle instances that gets you thinking about various issues that arise from within the film.Like I said earlier, it's clever but it's not overdone.The cast is excellent with Washington leading the way as ATF Agent Doug Carlin and Jim Caviezel playing his opposite as "the bad guy" Carroll Oerstadt. Very believable performances and they, along with the rest of the cast, help bring enjoyment to a very exciting Action/Sci-Fi Thriller.This is definitely a film to watch.</fullReview>

Near perfect hi-concept film. Involves sci-fi, time travel, detective work, etc. But when push comes to shove it is about connection and saving the person you love.2. Technically flawless. Well written. Great acting. And with Denzel holding the camera scene to scene even if there were some flaws, you would not notice them anyway 3. I will be honest. The picky reviews bother me because the purpose of the IMDb is to create a record for viewers of the futures, not a whine fest for reviewers of the present. I am a film buff (see my other reviews) and I tried to make a list simply of other films in this category, yet alone films that are this good. Maybe a dozen tops in the last 100 years. Which means that films like this are rare and when a good one comes along you treasure it, not belittle it.Highly recommended. Hi emotional impact. A feel-good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can Denzel save a girl who has already been killed?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the opening scenes a massive explosion kills hundreds of ferry passengers, including numerous US Navy personnel, in New Orleans. One of the investigators is our protagonist; ATF Agent Doug Carlin; he quickly establishes that the explosion was no accident. As he goes through the evidence he hears of the discovery of a burnt body on the shoreline; it sounds as though she died in the blast but she was found too soon? somebody who knew about the impending explosion clearly wanted it to look as if she was just another victim.Things now take a turn for the science-fictional when Carlin taken to a facility where he sees what appears to be footage of the scene days before the explosion? it turns out there is a government programme that allows the viewer to observe the past? to be precise 4 days, 6 hours, 3 minutes, 45 seconds, 14.5 nanoseconds in the past? no more no less. They are looking over the ferry but it is impossible to pick out anybody who might be planning to blow it up; Carlin suggests that instead they concentrate on solving the girl's murder; if they can solve that they will also solve the bombing. As he watches the past unfold he realises the doomed girl, Claire Kuchever, is somehow aware that she is being observed. Now he doesn't just want to solve Claire's murder he wants to save her! This film gets off to a great start with a spectacular explosion and continues nicely as a conventional mystery for the first half hour; so much so that when the sci-fi elements are introduced I was a bit disappointed even though I knew they'd be coming. Once the details of seeing into the past were dealt with things get more interesting again with plenty of good action, as one would expect from director Tony Scott; the most fun being when Carlin dons a special helmet and chases the villain who is four days in the past in an attempt to find where he might be in the present. The story is a bit convoluted and the rules of time travel seem designed to make the story more exciting than anything else? still if you don't think about it too much it is a lot of fun. Denzel Washington does a fine job as Agent Carlin and Paula Patton is likable as the apparently doomed Claire. Jim Caviezel was good as the terrorist; it made a nice change that the bad guy wasn't part of some conspiracy. Overall a solid enough film with some great action but not really a must see film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Because Deja Vu is my favorite movie of all time, I figured it was only right for me to submit my own review for it.If you have never seen this movie, I think it is very important that you know as little about the plot as possible going in. That's how it was for me, and I must say, the twists will really shock the daylights out of you this way. I actually think it does this movie a GREAT injustice giving away certain information regarding the story the way it does basically everywhere I've read about it. Like imagine seeing A Beautiful Mind for the first time knowing the guy is a schizophrenic? Obviously the suspense wouldn't be the same.Deja Vu is the same way. All you need to know is that it's an action thriller starring one of the best actors of all time, Denzel Washington. If you are fortunate enough to only know this seeing Deja Vu for the first time, it will change your rating from a 7 or 8 to a definite 10, I promise you!That being said, even if you take away the initial suspense, this movie is so perfectly crafted that you will definitely want to own it so you can watch it over and over again. This is the most flawless action/sci-fi/psychological thriller of all time. I watch it 2-3 times every year, and simply cannot get enough of it. It's just one of those rare gems. I love this movie!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What If You Could Solve A Crime BEFORE It Happens?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually, police officers are only able to REACT to crimes and then investigation. However, what if one officer was given the opportunity to stop a crime BEFORE it could occur? That is the basic premise behind "Deja Vu".For a basic plot summary, this movie begins with the tragic bombing of a ferry in New Orleans. When Agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) is called in to investigate, he discovers that the bombing is somehow connected to Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton). Via a team of secret scientists, Carlin is able to view a live video stream of the past in order to help him piece together the mystery of Ms. Kuchever.At its core, "Deja Vu" is a very interesting (and fresh) take on time travel. More specifically, the ability to create a "window to the past". It is an intriguing concept from beginning to end, and one has to give much credit to director Tony Scott, who manages to seamlessly weave all the intricate pieces together (no easy task when dealing with relative physics!).Yet, thanks to a tight story and some incredible acting from Washington and Patton, this is also a very emotional and dramatic film. One cannot help but be sucked into the odd relationship between the two and wonder "what would I do in a similar situation?".Thus, I consider "Deja Vu" to be one of the most well-rounded films a person could ever hope to find. It has action, adventure, drama, science fiction, and even that smug Denzel Washington humor that always plays so well. Unless you have very little imagination, this film will interest you on at least some level.</fullReview>

I had no clue there was a metaphysical aspect like I said I was recommended on a site that this was a film about twin flames. This is now one of my favorite movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Déj? Vu is an action thriller film with elements of crime and science fiction.It stars Denzel Washington together with Val Kilmer, Bruce Greenwood, Matt Craven, Jim Caviezel, Adam Goldberg, and Paula Patton. The screenplay involves ATF agent Douglas Carlin, who travels back in time in attempts to prevent a domestic terrorist attack that takes place in New Orleans and to save Claire Kuchever, with whom he falls in love.It was written by Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio.And,it was directed by Tony Scott.New Orleans-based maverick ATF agent named Doug Carlin is brought in on a top-secret government program to catch the terrorist that is responsible for a ferry bombing that kills hundreds. Able to do what most law enforcement officers only dream of, Carlin is now able to look back in time at the perpetrator's movements, and at the life of the innocent woman whose death would set the events into motion. Carlin's instincts tell him that something is amiss, however, and while the government agent who tapped him for the job and the team of ultra-cool scientists who run the project tell him one story about the quantum physics behind this marvel of technology, the hotshot agent suspects that there is a greater power at their fingertips wherein one that might not just solve the crime at hand, but prevent it. This is a a gimmick picture, pure and simple. It tries hard to graft an emotional story of lost chances onto the gimmick, but ultimately the gimmick wins out as Tony Scott tries to combine action, science fiction, romance, and explosions into one movie, but the time travel conceit might be too preposterous and the action falls apart under scrutiny.But nevertheless,the ride of the first two-thirds is well worth the journey.So enjoy the ride while you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Time Travel Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are fascinated by the possibility of time travel like I am, you should definitely see this movie.It is mind bending, but plausible. Makes you wonder just how much of the government technology used in the movie is based on reality and how much is science fiction. I have seen it twice. I may even see it a third time. I rarely feel that strongly about a movie. I overheard a man walking out of the movie saying. "I am really confused." This is a thought provoking movie that woke me in the night thinking about it. Parallel universes, time lines, is it possible to undo horrible atrocities that have been committed - to change the past? Amazing mind candy! What the Bleep do we know anyway? Very little, as quantum physics is showing us. It may not a movie for people who are happy living on the surface of reality, people who aren't interested in questioning it. Oh, and it is a love movie also. The acting is superb. Denzel Washington and Paula Patton, and all the others, play their roles to perfection. There is a twist at the end, but it's ALL GOOD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good start but non-sensical...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 5/28/2009 ? 5 out of 10 (Dir- Tony Scott): Good start but non-sensical ending destroys what could have been a good detective story. The movie is basically about a terrorist setting off a bomb on a New Orleans ferry and a detective from the ATF, played by Denzel Washington, trying to figure out who did it and why. Once he's added to a secret team to work on the issue, he's introduced to a machine that looks back four days in time and is able to do surveillance, somehow. But we find out later that the machine isn't just capable of surveillance but is also a time machine. It's not been used much for real interacting with the past(they've only sent small object back) but they try it with a piece of paper that will hint the past cops as to what's happening ? it doesn't quite work but gives Denzel's character the idea to try more. He gets attracted to a victim and after the case is solved he decides he wants to send himself back to save her and possibly stop the event from ever occurring. This is where the story gets goofy as the machine has never been tested with humans and it makes no sense that they would allow him to do this. The rest of the movie is ridiculous as most movies that explore time travel are and destroyed what could have been a good movie. Of course, the gimmick had to be used for this purpose to appease our action-oriented, gimmick-driven, good guy gets the girl American movie audience but this is what makes it fall apart. Too bad because it definitely was compelling in the first half.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm about to ruin this movie for you, but only to tell you how absolutely horrible it turned out to be. If you're a lover of sci-fi, you'll be massively disappointed by all the bullshit science. If you're not a lover of sci-fi, you'll be disgusted by how little sense the conclusion makes.When I first started watching this movie, I loved it for about the first 20 minutes. I loved the main character, I loved the plot. Then, Denzel is approached by a man who invites him to join a "task force". The moment those words were spoken, I turned to my father (who was watching the movie with me) and said, "They'd better not go sci-fi on this movie." Sure enough, they went sci-fi. Suddenly, the government has satellite technology that isn't even conceptually possible. After watching that for a few minutes, I turn to my dad and say, "Five bucks says it's actually a time machine." Sure enough, Denzel pulls out a laser pointer and shines it at a computer monitor, only to reveal that the government actually has time travel technology (yes, he shined a laser pointer into the past...using a computer monitor).So the story progresses from there. The science is relatively sound: branching universe theory, blah blah blah, but then we start to realize that the things Denzel is seeing are actually things that *he's* done. Sure enough, Denzel TRAVELS INTO THE PAST and saves the girl and prevents a terrorist plot from taking place.But here's where the plot simply falls through and the stars fell off for me: Denzel has left himself all sorts of signs and clues after traveling back in time and then proceeds to prevent the terrorist plot. In the "original" present moment, the clues that Denzel leaves himself are still there (so he *had* to have been there), but the terrorist plot still unfolds.You can't have it both ways, here: either he travels back in time and changes the present, or he travels back in time into an alternate reality. There is no valid explanationAll in all, for how good the plot was starting to turn out to be, I was expecting a much better movie. The two stars I gave this are for the first fifteen minutes or so.</fullReview>

I loved the film as much as it is far from reality ( at least for now ) ..... and to revert the death of that girl and all other people from that disaster is euphoric , even more than that is - denzel Washington again coming to enquire the girl at the closing scene is simply exhilarating ...Denzel Washington, what an actor he is ! my oh my , till now just heard of him, but to see him get into the skin of the character is an absolute feast :bow: 9 on 10 for me .... i recommend it to all those who like science fiction (sci-fi) genre of films , if u haven't seen yet ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denzel's Doppelganger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An interesting premise - a special task-force is equipped with a cutting edge technology enabling users to look into the past. They do not bother to go further in providing elaborate explanations of how exactly this stuff works but we got to understand that the remote sensing technologies they use have certain limitations providing insight into only particular time span (4 days backward), which cannot be fine tuned. It looked like they somehow miraculously have been deriving satellite "ghost" imagery which is 4 days old.Initially I was thinking it might be due to some abysmal hard disk storage, which is capable of saving myriads of data from RS satellites in near real-time and these file archives could be accessed to furnish information on any area of surveillance which is only 4 days old and they can manipulate and interpret information shot from different angles of observation that could be rendered into free rotating 3D imagery. And my assumptions have been shattered when I figured out that they can also pierce through the walls.There was a really gripping sequence when Washington is blind chasing the "delayed vision" of terrorist's car racing across the highway.I wish they could stop pushing an envelope beyond those already immense technological capabilities. Sadly they went further experimenting with time travel aspects and have thrown the protagonist to the past, exactly where all the confusion began.I don't want to ruin expectations of the audience that haven't seen the film yet and to disclose further intricacies of the plot. But I wonder what could have happened if Washington eventually managed to find his way to the surface out from the submerged car.Guess whom he was supposed to meet at the berth beside the salvaged girl?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie being pretty aware of the fact that the movie would be a typical Hollywood action movie and was not expecting much more from it. I had seen the trailers and it looked very much of what I had intended the movie to be.The story is about a cop trying to stop a (patriotic) terrorist who wants to blow a US navy ferry with a stolen vehicle full of bombs. The movie starts with the ferry being blown off by the terrorist ? so where is the story line gone? But wait ? the frames unfold to a new dimension where our hero can travel back by 4 days into time and stop the terrorist to blow up the ferry, and in turn save our heroine and lots of dead people. Is this all possible in real life? NO would be the answer ? but scientific movies like ET, Star Wars etc. are big hits on the fantasy of 'What if?'? The movie is sleek. Denzel Washington is stylish ?sometimes overly with his facial expressions; and Val Kilmer ? has evidently put on lots of weight from his usual self, but is good in his small role.The movie is able to maintain your interest till the last frame. There are good action scenes ? especially the car chase of terrorist through time difference ? where with one eye Denzel is able to see the present day and the other eye he is able to see the same road 4 days back ? this chase is thrilling.Especially at the end of the movie, the way Denzel is shown traveling from one place to another within the city ? seems that the city is very small ? which is not the case of New Orleans as a city. It is big!! Director should have taken more care of this fact.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a terrorist blows up a ferry full of people an ATF agent is called to the scene. When a female corpse washes ashore she proves to be a piece of the puzzle - but dead women tell no tales. Or do they? Deja Vu plays with the idea that a deja vu isn't an erroneous action of the mind, but something real. With the invention of a device that allows the investigating team to see the actual past as it is happening it opens a premise for a story that might be fun enough for a film.And granted, it is. Watched as a mindless action flick this film isn't half bad - the plot is believable enough to pack the elements that keep the story rolling and the play-out is good enough to make it more than just acceptable. For me the one thing that demolished bit of the film though is something that happened at the very end of it - it just didn't belong in there or was just plain wrong (in combination with the events that lead to that moment).Still.. Acceptable material. Nothing to remember more than a few days after seeing it, but good enough to visit the cinema.6 out of 10 memories from the future</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting Thriller !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deja Vu is the more than intriguing title that was chosen for Denzel Washington's long anticipated new film. A Deja Vu is a strange phenomenon that modern-day science is yet to sufficiently explain. The simplified definition is "The sensation you are doing something you have done before.". You're no wiser now than you were a minute ago when you started reading are you?... I didn't think so :-). If you're hoping to learn more about the story itself I suggest you stop reading this comment immediately because the above is all I'm going to tell you about the story as it is a heavenly delight to watch this film ice cold( the regular IMDb user will know what I mean). Just lay back and you will be blown away by the story.Deja Vu is a fast-paced action thriller that has all the elements to keep you glued to your seat throughout the movie. An a-typical Denzel Washington movie but then again is there such a thing as a typical Denzel Washington movie?! He's played civil war soldiers, police officers, boxers, basket ball players and he manages to make it work every time. This is an intelligent action film( yes, there is such a thing) and will leave some thinking even after the credits have rolled. I know that was the case for yours truly. Don't miss out on this one, see it now because you never know what will happen tomorrow. Denzel Washington is great as always, he doesn't have as much to work with character-wise as in Training Day or The Hurricane but he still makes it work and makes the character 100% believable as he always manages to do. Jim Caviezel is unbelievable in his role. I've seen him in some roles before where I judged him to be average, but this was the firs time I was very impressed by him. ( I must admit I haven't seen him as Christ). The other actors are a bit overshadowed by those 2 amazing actors and deliver just OK performances. Tony Scott does an amazing job directing the film. He applies a very modern style in the camera shots ( frequent use of close-ups and fast paced switching of camera viewpoints), allowing the public to feel the excitement of the scenes. He is very careful not to overdo it, the slower and more intense scenes are given the chance to develop (without too much switching between camera viewpoints) and have the intended effect on the viewer. An example of a film that overdid the fast switching of shots is Smokin' Aces, which made the film very chaotic and sloppy. The pacing of the story itself is masterfully done.Deja Vu is one of 06's best. I haven't been so impressed by a film since I saw The Prestige some time ago. Both these films show that modern films with daring scenarios do have the potential to become classics and that the general film quality is going up despite what some cynics may say.See it yesterday rather than today...?!! :-D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Going Back to Look Forward</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DÉJ? VU is a riveting film about time travel in tandem with crime investigation that works on every level. Tony Scott is back in his element as the top director of intrigue/thrillers. Working with a challenging script by Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio that asks the viewer to accept the possibility of time travel, Scott is able to make the story work clearly despite the interplay of mixing the viewing of the past form the vantage of the present with placing a character into that past to alter it.The setting is New Orleans, still suffering from the devastation of Katrina, where a ferryboat explodes killing hundreds of people. ATF (Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms) agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) is brought into the investigation of the 'accident' when he discovers elements that suggest the explosion was the act of a terrorist. Agent Pryzwarra (a very fat Val Kilmer) and his team of secretive experts (Adam Goldberg, Elden Henson, Erika Alexander and Bruce Greenwood) introduce Doug to a highly sophisticated machine that coordinates cameras and heat detectors from satellites and security cameras that is able to mix images and reveal the past - a tricky means of examining a crime scene ex post facto to capture the perpetrators. Spurred on with Doug's discovery of a beautiful female body (Paula Patton) washed up from the water before the explosion, Doug examines all the evidence, observing the replay of the days leading up to the explosion, and finally asks to be placed in a time machine to return to the scene in hopes of altering the inevitable and unmasking the terrorist (Jim Caviezel). How this occurs forms the climax of the film, and while many viewers may have trouble swallowing the time travel aspect, the action is so tight and the technique of creating the incident so convincing that few viewers will fail to be wholly involved.The cast is excellent, beginning with Denzel Washington as a terrific lead to the work of Jim Caviezel and all the more minor roles in between. The musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams and the cinematography by DP Paul Cameron heighten the tension of this exciting suspense movie. Grady Harp</fullReview>

If done right the movie and its story could get a 5 out of 10, but since nothing is really new about the movie and because of the cheap acting, especially the girl its not worth more than a boring Monday evening.

		<fullReview>I don't know why I watched this (oh yeah I do, I was in the middle of the Aegean sea with nothing to do) because Tony Scott is one of my least favorite filmmakers. When people talk about "the crap coming out of Hollywood" they are talking about Scott. He blows stuff up, has sexy camera angles of "hot" people, and rehashes a predicable plot we have all seen before. My brother was quoting the film moments ahead of the dialogue, that's how banal and conventional it is. One of worst aspects of Scotts work is his overuse of editing. He edits/manipulates so much it kills the chance for the viewer to think about what is going on. He just shoves it down your throat. Tony Scott makes movies for people that don't want to think for themselves. Denzel Washington reprises the same role he has played his whole career, a conflicted detective. It is the same old stupid posturing and tough guy nonsense. The film is about some young and terribly miscast detective/scientists that use a wormhole in space/time to solve crimes. In this case the crime is a terrorist blowing up a ferry full of sailors and children. But Denzel gets involved and demands to be transported back in time to save this one hot girl that has nothing to do with the actual story. "Deja Vu" is a fitting title, its the same movie over and over again. Absolute crap.</fullReview>

The first: you can smuggle a sci-fi plot onto the big screen if you put enough A-list actors and big money behind it and use the leftover music from Bad Boys 2. The second: You can totally destroy a sci-fi script if you load the production with A-list actors in a vain effort to pass it off as a mainstream film. Thirdly and most importantly, if you are an aspiring filmmaker or screenwriter, you have hope. This was reported the biggest "spec" script ever picked up by a studio for seven figures and it's not that good, although there are some interesting plot elements. One can only hope that merely decent writing can do even better. This film has so many needless visual elements and effects it's comical. If I didn't know any better, this film was made as a writing lab exercise for film students to learn what NOT to do in film-making. The dialogue is laughable. There are two lines in the film that the entire movie seems to be written around. Once again, as destiny prevails, a sci-fi film will never win an Oscar.</fullReview>

Anybody with a shred of intelligence, and a natural inclination to make sense of things, will find themselves crying for a resolution to this plot until the very end. The movie begins as a generic cop film, with Denzel Washington playing the archetypal genius officer who is under-appreciated for his perceptive talents. It ends with an insulting, pathetic attempt to add a science-fiction twist to this cop formula. The plot holes in this film are gaping, the action scenes are cheesy and overdone, and the love story is nauseating. Don't see this travesty.</fullReview>

He is called in to help find the terrorist Carroll Oerstadt(James Caviezel), who blew up a ferry in New Orleans killing hundreds of people. Carlin is approached by Agent Pryzwarra(Val Kilmer)to work in a top-secret government program that will allow him to go back in time to watch the perpetrator's movements leading to the bombing. Thus being able to stop the atrocity. Carlin senses that a beautiful woman, Claire Kuchever(Paula Patton), is the innocent fuse to the terrorist's actions. All she was doing was selling him a car...the car that blows up the ferry. The super sharp Carlin begins to realize that the process he has entered may leave him stranded in the past by three days. Nevertheless, agent Carlin also knows that he has fallen in love with the lovely Claire. As the film ends, don't feel stupid if you are still puzzled. Its just a movie...damn good movie.

Director Tony Scott delivers a sad. conspicuously hackneyed turn, going for a format that values schmaltz over of solid art. Thankfully, Washington carries the ball well and gets to show appreciable depth (it is still amazing that he won his leading man Oscar for a shallow-as-two-inches-of-water fake-job in Training Man when this premiere performer consistently has and still does much better -- think Out Of Time, Man On Fire and Inside Man). This time out, the gifted actor plumbs subtle depths to afford vaguely engaging dimension, supported by Caviesel's superb character-work and newly rising Patton establishing cast-iron chops. As for the script, well, it intrigues, but still needs work. The cast carries the day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Denzel Washington and think he is a very good actor. The last time this director and Washington teamed up they made the gritty and violent thriller, "Man on Fire", but this will definitely appeal to a wider audience. Denzel plays an smart and inventive detective who sees things differently from most people. When a terrorist attack is made on a ferry holding over 500 people he is called in to investigate, he is soon recruited to a new investigation team using "cutting edge" technology, but he soon realizes things are not as they seem.Paula Patton, a relatively unknown actress was so convincing as the victim in this story made you care for her. The plot overall wasn't the most amazing thing, but the acting and characters are what make this so intensely personal. Val Kilmer also appears in this film, but in a very small role. Another actor though who made the movie feel so intense is Jim Caviezal as the insane and insanely "patriotic" terrorist who will let nothing in his way of making his statement to the world.This movie proves that Jerry Bruckheimer can still pick good movies to produce and even if this film wasn't exactly a blockbuster is was an interesting, intense, and smart thriller that has high flying surprises and top notch acting that will make your jaw drop.

Of course the scale of the start disaster is much bigger;but no thanks to the weak directing;the 9/11ish event and all those lovely dead people doesn't really get to us.when you go through the first 25 minutes;which is really ordinary; you see what the movie is all about.(spoilers from here)the government has a device that lets them see past;see exactly 4 days somewhat hours ago and they use this new technology to see anything in the past,of course with limitations.from this point;one of the greatest chases of the movie history begins and lasts for the first half of the movie.it's really brilliant,and it remains that way.when they learn that they can interact with the past; the movie takes you to the edge of the scene;and you feel like you are about to see a conclusion that you've never seen before.but instead,it takes a grim twist and for the last quarter of the movie;it becomes a mindless "cop who went back in time to save the girl" thing.i am really really curious how someone could have come up with such an unique idea like the "snow white" but be stupid enough to turn it into a stupid time machine- hey look the pieces are coming together-kind of action.i'm so sorry for this movie.the second half should be rewritten to take it into classics.but this way;it's just a "worth watching but nothing special" movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the time travel scenario, this could have been so much more. The writers could have introduced overlapping scenarios that could have created a paradox. They could have written this so the "bad guy" scenario was more complex. Unfortunately, they dumbed this down to avoid confusing the average idiot.There were moments where this film could have gotten more interesting and just fell flat."Out of Time" was a far better thriller. This was like "Out of Time" with less energy and more fancy cinematography. Rent this one. Buy Denzel's previous thriller "Out of Time" instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever manipulation makes a generic scenario seem fresh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A serviceable action thriller, given your typical Tony Scott quick cuts and typical Denzel Washington protagonist, still manages to rise slightly over it's tired mechanics with the inclusion of a well integrated science fiction element. For the first half hour of Deja Vu, viewers may be shaking their heads in disappointment, fearing that they are watching the same old mainstream cop mystery they have seen a thousand times over. Scott's typical direction does not help freshen things up either. What was once entirely stylish, edgy film-making has become completely predictable with grainy coloring, frenzied editing, and generic scoring somehow making the film feel dated more then it has any right. Viewers are taken through a typical detective procedure, as Washington's tired ATF agent tries desperately to gather clues from a massive explosion that rocked a newly opened New Orleans port. Certainly not a chore, the setup here remains completely average with hardly an effort made to differentiate this film from the many others like it, some starred in and directed by this team themselves.Thankfully, once the routine plot mechanics are set into play, Deja Vu finally offers up what will separate this popcorn movie from countless imitations. Borrowing from what made guilty pleasures like Strange Days such voyeuristic fun, the neat concept this script introduces, regarding what seems like the ultimate in surveillance security, will help take the generic thriller to fairly unique sequences. Toying with concepts of time travel while centering around this cat-and-mouse game helps Scott get some extra mileage out of the vehicle, and finally gives him a reason to implement all of the hyperactive edits he relishes in so much. Rather then barraging viewers with an onslaught of creative direction (which has been shown to prove contradictory and excessive with previous releases), Scott wisely finds a proper venue to work his magic. It is in these dazzling sequences of omniscient direction, when Washington is monitoring potential subjects with the precision of an infinitely floating camera eye, that any unique perspective and technical accomplishment shines through the otherwise predictable work.Suffering from a typically bland lead performance from the uninspired Washington, a confusingly underwritten antagonist played by Jim Caviezel, and a denigrating plot twist that makes the far-fetched reality behind this seem even sillier, Deja Vu is still a trip worth taking once (though no need to repeat!) for the brief stride hit in the middle which elevates the stereotypical proceedings with a fresh sheen of techno-paint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate to say this but there is nothing special with this picture. Deja Vu has nothing new.this is all about a time machine and story about changing the past.Which you have seen so many times before (and in some cases better movies). you see denzel Washington is great like always.But nothing new. Camera Changes its point of view many times within few seconds like any other Tony Scott's movies. only thing that saved this movie is the scene which Denzel Washington is driving the car with in pursuing the past with the Rig. Yes i admit that that was perfect. Beside that the little love story which is lying under the movies skin is not that bad but unsatisfying. All characters are rerun and they looks more like Types. music is so-so and Special effects are as good as any large Budget movies. what is great in this movie is its cutting and editing. there are some new ideas and some twists in the plot. But if you'd seen some movies in this Genre with similar stories , they all could be Preguessed. its not a bad movie but if you are looking for action-Thriller with a rich story or sci-fi theme i suggest you watch minority report or Man on fire again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Doesn't anybody understand the attempted complexity of this movie, the sub plot, which is the real story? It is not boy saves girl through arguably crazy science, with the rather contrived twist of going back into time! The HERO of the film is exactly that, the guy with the tat on his neck that says 'hero' and 'courage', Carroll Oerstadt...hello! Why do you think when he is being interrogated by Denzel's character he says 'I know things you don't know' and 'this will NEVER go to trial'? Why do you think that Val Kilmer's character knows Denzel will be back and has no issue with him jumping into the time machine to save the girl? This is a set up by the government from the start, including the bombing of the ferry and the induction of Denzel as a pawn in the game. That was not the FBI Denzel was working with, it was a special ops division of the government (CIA, NSA, etc.). And Carroll works for the MAN too, the government or the military. He already knows that he is a pawn and will ultimately be laying down his own life for this test. A test that will allow his government to change the course of history by altering the past and preventing terror in the future. He already knows that in the end he 'really' will not have killed hundreds of his military brothers ala the opening scene; that the course of history WILL be altered. Yes, he had to kill two or three people, but it is 'in the line of duty' if you will. It is ultimately Carroll who will die for this mission and he knows it in advance. He is the nameless hero.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tony Scott and Denzel Washington's long-awaited third collaboration (and the much-anticipated follow-up to the brilliant 'Man on Fire') is not precisely the adrenaline-charged, unapologetically-intense thriller that many were expecting, but it is, nonetheless, a very interesting film, and, above all, is a load of fun.Denzel Washington plays Doug Carlin, a dedicated ATF agent who must investigate the horrific terrorist bombing of a New Orleans naval ship, a disaster that cost over 500 lives, including that of his partner. A sympathetic FBI agent, Andrew Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer), recruits Carlin into his special task force, a team which scans the images produced by a futuristic surveillance device, capable of observing anything within a wide radius four days and six hours into the past.Carlin decides that the most effective course of action would be to survey a woman named Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton), whose murdered body was dumped in the water two hours before the actual explosion, meaning that her assailant knew of the impending disaster and intended on passing her off as just another unfortunate victim. However, throughout her surveillance, Carlin receives the disturbing impression that Claire can sense that she is being watched, despite her life playing by four days and six hours in the past.This is an exciting film, and I found myself constantly wondering what was going to happen next. The early events of the film lead inevitably towards a story of time travel, so it's no surprise when, taken off the case, Carlin decides that he's going to go back in time, not only to prevent the terrorist attack, but also to save Claire's life. And, of course, watch out for the most innovative and highly-original car chase since 'The Matrix Reloaded,' as Carlin cunningly pursues a vehicle that is exactly four days and six hours in front of him! As with many Hollywood time travel films, the filmmakers have been forced to substitute the logical ending with a more optimistic one, and the "happy conclusion" seemed like something of a cop-out, especially since the film had tried so hard up until that point to match together the minutest of details. Nevertheless, this is a fun action film with an enjoyable twist of science-fiction, and you shouldn't go home disappointed.</fullReview>

Even if you are willing to accept the whole time-hole nonsense and overlook the obvious mistakes, the choices the characters make are ludicrous and unbelievable. How can this movie score 7 out of 10? Or do the viewers just don't care anymore about a story, just as long as there's enough car chases and things blowing up?They are able to transfer a note. Why not transfer a second note? Why doesn't he call the police ones he is back in time? How did they manage to time-travel him into a hospital? Why doesn't he mind causing car-accidents every time he steps into a car... And there's a question like that every 5 minutes.The acting is fine, but this movie is not for people that like logic.</fullReview>

Some of the better actors in the business today are all "old farts". Jim Caviezel fans will enjoy his dark role in this movie.I don't want to give the movie away, but the time travel plot works for this script. As one reviewer noted, time travel, as a movie plot has its problems. The complications of that travel are well written and well worth seeing. This is really a movie that you need to watch 100%, if you are distracted with other things during the viewing process, you will be disappointed.If you like Denzel Washington and if you like Val Kilmer, you will enjoy this movie. Time travel fans will love the plot and all the turns it takes. Remember "Back to the Future"?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A man attempts to prevent a terrorist attack and save a woman with whom he has falling in love with.Satisfying science fiction that handles time travel more subtle than most. Tony Scott's Déj? Vu is a very rounded well constructed piece of entertainment. Although the closing ties things up a little too nicely in terms of Doug Carlin's 'duplicate' it still manages to inject some ambiguity into the end.Déj? Vu has plenty of heart and is more thriller than scifi, it's not too gadget/techie driven and Scott's realistic style of filming and the New Orleans setting draws you in from the off, it's quite compulsive viewing right up to the conclusion. With a great supporting cast actor Denzel Washington is on his usual fine form, Paula Patton is convincing and Val Kilmer gives a great performance (even with his limited screen time).Scott slightly drops the ball with the chase scene and a few plot points don't appear air tight. Even though much of the time travel dialogue may have your eyes rolling the acting is great. Would could have been a B-film yarn is pleasingly given a A-list makeover thanks to Tony Scott's visual prowess.Solid time travel entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best movies with Denzel Washington, in my opinion. A terrorist blows up a ferry with a lot of sailors and family on liberty. After reporting about several leads an ATF agent is invited to join a special investigation team. It soon becomes clear that this is about time travel. The story is set in the aftermath of Katrina, which is clearly visible throughout the movie. In fact in the credits the makers have dedicated this movie to the rescuers, helpers and victims of Katrina. Although the story is physically impossible, it is totally believable. Mostly because of the good acting and depth of the characters. Normally I have four or five breaks for coffee or a smoke or I skip parts of the movie, but this one had me glued to the screen. It will most certainly be on my personal top 10. So enjoy.P.S. How about the terrorist's motives? In the end he says: It was not supposed to happen like this. Like what?</fullReview>

It's is a nice movie , and interesting in my mind as it had me thinking the whole time ...what if...what if...This film is unique in providing a SCI-FI envelope to what may seem to be a Non SCI-FI movie.The most mind bending scene would be the one where Denzel drives the Hammer through traffic coming his whilst monitoring the perpetrator ,Jim Caviezel,with one eye through the "time machine" seeing events that occurring in real time 4 days and 6 hours ago, and with his other eye looking at the traffic in real time .Fantastic scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deja vu is set in the present times; a crime investigation is on progress, here science allows the investigation team to view past exactly 4 days, 6 hours, 3 minutes, 45 seconds back. At first this is mentioned as a camera recording with the help satellite to the agent Doug Carlin and the above delay is due to the time lost during processing by the satellite. Later Doug point a laser beam on the video and find the subject Claire Kuchever to respond to it, in video footage claimed to be taken from satellites and thus truth is brought to him. Now Doug is aware of that past he is observing may be changed and the events may take a different path but the scientist tell him they are not able to send any thing or person in past to make the change. But Doug insist on sending himself to the past risking his life so as to save Claire and the around 500 peoples from the explosion. Movie never get out of track and I like the most is the realistic touch give to the technology, everything is seem to be believable were none of the freaky gadgets are given more attention than the story itself and this is what expected from the director of Spy Game and Enemy of the State, Tony Scott.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deja Vu is a good movie with a mind-bending twist, good action scenes, and a plot that is hardly understandable unless you have the scientific mind like me. This film also boasts a good director-actor pairup in Tony Scott and Denzel Washington. This movie can be confusing at times because it is one that will make you think and the plot has many scientific terms especially regarding time travel.Tony Scott's film is about a ATF officer who is taken off a site of a ferry explosion to an area where he is told about some new machine that can take people back in the past to see if they can find any information about the crime.This is the second pairup between Tony and Denzel with the first being the 2004's Man on Fire, which is better than this film. However, Denzel still has what it takes to be a lead actor and his personality takes this movie out of mediocrity. This film also supports a well-rounded supporting cast with the likes of Val Kilmer, Bruce Greenwood, and Paula Patton.Overall, this is a energetic, fast-paced, and skillful movie. It features some very good editing and cinematography which is always present in a Tony Scott movie. Despite that, I felt Tony could have done better with this film. It's not a classic by any stretch but I wanted more of a story to be told. But, I admit I loved the style of the movie. I may be generous, but I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deja Vu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Time travel is a consistently popular plot device, a Hollywood convention for its mass appeal; depending on the ambition of the work, it can be as simple or as complicated as is desired or required. 'Deja Vu' achieves a consistent balance, presenting its hard science fiction concepts to viewers in an easily understandable manner. The result is a complex film that doesn't buckle under the weight of a convoluted screenplay, remaining a thorough action blockbuster throughout despite its intended depth.Denzel Washington carries the film to great effect, his convincing performance and clear enthusiasm for the material an influential factor in how the feature doesn't necessarily demand a great amount of suspended disbelief. Granted, there is an abundance of fallacies and ambiguities throughout that could threaten to detract from its credibility, but the film is ultimately as much for a popcorn audience as it is for the intellectual crowd. The cost of heavy scrutiny and flawless coherence would appear to be an extremely entertaining experience, and in the case of 'Deja Vu', it is most certainly a price worth paying.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlooked modern day (minor) classic - but you think you've heard that before.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll make the obligatory joke early: It seems that I've reviewed this before somewhere? Ho. Ho. Ho.The only thing that made audiences shy away was a confusing plot device - that many critics couldn't seem to look past - it is taut, well acted and cracks along for 2 hours, and once you've finished it the first time there is definite merit in watching it again once the pieces all fall into place for you.Denzel isn't a supercop, just a regular cop named Doug from the Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms (ATF) section, which may or way not involve checking kids for fake IDs, I'm not sure.The opening scene gives him reason for involvement by showing the explosion of a big New Orleans Ferry carrying hundreds, perhaps thousands of oblivious passengers, many of them members of the US navy. A car bomb stored in the parking area goes Ka-Boom, and reports put the death toll at 500+.Denzel is called in to check for signs of criminal activity among the debris, and he immediately discovers some suspicious evidence that he passes onto an FBI agent called in to assist, played by Val Kilmer. (I can't remember his character's name, this is Denzel's movie. Move on.) Security footage scrutinized in the following hours and days shows a shady character on the bridge just prior to the explosion, and the situation is labeled an act of terrorism.(It is worth mentioning at this time that many other seemingly minor things go on aside from what is described above, most of them have a pay-off later in the film but seem inconsequential at this point. You need to see the film to understand why.) Among the many bodies in the morgue is that of a young black woman identified as Claire, only her badly burned and charred body showed up before the actual blast, leading Doug to believe that she was killed and left there as a cover up, and that finding her killer might lead to the cause of the ferry explosion.His initial visit to the victim's home causes even more confusion, "U Can Save Her" is written on the fridge with plastic kid's magnets, there are bloody swabs and bandages in the bathroom, and when he checks the answering machine he hears his own voice from a message he left the previous day. He decides to concentrate his investigation on solving the Claire murder, and being the team player he is he passes his theory and information onto the FBI.This is where things get messy, and infinitely more interesting.The FBI conscripts Doug into their team investigating the incident, and in doing so provide him with a lot more access and information. Most notably is the availability of a Whiz Bang satellite system that allows the FBI to view events as they happen from any angle they decide: only the camera actually sees events as they occur 4 days and 6 hours previous to "now", due to a loophole in some scientific thingo.This seems to be a major sticking point with many people as such a thing obviously does not and (probably) will never exist. The genius of having such a fake reason explaining how they trace the events and ultimately the perpetrator, is that the filmmakers can dictate the abilities and limits of the system to justify plot events and further the story at various times, leading to some suspenseful and exciting scenes later on.Seriously, it is a plot device, don't understand it, just accept it and move on, or turn off and miss a really good second half. We can't fly to Mars yet either, but every year a movie comes out saying we can and no-one blinks an eye, should we penalize someone for making a sci-fi film that is set on Earth and not 3,000,000,000 miles above it?The camera system can only view what the operator is telling it to exactly 4 days and 6 hours previously, there is no rewind and recording can only take place of the current view, it can be directed all over the New Orleans area, can see through walls and can pick up audio of the events on screen. Doug's job is to tell it where to look so that they might find the guy who caused the incident and track how he did it up until "Boom goes the dynamite".And they only have three days to go.For some reason Doug comes up with ideas and theories that the FBI guys who invented the system don't think of right off the top of his head, and needless to say they find their man.Doug starts musing on the abilities of the system and starts wondering if it might prove more than an "Information only" device.I can't expand further without confusing myself so I won't. I really enjoyed the first ? of this film and had already jotted the grade down as a very solid 7.5, but the movie comes home strong, and the final 20 minutes earned it another .5 for sheer audacity.Déj? Vu features a solid believable performance from Denzel despite the leaps of logic that are required, but if you can move past these and watch the movie as a movie, and not a thesis about the merits and capabilities of time travel, you will see that all the events that seemed extraneous in the first half now make perfect sense.In one 6 or 7 minute scene the entire film comes together for the viewer and for Doug's character, and I actually got chills when the pieces all fell into place for me.Final Rating ? 8 / 10. Very underrated. Decide for yourself if the events "could really happen", but watch this in any case.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denzel's most driven performance?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen countless Denzel movies. I've seen Training Day, Bone Collector, Fallen, etc. You take his best action flick and pit it against his best dramatic flick. It doesn't matter the genre, Denzel can't make a bad film. It doesn't matter the demand, Denzel's emotion exceeds your expectations.From most of his films, I've seen, Denzel plays some form of a federal agent or police officer. In this film, while Denzel shines with the rays of the sun, Adam Goldberg, Val Kilmer, James Caviezel, and Elden Henson also perform vigorously in supporting cast.I especially enjoy the fact that Denzel can go from antagonist Alonzo Harris (Training Day) to protagonist Detective John Hobbs (Fallen) to protagonist-antagonist John Archibald in John Q to this powerful performance of protagonist Doug Carlin. Then you have James Caviezel who can play a protagonist in Frequency (2000) to this antagonist.It's plot is something to behold, most of all. When it comes to time travel it's one of the top things to discuss about movies. When you finish (and even during in some cases) you can't help but talk about the dilemma of going back and changing something for better or worse.I know that it's fictional, but it's fantasy and I allow for it because at least the screenwriters have tried to connect realism to their storytelling. With the actors showcased, you can't help but be grabbed and dragged into this spellbinding tale about a hero.It's been four years since my first viewing of Deja Vu and yet this second viewing is better. After watching over two hundred films or more between the first and second viewing, I think it's hard to remember every little detail about the great masterpiece of cinema that it is.While it's rating is PG-13, I think that children should avoid this simply because it's disturbing and this is a type of film where you have to think while watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet another pairing of Washington and Scott, this time they are tackling time travel. As it is with every time travel film there are plot holes, but it's always neat to see how the writers tackle such a heated topic and Deja Vu tries to attach an action thriller into the mix.Tony Scott has a certain style to him now, anyone whose seen Man On Fire or Domino knows this, here it isn't as blatant, but it's till there. I enjoy his films, they never try to inspire or be more then what it sets out to do.There are some interesting scenes here, like trying to drive in the present while using a device to see the past and follow the killer. Did you understand that? The supporting cast, including my man Kilmer, basically sit around and 'teach' Washington about time travel. Washington is the only one who really gets to have fun and do stuff.As a time travel film, it's okay, as an action thriller, it's alright. The film never truly steps outside of that mediocre box, considering it has so many things going for it, one might expect a bit more from those involved. The characters are somewhat likable, and....creepy? Watching her shower in the past...yup.This is not a film to rush out and see, unless your a big time fan of Washington or Scott. Instead give it a watch when you click past it on TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great story, badly told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the low rating I gave this movie, Deja Vu remains one of my favorite movies of all time, but purely because of the story line. It is a story about time-travel, about crime, about fate and human compassion. It is interesting and engaging, and I think that's why I like this movie, and why so many others like it. The cinematography is great too. However, the script and acting are absolutely shocking. It doesn't feel at all like we're watching a movie. It feels like we're listening in on a bunch of people making small talk for two hours. The characters repeat themselves, give small and irrelevant orders and make lame jokes. These are things that could be acceptable in our normal lives, but in a movie it just makes it look like the writer got lazy. I'm sure the intention of this is to make the characters seem more real, but in the end they just seem fake and awkward.The only character in the movie that has any substance is claire, and she spends 50% of the movie in a morgue. She comes across as a sweet girl with a headstrong personality, which is just enough for us to love her. Denzel Washington does not play a multi-dimensional character. He plays a character that is two-faced and confusing. We see few aspects of his personality. One of them being his compassion for claire, the other his skepticism and anger at his team when they "refuse" to tell him information about the machine. Might I add, his anger in that scene seems totally uncalled for. It seems like his team try their absolute best to answer his questions, and yet he blows a fuse at them for "not telling him anything". Either this was used to create drama, but ended up creating confused stares in the audience, or its just plain bad acting. For the rest of the time, denzel is sleepwalking, as are the rest of the characters. We are not watching people. We are watching dummies that can display a stereotypical range of emotions, and say whatever they're supposed to say to fulfill their role but absolutely nothing more.The problems with the plot are massive and hard to ignore. The surveillance system has an apoplexy when a small piece of paper is sent into the past, yet when a living, breathing human body is sent there seems to be minimal damage. Also, it seems like Doug took the hard way out of solving the case on purpose, or he's just really dumb. He insisted that a warning note be sent to him on his desk, and yet he seems to know that there is no point because he is about to leave his desk, putting his friend in danger. When he goes back in time, he could easily inform the police or the ATF that the bombing is about to occur, but instead he insists on being the hero himself. Of course, if he had taken the easy way out, there would be no story. But maybe if there were no story we wouldn't have to sit through this movie for so long.I gave this 4 stars because I liked the premise and the visual aspect, but everything else is a failure. Maybe in a few years there'll be a remake, and my rating will be higher for that. I would recommend that you see this movie if you're interested in crime and time-travel, but don't see it again, you'll kick yourself for ever liking this movie the first time round.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moving, Visually Fine and Well-Acted Sci-Fi Love Story and Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a thoughtful adventure that I found to be part sci-fi, part thriller, part love story and an unusually riveting filmgoing experience. Unsurprisingly, it has few well-developed characters; but uncharacteristically for the genre, almost all the piece's characters, however brief their appearance may be, become memorable. There is a special effects disaster in the film, a rousing car chase and many other interesting technical achievements; but I suggest that in this unusual achievement, these adult devices help to move the story along rather than detracting from it as is more usual. "Deja Vu" I find to be unusual in its structure also. Boy Loses Girl, Boy Pursues Girl is not the typical scenario for many films--least of all for a sci-fi narrative; but that's what one encounters here. The fun in the film is I suggest mostly provided by just how the boy loses the girl and exactly how he pursues her to the end of this one. Tony Scott directed this action masterwork for producer Jerry Bruckheimer, from a script by Bill Marsilli and co-producer Terry Rossio. Production Designer Chris Seagers makes use of understated but consistent lighting of and New Orleans streets and backgrounds just enough to give the real flavor of the Crescent City, which I have visited and experienced more than once. Paul Cameron's cinematography, the controlled art direction supplied by Drew Boughton, and the award level and very complex set decoration by Rosemary Brandenburg all in my opinion add greatly to the film's unusual believability. The makeup task was enormous in this movie; and the costumes well-handled; but these elements mostly provide a background to the main storyline's progress. Among the exceedingly large cast, standouts include Val Kilmer, James Caviezel as a terrorist, and a number of good actors in small roles as FBI and ATF officials. It is difficult to do justice to the pace, intelligence and gradual unfolding of so interesting a story. Most reviewers cannot understand sci-fi, especially time-travel stories. So, the success of this modest but "A" production effort is worth noting as a milestone in cinematic history. Add in a strong folksy performance by Denzel Washington as the lead agent and attractive Paula Patton as his love interest; throw in good or better music by Harry Gregson- Williams, and you have a first-rate film that deserves even more attention that its many nominations would attest. Very highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never heard of this movie, but it appeared on cable and when I saw the cast, I figured "how bad could it be?". I thought it was terrific. Nothing of great dramatic or historical significance, of course, but who cares? Denzel is his usual infinitely watchable self, Val Kilmer is quirky with yet another interesting dialect and Adam Goldberg is fantastic. All three are smooth, assured and entertaining. A lot of posters and reviewers talked about how "unbelievable" the science fiction aspect of the plot was, but that never bothers me. Once I figure out what I'm supposed to suspend my disbelief about, I just do so and enjoy what the filmmakers are doing. I actually found this particular sci-fi plot quite intriguing and really liked having to try to follow its twists and turns through the action.As has been said before, this is definitely a Sci Fi/ Film Noir/Action/Romance. How many of those have you come across? Highly recommended. Big fun and smart besides.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irritatingly Short of Excellent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few films have elicited such contradictory emotions from me.Jerry Bruckheimer and Tony Scott have put together a visually sumptuous and exciting story. Denzil Washington delivers a strong lead performance as Agent Doug Carlin, Val Kilmer,FBI Agent Paul Pryzwarra, actually shows he can do restraint, and Claire Kuchever, as love interest Paula Patton flounces, entertains and is credible as well.So where does it go wrong? The basis of the story, a time "envelope" allowing us to go backwards in time is fine.However the key question, "can we alter history by going back in time? " is ultimately fudged amongst a series of gaping plot holes.Now I am not one to go looking for trouble, and firmly believe that sometimes you should just "enjoy the ride" of the story that IS being told.But perversely one of the strengths of telling a story backwards is the power of fate, you KNOW how its going to end. This way that power is weakened because your question is "how is fate going to be distorted?" For me the "twist" doesn't work, but that does not undermine a good yarn, well told, and brilliantly realised on screen.The critics, and aficionados of this picture are both right. Which side of the fence you end up on is really dependent upon how convincingly the plot grabs you.Irrespective of that, a decent effort by all concerned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film in a time when we're surrounded by shallow garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this film from the moment I heard the story-line. The thing that I REALLY like about it is the fact that the production team found a way to put sci-fi elements into the story while still making it believable. The acting was good on all fronts; the African-American woman (I think her name was Shasta or something to that effect) was very natural in her conversations with Washington. Carlin's (Washington's) curiosity about the inner working of the agency he is later employed by in the beginning of the film is very believable. It is this seamlessness that makes the movie as a whole more believable. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone old enough to understand it; although it's gotten mixed reviews, I still think it's a gem among other more shallow, lackluster films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Really Got Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen and read so many time travel things over the years that I know one could pick at this forever. Still, once we embrace the technology and go with the plot, it's hard to stop watching. This evaded me when it first came out. I rented it and was captured. First of all, it's that cool Denzel thing he does. Especially when he is quizzing someone. He knows he's the man and he leaves the person being spoken to looking to see if his wallet has been stolen. I remember some of this from "Remember the Titans." The passing in and out of realities begs the question of what will happen to the characters when they make it back? Especially if we like them. And we do. The government, of course, does what it can to screw up, but the rebel always get his way, doesn't he? This is a film one thinks about long after seeing it. I decided to ignore the science and just enjoy it. I would have given it 9 but there are some plodding parts in the middle. It also suffers from a bit too much avoidance of common sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that it was almost as if they had started on a movie and then midway decided to change the plot. The idea is great but it did look like the script was struggling to convey the idea of time travel. I thought that they should have stuck with the satellite part (and made it more convincing)... As far as the acting is concerned, some was good and some was terrible. I thought that Denzel Washington was doing more posing than acting, as if he thought that he was auditioning for '24' or 'Zoolander'. You also get the feeling that it was designed to be part of a sequel franchise. The best thing about it are the special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He killed her four days ago! You were at the funeral, what's wrong with you?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An ATF agent, Doug Carlin, is called in to investigate a ferry explosion. During his investigation he stumbles upon the body of a murdered girl. He knows she is somehow connected to the bombing. With the help of some very high-tech, Einstein inspired, government equipment, he is able to watch the last four days of her life. As he watches her last moments, he cannot stop himself from falling in love with her and becomes determined to recover her life. Carlin needs to travel back in time, save the girl and stop the terrorist, but has to be quick for the clock is ticking.... A Tony Scott/Denzel Washington collaboration is always worth watching as they usually deliver a movie with an intricate plot, thrilling action sequences, and characters that are driven by their emotions. These are rare qualities in action movies to-day. Déj? vu is no exception for it has all these qualities and more. The supporting cast is fantastic, a sublime Adam Goldberg makes a great super intelligent and witty side kick to Washington and Jim Caviezel is unnerving as the psychopath who believes his actions are for a greater good. Be warned; if you are a Val Kilmer fan, you will be a little bit disappointed as he seems to be a bystander in most events and not a participant. I have the impression that most of his scenes ended up on the cutting room floor.Like all time travel stories it will leave you with questions e.g. if this event did not take place how come Carlin knew to go back and stop it happening. Unfortunately as with all time travel tales I don't think this can be avoided but don't get too hung up about it; just let it wash over you and enjoy the film. The ending is slightly weak and leans towards the saccharin but you can forgive Déj? Vu these few flaws. This is the thinking person's action movie and after you have watched it you will probably be compelled to watch it all over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I reviewed this once before, but that review seems to have vanished. In DEJA VU, Denzel W. plays a federal agent studying a ferry explosion that has killed hundreds of people, including many military personnel. He is allowed to view a government machine that lets the viewer look back several days, and he hopes to find clues this way. The real mystery is why a woman's body washed up down river with similar burns an hour before the ferry explosion. Then the worst possible plot turn arrives: Denzel figures he can literally go back in time using the machine and figure everything out. And maybe save the gal, among other things. From this point, the movie collapses like the proverbial house of cards. It is very enjoyable and suspenseful right up until good old Denzel climbs into the time machine, I will admit. Watch the first half, skip the second. This is no MAN ON FIRE II.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time-paradox hybrid drama bests them all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Déj?Vu is one of those movies that require repetitive viewings to accept. It's internally consistent so long as we're comfortable with time-paradoxes and are prepared to allow two (major) conceits. It's executed extremely well, including its satisfying ending. Above all, this police-procedural-come sci-fi love story is a nod/thank-you to all the cops who've ever wished they could prevent man-made disaster instead of counting the bodybags. With time-travel, if necessary.Things begin with a "wink". Since studio logos sometimes now herald a movie's plot, Bruckheimer's logo animation performs an act of déj?-vu itself: it rewinds, and restarts to end correctly on the lightning striking the tree. The action opens mysteriously, portended by music. The eerie score deepens the tension by intercutting the confusing ferry montage with the Beach Boys. The pointed use of "Don't Worry Baby" was a stroke of genius, especially when reprised at the end for a different meaning. Frequency(2000)'s similar musical flourish wasn't as successful. I mention Frequency(2000) for both Jim Caviezel and Brian Greene(V--IMDb)'s dual-duty involvements.There is careful plot seeding, eg as Agent Minuti(Matt Craven)'s cellphone rings inside a bodybag. The director's commitment to stunt realism is equally impressive; he shows real burning (stunt-)people, trained by the Picernis: both Charlie and son Chuck Jr are "Die Hard" &amp;"Lethal Weapon" mavens. While non-gratuitous, the depicted bombing is tough to watch, but it's vital for our emotional investment. Question: why was the FBI looking for Minuti instead of Doug Carlin, the Oklahoma expert? Tony Scott again made the right choice having Claire Kuchever's father(Enrique Castillo) imploring Carlin that "I need her to matter to you". The movie needs her to matter to us also. Lacking this connection, Time After Time(1979)'s biggest flaw was that women just couldn't connect to Mary Steenburgen's character, but by BTTF III(1990) she was much more emotionally available.Despite being horribly brutalised, the perfectly-cast Claire(Paula Patton) turns out to be as brave as the hero. She's very relateable as a 21stC damsel "in need of a vice", especially when her heart is breaking in the rescue boat, realising Doug(Washington)'s sacrifice, then being given a second chance she couldn't explain.Denzel is again charming and cheeky as the plot veers into technothriller territory. His first contact with the time-portal team is a giggle; his face communicating "YEAH(no sh!t; and) OK!(that you'll look into it)". The romance is pitch-perfect, eg as Doug lovingly puts Claire in his car to warm up. Jim Caviezel, nicknamed JC "also" for having been "the lead" in Passion of the Christ(2004), is a suitably intense patriot. He sheds a Christlike tear as he tries to explain his deadly commitment, but it's hard to see what Oerstedt's "date with destiny" is. Déj?Vu provides a hero-vs-antihero shared destiny within the original universe where the ferry explodes, and presumably it's this struggle that Oerstedt is trying to "win", but why is he experiencing déj?-vu? The logical links of this single element are weak, so we don't "get" the violent patriot. We're left disappointed by his expectation to die in the explosion, too.The technobabble is a dull roar, yet the "digital recreation" sounds fraudulent. Not only is the time-window computationally prohibitive(impossible), but its POV detail needs an in-situ camera, not "up-to-four satellites". So this reeks of a movie cheat using the cameraman's footage masquerading as technobabble. Carlin's right, the POV(and audiofeed!) remain unexplained. Originally Tony Scott's idea, the writers' insistence on the time-window made it a little more palatable, but not much.The hysterical and hyped action banter during the Hummer chase scene is the movie's lowest point; it's there to distract us from questioning the total absence of any technological explanation for the goggle-rig whatsoever. It's pure cover-up.Scientists loathe Denny(Adam Goldberg)'s claim that "Life, like time and space, is not merely a local phenomenon", because that's stolen from What the Bleep--Down the Rabbit Hole(2006), circling the drain of pseudoscience and parapsychology. Later, the plot changes Denny's mind for him with the now hollow-sounding excuse that he's secretly religious. Granted, as a co-protagonist, Denny's conceit WAS necessary if he was to help Carlin go back to save Claire. Carlin HAD to go back, because that's what completes the causality loop: once he first saw that leading "U can save her" message in Claire's apartment, the loop was set. Such is the nature of plausible(!) time-paradoxes.However, if it's physically impossible to change the past, then NOTHING physical can go back; not even the piece of paper. Anything/anyone macroscopic(touchable) is just too big. So the creators overrode their own "God's mind is made up about this" assertion with the transported note. This is the central conceit of the plot. They originally also intended hinting that God changed his mind (deleted scene--different weather in the other universe-branch), but this was abandoned as too obvious.The time-window is supposedly being generated by that particle accelerator, but there aren't (two)black holes surrounding it. They're needed to create an Einstein-Rosen bridge(wormhole) at both ends. Even if from another dimension, we'd still need to gravitationally attenuate such black holes--a science we haven't begun to dream. Black holes in Earth's vicinity (in either dimension) would cause Solar System misalignment, killing the planet and everything on it. So this capability would be much more tragic than just causing an EM-pulse that blacks out the Eastern seaboard. The technology is fanciful--but it sounds almost plausible.Déj?Vu(2006) had to cheat, but we can just about fool ourselves. Happily the movie can be taken on many levels, its universality making it an instant classic. Déj?Vu includes everyone except violent "patriots", whose "Hell-in-a-handbasket" destiny is contrary to a universe in which love and compassion crosses space-time. Its ultimate strength is in its wrenching conclusion so perfectly buttoned by the Beach Boys, telegraphing the movie's humanism about disaster. "?everything will be alright" because it's a branching universe, not a parallel one: BRIAN GREENE, the screenplay's "God", changed his mind!(9/10).</fullReview>

The director gives you subtle clues throughout the movie that connect events and link them to the plot, so it's possible to keep up with the action without getting too confused, but it does keep you guessing.

		<fullReview>The only thing I knew about this movie was that it was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, which is more than an enough reason to rent it. The director was Tony Scott, the director of "Enemy of Nation" which entertained and "Spy Game" which totally bored me. But this movie is like nothing else. Because; 1) The subject is very original, no you can't guess what it's about by looking at the name. Don't worry it's not some freaky Shyamalan type of movie. I have watched quite a lot movies and can easily say this was a first. Oh of course there WILL be many people who will rise up saying "this can't happen in real life". Yeah, and Godzilla can't happen either, so were you there to criticize that too? It's not a matter of "can it happen" or not, it's a matter of "does it make sense", and hell yes it does! It's so hard not to give spoilers, so all I can say is, just hold on for half an hour, and everything will start making sense.2) Unlike many other high budget action movies, this movie IS exciting. Don't wanna give spoilers, but when you grab what the movie is about, you will realize it doesn't necessarily have a happy ending, and that's what keeps you on the edge all the time.3) Needless to say, the producer is Jerry Bruckheimer so everything's gonna be BIG and EXPENSIVE, cars and ships and buildings blowing up in an eye feast.So as a conclusion, I can say Mr. Bruckheimer is getting even better by adding excitement to his high budget movies.</fullReview>

Most of the haters on this board seem to have gotten too twisted up in the plot turns and time travel to enjoy the film.

		<shortDescription>Voulez vous "Deja Vu" -- Most Certainly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For every person who ever dreamed they could simply venture back in time to change something, then "Deja Vu" just may be the movie for them. "Deja Vu" stars Denzel Washington as an ATF agent who falls for a murder victim who he travels back in time to try to save. The movie's initial twist comes when Denzel's character, Doug Carlin, learns that the victim attempted to contact him before her death. The movie's intensity grows when Carlin is recruited by a newly-formed FBI investigative unit headed by a character played by Val Kilmer."Deja Vu" examines voyeurism, both real and imagined, partly by raising the question as to whether 'Big Brother' is truly watching. This film additionally explores the true definition of courage in modern day society where the threat of terrorism is ever present and is now a globally recognized issue."Deja Vu" has all the makings of a good film -- good plot, good acting, good cinematography, and good directing -- and delivers. Washington's acting is solid and is rounded out by an equally talented cast of supporting actors, including newcomer Paula Patton, Val Kilmer, Jim Caviezel, and Adam Goldberg. Tony Scott continues his genius of wide-spanning, action-packed cinematography and keeps the momentum flowing throughout the film. "Deja Vu" parses down the basic human desire to be able to go back in time to save our loved ones while also showing the potential consequences of directly interfering with "destiny." (Thereby posing the question are certain things destined no matter what our efforts.) In patronage to the movie's New Orleans setting, "Voulez vous 'Deja Vu'?" Most certainly with this winning cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective, present-day Minority Report</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent studio action thriller. Tony Scott's approach to some complicated and, frankly, barely credible science fiction is to get his cast to race through it, shouting at one another. It's an effective ploy, at once patronising but dramatically taut. Even if you'd normally switch off during exposition like this, you're aware that it's important, frightening and crucial to the plot. And gives Denzel Washington a chance to freak out.In fact I think that Scott really buys the whole 'time travel' element, which is well incorporated into the story. I think Washington does to, although his job is more about making the resulting twists work. He is as watchable as ever; equivalent to 90s Harrison Ford, nothing he does is anything less than bankable.I wish more studio flicks would turn out like this. The crazy science become a function of the plot, not it's raison d'etre. The principal actor is committed, not phon(y)ing in a role. The first-rate special effects are in-camera - vast pyrotechnics, no principal CGI. Even the music's good - borrowed from Bourne, but effective. A tweak in the script going from the first to second acts and it would have been a real winner. 7/10</fullReview>

The man is both a fine actor, and highly selective about the films he chooses to be in. I notice the vast majority of reviews show 8 or 10 stars. I was amused by a few that gave around 3 stars, attempting to explain why. One in particular explained why the "science" was wrong. Well, this is a fantasy film, not a doctoral thesis. Who cares? It is inventive. One of the "issues" being, how could there be 2 Denzels. Well, if someone really could travel back in time, how does anyone know one would "disappear", so there would be only one? If it is possible to change history, what makes that impossible? Another remark which amused me was the car was not moving fast enough to push the other car off of the ramp. If that is the case, then Double Jeopardy (Tommy Lee Jones &amp; Ashley Judd) and a whole lot of other films are equally wrong. Well, the cars were not that far apart, you couldn't accelerate to 60mph on that short a distance. But if the pedal is down the the floor, you likely could push it. Somehow that didn't really bother me either, when watching the film. Maybe I was just being entertained, in the manner the film really intended me to be?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Good...with a few problems....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as time travel movies go they never really explain how they go back in time...But in Deja Vu i think they TRY and change that. They actually really explain why and how they are doing this, even though its not believable for a second its still really entertaining.This film is essentially about a cop (denzel Washington) who discovers and works for a new agency handling top secret projects. Their first project is to try and stop a big boat from blowing up. This boat contains many women and children as well as many navy officers.This movie really plays on your mind and really tricks it, so you really have to pay attention.Pro:The overall plot is better than most time travel flicks.Con:Its not that believable.Pro:The performance by Val Killmer and Adam Goldberg are very good. (but maybe thats because I really like both of them)Con:Denzel is good, but this is the character he plays in every movie, and I think he tends to overact...Pro:This movie is very exciting, interesting, thrilling, and intriguing and I highly recommend buying or renting it...</fullReview>

It is a great movie all around. The movie is filled with great acting on all parts, and as always, Denzel Washington led a great role in the movie.

		<fullReview>First I have to say that unfortunately I bought a defect DVD and so I couldn't enjoy DEJA VU as usual.DEJA VU is worth trying but I warn you that this is not a very good action thriller but just okay to spend time when you have really nothing to do. The story is very complex but I think director Tony Scott succeeded quiet well to smelt fiction and reality in a logical order. Anyway, I find the plot lacks sometimes and you must be very tolerant with all these elements. Denzel Washington did a great job here giving a believable performance as the agent and Jim Caviezel was very cool in his role because I have never seen him playing this character. All in all I give not more 6/10. See therefore MAN OF FIRE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tony Scott has mastered his craft.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tony Scott has become a fantastic director during his run in Hollywood doing bigger budget films and cheap shorts. Man On Fire takes a step into an experimental direction that went even further on his next movie, Domino. After Domino Tony could really do anything and have it come out visually stunning. In Deja Vu he takes on the idea of heightened reality with giving a grittier feel to the image and going hand held with plenty of zooms in all the right places. You lose the idea that you're watching a PG-13 film because of this and you get the feeling you're viewing an R rated picture. Like Man On Fire, Deja Vu starts off in one direction and moves quickly into another. It's only every once in awhile that action movies bother to stand out and be different from the heard. Deja Vu dares to do this and succeeds magnificently.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For every little detail you see happening to Denzel during the first three quarters of the movie you will see a little pay-off after he has traveled in time back to the past.The film is really good and keeps you glued to the film through it's run.Denzel plays a ATF agent who is called upon by the FBI to analyze footage of an explosion that kills hundreds in New Orleans. But it turns out their footage is from the past and they have the ability to see into the past but only 4 days into the past.They are trying to catch the bomber and he is also trying to catch the same man who had killed a young woman and tried to disguise her murder as part of the casualties of the ferry bombing.Referencing Hurricane Katrina and the Oklahoma City terrorist bombing this film plays the humanist angle of America as being open to trouble, like terrorism.The plot plays out well, Val Kilmer doesn't really add much to his role as the leader of the FBI time surveillance squad.The guy who plays the lead scientist is pretty good and plays his role well but the young lady whose murder Denzel is trying to solve doesn't really bring much to her role. Anyone could have played that role and most likely have done a better job than her.It's pretty obvious that Denzel will time travel at some point during the movie to try and prevent the girls murder and the bombing. The bombers motive is never really explained and it almost seems that just before he is killed he is about to reveal he is a time traveler himself? The film looks good visually, the effects are excellent and the plot is pretty decent. The bloke playing the terrorist is pretty rubbish and anyone could have played that role as well.On the whole the film is very enjoyable and will require several viewings to catch all the little nuances that happen in the "present" that are paid off in the "past" after Denzel does his time traveling.Well worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So don't even start looking for it. It's Tony Scott directing, for Pete's sake! How Denzel Washington can go back in time and change the past, although all what happens after that, despite him seeing the changes he made, does not happen as happened, so it wouldn't be possible that he changed anything, because that would mean, something must have changed, but it didn't! Confused yet? Don't be just let the movie entertain you! If you can't do that, that means you won't enjoy the movie! And it would be a shame, because it's light and funny. The action and the suspense are mixed good together (if you can stop thinking too much about the plot, that is)! Time travel has been handled better before (see 12 Monkeys), but that doesn't mean you have to write this movie off!</fullReview>

The time travel methods are well explained, but I have no idea if they are really possible. But the plot is well thought, the actors are some of the best Hollywood has ever seen. As usual Denzel Washington steals the show, but even with that Jim Cavezal surprised and pleased me as a great "villian".

		<fullReview>I really liked the idea of using wormhole technology to view the past optically and aurally. Despite the fact that the director didn't "want" to make a sci-fi, it turned out to be a very good sci-fi. Smart move to go sci-fi and not sci-fact. If the movie would've just used satellite technology as a basis, I wouldn't have like it as much. Especially since time travel is a part of the story. Hello? Time travel is sci-fi Mr. Director! Other than that, the movie was well done. I very much appreciated the car chase where Danzel's character is car chasing a villain while the villain is in the past and Danzel is in the present. Very cool concept... Wish I would've thought of it first! (Damn.) I also appreciated the director going with practical effects instead of computer effects. I love computer effects, but if you have the "money" try the practical first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We love Academy Award winning actor Denzel Washington, so we try to see his movies because we can expect a well-told, well-acted story. However, the trailers for Deja Vu did not even come close to preparing us for this thriller. We missed seeing it in the theater. How lovely it would have been to see beautiful Paula Patton on the big screen. Nonetheless, it proved to be an enjoyable rental! The love story beautifully unfolds as Denzel's character becomes involved with a mysterious woman. The clues he uncovers never gives the story away. And the explanation of the secret technology was just scientific enough to keep us interested without going over our head. Good job.The finale answered the last scientific question, which made the journey worth the investment of time. And, for us, it raised the entire film to a score of 10. Nice work!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>let's say, the time line of the film, the "present" time, the time line A; the time line in the relative past, let's call it A-; and the time line in the relative future comparing to the A, let's call it A+.So in time line A, Dough found a dead girl's body, and the "u can save her" sign, along with the ambulance crashed house. This doesn't make any sense. Because since he got the "u can save her" sign, along with the ambulance crashed house, which means he already saved the girl from Carroll Oerstadt, then how come he still got the dead body of Claire from the first place? Even we say, OK, he changed everything after he sent the note to time line A-, but then he should found the "u can save her" sign after that, instead of at the earlier part.The film is great, nice story, Denzel Washingtion is one undutifully fine actor, but this huge conflict in the story of Deja Vu, which I have to say is a pity to such a work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The cycle created can't be started or finished. He started the case because of the ferry incident and finding her body.. then it led up to him going back and stopping it... so nothing can lead to him going back. He left himself clues that helped him get to the point where he can go back and leave himself clues.He saw his own ambulance after the "new reality" would have taken place. So if a new reality is formed as soon as something changes.. shouldn't it have been a different reality. I mean.. they didn't say when he stops the ferry from exploding did they? They said when something changes.. which it did the second he pulled those doctor's from surgery to revive him. THEN he stole the ambulance.. so why would he have seen it in the other reality's future...Now that I think about it.. there are too many to type. You get the idea.. not the worst time travel movie.. not the best. Time travel never works, but as long as it is entertaining, I guess its OK. I like T2 and it had a paradox too (John sending a man back in time who gets his mother pregnant with him). I am not saying it sucks just felt compelled to type the word paradox and prepare for people to tear this apart.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The TV ads for this film fell way short. Had I known the awesome suspense sequences in Deja Vu I would have seen this in the theater instead of in my hotel room. Time travel is the least part of this performance -- it is the final answer--not the subject--not a science fiction film. Denzel can make any story real, but the dual present and past storyline is both original and riveting. The chase scene is absolutely fantastic! Best I've ever seen! One eye in the present and one in the past. Deja Vu belongs on the big screen. I'm mad about the previews. Space-folding is all I've heard. Deja Vu is a love/detective story. The technology is a well-done aside. Everyone will love this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't work.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am usually skeptical about every film Tony Scott directs these days. "Man On Fire" gave me a terrible headache for days. "Domino" was just garbage in every possible way. The whole post - modernist thing Scott has going on is just totally unnecessary and pretty much annoying. For the most part, "Deja Vu" loses this and that makes it more watchable. But again, there are certain scenes where Scott just obviously can't hold back on himself. and while this film is visually enjoyable(but at times annoying), there are several problems with the story.I guess it's pretty hard to make a film about time travel, that can avoid massive plot holes, but if usually these plot holes are hard to see, than in this film, they're hard miss. "Deja Vu" rapes every time travel film possible, breaking all the usual rules set up by them. In "Deja Vu" it is never said that time travel is dangerous and could alter the universe. It makes time travel look like an everyday task. This pretty much destroys all the excitement that you could get from the thought of time travel. Also, throughout the movie, the viewer is assured that it is impossible to change what has already happened. And throughout the film we are proved that this is true as the pieces begin to come together. But in the end, something happens, and the ending differs, implying that there is an event that changed the outcome of the story, but it is never explained what is this event. I suppose that this is intended to be the "divine intervention". And that's probably the thing that doesn't work in the film. Mixing religion with time travel? I'm sorry, but that's just retarded.I probably don't recommend this film to anyone. If you really want a good time travel flick, watch "Primer" instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Deja vu' has more class to itself as to use its title word 'Deja vu' in the entire movie, especially at the very end, where you'd realize just why it was called 'Deja vu' AND NOT by anyone's words, by the shear MAGNIFICANCE of Denzel Washington's tremendous solid acting.'Deja vu' can be classified as a Sci-Fi/Action movie, yet it's a Thriller like no other. Right when you'd think you've figured out where the movie is leading, it shows you, you're wrong. 'Deja vu' is a Thriller, while it contains significant messages of human dignity, value and of sacrifice &amp; patriotism. Therefore, I'd say that 'Deja vu' has it all, including my rating of it as 9/10. Few movies work well across all these genres and that's what makes this awesome movie stand out.The Sci-fi might seem at some points in the movie, too advanced for our times, but given the fresh ideas offered in that theme, it adds extra delight to the captivating events on screen.It's really interesting &amp; relevant to have a movie like this be produced after Hurricane Katrina occurred, in New Orleans, because of how this movie &amp; the role of 'Doug Carlin' sacrifices himself &amp; proves how sacrifice is an essence of patriotism. That's a lesson I believe Katrina proved to us too.Denzel Washington, as always, takes this storyline where it should be lead &amp; he carries a lot of it all by himself. Paula Patton does a really good job too playing the role of 'Claire Kuchever' &amp; all the scenarios that she goes through. I was surprised at how sensible 'Adam Goldberg' appeared since I'd mostly seen him in only comedies before. Overall a good cast &amp; excellent art direction for this movie, result in 128 minutes of a compelling thriller, with no faults to be mentioned at all at the end of it. From now on I'm thinking whenever I see an AWeSoME Movie, I'll be having myself a 'Deja Vu'! (A Deja Vu to this movie, if you know what I mean!)</fullReview>

Though MAN ON FIRE was a slightly better film and had stronger story dynamics.Little is left to be desired from this blockbuster, and it DOES have the fundamental elements that are required to bring action/sci-fi BEYOND the level of superficiality and mere shoot 'em up explosive scenes.It has a satisfying, and someone tensely humorous finale.

		<shortDescription>Not so much a science lecture than an old-fashioned crime thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I don't know how a cellphone works but I know how to use it," says Denzel Washington's character at some point in director Tony Scott's latest project - the thriller-slash-sci-fi film "Deja Vu." In a way, it mirrors much of the film's requirement for the audience's high level of suspension of disbelief; because as far as plausibility goes, Scott and screenwriters Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio care less about the details of theoretical physics to make a scientifically sound premise than to provide a fresh twist on the cinematic staple car chase. This is still a Jerry Bruckheimer-funded movie, after all.The movie starts with various people, mostly members of the US Navy, boarding a New Orleans ferry. At this point the movie runs for a little over ten minutes without much dialog - only snippets of randomness showcasing a relatively muted Scott-style editing. However, a few moments after departure, the ferry explodes and ATF agent Doug Carlin (Washington) gathers enough evidence from the crime scene to rule out an accident. Moreover, the discovery of the body of Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton) near the crime scene virtually suggests foul play and leads Carlin to discover that he had previous contact with the victim although he can't remember it.FBI agent Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer) then enlists Carlin's help in investigating the case by introducing the latter to a device that enables them to look four days into the past, trying to obtain any information that might help in pinning down the suspect - in the process spying on Claire, and doing an unorthodox mad chase scene across the highways of New Orleans. (How unorthodox? Let's just say Carlin is chasing the past. Yeah, terrible pun. Sorry.) As with any films toying with space-time continuum, "Deja Vu" suffers from plot holes resulting from the inherent paradox of the subject. But Scott and the writers wisely keep the proceedings lively by infusing the film with genuine tension and the fact that the audience isn't required much to mull on the specifics. Scott also exercises restraint in his usually artistic overindulgence and it results to a hearty old-fashioned crime thriller wedged somewhere in the pseudoscience mumbo jumbos.Washington, as usual, provides a solid presence for the film although his performance is a step down from the earlier "Inside Man." But his conviction for the case, along with some able support from Patton, makes it easier for the audience to go along with the story. Jim Caviezel as the villain, Kilmer, Adam Goldberg, and a bunch of others are merely drifting along, though.There were times when "Deja Vu" felt a little too long even by Jerry Bruckheimer standards but overall it's a satisfying experience. Like Carlin, I couldn't care less about intrauniverse wormholes but I sure know how to appreciate it in what could be its most practical application this time and age: a decent device for putting a new twist to an otherwise standard crime thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good idea, but not well done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a terrorist attack, the best agent of "CSI" is called to try a new kind of tool to solve crimes: a kind of camera that allow you to see what happened 3 days ago everywhere. It is a good idea, how to rebuild the crime from the beginning, but at the middle of the film it became a typical action film with a superhero-I-can-do-everything that is simply correct. It tries to go deep and to be different by putting in the time aspect, but after the rules are set: There's no way to change the future, and everything you do guides you to your future; just at the end, they change, as Denzel is so good, he changes the future and he does it in a very incoherent way, as he is in love with someone he has not met yet (he'll do 3 days after). Actors are not bad, but as the script is incoherent, the result is not good. I don't mind movies messing with time, but I'd like them to do it correctly. What starts as a thriller, soon became a sci-fi thriller and ends incoherently as a typical action movie where things happen without any reason (what a way to fell in love!) usually is not good. These mixes could result wonderful, but it is hard to do the mix well and, well this is not an example of that. Due to his incoherent script the movie results disappointing, but it is a good point to remark the good job of the director, being able to do a decent (not good) movie with this script. The idea was good, but the story was never interesting. I hope next Tony Scott movie is better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a cool flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As usual, no synopsis here; just a comment. And, yes, definite SPOILERS.When I realized at the start that it was a Jerry Bruckheimer movie, my reaction was 'cool'! A time travel theme done by Bruckheimer; what more could anyone want? With Denzel Washington and Val Kilmer to boot?plus one Paula Patton, who in the beginning on the morgue slab looks almost like Halle Berry, almost to the extend of making me think 'what the...', but then turns safely into a non-Halle-Berry, which is all good, because Patton has several times the personality of the former.Since I write SF I am a clued-in kind of guy, and so when a terrorist/CSI tale turned into a time-travel story, well that was even better. It's a daring genre mix?a bit like The Island was?but that makes it more interesting. I know a lot of cinema goers get 'genre-confused' when the clues are pointing _this_ way at the start, but then the movie ends up going _that_ way, but in this case it worked.The sci-fi premise was simple, supported by the inevitable and probably necessary bit of yak-speak in which the word 'wormhole' just _had_ to figure. But once you accepted the basic idea, it was followed through with fairly solid logic. That's the hallmark of good sci-fi premises, and especially those involving time-travel, and even more especially those set in a current-day context.In this instance (last spoiler warning!) it was this: Take any given location on the map. You can build a device that peeks a fixed amount of time into the past within a given radius around that location. Meaning that you can't peek outside the area thus defined. The only way you can do that is if you carry some remote to the device around and position said remote close to whatever you want to look at, since it was a much smaller viewing radius. Also, you can only always look at a given point in time a fixed interval 'behind' your current position on the time-axis; that is, if you are looking back using the device at time 't' and you can look back by an interval of 'dt', the point in time you're looking at is 't-dt'. Meaning you'd better look close, because if you don't you might miss it?and even recording what you see doesn't help, because you can't look everywhere. Just like you can't look everywhere right now.That was the premise and they basically ran with it. I like those kinds of plots, because they allow you to spin out things without too much strain on credibility. Stephen Gould writes books like that: _Jumper_ and _Wildside_ are two examples of the same kind of approach. I've tried it myself. It's a very neat way of story-telling. Simple and clear premises often give rise to much more complex tales than worlds created with too much artifice.Great flick. Worth every dollar my wife and I spent on seeing it, and more.Till Noever, owlglass.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie On its Own Right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are times when all of us, fans of filmaking,get tired of all the trashy movies that keep invading our theaters. We want to see something really different,something we would remember for months to come,that would really blow us away. "Deja VI" is the feeling you start to get when all the movies you see from a genre feel like they were taken from the same place...That being said,"deja VI" is movie magic. Its a mix of great directing,some of the best acting i have seen in a long time,and a script that works in so many ways,that the only way to make it justice is by watching it. I kid you not my friends. This movie has action,drama,and a great sense of "toying" with the viewer. Its art,plain and simple.The cast,is an important part to make this movie the "feel" it has. I don't want to get in details, but Denzel Washington is simply brilliant, his acting is top notch,in my opinion it is his best performance in recent years. Jim Caviezel also is a screen "stealer" every time he appears on film. A word of appreciation to Val Kilmer's role,his acting is also convincing. I am not going to go into details about the other cast members, but i can honestly say there is not bad acting on this movie,none what so ever.I am not going to say what the movie is about,everyone out there reading this,should just go and see it,its just that good. Action fans will not be disappointed,thriller fans will be blown away,and even sci-fi fans will love this one. Confused? Well there is only one day to solve this mystery. A theater near you. A word to producer Jerry Bruckheimer...Once again you recognize an excellent script when you see one,thank you. I went to the theater to watch "deja VI",and i came out with the feeling that i wanted the movie to be longer...or maybe just another "Deja VI" feeling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can we change what happens? Would things be different if we knew the future? And if we know it, does the only fact of having that power influence the next moments of our lives? Does it have any sense? The eternal question of the human being. Everything mix up in an unsolved paradox, and represented in this Tony Scott's film. Denzel Washington once again brings life to his character and gives a breath of anxiety in every single scene. Tension gets more and more uncontrollable, and with the running of the seconds, the privilege of being a simple spectator turns in an enormous desire of getting involved in the plot. The details are taken in extremely care. Where it seems there is no reason, for our surprise, there is. And where it seems there is truly a reason..., well, my friends, it's not what you believe it is. The first hour you may think that nonsense takes the control, but don't panic, remember that for every "why" there is a "because". Fast cameras will increase your pulse and give you the feeling of confusion. Doubts plus the thought of having lost several moments will take you to total madness. Exactly the same feeling of our leading man.An ultimate edition quality, even a better direction, crowned by the performances of Val Kilmer and James Caviezel make this film a great Hollywood's piece.Armed yourself with patient and be prepare to tolerate the anxiety. The answers will appear. Give it time,... because in this kind of films Time is the main character.You have to see it, from the beginning to the end (if that is defined). Of course if you think you already saw it, it's just a Deja Vu, because there is no movie like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too cunning to be understood - almost</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh dear. Time-travel movies. Most of the time they have some fatal flaw in their logic, and at first I thought that Deja Vu did, too. But apparently it doesn't. Only problem is, on first viewing it's nearly impossible for mortal intellects to understand, and even harder to explain.When the movie starts, another earlier timeline has already played itself out. Claire's phone message for Doug could only have come if he had already gotten involved in her life. So what we don't see in the movie is the first time he goes back in time to save her. He doesn't succeed, and so we get a second (actually a third) timeline, where we follow the "third Doug's" point of view, meaning that neither he nor we know the whole story. It's a plot much like in Christopher Nolan's Memento. Doug has to discover his mistakes over and over until he gets it right. Trouble is, the movie doesn't show you this with enough clarity for the ordinary (or even a bit advanced) viewer (or critic) to understand. There are not enough clues. It's being too steenkin' intellectual! But, this is forgivable; I always like a movie that doesn't give away all its secrets at once. The downside is that it will not be a commercial or critical success, at least not until posterity as a whole figures out what's going on in it. But to have a decent time-travel movie for once, I do think it's worth it! (And hey, don't movies take in most of their cash on DVD sales anyway?)So I must say that, after thinking about it, it's actually a much better movie than I thought it was just after I finished it. This is good. Discovering surprising depths to a Hollywood movie is very, very rare. Good job, everybody who worked on it. You did well.9 out of 10.</fullReview>

But the downfall, which made the movie a little sour for my part was that.. the "bad guy" shoots at a couple of cars and they blow up (typicall Hollywood), tho 2 secs later a whole bunch of police throws out 100's of bullets in Denzel's car.. No explosions.. since the movie was unrealistic in general, they could have made the rest realistic. I just want an unrealistic movie to be trustworthy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing "Deja Vu" with some friends, and I must say, I have not seen such an original, truly suspenseful thriller in a good long while. Denzel Washington gives (As You might expect...) an awesome performance. Along with Val Kilmer, and Jim Caviazel. I have always been a rather big fan of Tony Scott's work, (Domino, Top Gun, Man on Fire.) And I was not disappointed with this one either. This movie provides top-notch suspense! A near two-hour movie truly felt like one hour. Jerry Bruckheimer and Tony Scott knew what they were doing. I recommend this movie to thriller lovers, and I cannot wait until the DVD comes out. I am not at all sorry I went to see this movie. It wasn't perfect, but it definitely was a really good, suspenseful thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the visual frenesi of Domino,what other trick could director Tony Scott use to confuse the spectator?In Deja vu,Tony Scott decided to confuse but not with images.He decided to confuse with a story,at the same time intelligent and absurd;obviously weak,but so fun that the fails are excused.Deja vu uses the old concept of traveling in the time,I do not consider it as science fiction because the science this film has is totally stupid.But I consider it as a different twist this movie has because without that,the movie would have been a mediocre action film.If the movie would not have the premise of traveling in the time,it would have been a typical cop thriller with a main character looking for revenge.I have to give some credit to the screenwriters Bill Marsilii and Ted Rossio:for one sight,they found a fresh angle to a cliché story;but for the other sight,they did not do it very well.The movie has ridiculous twists and they feel forced.But Deja Vu has a lot of positive elements;like Denzel Washington in the main character and the supporting cast.Tony Scott is a good director when he wants and I think he did a good work on this movie.I had a good time watching this movie thanks to the good work of its actors,to Tony Scott's direction and for the intelligent and absurd script.It's not a good sci-fi movie,but as a simple action thriller it is very fun and never boring.I recommend it as a popcorn flick to watch at a weekend,but you do not have to wait a masterpiece.You have to expect big explosions and big holes of credibility and logic.And a very exotic persecution scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Had it matched its title just a tad bit more, this movie would have been more believable. When I bought the ticket my mind was somewhat made up that a cop with certain clairvoyance skills would draw a case to a close but man, this time travel thing just gave the movie a wrong twist I can't honestly buy -not to enter the fact that over the first 30 minutes it hints to become a 2-hour-long CSI episode, if one only refers to the electronic incidental music, two guys and a corpse at the morgue, and so on so forth as evidence of my theory, LOL. As a matter of fact, by minute 30 I was already labeling this as "CSI New Orleans". Interesting that a movie can be led in a logical and plausible sequence to its very end on such weak pretenses, not to say that this doesn't come too far beyond, either, from being a 1984's The Terminator's failed rip-off. Nonetheless, The Terminator succeeds in passing the time traveling thing over a secondary place, which is not a merit of Deja Vu. You have to forcibly suspend your disbelief on this movie's intended time travel method if you want to get this past and not to find yourself wanting your money back. Otherwise, it won't work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was quite surprised I have to say. We were a group of 10 people watching the movie. And everybody had a very different point of view at the end of the movie. It ranged from crap to excellent.Personally I liked the movie. OK you have to be in it and follow the storyline in order to keep up. It's getting pretty complicated after the first 20 minutes. If you lost it there, no need to go on.The story is nice, a bit different that what you would expect but nice. I couldn't find too many inconsistencies in the story line going back and forth in time. It was entertaining as well.There's two points that I didn't like about the movie. Who's the terrorist????? When he was arrested he was talking like he knew something that would be important to the story, but we never get to know if he was just talking crap or if it was based on information that the viewer didn't have "yet". And at the end on the Ferry he says: " It wasn't supposed to be like this". How can he know?? Then there's the final scene in the car where the main actor seems to remember about the past that hasn't happened yet. How's that possible? It's definitely a movie worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspend your sense of logic and enjoy the ride, if only for Denzel Washington</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Watched in Toronto) It is very difficult to talk about Deja Vu because the very mention of its fundamental premise would take away a lot of fun in watching it. The way the movie is really going does not take shape until halfway through and although you can guess to a certain extent, the fun is in the guessing. What I'll do therefore is to talk first about things that are "safe" to mention and bring in an addition spoiler warning before going any further.One cinematic axiom, to me at least, is that any movie with Denzel Washington is worth watching. In terms of personal experience, this axiom has always held true, and "Déj? vu" is no exception. Just that wickedly charming Washington smile in difficult situations is worth the price of the ticket. As to newcomer Paula Patton, the classic Latin beauty and damsel-in-distress combination is enough to make an overwhelming majority if the male audience want to jump through a black hole to her rescue.There is an intriguing story and here is cliffhanging tension. There is also meticulous attention to details. A great deal of effort is also evident in putting the camera to the best use, so that every frame is a stimulating experience to the audience. As to the script, well, that's where it becomes interesting. I looked up two prominent critics: one calls it "intelligent" while the other "a mess". There you have it! But it's also going into an area where a big spoiler warning is called for.ADDITIONAL SPOILER WARNING! Time travel is not exactly groundbreaking for a movie. Even narrowing down to the premise of trying to change the course of event by travelling back in time, there has been too many to mention, from successes e.g. "Back to the future" to failures e.g. "The time machine" (2002). The second half of "Déj? vu" is REALLY deja vu, in terms of covering these very familiar premises. It's the FIRST HALF of the movie that is quite imaginative, although you may not want to go so far as to call it groundbreaking.In trying to solve a crime, local ATF (alcohol, tobacco, firearms/explosives) agent Doug Carlin (Washington) is enlisted by the FBI for his keen detective sense and local background. If you have not been contaminated with spoilers, you would have a lot of fun being led down the path of surprises, with initially a team of science wiz that can bring back images from 4 days ago, anywhere on this planet, as if things were happening right now. The catch is that these two timelines ? 4 days ago and present ? flow in parallel and you can't pause what you see happening four days ago. That gives rise to a mind-boggling, exciting and ingenious car chase scene ? with one eye looking into a gadget, you are following a car that is in front of you FOUR DAYS AGO while with the other eye, you are see the actual, present traffic. Yes, it defies all your sense of logic and you can even call it stupid. But that doesn't stop it from being a load of fun, particularly when it is so skilfully shot.It isn't until about half-way through the movie, although you might have suspected earlier, that you not only can SEE what happens 4 days ago, but you can BE there. The way this was brought about is when suspecting agent Carlin pulls a quick one on the team of scientists by suddenly shooting a laser beam to the screen, thereby triggering a reaction from the protagonist who is supposed to the there 4 days ago, and DEAD NOW. All these are absolute nonsense and not even by invoking things like space folding back on itself can make it less absurd. But, as I said, it does not stop the movie from being a lot of fun, due large to the fact that is has been so skilfully crafted.So you get the idea. This is the sort of movie that can only be enjoyed by suspending all your sense of logic, and let yourself be caught in its pace and mood and enjoy the ride. After all, it's the magic of movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite of the title, this movie isn't anything "already seen". The plot tells a story never told before, even if some scenes are similar to another Tony Scott's movie, Public Enemy. However what I most like of "Deja Vu" is the script. Unlike many others action movies, the language isn't vulgar, the story is clear though what it tells is highly improbable, and some gags are memorable ("I'll speak slowly so that those of you in the room who have PhDs can understand me.") I also liked the directing: the movie starts slowly, with a long description of the ship disaster; but then the rhythm became faster and faster and at the end, when the great Denzel is trying to change the past, I couldn't help nail-biting. Finally the last scene, where they go away and Denzel has a Deja Vu. I definitely enjoyed it, not the best movie ever, but certainly one that worth the price of the ticket. And in our time that's a huge merit.</fullReview>

I won't go into detail because that would ruin the whole movie...but keep in mind Deja Vu is not a big mess of plot...it works.If there is one thing, however, that is a mess, it is the technological part. When they were talking about technology, I sure didn't understand what the hell was going on. Did it make sense? I have no idea, and I don't really care...just try to ignore the fact that all those big words and the explanation of time and space may be a little over the head...Then there is the plot hole problem. All movies like this are bound to have a plot hole...but again, that doesn't bother me. The film's plot made enough sense and was clever enough to the point where it doesn't matter. I actually can't figure out any plot holes but then again I don't care to waste my time trying to find them...why not just enjoy the movie? If you can ignore all that and just enjoy what the movie is trying to do...which is entertain, than go see it. It is definitely worth it. If you liked Back to the Future (I have yet to find someone who didn't) then you will certainly like this.Acting - great, cinematography - great, everything is great. Just don't go to haywire over the technological aspect of it...8/10.</fullReview>

Spectacular cinematography, Denzel Washington is always great, and a twisting story line make this an engrossing and entertaining movie. The plot is based upon scientific probable reality although, being a movie, it twists and turns into ways that make the probable reality impossible. Hints of 'Big Brother', hints of future scientific achievements, a modern day terrorist plot, and fantastic acting. This must be one of the better movies I've seen this year and I'd recommend everyone to go and see it. I gave it an 8 out of 10 only because I'm interested in the probably scientific reality the movie deals with, and was disappointed the script went into paradoxes and other scientific non-probabilities instead of dealing more accurately with the scientific theory behind the whole movie. All in all though, it was great - I'll be seeing this one again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a really good, exciting, action/romance type movie. From the word go it looks fabulous. The photography and the management of the crowds of extras all boarding the ferry, partying on board and then the aftermath of the explosion is amazing. The explosion itself is a visceral,breathtaking experience. The story is peopled with so many nice characters that you can't help but be drawn in. Denzel Washington gives yet another superb and riveting performance (Tell me? How is it he never ages?)and strips off beautifully too. The story involves time travel, and as with any story that makes use of such a device one has to be prepared to suspend disbelief. The idea of going back in time to stop a "Perp" before he commits a crime clearly has been done before in "Minority Report", but this story is an exciting new take on that theme. Both "Back to the Future" and "Bill and Ted" have examined the difficulties of time travel but in a jokey context, thus there is room for this serious piece within the oeuvre. The investigative reconstruction methods owed something to "Without a Trace", sign of Mr Bruckheimer's hand in there I think. In my opinion the story holds up pretty well under scrutiny; its internal logic works well. It is an intelligently written piece. Those who have problems with the plotting perhaps are not adept time-travellers like some of us. All in all this is a very enjoyable film that I would confidently recommend to anyone who likes good quality action movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What can I say? It's Tony Scott</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're going to make a film with a ridiculous premise, nonsensical sci-fi talk, and its share of clichés, it damn sure better look pretty. Fortunately, Tony Scott helms this disaster waiting to happen ? the same man who last year made me retract my absolute hatred for MTVesque film-making with the wickedly stylistic Domino. So, yes, for the record Déj? Vu looks pretty sweet. Not a bad action-thriller ride either.Scott goes out of his way to give the opening credits a surreal quality starting with the double-take on the Bruckheimer logo, continuing through the ferry disaster that resonates with an abstract almost montage vibe, and ending with the deliberate slow motion introduction of Denzel Washington's character, Doug Carlin. Dare I say it's "dreamlike" in a review for a movie wearing the name "Déj? Vu?" I honestly expected a character to wake up from a nightmare ? you know the overused cliché. Well, the narrative does suddenly in fact take on a more objective perspective not unlike the sensation of waking up; however, the events at the beginning of the film still stand. Doug Carlin still has a serious crime to solve, and a long road ahead of him.From there, Déj? Vu goes through some obligatory police procedural motions, and fortunately doesn't bore with them. It drives towards setting up its premise as quickly as possible while Denzel Washington spices up the dialogue with his upbeat character with a knack for being two approximately ten steps ahead of his contemporaries. This, naturally, catches the attention of Agent Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer) who recruits him for the top secret investigation from which the film gains its title.There exists a window into the past where the characters in the present can watch the events of four days before from a free-roaming perspective within a certain radius. The catch? It plays in real-time, and they can't rewind. This opens the second, most fascinating, act of the film ? where Doug Carlin observes one of the victims believed to be directly tied to the bomber. And Tony Scott masterfully exploits the possibilities and limitations of this setup of observation without interaction.Such as the wonderfully composed scene where Doug Carlin stares at the face of Claire ( the victim) as she was four days ago ? alive, alone, and oblivious to the fate that awaits her in a few days (her time). Carlin stands with his back to the camera, behind him Claire's face fills the frame, and across time a bond forms between these characters who have never met. Even though the fruits of these seeds won't be reaped until later, this is where the goal shifts from catching the bomber to saving Claire's life.Every thriller needs a chase sequence, and Tony Scott presents one of the most unique chases since the French Connection. Carlin, in the present, locates the bomber in the past, and has to track him in the past ? literally having to give chase to something that happened four days before while facing today's rush hour traffic. And despite the fact Carlin cannot stop the villain even if he catches him, and the fact that Carlin (and the audience) already know the ultimate outcome ? Tony Scott still manages to inject this chase with his trademark intensity as the question shifts from "what happens?" to "how does it happen?" from "who is the killer?" to "where are the bodies buried?" Unfortunately, Déj? Vu goes a little overboard in its (numerous) explanations, and it recycles dialogue/explanations that sci-fi fans have memorized regarding the warping of space-time not unlike folding a piece of paper to bring two separate points together. It really wasn't necessary nine years ago in Event Horizon, now it's just obnoxious.Déj? Vu also goes precisely where the mainstream audience would want a sci-fi thriller to go. At least Déj? Vu recognizes its own indulgence to the mainstream ? the bomber's been arrested in the present, that's it. Case closed. The people on the ferry and Claire are beyond saving. Right? The lead scientist character, Denny (who was in charge or reciting most of the Sci-fi mumbo-jumbo) answers the phone not surprised to hear Doug Carlin on the other end. "I knew you'd be call." That's it. Cut to Denzel Washington getting ready risk life and death to go back in time and save Claire hours before she's scheduled to die.While the third act is more than competently directed, providing some excellent action sequences topped off with a satisfying finale ? it's still traditional thriller. It never matches the brilliance of the second act where the ingenuity comes not from limitless possibilities, rather the limitations, themselves. More specifically: exploiting those limitations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much, much better than the last Washington/Scott movie, Man On Fire.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even Tony Scott's irritating tendency to over stylize his direction cannot stop Deja Vu from being a great piece of action cinema. The complex and involving story, coupled with great performances from its talented cast (including Denzel Washington, Paula Patton, Val Kilmer, and James Caviezel) ensure that you soon learn to ignore Scott's annoying visual techniques and concentrate on the story being told.Washington plays Doug Carlin, an ATF agent called in to investigate a terrorist explosion on a New Orleans ferry. Impressed by Carlin's efficiency, FBI Agent Andrew Pryzwarra asks him to join a special team who are utilising a high-tech piece of surveillance equipment to try and solve the crime.The boffins on the team tell him that their top secret gadget reconstructs the crime scene in 3D via some satellites and a whole load of computer imaging software. Carlin (quite rightly) suspects they are lying to him, and eventually manages to get them to tell him the truth: the machine is able to warp the fabric of space, enabling them to actually see into the past.Carlin wonders whether it might be possible to use the machine to actually travel into the past in order to prevent the ferry disaster, and also to save the life of a beautiful woman who somehow holds the key to the identity of the terrorist.Starting with the simply amazing destruction of the ferry (one of the most impressive cinematic explosions I have ever seen), Deja Vu keeps the momentum going right to the exciting climax in which Carlin is sent into the past to confront the maniac responsible for the bombing. Like many time-travel tales, the story throws up the possibility of all manner of paradoxes, and one is advised not to question the science too much, but just sit back and enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

A woman washes up to shore an hour before the boat explodes. How could this be? The suspense in this story is unlike anything I've ever seen or experienced. The action sequences are unique as well. For instance a one of a kind car chase where Denzel chases a car from 4 days earlier. (You'll understand when you see the movie) Speaking of which the plot isn't to difficult to understand. The suspense is good enough to be kind of creepy at times and the action is exhilarating. This movie is certainly worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Val Kilmer-small supporting role....why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Val Kilmer is a great actor. Denzel is also wonderful at his craft. I must admit I went to see this film because of Kilmer. With his sharp timing, amazing array of dialects, and general acting ability, he could have added so much to this typical Hollywood action flick, that would actually make it unique, intriguing, different. I'm surprised his role was only supporting, and his character wasn't exactly imperative to the film. While he did a fine job, I can't understand why he took the job. He is aging, and its noticeable, but that doesn't mean he shouldn't take on more interesting and bigger roles. Wish he'd get some better roles in the future!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>complicated setup that pays off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The producer-director team of Jerry Bruckheimer and Tony Scott re-collaborate to bring you this sophisticated thriller that explores the delicate link between the past and future. Denzel Washington stars as a headstrong ATF agent called in to investigate an attack on a Naval cruise liner and its ambiguous connection to the death of a young woman. With the help of a covert government team and one of a kind technology, he discovers a method to travel back in time to try and save her. Swift, intricate thrill ride is exciting, suspenseful, and well-performed, with a unique?if convoluted?story that grabs and holds you from the word go. The script may not be airtight and tends to ramble in its own logic, but it does entertain and adds yet another level of depth and intrigue to the 'mind teaser' genre. ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Denzel Washington will go down in history as one of the greatest actors of his day ...and this movie once again proves why! With a plot as complex as this one is ...Denzel holds his place and keeps you riveted to the screen. From the opening sequence (quite spectacular) to the thrilling (although mind boggling at times) conclusion ... I sat and watched without blinking. I loved this movie ...I plan on seeing it over again just to catch what I missed.The trailers for this movie did it justice by not giving away too much ...but giving away just enough to tempt you. A fabulous story featuring action, suspense, romance and of course a sci-fi touch too. This is one the whole family will love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Action-packed movie with a good overall plot. Denzel Washington play a local ATF agent who gets deeply involved into the case he is working. Some of the sci-fi may have been a little "out-there" and not well-explained, but it was worked well into the story. Pay close attention to subtle things happening in the movie. Even if they don't appear to have anything to do with what is happening, they may mean a lot later on.Given the opportunity, I might watch it again just to see what I missed. While it is a must-see on DVD, it certainly is worth seeing on the big screen with theatre-quality sound for the special effect sequences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tony Scott's Visual Flash and Panache Give This Average Story A Kick In The Pants</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the fact that many folks seem to embrace Ridley Scott's grandiose directorial style, they often refer to younger brother Tony's work as "amateurish." I on the other hand can't help but be wowed by Tony Scott's flashy, in your face, kinetic editing style. Deja Vu would have been "just another thriller" had it not been for Scott's trademark touches. That being said it's Scott's style coupled with some solid performances that are the only things holding together what otherwise probably would have been just another dumbed down Bruckheimer explosionfest helmed by Michael Bay. Storywise I have to say that I was let down. The initial trailer for this film had me all hyped as I thought it would be a deep psychological thriller that actually dealt with something that at least remotely resembled Deja Vu and not "I got to see stuff that happened 4 days ago on a giant flatscreen... that's kind of like Deja Vu right?" Wrong. Figures as it's a Bruckheimer production. In a nutshell the basic premise behind Deja Vu is that the government has found a way to see 4 days into the past and with that came my first question which was "how the hell did this screenplay sell for $5 million dollars?" Things don't really get ridiculous until the last 20-30 minutes though. Throughout the film we're told "we can't send anyone back in time, we can't change the past, it can't be done" and yet somehow toward the end of the film, someone is sent back through time. It's at this point that the main protagonist figures out what we as the audience knew all along and after all is said and done we get a slap in the face in the form of a cheesy, predictable, happy go lucky ending which totally doesn't fit with the tone of the film, especially after the protagonist and antagonist share a conversation about sacrifice and patriotism. Perhaps I was expecting too much? In my opinion the term "Deja Vu" was used as nothing more than a gimmick here. You might as well call this film "4 days ago."The performances from the leads were solid all around. Denzel is of course... well he's Denzel. When he rants and raves on the big screen he commands the attention of the other characters as well as the audience. Val Kilmer's performance is pretty straightforward, but the performance I was both most impressed and disappointed with was Jim Caviezel's. As much as I was wowed by his character I was so intrigued by him that it made me angry that he got such little screen time. True they did describe in brief what motivated him to do the things he did but it all felt so rushed as he only showed up as the film was hitting it's stride. And then there's Tony Scott's direction. Simply put, if you enjoyed how he shot Enemy of The State and Spy Game, you'll most likely enjoy Deja Vu. Think similar cinematography (i.e. flashy and techy but more restrained than Man on Fire and Domino), but with a government conspiracy screenplay that's also part science fiction. Scott pulls out his familiar bag of tricks by employing things like quick flashes, zooms and edits during the scenes where the characters see into the past. All touches that add to the feeling of confusion and put you smack in the middle of the action. And when things heat up and Denzel takes off after Caviezel in a Humvee, things get really impressive. Using a helmet that basically allows Washington's character to see into the past, Denzel drives around New Orleans with one eye looking straight ahead at the road, and the other eye focused on a screen showing the same road 4 days ago. One shot has his character looking at the screen that shows him the past as he ignores the threat of a semi coming straight at him which the audience can see in plain sight. Then all of a sudden... well I won't spoil it but talk about slick direction. Of course you have your slow motion crashes and water shots as well as Scott's trademark aerial pans around the city which help to immerse you in the environment. Some might dismiss these techniques as cheap tricks but simply put, I like the way he chops things and edits them back together. In the end it's these flashy details that help to save what is really a mediocre script. The idea of a story where destiny supposedly has a plan for a character and where said character thinks he's changing things when in fact he's acting in accordance with whatever plan destiny has for him in the first place has been done in the past in films such as Minority Report and The Matrix, yet the style of direction is almost enough to make Deja Vu feel relatively fresh. Definitely not the deep thinker of a thriller I was hoping for, but a flashy, showy take on a concept that's been done before that overall makes for an entertaining popcorn flick. True the only Deja Vu you'll experience during this film is Scott's kinetic style, but if you're a fan of his work it's worth a viewing. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even better than expected after seeing the previews, not at all what is suggested, that it's kind of a mind game thing. great effects, shooting style, very sci-fi , but not corny, and of course Denzel Washington approved as I'm sure he has his contributions to the story and the character he plays. Beautiful female lead too. It has a bit of a love story, but it's really more of an infatuation with another character,and in that light, you won't be disappointed that it doesn't develop completely, just enough to tie the story together. Don't let anyone talk about the story in detail, good chance of spoiling it. Val Kilmer adds a bit, I actually like his character, different than other parts. highly recommend it.

		<fullReview>The concept is not new. We've seen many time travel related movies. But the movie feels novel. It is more like a mystery/drama movie rather than science fiction . You never get bored. 2 hrs passed so quickly. It is hard to guess the ending. Acting is topnotch from Denzel as usual. I was trying not to fall asleep in 'The Fountain' but here I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Don't try to understand too much of the science fiction part of the movie. Enjoy the rest.Val Kilmer looks chubby! It took me a couple of moments to get convinced it was him. The female lead is pretty. The electronics equipment they use in the movie is very fascinating. So is the science fiction theory it is based on. One of the highlights of the movie is Denzel wearing a special headset and driving on a busy highway, with one eye looking into the past and other looking at the traffic! Yeah, you'll understand when you see it!</fullReview>

Denzel was amazing as usual and the story kept me guessing. I didn't know exactly where the story was going since the previews I had seen didn't give everything away like they so often do these days.The time seemed to fly by and the whole idea seemed very believable and well done.SPOILER BELOW STOP HERE!!!!!!!! For the person that asked how he could be alive at the end you need to brush up on parallel universe theories. When he went back in time he went to another universe which had another Denzel in it.</fullReview>

His acting style is never over the top - and never dull - just seems to be perfect.I watched this movie again for the second time tonight in 2015. I'm more impressed this time than the first. How's that possible? Perhaps it's been a lifetime since Hollywood's produced a great Sci-Fi movie. Denzel Washington and Sci-fi?? What?? Yes, this is 100% Sci-Fi and does a damn good job. I've seen it all. I'm a trekkie, computer geek - you name it - i'm it. I know my Sci-Fi. This has a great story, great acting and a great villain. It's everything a great movie should be.Don't hesitate. Watch this immediately. Even if you're not that much of a Sci-Fi fan, this still has enough to offer to keep anybody engaged and happy all the way through. Absolutely loved it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coming off the action high, Mission: Impossible ? Ghost Protocol, I yearned to watch another action-packed new-to-me adventure. Upon a great recommendation, I watched Déj? Vu.I am a Denzel fan?but only when he's not screaming for an Oscar (such as American Gangster) and when he actually earns it (such as Training Day.) Of course, my favorite of his are the smart action pics like Man on Fire or Crimson Tide. I'm certainly adding this one to that list.With a unique twist on the time machine/look back in a place in time genre, Déj? Vu does, in fact, make one of my 2011 favorites, Source Code, a Déj? Vu. ATF agent Doug Carlin (Washington) is investigating a blown up boat that killed 100s of innocents, including children, women and service men. He's introduced to a program where one can look back exactly 4? days to aid in any investigation. Handy, eh?Well, it can do a lot more than that. It can go within any structure and recreate every bit of privacy people have. Tell me how people would react today if this were true?In either case, that's incidental to this plot? after a few lessons, Doug's got it down and races against time for a gal he actually falls for prior to the explosion and might contain valuable information to prevent the act of terrorism.It's an exciting, albeit popcorn-fare, movie and if you're a Denzel fan, you'd probably really enjoy it. Even if you're not a (Director) Tony Scott fan, like I am not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Completely unbelievable. Total B.S. Unintelligent. What a crock!I gave this piece of garbage one star because I love Bruce Greenwood and the cat manages to survive the transition of the movie (presumably). At least Ginger isn't introduced as a plot element and then never seen again, as in most half-arsed movies being produced nowadays. You see an animal and then never see it again or it is never even referred to again. When that happens, I don't watch anymore. So, they should get a point for that at least. And Bruce Greenwood. (Check out "Nowhere Man" on DVD.)If this is supposed to be science fiction, it shouldn't take place in the present. Science can't even yet perfect face recognition or artificial intelligence. Or find bin Ladin.The premise is laughable and I can't even begin to imagine how much money it took to make this ridiculous Denzel vehicle.Why Bruce Greenwood isn't the master star of Hollywood, I'll never know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Movie could have been good, but the sci-fi aspect of this movie was really bad. First it begins as a solid thriller, but soon it drifts into very bad technobabbel, which made no sense at all. This whole "looking into the past" thing really got on my nerves, even more, when there appeared a "head set" with the same technology as the really big stationary machine.Even with the generally annoying time-travel, this movie could have been better. But most of the movie lives from the effects created by this absolutely incredible technology. The story itself doesn't benefit at all from these scenes and if cut out and replaced with more interaction between the characters, the movie would have been probably shorter, more mysterious and a lot more fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deja Vu is a fantastic thrill ride that deserved more credit. We know it's far from the truth, but it's a fantastic film. I love Denzel Washington, Val Kilmer and Paula Patton. The only problem I have with it is why would this agent become so obsessed with a dead chick. Taking a view of her house on camera. I just think it's kind of weird for an A.T.F. agent. By the way, what the hell is an A.T.F. agent in the first place. The Plot: A ferry filled with arriving marines explodes, killing everyone on the Ferry. A.T.F. agent Doug Carlin is called by a secret organization to figure out who the bomber is. Also, they find a burned up body who died before the explosion. They think it's the same guy, so they look for this criminal. Agen Carlin is soon drawn to her, and realizes that he can save her life. Think along the lines of Back to the Future, but they don't use a Delorean. Deja Vu is a well thought out film. Maybe not as well throughout as Memento or as good as Memento, but Deja Vu is an awesome film. It has a great ending of course. my face lit up when I saw the ending. Deja Vu is a pleasant surprise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i saw this movie NOT expecting much to see. As i heard critics and reviews that said how this movie mostly sucked. Now, when i started watching this movie i liked the concept and the idea. Denzel is a great actor but this movie was not for him. The first thing i hated was the name of the movie. It has no connection to a "deja vu". The movie should have been name d different. Another thing i hated was that the movie sticks to one story, one idea and than, by the climax, they risk all their existence and thats why the movie lacks reality and the story that goes after the big turn of the story just seems to go downhill. Im sorry to say that such a great actor as Denzel wasted his time on such a movie. The idea was also wasted. The only thing that stayed un wasted were the rest of the cast. They were not wastable.... they sucked anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"But?.if she was saved and they didn't find her burned, mutilated body on the riverbank, how did he know to go back in time and save her, he wouldn't have gone to her apartment ?..?" "And if the guy wasn't on the bridge but went back to the ferry and got shot, then?..". "Umm, yes, but remember time is a braided river, heading ever onwards towards the ocean. Or something."These were only a sample of several similar conversations my husband and I had after watching this movie on DVD. It's a pretty good movie. Not a classic, not a great movie, and of course the whole premise is hokum, but it's pretty well written, well acted and well filmed. I would expect no less from a combination of Denzel Washington and Tony Scott. I suspect that two middle aged codgers like us, are well past the age of the target audience, hence our need to mull over the plot afterwards! Washington is a good actor who seems to be without pretense. Every film I have seen him in, he gives an honest and totally committed performance. I loved him in Inside Man, which was one of the most underrated movies of 2006 in my opinion. He was, perhaps, less successful in American Gangster, if only because he seems to play a goodie more convincingly than a baddie. In Déj? Vu, as Agent Doug Carline, he goes back in time to try to prevent a terrorist attack on a ferry boat on the Mississippi, and to catch the terrorist. In the process he falls in love with a woman he first encounters as a corpse at the beginning. The necessary technobabble was slickly done, and the special effects were good without being overdone. The supporting cast were all more than adequate, and the story had a satisfying conclusion. Not the kind of movie to win any awards, but the kind that keeps people turning up on a Friday night to fill the movie theatres. Oh yes! And the rather gratuitous shots of victim Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton) in her bra and then naked in the shower were nicely balanced by several equally gratuitous shots of Denzel without his shirt, so happiness all round. I'm a great believer in equal opportunity in sexploitation.</fullReview>

To all the people who thought this move was good, you must be easily pleased with fancy effects and no substance. The movie made no sense at all. All this trouble to save one girl.

		<fullReview>Outstanding! One of the best science fiction films I have seen in a while. This was a winner! OK, enough with the tag lines. I was just inspired after seeing this film. Denzel Washington has given his best performances since Man on Fire.The movie starts out like it is going to be a Lincolyn Rhyme police procedural. That would be OK with me as I liked Denzel in that role. But then it goes off into the space/time continuum and theoretical physicals. Hang on to your hats because this is heavy stuff. No, you really don't need to understand it to follow, but it sure is interesting.Add the usual car chase - Denzel in a hummer chasing a car on a bridge; crashing into several vehicles and sending cars flying in its narrow path - and explosions and firework and you have a thriller with a twist.Paula Patton (Idlewid, London) is definitely one to keep an eye on. Up next in a horror flick with Kiefer Sutherland.Spoiler: Jesus is the bad guy.Have to watch this one again soon!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie starts in the middle of the war on terror. A super-gangster has been able to burst one of the prestigious flagships of the army into little pieces. Over 500 killed and thousands injured. Starting in aesthetically slow motion and scenic soundtrack the movie worsens continuously . An selected AFN-guy is starting to take part in the investigation and what follows is a eclectic clash of time-travelling action-sequences and more or less predictable interventions into the path of time. The unconvincing plot wants us to believe that a time-machine could have been developed without making use of it - and that just because of a more or less disinterested government and scientists. Unnecessary violence, yelling of pseudo-exciting and pseudo-scientific rubbish as well as thrilling intimations of being burned alive, being shooten and brought to death by cars doesn't necessary lead to an good action movie - at least not when served in the context of a plot that insults the intellect of the thinking spectator. Luckily the time window of the machine isn't opened to the genocide of Rwanda or Nazi-Germany - but that's the only thing to appreciate about the setting.Will the AFN-guy be able to save the free world and experience the mysteries of love?

		<fullReview>Besides the fact I didn't think Tara would be a huge fan, this movie had plenty of ingredients to ensure a great night in. Denzel, Tony Scott, Val Kilmer, time travel.....it could not not be good.The movie begins with a ferry being blown up in a likely terrorist attack. The police are quickly on the scene, with the key figure being Carlin (Washington). Carlin hones in on a woman who was washed up and soon discovers something ain't right. Impressed by his skills, a special operations group, headed by Val Kilmer (man did his career die after "Heat"), asks him to come in and assist with their work, which includes the use of a state of the art surveillance system which can track anything...as long as it occurred 4 days ago. This technology assists Carlin is backtracking and finding key clues. Obsessed with this technology, Carlin tries to find a way he can interact in the past. I won't give away too much but he finds a way and gets into some Marty McFly-type adventures. The technology is about as plausible as the DeLorean in the "Back To The Future" franchise, and throws up as many plot concerns, but the movie keeps you enthralled.Great cast, shot excellently, interesting storyline. Well worth watching and way better than I hoped or imagined.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deja Vu is a thriller based on the familiar time travel theme. Not one time travel movie is "realistic", but some of them are more "believable" or "easier to swallow" than others.Well, this one is not one of those.No matter how convincingly good actors try to make you believe that earth is flat, not round, you still don't believe them. (That was a metaphor. Actors don't actually try to convince you of the flatness of the earth.) That is the problem with Deja Vu. The script is just way too hard to swallow.Otherwise, the movie has all the goods for a great action packed ride. If you are a 13-year-old kid or just mentally a little bit "sub-par", you can probably even forgive the stupid concept of the movie.So I didn't like the script. Also what I didn't like were the constant references to god, devil, creationism, Fox News and support for war in Irak. Makes you wonder about the financing of this movie...</fullReview>

The problem is that this thing cannot be paused to right down a number, address etc. It can not be re winded either. It is a continuous stream.They also have another machine, which allows them to place any object into the scenery they are currently viewing to try and stop the major bomb explosion on the boat.

James Caviezel is the perfect villain for the film, and it has some good twists and turns as well, plus It's quite unpredictable, as you never know what's gonna happen next. One thing that irritated me is when Claire points the gun at Denzel as that just annoyed the hell out of me for some reason, and the finale will have you on the edge of your seat, plus there is a really wicked and unique car chase scene as well. Overall an excellent thriller, that I throughly enjoyed I say it's a must see for everyone!. ****1/2 out of 5The Acting is excellent. Denzel Washington is amazing as usual, and delivers yet another top notch performance in a thriller, he is intense, and focused and also very likable, this guy is one of the best actors in Hollywood today, and can pull of any role, and he shows it here!. Paula Patton is OK here she's definitely gorgeous, but got on my nerves with her character, as she made some stupid decisions. Val Kilmer is surprisingly adequate in his role I am usually not a fan but he did alright here. James Caviezel is excellent as the villain, he was menacing in his screen time I just wish he had more of it. Adam Goldberg is very good as Denny, he brought humor and class to the film I loved him. Elden Henson is good I remembered him as Fulton from the Mighty Duck movies. Bruce Greenwood is OK in his role and always plays a good prick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great movie could've used different ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WOW! great movie, fine writing. after the first 30 minutes you THINK you're watching a detective or CSI stylish movie with federal agents simply trying to find a terrorist. after that, for about 20 minutes you THINK it's becoming some kind of 'Enemy of the State' rip-off with federal agents using satellites in combination with some high-tech software to the crazy extend of generating a live video feed of a few days ago. i was thinking 'wow, enemy of the state was crazy with their sat tech, but this is just preposterous. then, after that we finally get to know what's going on. and at that point, it doesn't even hint to reality (although it tries to proof the hypothetical possibility of this actually happening in reality, LOL) but it's OK that it's a bit unrealistic from there on, it's still great writing and keeps you curious.now for the end of the movie, you actually get the feeling that whatever Denzel is trying to do to fix the past, he just can't and everything will be as it was. all the links from the beginning to the end of the movie (ambulance in shed, blooded clothes, everything in the woman's house) seem to link so you really start to think that Denzel cannot change the past as he is already part of it. or will the writers surprise us? eventually they do... but for me, they could've made an alternative ending that actually let everything happen like it would've.apart from that, great movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a former resident of the famous Crescent City, I must admit that much of my enjoyment watching this movie came from the recognition of familiar scenes. Even some of the areas devastated by storm Katrina in 2005 were featured within the context of the story.Denzel Washington stars as agent Doug Carlin who comes in to help investigate what appears to be a terrorist attack, an explosion which sinks a Mississippi River ferry full of military on Mardi Gras leave. The story relies on a technology that doesn't exist and in fact probably should be considered impossible, warping time and space to be able to interact with the recent past.I enjoyed the movie, it held my attention and the production values are first-rate.SPOILERS FOLLOW. Jim Caviezel is antagonist Carroll Oerstadt, the disgruntled man who is responsible for the explosion. One of his victims is Paula Patton as Claire Kuchever, but her body washes onshore a few minutes before the explosion occurred. Carlin (pronounced 'car-LEEN') quickly figures out, from clues under a bridge and from security video, that the same person murdered Kuchever also sank the ferry. Fortunately a secret government project allowed them to see 4 days into the past, in real time, and are able to observe the victim's last hours and identify the killer. The big leap of faith happens when Carlin puts himself into the machine and goes back 4 days to prevent her death and the explosion. Mandatory action on the ferry near the end, shootings etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Masterpiece of Tony Scott</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tony Scott films are really amazing pieces of art!, since Top Gun, The Last Boy Scout (with Willis), Crimson Tide (with Denzel), The Fan (with De Niro), Enemy of the State (incredible movie with Smith),Spy Game (with Redford and Pitt) to Man on Fire (the best of all!). With this movie, the third of his saga starred with Denzel, i can say that Scott is definitely an auteur, a director with a special talent and with his signature on his great quality films. The fiction and police subjects of this movie are just great; Denzel, as always complement a great directing and a good script with an extraordinary and realistic acting, he shows again why is one of the best actors of the decade!. The plot of the movie is amazing; how you can use the visualizing of the past to solve crimes; it resembles in some way, the Spielberg film Minority Report, but this one is much better. The shots, the action scenes, the feeling of tension is a delight for those who like intelligent films where you have to think a lot to understand fully the story, i personally love this type of films!. Like Tony said: with Malcom X, Jesus Christ and Jim Morrison, how can this movie be bad! ABOUT THE MOVIE: This is the story of agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) who was assigned to the investigation of a Ferry bombing in New Orleans where 563 people died; in this investigation he finds a woman corpse, this woman called Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton), will surely give a lot of clues to find the responsible for this terrorist attack, when she was actually found dead and burned in the river before the explosion had even occurred. Some special agents, including Agent Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer) and Jack McCready (Bruce Greenwood) invite Carlin to use a special and new tool to find the responsible, this tool is some kind of visor that put on video the events held 4 days ago, is like viewing the past and to possibly move trough it like navigating. Denzel, impressed with this technological aid, start to use it in order to find this terrible terrorist and while doing this, he get somehow involved and touched by Claire's last moments of her life.9/10! two thumbs up for Tony Scott, and one movie to add to this incredible Scott collection of action masterpieces.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DEJA VU 2006 (DENZEL WASHINGTON, PAULA PATTON, VAL KILMER) DIRECTED BY: TONY SCOTT ~ THE RUNDOWN: Tony Scott has done nothing but sh*t since True Romance; here he further corrupts the world by burdening us with this generic and laughable cop thriller. ~ Okay, with all BS aside, this is the premise of Deja Vu: cop uses time machine to...well...go back in time and save people. And upon conception of this ground-breaking design in storytelling, as*hole Jerry Bruckheimer hands a typewriter to a down-syndrome person who just got done watching Minory Report and 12 Monkeys and tells him to get to work. He, of course, makes it explicitly clear that the raw innovation accomplished so far still needs a gimmick...anything good for the theatrical trailer. The plot is ridiculous, and is founded upon the supposed and unquestioned creation of a government-made "super machine" that, according to the movie, just kinda...happened. I tell you, though, what's even more ridiculous is that they expect you to take it seriously, cheesy music and all, and care for characters in an absurd, horribly clichéd meshing of science-fiction and cop-investigation melodrama. You can't have your cake and eat it to. And, speaking of cops, how many times now has Denzel played one? I mean, wtf, is this guy like an honorary member of the Hollywood PD? He's been the lead in like every cop thriller of the last ten years. Yes, he HAS proved himself many times and has given several amazing performances including his role as a corrupt officer in Training Day...yet, has he never heard the word versatility? You better get to work Denzel, your legacy is at stake. ~ By normal standards of film-making this is not a bad movie; it was shot impressively and the acting was good. Also, I admit, at times I found myself saying: "wow, that's actually pretty cool." However, by the time the last half hour arrived, I couldn't have cared less what was going to happen. I didn't buy into any of it from the beginning and no revelation at the end was good enough to change my mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't condemn the whole movie.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Parts of it were truly truly excellent. I'm a fan of Denzel and love his low-key approach to these meaty roles he snags. And here he doesn't disappoint. The movie had me from the beginning right up to the four-day delay relay of New Orleans. the technology was fascinating and believable and I'm a fan of good sci-fi along with anyone else.However and it is a huge however, once the movie slipped into time travel it literally blew up and totally lost me.Great trouble was taken by the director and the script writer to keep the interesting clues consistent in both the past and the present and kudos for that.But it was alarming that the major plot hole of only sending a note of warning back in time once only and then to the wrong man who gets himself killed as a result. Puh-leese. And then I kept re-working the script - in my head - to more coherence.I found the scene of the mad smashemup Hummer ride inserted strictly for the young teenage boys of the audience, it was like a video game, innocent tiny passenger cars were totalled willy-nilly with no one to ponder the carnage of bodies that would result. On to the next. The fixation of Doug (the Denzel role) on a dead woman was almost pornographic at times and reminiscent to me of "Laura". But all the knots were neatly untied in Laura.And here? The time warped Doug dies, the ferry is saved, and in true Hollow-Wood fashion the new and improved Doug sallies forth to embrace the teary heroine.Serious movie let down from a quite auspicious beginning. Almost like two movies put through a blender. Badly. 6 out of 10. A shame. There was a superb suspense thriller in there somewhere waiting to get out. Everyone ignored it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read some of the comments on here and comparisons to Terminator 2 etc. Honestly I don't see how that connection can be made when the films were not even really related. deja Vu I found was cleverly done and of course similarities to other films CAN be found but then again every film you watch can be tied to another movie in one way or another if you wish to look at it that way rather than watching the movie rather than trying to exploit it with pointless references. IF the movie had ripped another movie off then I could see this point but has there was enough originality in this movie to separate it from a "clone" movie I think nitpicking is pointless. I saw comments slating the movie one minute and then praising it the next. Personally I watched the movie and enjoyed how cleverly things were tied up and could read between the lines enough to see where the plot was going. I saw enough in the storyline for this to be original and found the cast excellent and all this gripe about all the action bits being in the trailers I don't understand has the movie came across to me has a thriller NOT an out an out action movie. Regardless of what others thought I give it a two thumbs up.</fullReview>

Interesting plot if you can overlook the fact that space-and time travel is made a bit easy in this film. Cool action scenes, especially when the present and the past is mixed in some of them, along with good acting by Washington and Kilmer is two of the movies strong points. Has always I wish they could have made a different ending that wasn't so typical Hollywood. That would have been a surprise All in all it is an 2 hour enjoyable action/science-fiction movie.</fullReview>

Tony Scott and Jerry Bruckheimer make a very good team, and will hopefully team up again in the future (or the past? lol). Denzel Washington, Val Kilmer, Paula Patton and Jim Caviezel all deliver the goods as you would expect.Pay no attention to the critics that blabber on about the movie being unrealistic and unbelievable - of course it is, it's not a documentary, it's a movie!

		<fullReview>Jerry Bruckheimer as a producer has made a lot of popcorn movies in the past... and I mean A LOT! Déj? vu definitely is one of them, however one of the best J.B. has ever brought out. In some ways its different from all the others. The storyline I think is brilliant, even though the explanation for the time travel and all the technological stuff thats being used is somewhat poor, Tony Scott still made a movie that'll make u sweat until the very last second of it. Basically, you know what happens and what has happened... and that's where Denzel comes in, going back in time when the movie actually is over, to try and save the woman he fell in love with - 4 days and 6 hours in the past. Of course you recognize Bruckheimer, especially by the quote which was already usend in The Rock: "The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants." To mention here is Jim Caviezel who is terrific as the villain.So, all in all, it is definitely a movie worth watching, even if you're not a Tony Scott or Jerry Bruckheimer fan.</fullReview>

If anyone out there finds the storyline of "a guy who needs to go back in time to prevent a bomb explosion from happening, on a boat with many people's lives possibly being lost"interesting....then this will really fascinate you! I doubt you will be disappointed. When I was watching the movie, everyone was SO quiet because they wanted to make sure they understood EVERYTHING. Unfortunately for me, I kept asking my poor sister questions and the lady in front of me freaked out. Oops.

		<shortDescription>Interesting and original, far more sci-fi than it presents itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deja Vu is more than a little misrepresented in it's trailer. I mean it is an action film by Tony Scott, it does star a host of big stars including Denzel Washington but the plot and idea is far more science fiction than it ever presents. From watching the trailers I had no idea that Deja Vu revolved around time travel. That being said Deja Vu happens to be one of the best action films of the season with an original, well connected plot, easy to follow but complex and intelligent story line and some strong performances with some small flaws to them. Tony Scott and Denzel Washington had something in common to me...I did not like either of their last films...Domino or The Inside Man so I wasn't sure if the two of them together were my mix but the strong, brilliantly written storyline drew me in. Scott filmed and captured New Orleans like few directors good and uses that setting to really make a difference in the picture and not just use New Orleans "because." Denzel Washington leads the cast as almost too brilliant ATF agent Doug Carlin. Now Washington is a brilliant actor, I have seen him in some brilliant roles but his ego has pretty much seeped into every performance he has and drags down his characters and makes them often unlikeable. Carlin can spot a clue from the ground on the bottom of a bridge in the air. He's just REALLY good at his job which is fine but Washington gives a distinct air of conceit which makes him annoying. But he still commands a certain screen presence so it works. Val Kilmer plays a supporting role, and a good one, as Agent Andrew Pryzwarra who puts together a team of his choice to investigate a brutal terrorist bombing that kills many Marines and their families on a ferry. Kilmer is great and the conceit he once carried with his characters is gone and has been gone since Batman Forever making him a decent strong actor in what he does. I would have liked to have seen more of his character in this film. James Caviezel is dark and brilliant, and downright evil as Washington's nemesis and the terrorist bomber Carroll Oerstadt. Paula Patton is also fairly good as the victim of the bomber who just needs her out of the way.Small clues are dropped randomly right from square one in the film that won't be connected or make sense until the very end of the film. Time Travel doesn't truly happen until almost 3/4 of the way through the film but still the story is being set for the future plot. Time Travel films can be very difficult making sure things match up and dealing with time paradoxes and the likes but Deja Vu does a very good job keeping tabs on the details. Throw in a few very thrilling car chases and an even more thrilling murder mystery and it makes for one of those must see movies that come out every once in awhile. Deja Vu is a strong action, intense thriller and well worth your theater money, or rental when times comes. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A New Orleans ATF agent (Denzel Washington) tries to literally go back four days in time to save a beautiful woman (Paula Patton) and over 500 others who died due to a terrorist bombing in "Deja Vu", an unintentionally stupid and wasteful action thriller from director Tony Scott. Basic high-priced junk that throws in crazed science-fiction that only eggheads will care about or even try to understand. The film starts promising enough, but dies by its second hour with more outlandish and far-fetched elements that just do not add up at the end of the day. Val Kilmer does what he can, but is not utilized enough here and James Caviezel is totally out of place as our antagonist. Denzel must be congratulated for attempting to take the whole project seriously, but his choice to be in this production is one of life's major mysteries. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deja Vu is this kind of movies that starts really well, that raises high expectations and that unfortunately can't seem to meet them.First the good points. The cinematography is really good. Tony Scott proves once more that he is really good when it comes to images. The soundtrack is not unforgettable but not unpleasant and fits quite well with the atmosphere. The cast is pretty good too, Denzel Washington gives once more a pretty good performance, and Paula Patton manages to catch the attention without saying much. Actually, the biggest strength of this movie in my opinion is the plot. And unfortunately it's also it's biggest weakness.The first 3/4 of the movie are really captivating. We can see a policeman (Washington)trying to find a terrorist who is responsible for the explosion of a ferry and the death of more than 500 people. The inquiry is marked by the discovery of the corpse of a woman (Patton) near the scene of the crime but who apparently died before the explosion. Washington is then contacted by a special team who offer him to study the case with a brand new technology that allows them to see in the past. As time goes, we can the case being solved step by step, parts of the story being solved while some still remain a mystery, and we can see Washington being more and more emotionally involved as he discovers he can interact with the past and yet can't save the people in the ferry or the girl with whom he has obviously fallen in love. Everything from the cast to the image serve well this story, managing to keep the suspense needed to catch the audience attention, even when the bad guy is caught and gives us a most intriguing speech. But after that everything falls apart.Till then we had an original idea, with an almost plausible story, with a good suspense and a lots of questions unanswered, which could have been one of the most original movies of the year if it had finished as it started. But it seems there has been too much originality at the beginning and thus it has been required to give it an ordinary Hollywood ending. Tortured by the fact he can't save anyone while he can see them live in the past, Washington decides to go in the past and manage to do it (we will ignore the fact that sending a piece of paper in the past has nearly been a failure but sending a human being doesn't seem to be much of a problem). He save the girls life and the passenger of the ferry's one, killing the bad guy in between of course. Meanwhile all the question we might have had in during the first part are answered and the ending isn't even an open one. No plot twists, no surprise, nothing... Not to mention that this last part is way too long in my opinion, we still expect something surprising to happen, just to be even more disappointed in the end. I mean, what a waste...Overall this remains a pleasant movie, especially thanks to the first part and the technical realization. Yet, I can't feel anything but disappointment after seeing this movie, this could have been so much better...</fullReview>

Makes you wonder just how much of the government technology used in the movie is based on reality and how much is science fiction. I have seen it twice. I may even see it a third time. I rarely feel that strongly about a movie. I overheard a man walking out of the movie saying. "I am really confused." This is a thought provoking movie that woke me in the night thinking about it. Parallel universes, time lines, is it possible to undo horrible atrocities that have been committed - to change the past? Amazing mind candy! What the Bleep do we know anyway? Very little, as quantum physics is showing us. It may not a movie for people who are happy living on the surface of reality, people who aren't interested in questioning it. Oh, and it is a love movie also. The acting is superb. Denzel Washington and Paula Patton, and all the others, play their roles to perfection.

They also got the casting right for the part of Claire - Paula Patton, evoking the feral quality of Halle Berry, is genuinely captivating; one can easily see how Washington's character Doug could fall in love with her while watching the wormhole footage. Jim Caviezel is also hugely effective as the patriot-gone-awry - his character is three-dimensional, not merely a plot device. Val Kilmer comes off good here too, a solid performance. All in all, an exceptionally decent, thought-provoking thriller.</fullReview>

Perhaps, Denzel with his usual flair.But if anything,what this movie actually does is to bring forth an explanation about time space... and actually telling the audience this is what we think about time space...the theory of time space is tediously complex,near if not absolutely random, and perhaps may never be proved by science.The movie claims that only did we discovered the definitive theory of time space, but that humans can actually exploit it.This group of law enforcers had in fact meddled with the fabric of existence itself, messing with reality as we know it..earth,the sun, birds,flowers,matter,antimatter,heaven,hell etc.Don't get me wrong.The characters were decently written, and the movie tries to paint the scenario of would man do if he had stumbled upon a larger than life scientific discovery .One tries to play God( note the disaster when we discovered the atomic source of energy)Not his fault though, they've played God from the moment they developed the time travel technology. good actions scenes though. just don't expect it to make sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to go see this movie because of Denzel Washington. He's a great actor and smart guy. He usually chooses his starring roles carefully, so, my expectations were high. I was riveted by story and cinematography finesse UNTIL Doug Carlin (Denzel) decided to go back in time to "get the girl". From there on, it was a little too corny for me. The ending could've saved the story IF Carlin didn't "come back to life". If he would have "stayed dead", the beautiful sub-theme of sacrifice and patriotism would have been better expressed. Overall, the action was great and camera-work splendid. I enjoyed the movie, but I don't think I'll be buying the DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aw Man, Tony Scott's Toning Down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As opposed to the growing ambition, heart-stoppingly violent tension, and grandiosity in what Tony Scott's been leading up to with his past two movies, Man On Fire and Domino, is deflated with Deja Vu. Deja Vu is just another action thriller about a cop and a bad guy, an interesting twist and an "unexpected" love interest, corny comic relief tech teams and a PG-13 rating. I wanted more out of it, because ever since the final credits started rolling for Domino, I was expecting Tony Scott's next film to be next to the biggest rush of grunge, sleaze, eye-candy film-making, and music video editing I would ever get from a movie. I'm sure that somewhere deep down I felt that his next movie would have to be a lighter, almost cute actioner, because it's very difficult not to be stabbed with angry words from a studio exec who just flushed millions of dollars on a flop that read 17 or 18% fresh on the Tomatometer, not to mention the amount of cockiness and filmmakers' rebellion that was so aggressively lunged into Domino, a sort-of-biographyish action extravaganza that featured two stars of Beverly Hills 90210 playing themselves as they get their noses broken and later find themselves screaming as they happen to be there when a crazed Mexican is ripping a man's arm off with Tom Jones's cover of Mama Told Me Not To Come blaring over the soundtrack.Nonetheless, Deja Vu is a good, neat little thriller, even if it doesn't pack a punch or feel as twisted and comfortably numbing as Domino, Man On Fire, True Romance, or even Scott's earlier work like The Hunger and The Last Boy Scout. Deja vu might explain the all-too- familiar characters or the never-ending cycle of love interests that just has to lay its turf in every adventure film, action fans will have a decent time with it, thriller fans will love it, and Denzel fans will be making noise in the theater and aggravating the daylights out of the rest of the audience as usual.Washington, who has played this very same down-to-earth yet abruptly raging cop as many times as Willis has played his tough cop, Eddie Murphy has played his wisecracking cop, and De Niro has played his cocky, boisterous tough guy. This is one of the hints that this is just another action movie, because the star playing the tiring staple role for millions of dollars is a key element in most. Who should've gotten more screen time was constantly inflating but never too routine or drudging Val Kilmer. In a film full of actors with not quite enough charm to carry their corn-stuffed formula roles, I would've much preferred him as the hero. With the exception of Jim Caviezel, taking a huge turn as the ruthless, murder-driven villain from famously playing the most kind and decent man in the world in The Thin Red Line and taking the next step to Jesus Christ in The Passion of the Christ, the rest of the cast is just, well, there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Denzel Washington is a favorite of mine. He is selective about what projects he takes on, and does pretty good at making a good movie.I liked the people part of this movie a lot. The emotional attachment Denzel develops for the first victim becomes a romantic interest, with time. I found this progression and conduct both human and engaging.The science is OK, I guess, one of many theories of the universe, but told in a way that seems almost like an inside joke. Only those that have had better introductions will recognize the theory.I found the rapid camera angle change effects distracting and annoying. This stuff might be the current 'technical marvel', but it sure spins my stomach. Nearly literally. And I didn't see that these sequences contributed a blamed thing to the story being told. The smooth angle transitions, similar to the viewfinder sequences in 'Erased' (with Arnold Schwarzenegger), worked nicely. The frame-jump stuff was sophomoric and distracting. I will be glad when the FX guys that like this stuff retire.Deja Vu shows us some heroic acts, some people that are dedicated to their work and kind and responsible with people. People that we want to know better, and that are just like people we already know and love. This is a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Movie!!! This is the one to spend your money on!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the mysterious and crime scene investigations, but this movie paints the picture of the heartfelt agent who wants to do more than just clean up after a murder. It is full of mystery and thrill, it makes you think what if and no way! Mainly this movie is just the type of movie that gets you away from everyday reality and puts you in a situation where you have to think that the impossible could actually be possible! This movie was outstanding in every aspect.It has something for everyone the romantic, the thrill seeker, the action adventurer or even the mystery that is desired by everyone. The actors/actresses fit their characters making this movie full of chemistry. Denzel Washington is always a great performer so there is no surprise there but this movie had a little bit of all of his character in it. It showed his humor, sarcasm,compassion,and basically it was just an all around great movie! In my eyes it is movie of the year.I have not found a movie that Denzel did not make you feel like you were right there, but in this movie you felt like you knew the people and you wanted to change the same things that he wanted to change. Whatever your seeking you can be thrilled and satisfied with this outstanding movie. Watch it! It is worth every penny and every second of your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though Denzil Washinton is a great actor - and gives another stellar performance in this new one- this movie is lacks creativity. Despite the innovative sci-fi themes which are pursued, they are not new and are merely twists on old ploys and themes from the sci-fi genre.Without a doubt,this movie ECHOs of the recent PK Dick written "Minority Report" (Tom Cruise/Steven Spielberg) synthesized into one movie with Denzil's own previous "Man on Fire". While Denzil, Val Kilmer, and the other actors shine as performers, there is little doubt that this effort is merely a high action drama intended to generate revenue rather than to dazzle viewers in artistic effort.This movie is nice cheap entertainment intended to capture the holiday crowd in the malls, and is definitely not intended to be an award winner!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but Nothing New</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes a good movie can be more frustrating than a bad one and that is the case in "Deja Vu." The problem is that the description of the movie on IMDb tells you it involves time travel and the trailer shows Denzel Washington with the murder victim, so you know it is going to happen. But this part of the film comes in the last 30 minutes."Deja Vu" is a good movie but with a little editing and a little reworking of script, it could have been a great one.Tony Scott has toned down his directing style a bit from "Man on Fire" and "Domino," but it is still a nice looking film.I had never seen Paula Patton before and she is really good, but she is hardly in the movie. I wish they had made her role bigger. Denzel Washington is good, as always. Val Kilmer really needs to go on a diet. He gets fatter in every film.The music was okay, but the film would have benefited from a better score."Deja Vu" is almost a great science fiction movie. It involves time travel and you have to suspend belief. If you like good action film that requires a decent amount of thinking, you might want to see "Deja Vu."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is Time Fluid or Fixed? This Movie Says, "Yes!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the kind of movie you enjoy seeing for the $10.00 multiplex experience: munching your popcorn watching capable actors in a puzzling, thrilling, well photographed action movie, with tasteful use of music, interesting and engaging characters with dialog and themes that appeal to your intelligence. Even scientific discussions of folding space and parallel time streams. But---- the ending may leave you either disappointed or perhaps pleased with its "Hollywoodness." On the one hand, it tells you that going back and changing the past is no big deal, since you're just creating a new time stream to replace the one you just left ('Back to the Future: I' handles this idea the best). This seems to be the point of view that Agent Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer-- having nicely put on weight to star in "Mickey Rooney: The Senior Years") abruptly and mysteriously adopts when he tells Denny "Be sure to lock up when you're finished," to send Carlin (Denzel Washington) back to change the past, despite the science nerds having argued earlier against interfering with it. We can now guess the movie will change into 'TimeCop.' This kills the movie right there-- now the whole story, criminal investigation itself, and the characters' prior motivations, have no meaning since changing the past is now just a matter of routine. On the other hand, it tells you that you can't change the past because events are predestined and will wind up the same some how no matter how you interfere. 'Retroactive' nails this theme well as does the fantastic '12 Monkeys'. This seemed to be the way the movie was supposedly going. After Carlin takes Claire (Paula Patton) back to her apartment to clean up, and notices that all the evidence of the crime scene is present (even though he had caused it to be there) he says something like "Nothing has changed." In the same way that he was unable to prevent the different death of his partner, we expect that Claire will be killed (by the ship's propeller this time) and that the bombing will still occur. But no-- she survives, the bomb misses the boat, and the current-time Carlin (though the time traveling Carlin has died) meets her on the dock, and they drive off happily to the Beach Boys singing, "Don't worry baby, everything will turn out all right." Seems like arbitrarily switching to the obligatory Hollywood happy ending, or is it just a new time stream? You decide if you would have preferred fatalism over free will.(Note: The super-patriot 'mad bomber' was much better done by Ed Harris as Brigadier General Francix X. Hummel in the 1996 film 'The Rock.' Carlin even uses the same quote about the "Tree of Liberty.")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Time-Travel Film EVER ! ! ! ! ! !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denzel Washington and director Tony Scott ( both collaborators on the hits, "Man on Fire" and "Crimson Tide" ) team up for the third time on this brilliant film that mixes philosophy, dram and action along with brain-twisting physics. The plot: A New Orleans ferry is destroyed by a terrorist bomb set by an mysterious figure. Detectives trying to solve the shocking devastation are introduced to a special crime solving machine used to reenact murders and other situations after they have occurred. It turns out that one murdered woman, who's been missing, might be the key to solving the entire crime. Can this entire puzzle be cracked? Can they go back in time before the entire scenario even occurred and change all of this from even happening?Review: Everything in this film is excellent. The actors ( Washington, Val Kilmer, Adam Goldberg, Bruce Greenwood and James Caviezel ) are all in top form and fans of them will be pleased; the special effects are used to tell the story instead of being just "gratuitous eye candy;" Terrio Rossio ( writer of The Mask of Zorro, Shrek, Pirates of the Caribbean, and other similar Dreamworks/Disney/Bruckheimer fare) and Bill Marsili's script is full of imagination and ideas even worth discussing after the film; Tony Scott works beautifully with what content he hes; while I'm not a huge fan, I will think Jerry Bruckheimer for financing this thrilling adventure; and, last of all, the musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams is a blast! This guy has written electronic/instrumental musical scores for both Tony and Ridley Scott's films, as well as animated ones and video-games, and has never disappointed his audiences. This might be more of a 8/10, but seeming how I throughly enjoyed every minute and want to own this DVD so bad, I'm going to rate it the total amount! See now !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ATF Agent Doug Carlin (Two Time Oscar-Winner:Denzel Washington) is investigating the bombing of a ferry boat that killed over five-hundred people. Doug finds out that one of the victims (Paula Patton) didn't died from the bombing. His partner's (Matt Craven) car from found in the ferry and he's missing. Then an mysterious government agent (Val Kilmer) takes Doug to a top secret government lab that uses a time-shifting surveillance device to help from prevent time. Doug thinks that the best thing from preventing this crime is looking back on the woman from a couple of days before her murder happened. Doug finds out that they could sent something back in the past. Which it's possible for the high-tech device but they are not certain if a person being could return back to the past. They find the terrorist (Jim Caviezel), who did it. Once he was a ex-marine, who never got his respect from his country and he's a raving psychopath as well. Doug thinks it's possible to return to the past to save the woman, he falls in love with this woman and as well for stopping the bomb before it's too late.Directed by Tony Scott (Crimson Tide, Domino, Man on Fire "2004") made an interesting suspense/thriller that has elements of romance and science-fiction that mixes quite well. This movie has some fascinating ideas. Washington as usual gives an excellent performance in this. Caviezel offers an change of pace role in this and it is also the first time, he plays a bad guy. The film has good roles for the supporting cast like Bruce Greenwood, Adam Goldberg, Elden Henson and Erika Alexander. But the film went on to be an box office disappointing in the U.S. (It did quite well in Overseas) and it is Scott's first PG-13 since "Days of Thunder".DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has "The Surveillance Window", which it could bring back in time from the movie by watching the behind the scenes footage. Which it's option by watching the movie or u could watch it separately from the movie. DVD also has Deleted Scenes and Extended Scenes with optional commentary by the director. Which there's no commentary track from the movie for some reason. There's rumours that Scott might release an Unrated Version of the picture in the near future. This thriller is well made, it's entertaining but it's goes on longer than it should. Some viewers might find this confusing or predictable but It's pretty good solid entertainment. Don't miss it. Written by Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio (Aladdin, Shrek, Small Soldiers). Super 35. (*** ?/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nineties man trapped in self-contradicting time travel film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When making a time travel action film you have a choice to make. Is it going to be daft but entertaining fun (eg Timecop) or is it going to be an intellectual science fiction film that pursues deep philosophical points about determinism and free will (eg 12 Monkeys)? If you take the first path, then you can pretty much mess around with time-lines and ignore contradictions and paradoxes - time travel is simply a plot device. If you follow the second path, then you really have to make sure the plot is tight and there are no mistakes.Unfortunately, Tony Scott and Jerry Bruckheimer go for the latter but only have the ability to produce the former. The result is a film that on the surface seems intelligent, but as the story progresses fills the intelligent viewer with a growing sense of things not making sense until all suspension of disbelief is lost. The messages are confused: the philosophical stance of the film is to suggest that dictatorial spoilsport science tells us that there is no such thing as free will. Fortunately, so the film tells us, having faith and believing in God means that free will actually can exist. Washington believes he can change the future and so he finds he can... however, in a strange contradiction to this, the film produces the branching time-line theory to explain how time travel allows us to change the present in a way that is consistent with a deterministic view of the universe! Does society need faith to choose its own future? Or is it just that we're all following the wrong theory of how time works? The film is inconclusive - and not deliberately (which could work!), but because the screenplay writer(s) obviously didn't see the contradiction.Ironically, this reveals much about mainstream US cultural attitudes to science and spirituality. So, the bad guy in the film believes that everything in the future is already decided. Then the 'dogmatic' scientist overcomes his disbelief in the possibility of altering the present because he believes in God. However, the pretty black female scientist (ie, non-conformist who we should identify with because she is not trapped by the scientific atheist conspiracy) presents a clear physics reason why all this is perfectly explainable through normal cause and effect. The film justifies this blatant contradiction by implying that the theory she suggests is outside the mainstream of science. This is a common attitude, especially in the US (where the citizen believes they have an absolute right to believe what they want irrespective of reason or evidence) - the desire to keep life mysterious (and so allow the belief in God or ghosts or whatever) crashes up against the need for an explanation of everything in the context of a technologically advanced society and creates this strange kind of 'non-conventional science' which both explains everything yet allows the individual to maintain his or her unscientific spiritual beliefs. Intelligent Design and Scientology are prime examples of this kind of non-conventional 'science'. The non-conventional science suggested here is clearly not well understood, because it doesn't require the existence of free will to allow the changing of the present.There is also one really big error - BIG SPOILER ALERT - and that is with all the stuff that happens in the woman's flat when Washington jumps back in time. When examining the woman's apartment before Washington jumps back, his forensics pal says that Washington's fingerprints are everywhere. However, this is not possible in the branching theory of time travel. The version of time that Washington observes through the high-tech surveillance system is the original branch of time (where the terrorist blows up the boat). The problem is that everything that happens as a result of his time travel is in the NEW branch of time. In the old branch Washington has no effect on the events leading up to the terrorist attack (we know this because the attack is successful) yet we are told that his fingerprints are in the apartment and we can work out that the woman calls his office. This is stuff that can only have happened in the NEW branch of time - otherwise the explosion would not have happened in the original time-line and the whole story could never have happened. In other words, the screenplay uses the tricks of a time travel story to illicit surprise and spine tingling moments of realisation but fails to be self-consistent. Despite this, the film could still have worked as a good action flick. I've enjoyed plenty of preposterous action movies that have a dynamic driving pace and interesting characters. However, Scott's style is now outdated - a decade ago he could get away with laying the emotion on so thickly because the action was so BIG. Things have changed now. In the age of ultra-fast action and ultra-realistic fight scenes, Scott's directing lacks bite and drive and in places feels quite pedestrian. Compared to Casino Royal, which also has a rubbish story, watching this film sometimes feels like wading through a river of syrup. Add to this the over-emoting of Washington and it is hard to care for the characters. Modern action heroes are hard-edged and cold, only displaying emotion in moments of weakness. Scott's hero is very much a 'new man' of the nineties and so is passé.So, the film pretty much fails to succeed on all levels. It feels like it should be a an exciting movie, but it isn't. It feels like it has something to say, but it doesn't. The film isn't really bad in any way, it just isn't good in any way either. It is clear from the film that Scott can direct - he just needs to move into the twenty-first century and stay away from the intellectual stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this movie - lots of great time-slip foreshadowing and well-thought "time machine" twists. It is very difficult to impress me with a time twist anymore - and this one was a lot of fun to watch. Denzel is also a lot of fun as a plainspoken ATF agent amidst what initially appear to be stuffy techs who don't really know how to apply their amazing technology. In the end I think most everyone will really like this ride and find a surprise around every corner - I won't write any spoilers - but if you really like time-travel or techno thrillers, this one's for you.And by the way - pay closer attention to the first time you watch it - then watch it again. There are just tons of little twists that you'll pass over when you first watch the movie - and watching it a second time is a blast because they all come rushing at you. I think the directors intended this considering the theme of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man, what the hell were they thinking? This movie had the potential to be a smart SciFi/action flick. I was willing to look past the whole looking back in time aspect of the movie, because the predestination paradox problem was so well written. Then there was that terrible ending, and the movie lost any little credibility it had. Not only does the ending contradict the predestination paradox, but also the science that the movie is built on. Were we supposed to believe that there was some kind of divine intervention, or was the end changed so the movie could be dedicated to the victims/survivors(?) of hurricane Katrina? I mean, how can you travel back in time to stop a ship from exploding, if it never exploded in the first place?All the performances were good,with the best coming from Adam Goldberg, as the typical computer nerd. Val Kilmer looked fat and old. Denzel Washington was solid, but we had seen it all before. Why would he except another cop role? Tont Scott did a brilliant job directing, but this has to be one of his worst.Don't bother watching it, you would be wasting your time.Perhaps they should of done their homework and studied Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban(book &amp; movie), before making this garbage.3 stars for the performances, directing and cinematography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Viewable, if...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fast-paced thriller, very, very viewable if one is prepared to overlook the time-travel-cum-quantum-physics questions that inevitably arise as the plot unfolds. The problem with this theme is that the storyteller invariably has to deal with the type of realism that the audience comes to expect, not that there ever was a time travel story that ever satisfied an audience's taste for realism.This time, instead of an out-and-out take on time travel, the writers merged this worn-out concept with that of quantum physics' multi-verse. Not with great success because one asks the question how would altering the past affect the other branches of the time-space continuum. And so forth...The ending was somewhat lame in that it failed to answer this question to satisfaction. However Denzel's acting was superb, so was his role. The pacing was electric and the story, while dealing with a complicated premise, was surprisingly not very difficult to follow.Very viewable indeed...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid All Around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ATF Agent Doug Carlin (Washington) gets called in by a secret government agency to help out in the bombing of a ferry boat with 500+ passengers aboard in New Orleans.There is something to be said about a Denzel Washington movie: it never disappoints.When you watch a movie you want the beginning of it to really capture your attention and this one does that. Fantastic scenes is all I can say. Kind of unbelievable too. The secret gov't agency Task Force Leader, Pryzwarra, (Kilmer) has some new toys to help catch criminals and it involves time-shifting technology that allows looking 4-days into the past into any area via the use of triangulations of digital satellite imagery. That's as far as I am going to go with that technology as it does become complicated, but extremely interesting to watch. This is a thriller of the highest order, and there is no way you will figure out the twist at the end.Performances all around are outstanding. And, yes, Paula Patton does indeed resemble Halle Berry, who is now the standard for beautiful black actresses. The cinematography is also outstanding, and the dialogue is believable. You know, I have this feeling that I wrote this review before??Hmmmm????..

		<shortDescription>exciting and intriguing but too implausible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Intellectually stimulating, although when watching it had the sensation "I've already seen it before". Action wise "Deja Vu" is an average thriller but Tony Scott's energy along with Denzel Washington's excellent performance turn it into something more. There are some plot inconsistencies as well as some violence disturbing scenes but this science fiction movie - that's surely the genre it belongs to though it's not been touted that way - is smart and enjoyable. Jim Caviezel is really surprising as the mad bomber and that's another interesting point. So I could say the film is preposterous but never dull, engaging and surprising.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deja Vu is one of Tony Scott's best films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can quote me on that if you'd like. Seriously though, normally I don't write reviews on here. It's kind of a pain in the rear since you have to write a specific amount, etc. But the other reviews of this movie all sounded like they might be studio plants (the movie studios have been known to fabricate reviews of their movies on IMDb in order to make their movie look better), so I decided to take the time to write my own review of Deja Vu to encourage people to go see it.In my opinion, Tony Scott either makes really bad, or really good, movies. Domino looked like a steaming turd right out of the gate. Enemy of the State was pretty entertaining. Deja Vu is much more like Enemy of the State than Domino. It's razor sharp, extremely tense, and very well executed. If you like what you see in the previews of Deja Vu you're almost certain to love the movie. At least, that was my experience. I thought the previews looked pretty cool, but, with such a tricky premise, I figured there was almost NO WAY that a major Hollywood studio could do it justice. Hollywood screws up a lot more simpler movies than Deja Vu.Anyway, I digress. Deja Vu is one of those rare movies with a lot going on that actually pulls it off. Be warned, this is a thriller with the potential to seriously confuse the snot out of you, so bring your thinking cap. I loved Deja Vu and I'm betting you will too...assuming you like 1)thrillers, and 2)thinking movies. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A race against time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A race against time." That would have made a good, if pretty cheesy, tagline for this Tony Scott helmed Denzel Washington sci-fi actioner. This film is pure Scott--whiplash editing, a constantly moving camera, a grainy, color-saturated presentation. The film tells the story of ATF agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) who stumbles onto an improbable murder in the wake of a terrorist bombing. (Denzel Washington turns in an accomplished performance.) Carlin soon discovers that if he solves the murder, he'll also figure out who's behind the bombing. This discovery and his display of sleuthing acumen gains the attention of the FBI who enlist him in a top secret surveillance program. Through cutting and pasting satellite photography, the FBI is able to create a composite 360 degree surveillance video at a location four days in the past.Like Scott's "Enemy of the State," this film features an interesting cast of nerdy techies including Cousin Pam from "The Cosby Show" (Erika Alexander), Elden Henson ("Freak the Mighty"), the welcome return of Adam Goldberg ("Saving Private Ryan"), and a very healthy-looking Val Kilmer. This crew guides Agent Carlin, and us, through the ins and outs of retro surveillance and quantum physics.The first two-thirds of the film is an interesting detective story which Scott lets us play along with. We get to spot the clues and take an active role in putting together all the pieces. This is some sure-handed direction which lets you participate in the story and expertly keeps your attention. The first two-thirds of the film also has some fun with the problem of interfering in the past. Are you dooming your own future? Is the present inevitable? This all gets scrapped in the movie's final third when the film becomes a pretty straightforward action thriller. That's a shame, but the movie still manages to be pretty fun and gripping. Some critics have complained that the movie is implausible--well duh. Penguins don't sing either and there's no galaxy far, far away waging a magical civil war. This is a sci-fi story--fantasy propelled by some fantastical feats of science.This is an entertaining film worth checking out</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love movies that make me think. If you like to play around the concept of time, the universe as a bendable blanket, then you will be fascinated by this movie. Really interesting concept.Denzel Washington is best at playing the character as a cop or detective of some sort. He basically traces all the evidences to figure out that there is a way to go back in time to save all the victims. The movie is intense. It keeps you thinking and wondering what on earth is going on. There were a lot of clues given as well throughout the movie. You need to see the movie to understand how intriguing it is. If you have seen movies such as "Frequency" and liked them, then I think you will like this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes you watch a movie and couldn't give a monkey's what happens to the characters.That is how I felt about this movie.It started out pretty promisingly but lost itself up it's own rear end by trying to be way too clever,so much so that it ended up bugging me.It isn't all bad.The acting is pretty solid with Denzel Washington,Val Kilmer and Jim Caviezel all giving good performances.The action scenes are decent and well staged.Then the film tries so hard to be smart,so much so in fact that it quickly becomes a pain as it shows us just how intelligent the film makers are.Hey look everybody!Denzel isn't really dead after all,he saved the passengers of the ship and also the girl that was found dead at the beginning.BIG DEAL!!!!!!!!I will not watch this movie again for the sole reason that when a film tries so very hard to make you think,you just end up wishing you had done the washing up instead.'Donnie Darko' was a cracking film that really did make you think as it sucked you into Donnie's world.'Deja Vu' is about as subtle as a sledgehammer and I won't be suffering from Deja Vu with this movie as it is an experience that will definitely NOT happen again,at least as far as I'm concerned.</fullReview>

You feel like the actors are making fun of you. The actors are so bad. They do not believe at all in what they're doing. The story is so unrealistic that you'll start laughing. I can't believe that an actor as good as Denzel Washington accepted to play in that kind of movie. I can even say that it's one of the worst movie of all time. DO NOT RENT THAT MOVIE AT ANY COST. I really hope that Denzel Washington will be more caution in the future when choosing a movie to play in.</fullReview>

Surrelistic plot, to the extent that you cannot avoid smiling and think: This is really too much! Abundance of elements which have already been: the brave courageous and stubborn police-man, the stunningly beautiful and unlucky young woman, the crazy maniac threatening the American security, last...but not least...a love story!

		<fullReview>You see the name Denzel Washington, you know you're going to get a well-acted lead character. You see the name Jerry Bruckheimer, you know you're going to get a boatload of action. You see the name Tony Scott, you know you're going to get one hell of a story.With this recipe, Deja Vu delivered as promised. A taut, tense thriller that I couldn't take my eyes off for a second. Intelligent, visceral, practically vibrating with tension, this film starts with a bang (pun intended) and ends with, ironically the very same bang! In between, you get a well-written story, full of crisp dialogue and plenty of humor, balanced equally with a full measure of action. (NOTE: This movie contains one of the most UNIQUE chase scenes of all time.) We don't know how it will end, as the age-old question rears its head: can one change the past? One of the best movies of the year. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The premise is well known by now. Denzel Washington is approached by FBI agents with neat new gadgetry that records events from space in Google Earth Maximus so that he can solve a terrorist bombing. Then they reluctantly admit they actually can bend time and see into the past, but only for 4 days worth and it can't be Tivo'd.Agent Denzel works for the ATF, but as this is a Bruckheimer vehicle we all know what that means. All Bruckheimer heroes get to do everybody else's job without OJT. The FBI takes a back seat. The Police take a back seat. Homeland Security lets agent Denzel run the show! All Bruckheimer vehicles exist in a scrunched World. The Press cease to exist. Lawyers are almost always non existent. When agent Denzel almost certainly kills off a few unlucky commuters in his zeal to follow the baddie, no Police ever show up to inquire whether said zeal has compromised the purpose of chasing down baddies!***********SPOILER******************* Denzel usually chooses his vehicles well. This time not so much! The movie works fairly well until Denzel, as we know he must, goes back in time. To stop the carnage of 500+ plus people from dying? Well yes but really, No! To rescue a damsel in distress. A very cute DID to be sure, but still our hero takes an hour and a half of his allotted 2 hours to rescue her, take her home, let her bandage him up, and most ridiculously to take time to make sure that the the things in her house are not rearranged (because as we all know if you go back in time, you can't rearrange anything). This proves ridiculous because he's already rescued DID from being killed by baddie again! Suffice it to say this movie has plot holes you can fly a 747 through, but it might not have mattered if the writers had decided to cut out the whole traveling back in time to rescue DID, and had instead treated us to the much more interesting initial story line story of sending a clue back to the past so that they could have followed the clue to stop the crimes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This could have been a great Sci-Fi thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately could have been a great movie but this thriller wasted too much time on inconsequential facts, most of the movie focused on these little pieces of drivel which in the end did not even matter for example when Denzel Washington was shot in the shoulder and Paula Patton was cleaning his wounds she thru the gauze in the trash can. They focused on this twice once when Washington first went to her home and second when he wash shot and Patton cleaned his wounds. Script writers made sure to focus on such trivial things all through ought the movie. The ending did not seem to match since much of the movie tends to suggest that you can't change the past. If you did not see this film please don't waste your time! The ending would have been great if in the end nothing changed but that is just my opinion.Sorry to say this but true Si-Fi thriller fans should see this crap for what it is, the script is week like watered down coffee and goes from bad to worse. I noticed a lot of "rave reviews" I feel sorry for the reviewers they don't know poor films when they view them their was just no; and I mean no continuity in the plot line, which was littered with to many Swiss cheese holes. I hate to be harsh but the film seemed to suggest on thing and deliver something totally different. The scenes where he was hit by a semi and survived was just bull and of course we have the total disregard for the safety of the drivers when Washington was playing chicken, following the terrorists; bull, just pure bull. What about all the loose ends which are never addressed such as the ambulance winding up on the barge, and the terrorists with his flack jacket and many guns. Well anyway I would not see if again if I could go back in time, there was no "DeJavu" about this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a thriller as much as an action-flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I walked into the cinema last night I didn't have great expectations. Tony Scott isn't my type of director. My personal opinion is that he is very overrated even though he isn't very well known. "Enemy of the state", "Man on fire" and "Spygame" isn't really great work in the art of directing. "Top gun" is an amusement to my parents that grew up in that generation, but I don't really care for it. Secondly. A Jerry Brockheimer production. I'm not a fan of mass produced expensive movies that are made to make money. Now I'll stop throwing my opinions on Scott and Bruckheimer at you. But my point remains standing. I didn't have great expectations on this movie.******************SPOILER*************** Anyway. I sat down in my chair thinking I was going to see a thriller. The first few minutes went fast (I noticed that Jerry Bruckheimers name appeared three times (on separate locations) in the first three minutes of the film. His Logo, "A J. Bruckheimer production" and "Produced by J. Bruckheimer". The man obviously loves to be known for his great producing skills.) and it seems like it's going to be a nice movie. I thought I had judged the movie to fast. Then the ship explodes in a rather expensive computer-animated explosion. I can't say anything else then that the explosion is very entangling.(Bonus to Scott if he's the one that picked the Beach Boys song on the radio) OK. let me just say that the first 1/3 of the movie is kind of thriller-like. But the last 2/3 is action. No thriller there at all. I think that the average length of all the clips in this movie was about 2 seconds. The movie's pace unbelievably rapid. Which is good...If the story is thin and you need a lot of action, bullets and explosions to compensate. There where a car-chase, a number of bullet festivals and a good ol' crashing into the house with an ambulance stunt. The music could be described simply as "random post-2000 action-flick beat". It was far to loud, annoying and I think they actually just had one bar that they looped over and over and over again. Don't listen to anyone that says the story doesn't have any holes in it. The story is one of the least through out creations I have crossed paths with. If you have another opinion on this. Please start a thread on the movie's message-board and we'll discuss it there. There's simply not enough space here to do that. Very strange when he lights a laser-pen on a screen and then the whole town gets power failure. If the screen is actually a portal. Then why doesn't he just jump though it? If the portal only can transport light, the girl should have been able to see them in the control room. Right? One thing that I found very strange was that you (atleast in the Swedish version) never heard the word Deja vu once. The movies had nothing to do with this phenomenon at all. Very strange. Maybe the original script had more scenes where this was discussed and someone cut them out.*Cough* Producer *Cough*. I sure hope so because it really left me hanging when the movie was over. It felt like they never got to the point. One more thing. You never got to know why the bad guy was bad. You never got to know anything about him. This is something that I found so annoying that I decided to post this comment in the first place... Why did he even blow up the ship in the first place? It makes no sense because we never got to know him or his intentions!Conclusion: If you like action-flicks: See Deja vu. It's a nonstop action-movie that has some, but not to much, clever twists and turns. If you like thrillers: Don't expect to much. If you like good movies: Don't expect to much. If you want to spend two hours of you life and never get them back: See the movie. It will entertain you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It really isn't deja vu all over again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Deja Vu" is surely the most ironic title of one of the best movies of the year. The only way in which this movie is formulaic is that it resembles John Travolta's "Blow-Out" (1981), another superb and underrated thriller in which the hero grasps at technology to try and save a woman's life.Denzel Washington plays yet another cop, but after "Out of Time" and "The Inside Man," what a treat to see him play a *smart* cop. Here he's Doug Carlin, a New Orleans ATF agent called in to help find an assassin-terrorist who set off a bomb that killed hundreds of people on a ferry.Carlin is put on the case because he has a way of sniffing out relevant details. This turns out to be extremely helpful when the New Orleans police are shown to have technology that can show the whereabouts of anybody, anywhere, three-and-a-half days before a given event.Carlin has discovered that an innocent and now-dead woman was a pawn in the assassin's plot, so he has the technologists look at her life just prior to her death. The late woman is, of course, too beautiful for words, and we're given long, loving shots in which Carlin beholds her gorgeousness.At this point, you figure that the movie will be a bargain-rate version of "Laura" in which a slack-jawed cop falls in love with a dead woman. And you wonder why the brilliant techno-geeks are letting this guy use their up-to-the-minute software to pursue some lurid fantasy. And it is at precisely this point that you have gotten it all wrong.I can't bear to give away any more plot points. Suffice to say, the cop is far smarter than we thought, and so is the movie -- a film with extremely thoughtful ideas, that engages its audience instead of allowing them to be passive viewers. The last movie I can think of that offered so many clever concepts to chew on was "Contact" (and that was ten years ago). "Deja Vu" is worlds removed from that sci-fi gem, yet it has the same sort of plot twists that come out of left field and yet seem wholly plausible when they add up to the bigger picture.For once, credit goes to everyone. To screenwriters Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio for writing such a satisfying convoluted script. To director Tony Scott, who (like his brother Ridley) seems to be making better movies in his later years than he did two decades ago. And to stars Washington, Val Kilmer (his best work in years), and just about everyone else in the sterling cast.Like most viewers, I put off seeing "Deja Vu" after seeing middling reviews that complained how convoluted its plot is. I think a lot of people have forgotten that you can engage your brain at a movie and still have a great time with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Candy Coated Bruckheimer Glam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Bruckheimer gem quickly dispels with the necessary and gratuitous distillation of cracker jack movie physics to explain things to us (how many times are we going to get the folded up piece of paper demo for how to travel thru time?). It's basically soda pop scifi to enable yet another formulaic Denzel-chasing-the-bad-guys movie. Once Denzel becomes suspicious of the incredible technology, the experts (who look like rejects from the cast of Rent) give him the standard 30 second Hollywood distillation of how the technology works. Denzel gets this news of the century, and somehow it doesn't phase him at all (maybe because he can't believe it either). Granted, he's wrapped up in solving a terrorist plot, but still, one has to wonder how that somehow would not cause at least a wee bit of shock and awe. Some other things observed:-Denzel very quickly piecing together the underlying secrets of the technology he's witnessing-Denzel figuring out that shining a laser pen pointer into the projector screen actually gets sent to the past.-Denzel actually carrying a laser pointer around in his front pocket. Is this SOP for an ATF agent? I dunno, maybe it is.-Light from Denzel's laser pointer can go through a display/screen yet anything else has to go through a separate huge machine, including Denzel, who throws himself at this task without pause.-Said time machine / teleporter would constitute an earth shattering news (let alone being able to see a real-time feed of the past).-This huge machine existing somewhere in the New Orleans area yet nobody has found it (despite huge electrical power grid failures due to it and scores of army personnel hanging around)-A doughy, pudgy faced Val Kilmer having a short, meaningless, throw away role in this film, essentially there to collect a paycheck.-The "bad guy" seems to have some knowledge of a conspiracy involving the government and its technology to affect or alter the past/future, yet neither this or the character are really developed.-The female victim somehow falls in love with Denzel in a NY minute, I guess for thanks and payback for rescuing her.I'm starting to think that all Denzel's roles of late are the same guy. Great talent, but it's like everything he does is a variation on the same theme, sort of like Tommy Lee Jones spat of films where he's chasing someone, somewhere.The last 15 minutes of this film are good. It's just too bad the rest couldn't be. Then again, it's Bruckheimer folks, and that unfortunately says it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a good wine, Scott matures with "Deja Vu"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Deja Vu" is an intelligent and sophisticated thrilled from master craftsman Tony Scott, and sublime actor Denzel Washington, that delivers on all counts: plot, acting, script, cinematography, score, action, tension and coolness factor. James Caviezel is one of the best on-screen villains in a long while. And it's not just Washington who falls for his leading lady, Paula Patton, we all do. She is stunning and believable without the prima donna factor of her ingénue predecessor, Halle Berry.Easily one of Scott's best films in the last decade, if not a contender for one of his best ever. I would rank this one above the top-notch, "Man on Fire", simply because it is not so dark and more accessible, i.e. it's not just a guy's flick like so much of Tony Scott's canon.This film is deserving of the same level of audience attention his blockbuster smash hits with Tom Cruise generated in the 80's and 90's with "Top Gun" and "Days of Thunder". However, unlike those populist, decade defining films, this one is not pure pabulum for an excess-craving masses. "Deja Vu" has a brain working hard beneath its visually arresting exterior. It's concerned less with glamour than with its chief purpose, time-busting. This pays off in dividends, as it ranks as one of the most well thought out and believable time travel films ever made.More poignant than "Domino", with little to no "cheese factor", it feels like, "Deja Vu", is the film Scott's been attempting to make for the last half-decade since "Spy Games" in 2001. In 2004 he conjured character and mood with the revenge themed "Man on Fire", then O.D.'d on form and style with a saturated palette in "Domino". Having worked those forces out, he's cleared the way for this toned-down, grown-up thriller.The various techniques Scott uses to take his audience on a visceral ride: the blending of film stocks, "Domino"; technological wizardry, "Enemy of the State"; cojones, "Man on Fire"; awesome car-chases, pick a film; and great romantic intensity, "Top Gun", are all contained in "Deja Vu"."Deja Vu" grabs you by the heart and brings your brain along for the ride. Two hours fly by and you've lost track of all time, literally. A reviewer I know has a reverse scale for rating films. She judges them by how many times she looks at her watch during a film, no watch glances equals a great film. This film grips its audience with the engaging premise of reweaving the fabric of time. With flawless execution, "Deja Vu" achieves its goal so masterfully, viewers will quickly forget their own investment of time with nary a watch glance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to the movie not knowing what to expect. Denzel Washington always does a good job as an actor, but he can't magically transform a bad script or plot line into something good. In this movie he takes a great story and makes it better.As an ATF investigator, he quickly establishes himself as being knowledgeable about his job. When he's invited to investigate a terrorist bombing with a new technology, the roller coaster of intrigue begins. The technology involves the ability to see into the past and follow the events as they transpire leading up to the event. You have to pay attention to see if he's changing reality or just reliving the one that's already occurred. The small touches make this movie cool.Definitely worth seeing in the theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this title was based on the right stuff. If was out there a bit, but not so much that it wasn't believable. THe premise was fresh and the technical side was easy to follow.I found myself really wanting to see what was going to happen, how and when. The pacing was good, the drama unfolded and the conflict was exposed. I like the movie pretty much right up to the end.Without giving things away the fresh, concept appeared to go out the window and the same predictable Hollywood formula reared it's ugly head.I'd recommend that you see this and my guess is you will enjoy it. If you value your dollar like I do I suggest you catch a matinée, I don't know if it's worth a tenski.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the movie that actually made me sign up to IMDb, just so I can vent, just so I can make my puny voice perhaps heard. I am so sick of films like this, cookie-cutter crap that is being passed off as creative, passed off as entertainment. Why are they, Hollywood, still making movies like this? I know the answer, because people like me keep paying good money to see them. But what a overloaded retarded movie. Special effects, were great but what the hell happened to the story? She survived why? To make a happy ending? Can someone please tell me how that even happened in the film? Caveizel is excellent. Denzel is Denzel and in my book that equals good. If actors stopped taking the huge paycheck maybe then Hollywood would cease this nonsense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More like Deja Pooh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've had more thrill-packed poops than Deja Vu.Where to begin? Denzel Washington is NOT a time-traveling do-gooder as he would have us believe. Instead he proves once again why he is one of the most inconsistent actors of our time, delivering a stale, if not poopy, performance. It was like The Crotch Chronicles all over again. Come on, Denzel! Mommy loves you.There are many more problems with the film, but there's not nearly enough room here to list them all (think Gabe Kaplan on a shrink's couch). I don't know what Val Kilmer is doing in this movie. As usual, he makes you long for the poetic subtlety of Robert Hegyes. Here I was hoping this would be the movie where they finally bring back Bull the bailiff from Night Court.What I will say is that Deja Vu has a pretty crazy performance from Paula Patton as Claire. This lady knows where to find the pickle! She's got a bright future ahead of her, if Hollywood knows what's good for it. I read she likes corn.Overall, I do not recommend Deja Vu.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Explosions, Noise, Helicopters, Car Chases and guns ... all staples from a Tony Scott/Jerry Bruckheimer production. All of these are most certainly abundant and at the usual sensory overload level. What is a little surprising about this one is the somewhat complex, if almost impossible to believe, story line. Sure time travel and parallel universes are common in film, but the whole criminal element is a nice little twist to the theme.Denzel does his customary strutting through with his favorite partner ... his enormous ego, but it somehow works here. Val Kilmer is drastically underused as Mr. FBI and Adam Goldberg somehow only gets to fire off a couple of wise cracks during his scenes. The spark for the film actually comes from Paula Patton as the victim-or-is-she? and Jesus (Jim Caviezel) as a really bad guy "patriot" Sure, the film is pure malarkey as far as being reasonable, but as escapism, it is actually much better than anticipated. The best news ... no Jon Bon Jovi or Bryan Adams songs on the soundtrack!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the final analysis, this is a time travel action flick, with a few good lines of dialog, and a heroine with nice breasts.The plot has enough holes to drive several Hummers thru sideways.There is no depth whatsoever to any of the characters here.Tell me how Denzel Washington plays "chicken" on a suspension bridge, without killing anyone or himself, and without getting nailed by the police? I kept hoping something better was coming around the bend, but it just kept spiraling down into tinseltown pyrotechnics.In fact, there was a movie just like this about 10 years ago, same plot, same ending, same bogus science, and it was just as disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Daft but fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a lot going for this movie. It is well made, well shot, well acted and well directed. As thrillers go I think that Mr Scott pretty much does a masterclass in thriller directing. Obviously, once you take a leap into the void that is temporal displacement / time travel mechanics then you are opening yourself up to a whole bunch of nightmare scripting sessions in which the writers must have leaned one way to make it work in a logical way but the producers must have been sighing all the time; 'boring! Too much exposition - we want action, dammit!' and leaned the other way. What we have ended up with is a film started by the writers and finished by the producers.It is entertaining but when the film ends you end up thinking: 'I dunno, that doesn't make any sense...' and unfortunately what started out as quite a clever idea gets crazier and crazier as the film progresses and by the end I was pretty sure that no one had any idea where - or indeed when - Denzel Washington was, least of all the writers. Overall, it's fun and for the first half an hour or so you are wondering where they are going with it and it becomes immediately apparent that it is going to be quite a bit of fun...but then goes a bit bonkers. Worth a watch though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong performances and a sci-fi script that knew where the line was</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of science fiction, but every once in a while a sci-film will come along that I do like (and this is one). The problem for me with most sci-fi is how far can the director push the viewer to suspend belief before the viewer says, "Wait a minute. This is getting absurd."? That is, perhaps, even more true when the sci-fi topic is time travel...which this sort of is. For me, this story did not push me past that point of being comfortable with suspending belief.I'm not going to outline the plot of the film here. Many others...and many other sources...do that. I want to concentrate on a few of the actors and their performances.Denzel Washington, as an ATF Special Agent, turns in a solid performance, as he almost always does. He helps hold the line on suspending belief.Paula Patton -- an actress I'm not very familiar with -- is excellent as the victim turned hero.Jim Caviezel turns in a wonderful performance as the terrorist.Val Kilmer -- looking quite rotund (but once one of my favorites) is rather bland as an FBI Special Agent.Adam Goldberg, another actor I'm not too familiar with, is superb as a scientist.I highly recommend this film...and I think you'll like the plot twist at the end!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool sci-fi idea on paper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A ferry filled with USS Nimitz sailors and families is blown up in New Orleans during Mardi Gras. ATF agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) investigates the suspected terrorist attack. They find the body of Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton) who seems to be killed before the bombing. FBI Agent Jack McCready (Bruce Greenwood) is in charge. Carlin's partner's car is left in the ferris' parking lot and ends up in the investigation. Agent Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer) brings him into a new experimental FBI unit called Snow White run by scientist Dr. Alexander Denny (Adam Goldberg) who uses spacefolding to see events 4 days 6 hours into the past. Carlin suspects that he can change history.This is a great sci-fi idea and I imagine that it would make a great book. However it's biggest difficulty is to make a bunch of people sitting around watching a monitor as something exciting. The sad truth is that it's not exciting no matter how well director Tony Scott films it. He is probably the only one capable of energizing that room with kinetic power. However even he has his limits to his fast quick edits flashing sound-and-fury style. It's noticeable that the drive in the middle of the movie is derived almost exclusively from Tony Scott trying to make watching computer screens exciting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad time travel movie but fairly entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The acting here is very decent - Denzel Washington , Val Kilmer and Jim Caviezel are all very OK. The film is a nice eye candy which isn't strange considering that this is a Tony Scott movie. There is also a nice and quite inventive car chase that happens in both past and present (watch the movie and you will understand what I'm talking about).The screenplay is however poor. * Why an Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms agent is investigating terrorist activity and a murder scene, which should surely be the province of the police, FBI or Homeland Security. * The terrorist has no motive for his madness * US government has a time machine that needs a lot of energy just to send a piece of paper in to the past (it knocked out the whole city power). Yet when Denzel goes back in time the problem is miraciolusly solved ! * Denzel is so strong he only needs a couple of hours to recover from dying * Denzel only needs to wash his wound to stop it from bleeding * Why send Denzel instead of sending a note to the police from the past ? * The movie ends with a paradox that is very confusing to explain or understand (look the IMDb FAQ for this movie).It's fairly entertaining , but dumb and mostly predictable movie. I give it 3/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Massive fan of time travel stories and films, and also a fan of Denzel so it seemed a good choice to watch Deja Vu.A ship containing a load of navy officers and their families is blown up and AFT agent Denzel Washington arrives on the scene to investigate. He soon gets mixed up with a special crime investigation unit who claim to use some kind of mechanism to look back in time. As it turns out there's a little bit more to it than that, and Denzel finds himself falling for one of the female victims of the disaster.I don't want to spoil the plot too much but it's the kind of film you need to watch twice to get the full low-down on the plot, I do need to go back and watch it when I get the chance. Also look out for Jim Cazviezel, he also starred in Frequency - another great time travel film which might just be a tad better than Deja Vu.In some parts it is a sophisticated thriller, whereas in others it ends up being a tad OTT - lots of explosions, classic Bruckheimer style. But don't let that take it away from it.Val Kilmer is also in this, although he is wasted really - he gets a lot of screen time but his character does little to help the story. But there we go.Also, for those who have seen it - what about that ending, ey?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just find movies based on time travel hard to swallow, but that being said this was a great action picture with a breathtaking opening scene. It will definitely be one for the DVD player to pause/rewind and watch it in slow motion.Denzel Washington plays the archetypal, non-conformist, "ill do it myway coz i'm smarter than you" ATF agent as Doug Carlin. I'm not sure why the ATF were involved in a terror attack or even the FBI. Surely it would have been Homeland Security who would have carried out the investigation? He gets recruited to join a top secret FBI operation that has found a way of viewing events from the 4.5 days ago as they happen 'live'. Of course it uses masses of electricity and has been used to explain the various North American blackouts that have occurred over the years.As a sub-plot he is also assigned to solve the mysterious murder of a very attractive young lady, Claire Kuchever, who appears to have died from injuries similar to the terror attack victims. Doug is like a dog with a bone and won't let go of his hunch. With the FBI and their super viewer he tracks down the terrorist and brings him to justice. The FBI "powers that be" then orders that the "viewer" be shut down because the case is solved.At this point I thought we might be in for a typical "conspiracy theory 'the Govt was behind the attack" tangent. But no. Doug goes off on his quest to save Claire and win her heart.Provided that you don't think too much about the whole travel back in time thing then this movie is fast paced and well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I still give this a six though because I could see how people liked it but I did not and heres why. I actually had not watched this movie until recently after already seeing the movie Source Code. Although these movies are not the same they are very similar and it just hung in my head because Source Code is better.That clearly is only opinion though. If you look at the facts is was above average. Denzel did a great job as always and it was an original idea I just feel Tony Scott (R.I.P) ;lacks writing in his films and tries to makes up for it with action.This movie is about an explosion that kills 500 people and the ATF send a man to find out who did it. While in fact they actually have this sort of time seeing device which they use to try to find it out.Overall this movie was not bad but like I said Source Code is better obviously a little less now though seeing how they ripped the idea off pretty hard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"De Ja Vu" is one of Tony Scott and Jerry Bruckheimer's better collaborations. The film stars Denzel Washington as an ATF agent who is brought into the folds of a government programme called "Snow White". "Snow White" "opens a time window" which allows viewers in the present to look four days back into the past. Using this forensic tool viewers in the present are able to gather clues which may help them solve crimes which have already been committed. The catch is, "Snow White" unfolds in real-time. What it shows is always four days, 6 hours and 3 minutes ago. While this limitation hampers "Snow White's" effectiveness - once the device misses a moment, it's gone forever - it is still a remarkable tool: it's essentially a super-controllable time-camera, a "worm hole" which can be manually moved about such that those in the present see anywhere in the past, albeit within the four day window.The film's theories, machines and techno-babble are ridiculous. Science fiction has always gleefully expounded on mind-bending ideas, but "De Ja Vu's" problem is not that its ideas are too far fetched ? the film's central idea is a good one - but that everything works too well. Tony Scott doesn't sell us the idea of "Snow White". It works too powerfully, too precisely, too conveniently, too quickly. On the flip side, it's hilarious the way Scott doesn't care. And though his film bares resemblance to such time-movies as "Primer", "12 Monkeys", "Minority Report", "Looper", "The Butterfly Effect", "La Jettee", "Source Code" and "Frequency", the real influence seems to be the sequence in big brother Ridley Scott's "Blade Runner" where Harrisson Ford manipulates a photograph, trawling its borders in a search for clues. What "De Ja Vu" does is construct a whole film out of this sequence, Scott treating the whole world as a photograph which his boundless camera bounces back and forth exploring. "Snow White's" not a time machine, so much as its a forensic tool which turns yesterdays into a virtual, explorable globe. It's like a cross between Google Earth Street View and a giant magnifying glass.The film's central crime is a terrorist attack on a New Orleans river ferry. The way the film handles the terrorist, the terrorist attack and the government's solution, is crass. The film ignores a very spooky aspect of the US government: its paranoiac obsession with preventing tragedies in the future through money, high-tech gadgets, covert forces, data-mining, wide-spread surveillance, illegal information gathering and the breaking of any number of privacy and/or civil rights laws. It's a kind of super-neurosis, the state organism so uber-desirous of control that it's not only oppressive and controlling in the present, but reaches far out in to the past and future as well, obsessively gathering all it can to preserve and protect itself. But Scott's too small an artist to see these nefarious avenues. He's in the Cameron, Spielberg, Bay mould, interested in technology only insofar as its able to zap eyeballs. It's along these lines, and these lines only, that "De Ja Vu" works. Scott's more interesting in playing with cameras, time-lines and points of view.The film was written by Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio. Their script was heavily changed by Scott, who has since apologised and expressed regret for his meddling. Marsilii and Rossio's script was allegedly more highbrow, clever and had less plot holes. Still, some good stuff remains in Scott's final version. Consider your typical Tony Scott car-chase, only now it takes place simultaneously within two time-lines, Denzel carrying a camera on his vehicle (akin to the Google camera, currently mapping our streets for Google Earth) which allows him to catch up to and chase a car that travelled a particular route four days ago. It's a cool idea, even if Scott doesn't milk it fully.More interesting is the way the film implies that what we're witnessing is the third or fourth "unfolding" of its particular events. Late in the film Denzel uses "Snow White" to physically jump into the past in an attempt to stop the terrorist action. What the film does, however, is start 3 or 4 jumps after Denzel's first jump into the past. The effect is such that the past versions of Denzel are leaving clues for both Denzel and the audience in the future, the hope being that these clues allow us to "break the conspiracy of time" (no matter what actions occur in the past and present, the film says, the future outcome is always the same, though it unfolds in a slightly different way) and catch the terrorist in the present. In this way the film itself becomes a time-window, a forensic wormhole akin to "Snow White's" own event horizon. Meanwhile we become time-detectives.The film's cast and characters are more functional than interesting. Only Denzel Washington stands out. He's always good in these every-man roles. The film ends with a very forced romance, which for some reason always finds its way into these time-traveller movies. It's funny the way human beings can't think of any other reason to break the space-time continuum other than sex. Interestingly, the film's "worm hole" functions in such a way that those in the past can "feel" or "sense" that they're being watched by observers in the future. As far as I know, this is the opposite of an event horizon under the general theory of relativity, in which the boundary marks the point at which events beyond cannot be affected by outside observers. In "De Ja Vu" there is no point of no return. A light shone through "Snow White" will reach into the past and cause knock-on reactions. In a way this epitomises the unconditional hopefulness, naivety or optimism of the film. The past, present and future will be changed through sheer will and covert technology, it says, and your tomorrow will always be safeguarded. Meanwhile, in the real world...8/10 ? Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

Is there any logic here? You should just enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film with potential shoots itself in the foot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're looking for a film that is different, a little out there, and plenty of fun then Deja Vu is the film for you. Denzel Washington stars as an ATF agent who is investigating the tragic bombing of a New Orleans ferry. In order to track the bomber down Washington is introduced to a top secret government technology that allows him to view the past. When Washington draws connections between the bombing and the murder of a young woman he starts to watch her past as it unfolds the mystery in a smart yet fairly far-fetched film.Deja Vu heavily demands the suspension of disbelief. The film starts out pretty clever with this super secret technology that transcends time and space. The movie tries very hard to explain this technology and there are points where you just can't buy it. It is undeniably ridiculous at times but watching this unbelievable technology at work in the film is pretty fun. The whole film is fun, it just demands a lot of slack because it can be too much at times. But I have to give the film props for making a more or less coherent story out of this far fetched and fairly unique idea. And there is a nice amount of movie magic at work here because the film is loaded with good actors. These actors portray characters that believe in what is going on, and it allows us to believe it as well.The sad thing about this film is that despite any brains it has, it ends up shooting itself in the foot by being a formulaic and clichéd action flick. It has the familiar action movie score that doesn't stir any kind of emotion and is sort of just there to add some fat to the film. Tony Scott's jumpy cuts in his direction are more obnoxious than thrilling and overall it has that action film feel to it that is just too typical for me to enjoy much. It is a feeling that is hard to put into entirely into words, but anybody can recognize it once they see the music, direction, and script come together. And of course with any below average action flick Deja Vu has a very weak script at times. Throughout the film there are lines which just make me hang my head. Lines that easily could have been cut to create a much better film.There are a lot of things you have to look past to enjoy Deja Vu but if you can then it isn't a terrible film. It isn't great but there is a faint unique flare in here that makes it more or less worth the two hours of your time. You have to take the movie's technology and ideas for granted as there are times that it doesn't exactly add up. But the film is different and has smart aspects that sadly end up being shot down by action film clichés. And then to add insult to injury the film has a terrible ending that could have been done so much better. It's unfortunate but it's just another thing to accept for what it is. Overall Deja Vu just earns a big shrug.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven but engrossing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an interesting pair of movies. I say that because it really *feels* like two movies. 2/3 of the movie takes place in the "present" spying on the past. That plot line is a tight investigative thriller with a very clever spin on the genre-standard car chase. It fully resolves with the catching of the terrorist.Then the movie goes on to suddenly turn into a time travel movie, and this part is not as tight or as satisfying. After being told that the mass of an object determines the power requirements to send it back in time, and establishing that sending a piece of paper back in time in the first 2/3 practically blacks out New Orleans, they somehow send all of a not small Denzel Washington back in time without a lot more impact. Odd to say the least.The only idiot-plot moment of the film also occurs in this last 1/3 when Claire, on spotting the terrorist returning to the ferry, does NOT go tell the police right behind her, as she was instructed and who undoubtedly have radios to warn the police on the ferry, but instead decides to chase him. How she even gets ON the boat is a bit of a mystery since we see the terrorist JUST make it on before the gates are closed before she even starts running for it.All in all, this last 1/3 is so sloppy compared to the first 2/3 it makes one wonder if it wasn't tacked on by a studio demand for a "happy ending."Still its an entertaining film and the last 1/3, if a bit weak, maintains a good pace and carries you to the end.Edit: It recently occurred to me that the first 2/3 of the film can also be viewed as an interesting allegory for the "imaginary" relationships we have in the modern world. His falling in love with, and in a real sense constructing an imaginary relationship, with this woman he by definition cannot interact with but only observe parallels our modern day obsession with media figures and "internet friends."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Denzel Washington plays an ATF agent being sent on a terrorist attack site and assigned to a special and secret FBI team to maybe, possibly, go back in time and avoid the incident to occur. He plays his character straight forward without frills and thereby, I guess, finds the right note in such preposterous story.I had a problem with the following: Washington's character's transition from meticulous cop to action superhero is too sudden. Also, his character seems like a nice and caring and, again, meticulous guy and, yet, once behind the wheel, he causes so many accidents and damages, putting many other people's lives in danger, without looking back even once. He does request paramedics to be sent on one of those crash sites but you don't see the call being made. This is something recurrent in Batman movies, for example, and has been parodied by the "Hancock" movie.Nevertheless, this being a Tony Scott movie, you know what to expect: a good-looking no-brainer where you ought to just relax and enjoy the show. That's all it intends to be and does perfectly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In New Orleans, a community still suffering from Hurricane Katrina, a group of people are at the gulf shoreline. They are welcoming back their relatives in the United States Navy, who are arriving on a ferry. However, tragically, the ferry blows up near the coast, killing many of the military men and folks on land. How can this be? Who planted such a massive bomb? Soon, government officials, such as Paul (Val Kilmer), and the man in charge (Bruce Greenwood) are telling the public the investigation will take some time, for the ferry is now under water and they have few leads. Onto the scene arrives ATF agent Doug (Denzel Washington), who was one of the principal investigators of the Oklahoma City bombing. The other men are reluctant to let him join the team, for reasons unknown, for he has already discovered some key elements they overlooked. However, Doug, while engaging, is a driven man and he becomes even more so when a beautiful female victim, Claire (Paula Patton) washes up on the shore. Unbelievably, forensic evidence indicates that she was killed BEFORE the explosion and dumped in the water, to throw investigators off kilter. Also, Doug learns that it was HER van, stolen most likely, that was rigged with the bomb that blew up the ferry. Further, Paul asks Doug to review a series of tapes, made with satellite surveillance, that may offer clues on how to find the person responsible. Or, are they really tapes or something else? Is it possible to reverse what happened to Claire and all of the others? This story started off so well that the last half was a major disappointment. This was not the fault of the cast, however, for Washington is marvelous, as are Kilmer (how nice to see him!), Greenwood, lovely Patton, Adam Goldberg, Jim Cavaziel and a host of others. In fact, Washington, despite the somber nature of the film, is funny, smart, and a total joy. Also fine is the setting, costuming and photography. Therefore, what is to blame for the film's ultimate failure, my view, is the complicated plot which strains plausibility. One minute, the movie is zipping along, offering real possibilities in the actual world and, then, it morphs into a science fiction, hard-to-swallow thriller. A much better film would have resulted if the story would had stayed as a typical whodonit, for as it is, the flick is confusing and meandering, with a far from satisfying conclusion. Yes, the direction has energy but there is nothing that will rectify the situation when the tale collapses. In short, if you like the cast, especially Washington, or thrillers, give it a whirl, for you may see things conversely to what this critic does. As for me, oh how I wish it had turned out differently!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing about Deja Vu but 'Man on Fire in New Orleans'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's funny that this film made me believe a couple of scenes as experiencing Deja Vu, but later I've noticed that they actually were far different to what you know as Deja Vu. In the film, Doug(Denzel Washington) faces a few moments where he feels like "I've seen this before..." that just looks like Deja Vu, but in fact those moments were his actual experiences that he'd gone through just a couple of days ago. It is not a kind of thing that you feel like you've seen but can never remember where, it is actually the thing that you have just experienced in real life. You would not call that a Deja Vu. If you could see what happened at certain places and you would time-travel back to that moment, you'll surely what you have already seen from the future. After all, it does not make any sense though. To me this film is more like 'Man on Fire II' but in New Orleans. Rather than saving a little girl, this ex-military tough but sole man goes for saving a girl that he meets via time machine. It is stylish, just like 'Man of Fire' but I'm a bit sick of hearing another time-traveling story and the love and sacrifice and all that. Another thing is that, Doug goes out in a van to chase the criminal but then he causes serious car accidents and a truck crash while chasing and don't really care. (a couple of innocent people must have died in the crashes but no need to care 'cause they are not playing any roles for this film? what a HOLY Hollywood!) Yeah, yeah, I get it, a couple of cars, explosions, 'must be in film' thing, a girl in the past must be saved but who cares about a couple of civilian's deaths. I'm giving 7 'cause Denzel Washington's done his job alright as usual.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a real shame that everything I had read about Déj? Vu concerned the high-powered explosions and loud clatter of guru/producer Jerry Bruckheimer. No mention, except maybe as a footnote, was given to A-list director Tony Scott and the magic he has woven in his past three films. The man who brought us Top Gun has seen a sort of revival in style lately with the entertaining Spy Game, the amazing Man on Fire, and the kinetic Domino. Scott has taken the quick cuts of music videos and has infused them into his shooting style. His editor better be making some good money as these films fly by with filters, jump-cuts, grain, and camera angles swiveling at every turn. Greatly overshadowed by brother Ridley Scott and his more serious, award-winning epics, Tony has been pumping out some of the most solid and entertaining films of the past couple decades. With a reuniting of semi-regular star Denzel Washington, Déj? Vu proves that when Bruckheimer is paired with a like mind, his usual drivel can become great. Scott shows us how to hone the explosions, noise, and clutter to an effective level and gives us a helluva ride.Déj? Vu could have easily reduced itself to time-travel farce, going by the books to show a time warp in order to solve a crime. The far-fetched premise of being able to see the past as it happens four and a half days later should seem crazy and by watching the previews you are given the idea that it will be just a series of do-overs. Fortunately the trailers these days show a totally different movie than what has been crafted. Scott and his screenwriters have not only developed a sci-fi tale seeped in enough reality to at least be looked upon as plausible for the sake of the story, but they nicely tidy up any chance of their being a plot-hole. Our story begins with a devastating domestic terrorist act upon a ferry carrying over 500 people, Navy and family. Washington's ATF agent is brought in and discovers that it was no accident. Intrigued by the efficiency he displays, an FBI agent, played with nicely effective restraint by Val Kilmer, calls him in to check out a new toy they have to find who the perpetrator is. During the use of this screen of the past, Denzel acquires a feeling of obligation to do all he can to prevent what he sees from occurring in the present, no matter what consequences that might entail for the future. The quest to stop the violence begins with an attractive young woman who unknowingly has become an integral part in what will ultimately transpire.The beauty of this film is that with multiple time-lines being shown parallel to each other, there are many questions that desperately need answering. To credit all involved, they appear to have put themselves in the audience's shoes and piece-by-piece wrote in a reason for everything. Anything that is seen either in the past, present, or future has a reason for being there and will be intelligently explained. Also, the performances are stellar, Denzel and Kilmer as well as a quietly maniacal Jim Caviezel and the emotionally exasperated Paula Patton, and the visuals unique. While Scott has toned down the ultra-kinetic cuts and filters for the main action, his style is still stamped on the graphics of their screen showing the past. The motion trails and speed scans lend a stylized digital editing program feel and are gorgeous to watch. Déj? Vu's best sequence, however, is the crazy car chase during the present in pursuit of a vehicle in the past, definitely a rush and orchestrated almost flawlessly. Even though Ridley gets the accolades and Tony gets the hack/overproduced label, I must say, while they are the best directing duo in Hollywood, I might have to give the edge on pure cinematic entertainment to the younger Tony. He is on a roll and doesn't seem to be stopping anytime soon.Evren Buyruk from USA</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wormhole movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An ATF officer (Denzel Washington) goes four days into the past to stop an explosion in which many people were killed, as well as stop the murder of a beautiful young woman (Paula Patton). Tony Scott directed, and the film also stars Val Kilmer, Jim Caviezel, and Bruce Greenwood.For such a simple plot, it sure is a complicated movie, but totally absorbing. Someone on this site called it a "wormhole movie" - I never knew there was such a genre, and I come into this as a newbie. I had to do some reading after the film to figure out some of the plot points. I don't know if it was me or the film, so I split the difference and gave it an 8. I think the audiences more used to this type of film can figure it out much more easily. I don't want to say too much and give it away for those who haven't seen it. Just pay attention.Scott and Washington make a great team. There's lots of suspense, excitement, mystery, and special effects.Some time ago, I sat in a room of people watching "The Constant Gardner" and had to explain the plot as the film went along. I can't imagine watching this film with that crowd! Fascinating, entertaining, and well worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable but ultimately forgettable - 60%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently, I've been spoiling myself by rewatching some absolute gems on DVD. Reacquainting myself with the likes of "The Lord Of The Rings" trilogy and "WALL·E", it's easy to forget that not all movie are stone-cold classics. Take this middling effort from a couple of year ago. Despite having a big-name lead actor, a director with a proved track record and a superstar producer, it just failed to excite and entertain me in the way I expected. To be honest, I had high hopes for this (certainly the excessive publicity around the time of release suggested this was a corker) but ironically, I suppose hindsight is a wonderful thing.Denzel Washington plays AFT agent Doug Carlin, called in to investigate a massive explosion on a New Orleans ferry. But after meeting FBI agent Paul Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer), Doug is offered a unique opportunity. Using the latest technology and advances in surveillance, the team use a window into the recent past to uncover the bomber and investigate the murder of a young woman (Paula Patton) who appears to be connected to the bombing. And as Doug begins to develop feelings for the woman, he starts to wonder if he can really change the past for the better.It's difficult to specify why "Deja Vu" isn't the runaway hit I thought it would be. The plot, while clearly nonsense, offers enough to keep the viewer interested thanks in no small part to Washington as the increasingly perplexed agent. The problem is that like nearly all time-travelling movies, the plot ultimately lets itself down. This isn't a problem with stuff like the "Austin Powers" movies which don't take themselves seriously but "Deja Vu" takes itself very seriously indeed. Personally, I felt a strange sense that nobody was really trying. The action, when it eventually comes, never felt like it was pushing any boundaries and the story takes a long time to get going. At no point did I go "oh, that's cool" or see anything that I felt I hadn't seen before. In a weird way, it reminded me of another Denzel flick "Out Of Time" which wasn't a classic either but through good story-telling and another magnetic performance from Washington, it was eminently watchable. "Deja Vu" is just that, a fine film to watch on TV if nothing else is on but nothing more.Maybe I've been spoiling myself with classic DVDs too much but in truth, "Deja Vu" isn't in the same league as what I've been watching. Yes, Denzel gives another performance that reminds us why he has a Best Actor Oscar on his mantelpiece but with a typically confused time-travelling plot and lazy direction, it doesn't match the performance Denzel gives it. Like "Out Of Time", he is a big fish in a small pond. With a little more effort and a better ending (which badly let the film down), this may have been the classic I thought it was but sadly, this is a wasted opportunity that's gone by begging. Damn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid first half</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave DEJA VU 7 stars because of a slam-bang, tension-filled first half. The second half detracts from the score, as the movie goes off in the wrong direction and comes to an implausible finish, even for a science fiction movie (and make no mistake, this is a science fiction flick). Washington stars as a cop investigating the bombing of a ferry that kills hundreds, including many servicemen. The mystery of the event deepens with the discovery of a woman's charred body miles downstream. A bunch of mad scientists working in a big, expensive lab show DW using their newly developed wayback machine a way to view the immediate past, in an effort to figure out the who and why and when of things leading up to the explosion. OK so far. But then, the movie shifts into time travel, and other than Jim Cavaziel popping up as the mad bomber, interest quickly wanes. Sort of like the second half of EVENT HORIZON, when Sam Neil becomes Pinhead. Not one of DW's best, for sure. You have to see him in his undies, curled up in a tiny box, being flung into the past via the mad scientists' wayback machine. I'd like to say, what was he thinking? But God only know how many millions he was paid for this semi-turkey. Plus, he apparently enjoys working with Tony Scott.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You've seen it all before (pun welcomed though not intended), and it's still good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We know that Denzel Washington can helm a thriller and we know that Tony Scott is more than capable of guiding him in such a project, so reasonably, expectations for "Deja Vu" are high. Knowing that the film puts a time travel twist on the traditional federal investigation thriller and was the first film to be made in New Orleans post-Hurricane Katrina makes the interest level soar."Deja Vu" ends up being one of those movies that meets your expectations. It takes the conventional aforementioned thriller full of CSI and mystery nuggets and combines it with a typical Hollywood sci-fi depiction of time travel. You've seen both before, just never like this, and the result ends up being --like you've seen it before. Deja vu anyone?Washington plays ATF agent Doug Carlin who begins investigating the explosion of a boat in a New Orleans harbor believed to be an act of terrorism. When the FBI gets involved, Carlin gets pulled onto the crack team to figure out who did it. They introduce him to an incredible technology that via satellite allows for an invisible camera to travel four days back in time. Carlin, however, is not only interested in apprehending the killer, but is smitten by a young woman (the Halle Berry-esquire Paula Patton) that while dead in present time is central to the case, and he goes about trying to reverse her fate.Scott's style with the film sort of cleverly imitates that of the "invisible camera" that goes back in time. He gets all these sweeping shots of the bay where the ferry exploded and aims to get as many perspectives as possible. If you want a director that will deliver surefire quality in this genre, there are few guarantees other than Scott. It may not be a touching or deep film, but it will satisfy viewers.Washington does his job here too, taking over the film with his presence and giving it the sense of urgency and importance it requires. This is why he can play basically the same part over and over again from movie to movie and no one will say anything about it: he doesn't create a character, he just invests himself into the part. He just sort of makes every role his and it's so convincing that you don't care that you've seen it before.The only thing not "standard" about "Deja Vu" is that Jim Caviezel was cast as the terrorist, a part usually reserved for an unknown actor in these types of films so that the antagonist is easier to hate. I can't say it makes a difference, because it's immaterial, but what really misses the mark is the film's attempt to insert some post-Katrina-sensitive patriotic themes. The way Scott captures the city with such great awe is testament enough to how it endured, there doesn't need to be anything in the script about it outside of mere setting context.There's plenty of great action shots and mystery unraveling to keep "Deja Vu" interesting and the actors hold their own to create a solid film that although not capable of astonishing most viewers, will earn a lot of fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film. It had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. At points, my head hurt from trying to figure out all the twists and turns - primarily from attempting to figure out the whole time travel aspect. Even though I've seen the film several times now, I'm still not sure I have it totally figured out. But I like when a film has me second guessing my own conclusions. It almost means you have to watch it multiple times to uncover things you may have missed the first time around. This film is definitely like that.Denzel does a good job, but I wouldn't say this is one of my favorites of his performances. Although I do like him in this. I just think this film is less of a character story and is more about the plot itself of traveling to the past and whether we can alter outcomes. So my focus was always more on that, than on the characters themselves. It would have been neat to see Halle Berry in the role of Claire - I wasn't familiar with the girl that played Claire (Paula Patton). It creeped me out a little that the same dude (Jim Caviezel) that played Jesus in PASSION OF THE Christ played the terrorist here. Just doesn't seem right somehow.There are some good action shots. I think it's great they chose to shoot in New Orleans as their economy definitely needed help after Katrina.Go to the message boards if you want to try to analyze timelines, parallel universes, wormholes, paradoxes and such. I looked at some of that, and it just made me more confused. I say, just watch the movie and enjoy it for all the pulse-pumping, adrenalin-raising thrills!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One big Deja Vu itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I'm completely honest I'd say that this movie itself is one big Deja Vu. We don't see anything that hasn't been done before. Denzel Washington plays another charismatic FBI-agent with the task of saving a girl. He did it before, and he most likely will do it again. But since that is the thing he's damned good at, you won't hear me complain about it.The storyline of altering time and the consequences appears deeper on the outside than it actually is. In the end it are the nice explosions and action-pumped car chase that steal the show rather than any philosophical side to the subject. All the SF talk is just a way of making it more believable.I may appear a bit sarcastic, but I'm not. This movie really doesn't do anything wrong by being a well-crafted thriller. You never have the feeling that they elevate any of the subjects to a higher plain nor do you care. Pure fun is good once in a while. And it's never a punishment to watch Denzel Washington act.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TimeCop. This is TimeCop without the "Muscles from Brussels". The plot is not the same yet the vehicle is. Also, do not forget the 2 drink minimum with Denzel Washington.A ferry blows up in New Orleans carrying mostly servicemen and civilians. Denzel Washington is an ATF agent sent to investigate. The first half of the movie is your typical police drama/investigation. It is the second half of the movie that feels like someone sucker punched you in the gonads. Let me rephrase that. It is so completely over the top and full of paradoxes that it makes Millennium seem like a Broadway musical.It isn't that this is a bad movie. The problem is that it isn't consistent and that hurts it dramatically. If it went full on science fiction or basic detective story, it would have worked. The problems is the sudden flip. I thought there was something wrong with the DVD or maybe the director had seen too much of Memento recently. And yes, Paula Patton is easy on the eyes, but she spends half the movie being dead. I don't swing that way, sorry.TimeCop worked on a purely science fiction and campy level. It is like that from beginning to end. Deja Vu tries first to be realistic and then sneaks in the incredible midway plot twist (like we were sufficiently drunk enough to try a rear entry through the back door without anyone noticing). It just becomes ridiculous. This is further complicated by the happy, yet somehow implausible and strangely creepy, ending. This is a pure rental. Unless you enjoy happy, yet implausible endings, love stories involving dead people and/or science fiction so watered down you can't taste it , I suggest you try something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a clever premise in Deja Vu but it's not really cleverly executed. Some things make sense, some don't. The chase scene, in which Denzel races down the road after a car that raced down the road 4 days ago, is really ingenious. But the movie gets shakier as it goes along. I can't help but think it would have been more interesting if Denzel had not been able to go back in time but had been able to ingeniously effect the time line as he tried to do with the note. But that's a more cerebral approach and this is not a cerebral movie.The little ending thing where it's implied they have some sort of connection is a perfect example of breaking the sci-fi premise. It's understandable that they would want to do that, but it doesn't make sense.The thing that actually bothered me the most was the way Denzel kept going on about saving the woman. I mean, 500 people were dead, but he never says, "I have to go back in time to save all those people," he just says, "what about the girl." For him, saving the rest of them is apparently just an afterthought.It's a generally entertaining movie, but there's just too much dumb in it to leave me satisfied.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have I seen this before? Sorry, an obvious blundersome and unworthy introduction, probably brought about by my recent viewing of another of Val Kilmer's movies, TOP SECRET, where he meets a French Resistance operative named Déj? Vu who introduces himself with the line "'Ave we not met before monsieur?".As part of their investigation, Doug Carlin, Agent Andrew Pryzwarra and Jack McCready, investigators of a post Katrina New Orleans ferry terrorist attack in which over 500 persons are killed, are viewing on screen the events of four and a half days previously. Initially, Denzel's character thinks he's watching simple enhanced satellite and CCTV footage, but then realises there's more to it than that. He then at one point flashes a penlight at a supposedly four day old image of a girl on the screen and she reacts to it. It turns out that this is a system which, through the bending of the oft-taken-advantage-of space-time continuum, enables them to actually watch, live, the events of four days previously and that the observers can also interact with the observed. So, the premise goes on, if we can watch the said events, can we influence those events? Denzel's character's motivation is the simple fact that he has already seen this girl's body in the morgue, and now he may have a chance of saving her life. And she's cute. First they send a document back, then, inevitably, they send Denzel himself back.There's an interesting chase sequence where, with the aid of some hi-tech jiggery-pokery head-set jobby (a goggle-rig they call it), Washington chases a four day old image of the suspect's vehicle, with the current-day world in one eye, and four days previous in the other. It is admittedly imaginative.As with all films of this type though, there is the problem of the paradox. If the motivation for changing things in the past is removed, then those events will not be interfered with and will therefore occur. It's not a spoiler, but if you have to go back in time to save someone's life and succeed, then there is no reason to go back in time, so you don't, and therefore they will die, so you have to go back in time? etc? etc. It's a no-win scenario. Also there is the problem that if, as the technos tell us in the movie, that nothing can be sent back, why have they got a chamber constructed, that will hold something the size of a man, in order to do just that? However, as I've said, it is imaginatively done and will keep you hooked from start to finish, and Washington gives a great and easy looking performance, which is a skill in itself.And if you can work out the resolution, then congratulations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Messy, and should have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's obvious that the whole point of this film is to incorporate the time travelling idea into a plot, but unfortunately the plot itself therefore got left behind and what we end up with is a fairly cool idea wasted by a messy and rather boring central plot line. The idea behind this film is not all that original - time travelling has been done before, and while I tend to avoid films revolving around the subject; I haven't seen anything done quite like this before, and the film deserves some sort of kudos for that. The plot focuses on an explosion on a ferry which kills over 500 people. The explosion is soon deemed not to have being caused by naturally, and AFT agent Doug Carlin is assigned to investigate the case. The body of a woman, apparently killed in the explosion, but who had actually died an hour before is uncovered and the AFT agent believes she is the key to solving the case. He is then invited to join a new surveillance team, which uses new technology to follow the woman during the time before she was murdered...Denzel Washington is in very familiar territory; having played a copper so many times it's hard to imagine him doing anything else. The main plot presents a problem for this film; it's always going to be difficult for something like this to really convince, and the plot here doesn't - or at least not really. It's not a flaw that had to be fatal for the film, but it becomes such because there really isn't all that much excitement to go with it. The best action sequence in the film sees Denzel chasing the culprit, only the culprit happens to be four days in the past. It works fairly well, but as you might expect; it's difficult to totally go along with. Too much of the film takes place in the lad where the central characters are watching the action unfold, and it's not very exciting. We don't actually find out what the new technology is until about half way through, and once we do find out what it is, the rest of the film seems rushed. I think more could have been made of this; Deja Vu really needed a solid plot and some more interesting scenes, so despite a few good ideas; this is a failure overall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you should tune in to this film after the first twenty minutes or so, you are likely to be clueless about what happens afterward. It's confusing enough from the beginning. Instead of deja vu (already seen) I finished it with an uncanny feeling of presque vu (almost seen).A special government agency has these satellites, you see, which are able to peer down and capture events in and near New Orleans in incredible detail. Nothing much new there. But the thing is, the picture the agents get is, dig it, four days old! And it's a trailing four day period, meaning that the events they are looking at on their giant TV screen are happening in real time. And as the agents spend their "present" watching the images, the "past" they are viewing travels along with them, always four days old.The satellites are not only able to capture any normal images of events in public spaces either. They have "infra red" capacity that allows them to penetrate buildings and walls and see inside people's apartments and offices. And they pick up the audio as well. Of course this opens up new vistas, which the agents take advantage of by watching the drop-dead gorgeous Paula Patton take a shower.Not wanting to run out of space here, and space is our problem now, not time, although we're assured they're one and the same, I'd better -- wait a minute. It occurs to me that I just spent too much of the space/time continuum explaining why I couldn't spend too much of the space/time continuum. Well, it's all no more confusing than the science and technology we see in this movie.To cut to the chase, a domestic terrorist (James Caviezel) blows up a big ferry, killing any number of people, including the partner of Denzel Washington, who's an ATF agent. When Washington finds out that not only can we view the past but we can also, in some curious way, penetrate it, he insists on being sent back to a few hours before the explosion to see if he can prevent it. (The usual paradox is mentioned in passing, as a joke.) BANG -- and Washington is sent back to a few hours before the blast, and after his Terminator-like trip he immediately rescues the drop-dead gorgeous Paula Patton from certain incineration by the terrorist. He does more than that. He saves the drop-dead gorgeous Paula Patton a second time. He saves the ferry by sacrificing his own life. Or so it would seem, except that he unknowingly shows up at the post-disaster scene, his unknowing "present" self, where he is introduced for the first time to the drop-dead gorgeous Pamela Patton. I don't know how that works either. If you died in the past, how can you show up alive in the present? For that matter, if your satellite technology can pick up the visual spectrum in the electromagnetic field, plus infra red, how come it can also give you high-definition audio, which is nothing more than waves of differing air pressure? Actually, I happen to know all these answers but the NSA won't let me spill the beans.Denzel Washington is quite good in this most action movie. He doesn't have much in the way of dynamic range but that's okay. Neither did Gary Cooper or Robert Redford. What more can be said about the drop-dead gorgeous Paula Patton except that she has a slinky, sinewy figure and the face of a model, full of good bone structure. And she has a distinctive husky voice too. Her features are slightly, engagingly, askew, as if someone had sliced her face through the sagittal plane and put it back together somewhat carelessly. She's African-American, I suppose, because we all agree that she is. But genetically my guess is that she's about half Caucasian, like Barak Obama and Hallie Berry. A living example of what's called "the social construction of reality." She's a decent actress and one hopes she has a career in films, and not just because she's, well, drop-dead gorgeous either.The director, Tony Scott, deserves a comment too. He's done some meretricious work in the past, undeserving of much attention, but this (with one or two exceptional scenes) is nicely executed material. There's a bit too much editorial razzle dazzle in the expository scenes involving the satellites, but that's about it. The action scenes, the special effects, are above what you might expect from a routine action movie. Sometimes they're startling. I hope the stunt people were being paid above scale.This is a film that ought to keep you attentive and in your seat, even if you're not an action movie fan. It's a superior example of a much degraded genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Takes a while to get going ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has a "scifi-esq" element to it so it's hard to imagine that it would take a while to get going. Yet, somehow, it manages to stall for the first 2/3 of the movie. Fortunately, it does finally pick up and get interesting.Basically, the movie is about a police officer (Denzel) who investigates a high-fatality ferry bombing. When he is teamed up with a government unit to look for answers, he learns they have a very unusual tool at their disposal: a device that can look back in time.The basic plot sounds like it's going to be incredibly interesting - but a couple of things are off so it is pretty low key for a while. The story is a bit slow in developing and the characters aren't that interesting. Not even Denzel - who is almost always interesting to watch - is not very engaging.The scifi element is interesting, but only for a little while when it is first introduced. Only in the last third of the movie does a feeling of suspense and unpredictability really come to the forefront.I do recommend seeing it if you're looking for an above-average movie. However, don't expect a thrill ride from start to finish. If you find it slow, give it some time and it will improve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great flick until the last few minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked "Deja Vu" until the last few minutes (more on that later). The acting (Denzel Washington, Val Kilmer, etc.) was great as you'd expect. The story was creative and very different, in a good way - a totally different perspective than anything I've seen or read before. Special effects were good and surprisingly fewer that I'd have expected (or at least that I noticed).Basically, *everything* about "Deja Vu" was brilliant until (drum roll please) the last few minutes. Then, all of a sudden, all good deeds were undone - and exponentially so, to boot. *Everything* good, all the way from the writers to the director to the actors, to the towel boys etc. it was all simply obliterated in a few brief minutes with a really lame and poorly executed ending that wasn't fitting to end a pre-schooler's first film (sorry if I insulted any pre-schoolers). I was just *so* disappointed in the ending that only writings the size of an epic novel would fill my despair. I'll give only one example - so I don't spoil anything. And that is... Since when can a blazer type vehicle get from 0 to "flip over at spectacularly *high* speed" in about a 5 foot distance? This is just one of a multitude of sins we observed in the final minutes of "Deja Vu". Many other, more serious flaws can't be mentioned without introducing possible spoilers.Seriously, I loved the movie until very close to the end. I would have debated between a 7 and maybe a 9 out of 10. But the ending was so poorly conceived (did I say that? - it was never conceived, they just took some old "Dukes of Hazzard" footage or something like that and used it - sorry "Dukes of Hazzard" fans, no foul intended) after a brilliant first 100+ minutes of film, that I just couldn't give it better than a 6, and I wanted to give it even less, I was so mad.My bottom line final thoughts - I just can't get over a movie being so brilliantly conceived and executed by so many people. And then at the very end, everyone said "hey this has worked in other lame movies". Did they not understand what they had created? It was genius up until the ending. I really believe that whoever was involved with the first 100+ minutes of the movie plot/storyline must have had absolutely no involvement in the last 10 minutes or so of the movie.The ending was a disgrace! But the overall movie was a success!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed every moment of this sci-fi thriller - and the script allows you to believe it and buy it and if you go with it, you'll enjoy a great thriller! Denzel is one of the few, if only actor who I will go see just because he's in a film. He has that ability to make his character so juicy and believable that you go with what he is doing...Paula Patton is wonderful, as is the entire cast. From the music to the storyline, to the cinematography - I loved it! I was on the edge of my seat and not really sure where they were taking me - which I love! I really don't like predicting a script and this was never a predictable storyline...Well done. Tony Scott is a good solid director - and his teaming up with Denzel (Man on Fire) proved to be a correct marriage of film talent! See the film if you like Denzel, if you like good scripts and thrillers bordering on sci-fi. At several points in the film you are really involved in two films for the price of one! Well done - thank you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deja Vu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Tony Scott (True Romance, Enemy of the State), this is quite a clever action thriller combining past and present. Basically in Algiers, New Orleons, a ferry has exploded and killed over 500 people, and ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) Agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington), along with FBI Agent Paul Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer) is investigating. Impressed with Carlin's skills, Pryzwarra invites him to join a new team with highly sophisticated satellite technology that can look backwards in time for 4-1/2 days. With this technology, they try and capture sight of the terrorist by looking into the private life of a woman victim to the crime, with unusual death circumstances. Soon enough Carlin knows that it is not satellite imagery, but somehow a time warp/machine. This is where when they find the terrorist, Carroll Oerstadt (The Passion of the Christ's James Caviezel) they can combine past with present, best example is a car chase with special goggles. There is also a moment where Carlin tries to warn himself in the past of the event, but his partner is victim to finding the note and being killed by Oerstadt. Eventually Carlin takes the risk of going into the past with the special scanner they used to send the note, and he is transported a few hours before the incident to meet the woman they found, and he has fallen for, Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton). When she eventually believes him knowing her and the future, they head to the scene of the crime to stop Oerstadt blowing up the ferry. The bomb (in a car) goes off the ship, and Claire escapes, but Carlin dies in the explosion, but don't worry, he's back to investigate the explosion where no-one died. Also starring Adam Goldberg as Dr. Alexander Denny, Elden Henson as Gunnars, Erika Alexander as Shanti and Bruce Greenwood as FBI Agent Jack McCready. There are tiny moments where it gets slightly complicated and you have remember past or future events, but it is still quite a clever film. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Déj? vu" first got my attention by the trailer. It had everything a trailer should have ? a cool, recognizable lead; some sort of gimmick; great music; a little taste of the story, yet not too much so that you can't figure it out; and some glimpses of great action sequences. "Déj? vu" stars Denzel Washington as an ATF agent, Doug Carlin, who is called to a crime scene where a ferry has just been blown up, most likely due to foul play. Doug seems vaguely familiar with the place, a recurring theme in the movie, hence the title. A body of one of the burned victims turns up, yet not only does Doug sense something familiar about her, the body had been washed up before the bombing.Doug then goes to her apartment, and then things start getting weird. I'll let you discover the weird elements and clues yourself. Just know that the subsequent scenes involve time travel, a crazy ex-Army guy, a car chase where one car is 4 1/2 days ahead of the other one, and a lame ending, that, when you put everything together, makes little logical sense.While I was not thrilled with all the plot holes, everything else is very well done ? the car chase I previously mentioned is actually pretty tense and actually believable. Denzel Washington gives another very good performance and director Tony Scott knows how to manage his stylistic camera moves and action scenes.If you're looking for a fun movie that challenges you just a little bit, here it is. It is tense, exciting, action-packed, and somewhat clever ? although the script is not as clever as it wants to be, it still delivers most of what the awesome trailer promises.</fullReview>

I agree with most everything the headline comment (a 9 rating) by Max Million says. Aside from the time-travel hoariness, the movie is well-done and enjoyable. Denzel does not disappoint. I also agree with most everything said by the last few commenters, who downgrade it for the time-travel and plot holes. Full disclosure, except for Bill &amp; Ted, I really really dislike most time-travel movies. When I rented this, I didn't know about the time-travel aspect. (Maybe I've got to get out more. Nah!) When I realized it was turning into a time-travel movie, I reflexively reached for the remote to turn it off. But, I didn't because I was enjoying it to that point. So, for those thinking of watching it ... go ahead, just forgive it the maybe-below-average time-travel difficulties. Look past that and it is enjoyable. Party on, dudes!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Denzel Washington is not a first to action/thriller films. So with the role of a detective investigating a brutal murder and a terrorist attack he is more than familiar in his role.The film opens showing a huge ship boarding military navel soldiers that have just came back from there duty work, and at there delight meeting their beloved family members. These romantic/intimate scene's soon end with a bomb going off on the ship, which results in no survivors. This is when Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) is called into action to investigate the incident. Upon investigating the bomb a murdered women drifts upon shore, who after a autopsy appears to have been murdered.When investigating he is introduced to a new technological innovation which appears to be able to view the past 4 days prior to the 'now' time. But with the concept of Einstein's parallel universe coming into play he asks the question "can he still save her".A film with a good story-line plot and excellent acting contributes to make this a really enjoyable film, which keeps you guessing. Would Definitely recommend this film.</fullReview>

A more relevant title would have indicated what I was getting when I rented it.Otherwise, the movie was okay but not spectacular. Denzel did a good job and the special effects were good.

The only problem I really have with this movie is that he goes back in time and sees why the things he saw in the future were there, meaning that the future he came from included his going back. But if he is going to change the future, there has to be something obvious where he does this, it needs to be something that he knew happened that he is able to change, and then from that point forward everything changes. Plus, that would be a great opportunity for a dramatic visual effect to show that the timeline has been skewed. There is nothing like that, so at what point does the past he goes back to change to the alternate future? Also, to save the people on the ferry, all he had to do was call in a bomb threat and they would have evacuated the ferry. But that would make the end of the movie kind of anti-climactic. I still rate this an 8 out of 10, though, because I really enjoyed it in spite of its pitfalls.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tony Scott Knows Action But Not Necessarily Science Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's make one thing perfectly clear: director Tony Scott does action. Whether it's TOP GUN or THE LAST BOY SCOUT, he knows how to keep viewers riveted to the screen. He's also worked with the best Hollywood has to offer, from Madeleine Stowe and Gary Oldman to Nicole Kidman and Denzel Washington. This last name is significant since Washington and Scott have worked together on several previously successful film ventures (CRIMSON TIDE and MAN ON FIRE), and come together again with DEJA VU.More of a science fiction action-drama, Scott dips gingerly into the genre to test its waters utilizing his own unique style. The staged explosions. The high body count. The dessication of morality through characters. It's typical Scott fodder but brandishing the SF genre adequately if somewhat disrespectfully.There's a lot to like about Deja Vu and one big hunk of burnin' dislike that might make or break it for some viewers (and we'll cover that in a moment). But first, let's look at the film's machinations...Denzel (INSIDE MAN) stars as Doug Carlin, an investigator for the ATF. He's summoned to a ferryboat explosion in Louisiana and quickly wraps-up evidence regarding its cause: terrorism. Domestic or foreign? We're not sure. But the ferry carried a bunch of navy personnel on shore leave, which brings in the FBI. Specifically, Agent Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer, 10TH &amp; WOLF), who realizes the brainpower of Carlin (Denzel) and asks him to join his team of experts. Carlin agrees and Pryzwarra takes him to an elaborate mobile facility where "monitoring" equipment takes on surreal proportions. Carlin meets up with the rest of Pryzwarra's crew, Denny (Adam Goldberg), Gunnars (Elden Henson) and Shanti (Erika Alexander), and checks out the new gadgets (involving wormhole/foldspace theory coupled with time-travel).Carlin isn't immediately let in on how the technology works, but soon surmises that they are looking at the past. Three days past, to be exact. He's also interested in finding out who killed a woman who's body was found several hours before the explosion, burned and battered like the rest of the ferryboat victims but who's time of death doesn't match up. She's a beautiful Louisiana native named Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton, IDLEWILD), and even in death, Carlin is oddly attracted to her. And when he sees her walking around in the FBI's three-days-past time-machine, he knows there's a connection between the bombing and her life.While checking out her kitchen, Carlin also finds a message on her refrigerator ("U Can Save Her"). Who wrote that and why? How can you save someone who's already dead? Racing against fate, destiny, and lateral time-lines, Carlin boldly goes where no man has gone before. And this is where the hitch comes in. When Carlin offers to risk his life to save Paula, we as the audience are supposed to believe that an entire human body can be transported through time using a machine never designed for such a thing (they send back a piece of paper and, in so doing, use so much of the local power grid that they blackout most of the South). Imagine the power required to send something as complex as a person and you see where the problem lay.There is one other thing that I have to mention that bugged the crap out of me, and that was the film's title. Deja Vu isn't really mentioned or hit upon until the closing moments, which made me wonder why they gave it its current title. And Deja Vu is more of a feeling and that didn't come through in the movie.But it was certainly entertaining. Tony Scott has another successful action film on his hands. But you might want to switch-off your overly analytical brain when it comes to the SF elements.</fullReview>

Well-acted and thrilling enough this is most akin to "Donnie Darko" in feel if not in tone. To clarify that further, both movies appear smarter than they are in actuality. Whereas "Twelve Monkeys" has been the only reasonably honest time travel movie (honest as in as much as a science fiction dues ex machina as time travel can be), this film has to be looked at for what it is, merely a popcorn flick for the masses, happy contrived ending and all. That's not a slight against the film, even if my personal tastes don't lean that way for the most part (I can however , unlike some cinema snobs, enjoy one from time to time) The crux of the matter, for fear of me rambling on, is that this film is typical.

		<fullReview>Deja Vu is one of those movies that couldn't have been made even ten years ago. Whether this is good or bad depends on your point of view. This particular film depends entirely on computer graphics and the modern viewer's fascination with video games and pop physics. If you believe the right joystick in the right hands can make virtually anything happen, then you'll love this movie. If you are willing to suspend your disbelief in the miraculous technological gimmickry and just blindly go where the writers' lead, then you may enjoy the fun. Or not.The story is a convoluted mix of science fiction, criminal justice, terrorism, new age humanism and fluff. I sat through the whole thing and groaned at the end. By this measure, the movie was too long. Even accepting the movie's fantastic premise, something just didn't feel right about the kicker at the end. Maybe I got lost in the myriad explanations of the technical wizardry offered by the head computer geek.I watched the DVD version. It was a somewhat pleasant and mindless alternative to an evening of reality shows on TV. By this measure, the movie was just long enough. Although sitting the entire evening with my finger on the volume control wasn't all that pleasant. One moment you turn the volume up in order to understand an especially touching bit of muted dialogue. The next moment you punch it down to avoid having your eardrums blasted back to the stone age by an explosive sound effect. I know the modern geniuses do this on purpose, but do they do it to irritate the viewer or to keep him awake? Oh, well. It's a movie you'll forget the moment the credits roll. I guess I'll give it five stars only because Denzel Washington did his best to make me believe anything's possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the movie is entertaining. camera and editing are really great and work very well with the music. the acting is OK. but denzel washington did better in other movies. he's playing all emotions with his mouth. that's boring after a while. the story is confusing. when doug is following the suspect with that tracing device on the highway to save the girl, he causes a lot of collateral damage. the point in the story is to avoid that people get killed or hurt. but the life of the girl is suddenly worth more, than other lives. that is stupid. also the attraction between doug and the girl comes out of nowhere. he's looking on her through that wormhole and she never saw him before. but suddenly they kiss, as if they were in love for quite a time. for real they know each other for one or two hours. and last, when doug is investigating he finds lot of evidence leading to himself, that he must have been on the crime scene before all the events took place, but he never traveled to the past before. so how can he find something that never happened, or not has happened? i think better and smarter thriller were shot in the past.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whereas this moving is entertaining, when is Denzel Washington not entertaining, how can you possibly have a movie about New Orleans, the Crescent City - and have everyone speaking in a generic voice. New Orleans has a very unique accent and culture and to have a movie set in New Orleans and have no New Orleans accents is ridiculous at best. Also, movies about time travel always absolve themselves from having to be consistent. I think it is the lazy way out and when coupled with no local accents - sorry Denzel = this is a lazy movie. But you can get away with it! With very little effort, you could have added lots of color and culture with just a little bit of New Orleans in your movie about a terrorist act in New Orleans. How hard can that be? You could have masked the obvious holes in the plot of the movie if you had added the local color - and not just beads around the necks of women who bared their breasts for Mardi Gras!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deja vu: predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was too long, like 30 minutes too long. The story line wasn't very impressive or original but the cast managed to pull it off, specially Denzel Washington (DW) and Val Kilmer.The romantic part of the film and DW's infatuation with the girl (and vice versa) seemed forced and artificial but I guess it was necessary seeing how things developed in the second half. I won't even comment on the absurdity surrounding all the "watching the past 4 days after it happens" thing and the time travel.Scenery and photography are flawless.Some parts of the dialogue are witty and make fun out of some worn out clichés, eg the scene when DW asks who is in charge of the investigation and then asks about the coffee pot. Priceless.It's nothing new or groundbreaking but it's entertaining so if your expectations aren't too high it's worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What if you had to tell someone the most important thing in the world, but you knew they'd never believe you?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deja Vu is a very interesting take on the time travel spectrum directors, writers, and producers alike are all interested in. Tony Scott (Man on Fire, Enemy of the State) once again goes with Denzel Washington to boost his movie. If it weren't for Denzel's superb acting, I'd give the movie a 7. Putting aside the silly time-travel lingo tossed around throughout, the movie itself has strong performances and good action/suspense...that's all if you're able to set aside the time travel idea. It IS a pretty far-fetched way to do the whole time travel thing. I didn't find the techno jargon too difficult to grasp/understand from an intuitive aspect, but I have watched this with my family and I had to give a run-down on what they were talking about. I understand, some explaining is needed, but Tony may have extended the details a tad bit too far. I like how he makes Denzel just as confused as viewers are, and realistically Denzel doesn't grasp the science stuff easily. That was a good touch. Denzel actually probably wasn't even acting too much during that part, because he sounded genuinely confused. Denzel is a question man in this movie, and boy he was great in this movie. I love a good Denzel role (which I'm sure most of you do too), and his character is basically the reason this movie did well at the box office, and the reason I (along with many others) bought the DVD. So, the whole time, Denzel and co. are trying to figure out (via intelligent global survey satellite) who really blew up the New Orleans ferry boat packed full of Navy officers and civilians alike (which is shown at the beginning of the movie). In the process, gorgeous new comer Paula Patton is tossed in the mix of the whole bomb act, and thus Denzel forms an attachment to her, and is determined to protect her from what she doesn't know awaits her.The movie is really a romantic action thriller. The sci-fi aspect is overshadowed by a very strong performance by Mr. Washington. I think as viewers, you'll really enjoy this movie a lot by putting aside the sci-fi aspect and watching it for its suspense and thrills. I think Tony should stray away from trying to do far-fetched sci-fi from here on out and just stick to his high-octane action thrillers...and use Denzel because as far as Im concerned, he's one of the strongest actors in Hollywood as of now. Pretty good plot, decent sci-fi aspect, great thrills, and awesome performances make up this movie. I'm Will Black and that's my review of Deja Vu 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good beginning ... lousy ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film with great anticipation especially with actor like Denzel Washington. For most part, it was very entertaining but the ending ruined it. Although I'm a Sci-fi fan, the story line just doesn't gel. On one hand, everyone was saying that history cannot be changed and whatever that had happened, happened. For most part of the show, it seemed to follow that logic - and I liked that. But towards the end, everything starts turning the other way round. The story fell apart! I felt that the ending was done in a 'convenient' manner. I was hoping that the ending would be more thought provoking or at least with a twist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sleeper in '06</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deja Vu really flew under the radar. For it to not have gotten much attention and much publicity, it was very good. It was a good mix of sci-fi, mystery, and suspense. This movie took the age old and much revisited issue of time travel and put a different spin on it. Instead of a machine that gives one the ability to travel back and forth through time to any time or era, the government developed a highly experimental machine that can view exactly 4 days and some odd hours into the past. With Bruckenheimer being part of the production team, you had to expect something decent. Denzel plays his role well, as can be expected, but this movie was more about the story; the who-dun-it aspect of it, the is-he-going-to-be-able-to-do-that aspect of it, and the makes-you-think aspect of it as well. Overall, I really enjoyed this movie, plus it was good to see a movie being filmed in New Orleans to bring some much needed jobs and dollars to that area. "Deja Vu" held my attention from beginning to end, and the ending did not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the movie and I felt desire to see it again . I started it again straight away and strangely, but I had no Deja Vu feeling. Despite I should know what will happen, this was not so important because I was looking for other things from another point of view and I still found new details filling the general picture. Denzel Washington acting is great. Regardless that his role is quite serious he still uses those flashes where he can demonstrate his glamour. The actions are developing really fast. Director smartly does not stress the attention over the great tragedy in the beginning, with turgid screens and visual effects exaggeration. Simply there is no need to do that, the story board is quite exciting.This is a movie for the presence of mind and the power of the spirit.Those of you who like Crash and Lucky number slevin will adore Deja Vu for sure.A classy one and I regularly vote with 9.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's about one of the most Human's ancestral fantasies: To change the past!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How many times do we want to change something we didn't right in the past? How many times do we have this feeling which tells us that one little detail could have changed everything? And how many times do we want to have the chance to come back into the past and do it right? That's the main topic of this movie? It all begun when a terrible terrorist attack happens in New Orleans, a ship full of people explodes in the river. More than 500 persons were killed and there were no survivors. An agent of ATF, Doug Carlin (Danzel Washington), is called to investigate the case, and soon he starts finding some important clues. Then the FBI appeared and Doug Carlin is integrated in FBI's investigation, which is using an experimental (and revolutionary)technology that permits one to see what happened in the past, through a complex flux of energy? When this movies starts it seems that there is something really original/new (the experimental project, at the beginning, is really nice! It's very well done and, by some way, it shows "some credibility?") but when the plot is growing the originality starts to disappear, and all that we see is some clichés that we all have seen before, in other Sci-Fi movies. I think the movie starts to lose its originality and interest when the main character wants to get back in the past and change it? we have seen it before in the movies, haven't we?! And that ending? This "nice looking ending" fits so badly in the story! Wouldn't it be so much better if the "time" and the "happenings" could be faithful to themselves? I mean, the things just happen again the way they had happened before? In my point of view it would have much more logic and would be a "lesser romantic" ending than it was! Though it was an entertaining movie, a typical Hollywood one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action, tension and romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Tony Scott, the one who brought us Man on fire, we have another movie called Deja Vu. The title itself gives us a clue about what's going on. A ATF detective(Denzel)is called upon to investigate a ship bombing that is later revealed to be connected to the murder of a woman named Claire. During his investigation he is recruited in a special division of the FBI. The movie basically focuses on the relation between Doug(Denzel) and Claire, the dead woman while he tries to identify the culprit. (SPOILER)The scene where he goes to the screen and sees her in her everyday routine and he almost wishes he could touch her is just amazing.(/SPOILER). The movie also deals with time and space distortion, but it has some plot gaps, gaps which will be easily overcome. But the main ingredient is the tension, which builds up an releases and so on. This is also done with the help of the fast camera moves and the same image editing used in man on fire(they are brilliant). It's a shame it didn't get a nod for the superb imagery. So there you have it- brilliant acting by Denzel, action and tension, quality image and that superb touch of romance would give it a 9, but the plot holes only earn it a 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER WARNING: Don't get me wrong, this film was very well made. I was taking note of the techniques used and the effects were not too over the top most of the time.The main problem I had with the film arose towards the very end. The film led up to Denzel Washington's character being unable to change anything in the past - which would have made a much more interesting film... too many movies have been based around people altering the course of destiny.The other problem I had with the film was the practicality of the equipment that the FBI were using. Initially, the film alluded to the equipment using different satellite images and thermo imaging from 4 days in the past to produce a world in which investigators could move around in - that was a very very interesting idea, regardless of how difficult it would be to recreate in today's modern world... I liked this idea much more than the science-fiction turn the film made by claiming to fold the time/space continuum in order to look into the actual past.So in summary, the film wasn't bad, it was just lacking so much more.</fullReview>

The incredible female costar? I dunno.Anyway, the 'one time through, time a constant rate of progress: first derivative fixed' with ability to relocate in virtually any zoom-in/zoom-out from any direction, including audio, is something for many to probe futures with.

		<fullReview>If you want to be entertained with visually stunning action and excitement, catch Déj? vu on the big screen, because that's the best way to view this incredible story from Terry Rossio (same writer of the Pirates of the Caribbean series, Shrek, Zorro). Déj? vu has an interesting premise, and if you allow yourself to believe it then you will have fun.Tony Scott teams up once more with his fave leading man Denzel Washington, who comfortably fits into the role (although he overacts in one scene in an angry outburst). The rest of the cast is just as pretty: Jim Caviezel marvelously transforms into a credible villain (from playing Jesus Christ in The Passion of the Christ) and he is exceptionally handsome enough for the audience to both fear and be enamored by his sociopathic terrorist turn. Producer-turned-actress Paula Patton is beautifully exotic, which makes Denzel's decision to save her digestible. Val Kilmer also pulls his own weight, literally, putting on the pounds to amply play a supporting role. Adam Goldberg as stereotypical looking scientist provides welcome comic relief, aptly punctuating tense or boring scenes.Scott's trademark staccato editing and messy montages, which somehow amazingly doesn't confuse the viewers, was perfectly executed, as always, in this Bruckheimer action spectacular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another one of Jerry Bruckheimers unpredictable, brilliant films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deja Vu had me on the end of my seat throughout the entire duration of the movie. I get right into CSI, Cold Case and all those crime scene dramas which is why i enjoyed this film so much. If you like this genre, this is the film for you.One of the most attention wrenching factors that this movie possesses is unpredictability. Denzel Washington does a great job playing his part, however the woman he is trying to save, Claire, seems a little experienced with the general shock a normal person would have.The general prospect of traveling back in time seems a little far-fetched, however Jerry Bruckheimer does a great job disguising the 'fantasy factor,' and makes it seem very real. The excitement you feel overshadows this, therefore you tend to forget about it and concentrate on what's going to happen next.There are several twists within the movie that are not foreseen. At the end, something happens with such a magnitude you think the movie will finish, however once again it ends with a brilliant unpredictable twist that leaves you feeling almost disorientated with excitement. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay let's face it, I don't know if either Denzel Washington or Val Kilmer were told to gain weight for their roles either ways, they were FAT! I'm sorry to sound vain but if they had been Hollywood Actresses, more people would have pointed out this fact. I just couldn't get over how fat they had gotten and so I had to get that off of my chest. Phew! Okay, I'm good. Now on to the movie, which I didn't really like either-ways.The film centers around an ATF agent Doug Carlin (played by a FAT Denzel Washington) who one morning responds to a ferry bombing attack in downtown New Orleans and during the course of the investigation comes to realise that a young woman Claire Kuchever (played by Paula Patton) whose body washed up on the banks of the New Orleans river hours before the explosion seems to be tied to the terrorist attack. Agent Carlin, who falls in love with Kuchever's corpse then embarks on the seemingly impossible task of connecting the two crimes, in the hopes of bringing her killer to justice. Carlin is assisted by Agent Andrew Pryzwarra (played by a FAT Val Kilmer, who by the way has very little to do in this film) who introduces him to a team of surveillance investigators headed by Denny (played by a very geeky looking Adam Goldberg). This surveillance team happens to be in possession of a (okay let me put this simply) time machine that allows one to travel 4 days back in real time, hence the title: Deja Vu. If you don't get that, then I'm sorry you'll just have to go watch the movie because trust me, it took both me and Denzel's character 10 headaches and 2 tantrums to get it too. LOL! All in all, it was good entertainment but not without its faults. How Jim Caviezel thought it was okay to play such a role as he did in this film, after portraying Jesus Christ, it light years beyond me. There are some things you just don't do in life. You don't dress Hrithik Roshan up as a Priest (they did in Dhoom 2), you don't cast Brad Pitt as Jesus Christ (thank God nobody has made that Faux Pas yet, and here's hoping they never do) and you certainly DO NOT cast Jesus Christ (nor the man who played him) as a TERRORIST! I dunno who to blame, casting or Jim himself. I was too unnerved to even judge whether for versatility sake he was good or bad -- acting wise. He reminded me of Keanu Reeves in THE WATCHER -- another poor casting decision. Another thing that irked me about this film was the character Shanti (played by Erika Alexander), she was so annoying to begin with then she just had to add two Faux/forced crying scenes? Her acting in this was painful at best.</fullReview>

Seeing something when he is in the past that he remembers seeing in the future, such as the bloodied rags and so forth in her apartment is not dejavous it's him realising that he was the one who left said rags and so forth in her apartment, nor is him asking if they've met before at the end. So how is this movie all about 'solving the mystery of dejavous' as it states in the trailer? For a take your brain out film it was pretty enjoyable although the beginning sickened me to the point that I almost walked out. It went downhill quite a bit for me with the looking into the past technology hullabaloo though once I watched on for a few minutes I got over it. Would see it again definitely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the original trailer it looked like a typical CSI type of murder investigation mystery. It wasn't until later that I realized that it was a science fiction movie. Despite seeing the average rating for this movie I wasn't expecting too much. I was impressed that the movie and Denzel's performance came across with enough of a feel of reality to the first part of the film that you really get sucked in and intrigued. It allowed me to suspend my disbelief for the remainder of the movie and go with it even though I knew it was impossible. The scenes with the hi tech surveillance reminded me of Minority Report. Usually I rip apart all the things in a movie that are obviously fake, but I think this movie did a great job with all the intricate details and made it seem realistic (despite being completely impossible). I was also impressed with the attention to detail in each scene and how the clues interacted as the story unfolded. This is obviously a complicated story to follow and I would love to see it again to pick up on any other details I missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a problem with 'travel back in time films'. If you go back in time you have the potential of killing your father or another ancestor hence your 'future' existence is impossible. What happens if you 'meet' yourself? That being said this was a great action picture with a breathtaking opening scene. It will definitely be one for the DVD player to pause/rewind and watch it in slow motion.Denzel Washington plays the archetypal, non-conformist, "ill do it myway coz i'm smarter than you" ATF agent as Doug Carlin. I'm not sure why the ATF were involved in a terror attack or even the FBI. Surely it would have been Homeland Security who would have carried out the investigation? He gets recruited to join a top secret FBI operation that has found a way of viewing events from the 4.5 days ago as they happen 'live'. Of course it uses masses of electricity and has been used to explain the various North American blackouts that have occurred over the years.As a sub-plot he is also assigned to solve the mysterious murder of a very attractive young lady, Claire Kuchever, who appears to have died from injuries similar to the terror attack victims. Doug is like a dog with a bone and won't let go of his hunch. With the FBI and their super viewer he tracks down the terrorist and brings him to justice. The FBI "powers that be" then orders that the "viewer" be shut down because the case is solved.At this point I thought we might be in for a typical "conspiracy theory 'the Govt was behind the attack" tangent. But no. Doug goes off on his quest to save Claire and win her heart.Provided that you don't think too much about the whole travel back in time thing then this movie is fast paced and well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Red Herring: In the burial scene, a fifth limo driver joins a group of 4 other drivers. Moments later Washington asks whether there were 4 or 5 limo drivers. Kilmer replies that there were 4. This is never mentioned again. So why bring it up in the first pace?I also have problems with the traffic mayhem Doug (Washington) creates in pursuing the terrorist. He causes numerous accidents, some clearly involving injury to other drivers, yet there is no follow-up for actions that could be considered equally heinous to the terrorist bombing, though on a smaller scale.On another note, however, give Denzel props for wearing the Dillard University baseball cap in the opening scenes in tribute to this Historically Black University in New Orleans, as he promised Dillard students he would when he visited the temporary campus in the New Orleans Hilton Riverside Hotel during filming last spring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not too fond of predictable Hollywood flicks, but hey, I had a free ticket so I thought I'd give it a chance yesterday evening, as I like going to the cinema and there wasn't anything else to see.It would be a lie if I'd say that this one wasn't predictable, at least not in my humble opinion. One could figure out most of the flick pretty fast, and besides the plot, I even found the scene development to be too familiar with the typical Hollywood touch to it; a girl facing herself in the mirror while wearing only her bra on top, the implicit promotion of certain ideals and industries... well, you know it. It kind of makes me wanna throw up, but anyhow... it wasn't too difficult to blindfold oneself for these kind of things and just focus on the plot, as the flick kept a quite decent pace. Even though by judging what's written above might draw one to an easy conclusion that I wasn't fond of the flick it all, I must emphasize that it was after all a quite good brain-dead action. I mean, a flick like this one doesn't require too much of one's concentration.6/10</fullReview>

The problems in the movie, I think, are very actual nowadays, and "deja vu" really forces to think about them. So I call everybody: if you want to see a wonderful, but not easy to understanding movie, you must go to your nearest cinema and watch "deja vu".

Well it started at a decent pace and held it's own, a comfortable cruise through familiar territory in a different vehicle driven by a veteran chauffeur. I overdid it on the pepsi and needed the toilet after 25 minutes, held on as long as i could but had to go, upon my return i sat feeling a lot more comfortable but very confused, this movie requires your utmost attention and i had returned to the wrong screening but it took me 10 minutes to work that out ! Even so the animated movie i had sat in on helped the film along considerably. As most scenarios have now been well and truly covered it was a pleasure to enjoy an intelligent angle on a familiar experience, if you enjoy the latest series of Doctor Who then this will be a film to watch. The acting although not top notch, does not detract from the plot. Somehow i can't help feeling i'd seen it before.</fullReview>

It is true that you can think about it deeply and maybe spot inconsistencies, but they introduce the split timeline theory halfway thru to explain all that away.If you liked this movie then you should see a relatively unknown independent movie called Primer. It is about some guys who invent a time machine and is really nicely put together on a very low budget. The reason being that it doesn't tie up the loose ends so you'll literally spend hours trying to figure out what the hell is (or was) going on.As with this film, if they had tied up the loose ends completely, it would've been dull.

		<shortDescription>The usual Denzel performance, with a strong, subordinate, supporting cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an exciting, involving, thought provoking thriller, this film was an excellent example, and a great addition to the many other exciting thrillers of its type. It had the formula, the gimmicks, the characters, story, and the personalities.Unfortunately, the formula of this movie was also based on the same character that the very competent Denzel always plays. Look closely, and you can see the same persona, same acting and reacting, and same influences and events in this movie that you see in almost everything else Denzel is in. He is the star, up against an incalculable amount of adversity and stress, including most of the other characters around him. But, as always, his character's ego is big enough to take care of the problem.In every hi-tech, or not so hi-tech, story line our hero is in, the script demands that he manually manages the rest of the cast. This management is accomplished by the innuendo of shaming all of the others into their proper places, so that Denzel can accomplish his super hero mission and goal in the plot. A closer look might even suggest a very carefully concealed bias, or even racism, in Carlin, Denzel's character. This character always seems to find it necessary to put all of the others in their places, because all of the other character's explanations of technical conditions don't match what Carlin expects to hear? Presumably, this lecturing, or boisterous act of holding the rest of the cast accountable for every word they utter, sort of shows a little bit of self-infatuation. And, for further food for thought, could we picture Carlin behaving the same way toward a room full of black computer/time warp whizzes, as opposed to the white ones he seems to try to belittle? As a further bemusement, isn't this all too common necessity of the cynical trademark lecture to the subordinates or supporting cast getting a little dry? From a very middle of the road, neutral standpoint, and with an open mind, one can see that though he, Denzel, is the one doing the lecturing, it would be infinitely more logical if he were the one being lectured to. Or even belittled? The nonsense of his scolding the rest of his accomplices for not being clear in their explanations of technical conditions is strictly theatrical, and wouldn't hold any water at all in the real world of science and research.Other than character flaws of this type, that are generally inherent in most ensemble settings, this movie has merit. The unbelievable plot is almost believable, and the film has enough going for it that it should be entertaining to a wide audience. The terrorism theme hits home, since almost everyone is familiar with it to some degree, and there is enough intrigue to hold most audience's attention. Also, as always, Denzel is the perfect and charming gentleman towards the opposite sex. After all, the hero should always be charming and magnetic to help form that hero and rescued girl combination.From the standpoint of story telling, this one is good. From the super hero character standpoint, it is mildly flawed. For an escape, the story is definitely recommended. Just don't pay to watch it hoping to attach any credibility to it.</fullReview>

This movie is so unrealistic, has so many plot flaws and is just generally very dumb.What is claimed to be a time machine in the movie is much more a camera that followed the people in the past. I mean how else could they be "looking" at the past, if there was not a camera capturing the exact space and time at that particular moment, in that particular angle.Somehow, our hero survives the use of the dubious time machine, although, when previously used on animals, they died.I really cannot grasp how this movie achieves such a high ranking here. It is a really stupid movie, that's what it is. Apart from great acting and cinematography, this is the worst movie I have watched in a long time.</fullReview>

It could have been amazing.However, as it is, the movie is reduced to this: things go boom - a lot, women are there to be leered at in the shower by a room full of meatheads or to pray over bowls of soup (thus showing what 'good' girls they are), cars go fast, men do actiony things and talk tough, guns go off and then, just for a change, things explode.Honestly, Denzel Washington and Jim Caviezel are about as wasted in this boof-headed romp as two actors can be. Both are far better than this swill. I can only hope they were paid handsomely.</fullReview>

The technology this team have at their disposal is amazing to say the least- the stuff that they can do and the stuff they can't do is pretty mind blowing - all though Denzel doesn't seem to have too much trouble accepting the rules of the game - but he's always on top of thangs I guess. Writing the script must have been one big struggle to try and explain how this whole time-travel thing works. In the end - it doesn't - but if You can ignore this minor detail - the plot being one big hole - then You'll probably be alright.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously there are other films similar to this one, even, perhaps especially, in recent years. I won't name them here, as that might tell you too much, about this or them, before viewing. I would advise against reading anything about the plot of this before watching it. This presents a couple of interesting concepts(one of which is extremely beautifully realized, and possibly unique), and the explanations, while varied, show that thought was put into this. The tone isn't overly dark, though this surely can be intense, without going overboard. The pacing is good, it never really loses the audience. There's humor, and most of it works. Characters are fairly fleshed out and well-written. Denzel is largely spot-on in his portrayal(it might have been negatively affected by the script, also). Caviezel does great with what he's given, which could and should have been more. The cinematography and editing are marvelous. There are utterly fascinating visuals in this. The action is well-done, effective and entertaining(and at times amazingly thought up and put on the screen). It does beg the question, however... is it perhaps too "Hollywood"? If it had focused entirely on the intellectual aspect of the story, it would definitely have made a different movie. I'm not sure this fully reached its potential. They had places to go that they didn't even seem to consider, and, in that respect, the titles that use ideas akin to that of this feature are better than this. Also, this might be mistaken, particularly from the trailers, for a simple flick with big explosions by some, and they will be disappointed, and selling it short. It has very little language, and not the worst it could be. There is a tiny bit of nudity. Finally, there is violence, a nominal amount of which is strong. The DVD holds deleted and extended scenes, complete with English subtitles and optional director's commentary(that are subbed, as well), and a group of featurettes, each corresponding to specific parts of Deja Vu, that can be played as you watch it(complete with an audio track of Bill Marsili, Tony Scott, and Jerry Bruckheimer, during the picture itself, that seems to have been recorded at different times and put together) or altogether, from the Index. I recommend this to fans of science fiction and thrillers, of productions that ask you to think and can provide food for thought, as well as of the actors and/or anyone else who helped make this. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Tony Scott has managed to accomplish an excellent film by casting Denzel Washington as the lead actor in this film and the mind-numbingly gorgeous Paula Patton as the prominent female character intertwined in a mysterious terrorist plot set loose by a right-wing extremist (James Caviezel). Val Kilmer's performance is above par as well and the elements of this movie go well with its stellar cast.Tony Scott is best remembered for his films like Domino and Man On Fire (which also starred Denzel Washington). Having achieved success in those films, he pulls us into the plot of this film with considerable twists and unexpected occurrences. The premise of this film is simple - a ferry laden with civilians and Navy personnel explodes just after casting off from the docks of New Orleans. Denzel Washington plays ATF agent Doug Carlin, a no-nonsense, determined enforcer who is stunned to learn that the explosion was a result of a bomb meticulously planned and planted.Val Kilmer is an FBI agent who enlists the help of a more experienced Doug Carlin to review and investigate the bombing and slowly reveals to Carlin that they possess the technology to virtually go back in time and conduct surveillance prior to the bombing. Caviezel plays the right-wing extremist and is clearly suited for the cold-blooded, heartless role.Eventually, Carlin discovers that he can save the life of Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton) who is simply at the wrong place at the wrong time. It may get confusing at times but if you've watched 'back in time' movies like Back To The Future and such, you should be able to grasp the logic and practicality of this film.Without giving it away, the film manages to remain interestingly compelling and I consider it a rare heartwarming movie which is well-rounded in all aspects without being over- dramatic.An obvious masterpiece on Tony Scott's part and the talented cast bolster this movie's appeal. A must-see if you're the type who enjoys psychological thrillers like Memento etc. A definite two thumbs up!</fullReview>

Though many would disagree with them I don't think these were good. Deja vu on the other hand is very similar to Enemy Of The State. There is no much of innovative and experimental shootings, only great shooting angles.The difference in this movie, is that it has a very interesting plot with a twist towards the end of the movie. Adding to this a couple of explosions and a good cast sums to two hours of fun. Moreover, it leaves the taste to see it again to catch all the little details.It also recommended to watch it with someone, to discuss the details after wards.Really enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The previews I saw for this movie led me to believe that it was a supernatural thriller like The Sixth Sense or Stigmata. I never got the sci-fi tech angle from the trailers. That ended up being a very pleasant surprise.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Tony Scott's direction reminded me at times of his earlier films like The Hunger or Revenge. The guy's a painter. The look of the film is beautiful.I read a couple of reviews on here saying that the acting was sub-par. Absolute nonsense. Sure, if you're looking for over-the-top hamminess, this film will let you down. Denzel Washington is understated as an ATF agent based in New Orleans. He's got an easygoing way about him and speaks economically. There's a bit of Sam Elliot in this character. Val Kilmer plays an FBI agent with a big secret. He's believably tight-lipped. Both these performances were fantastic. Too many idiots in this world believe that a person has to be bombastic to truly be *acting*. That's why Tom Cruise has a career.Yes, I'll admit that the time-loop logic is flawed but it's not enough to kill the film. It's not a huge glaring flaw that left me yelling "Bullsh*t!" like the one at the end of Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes remake.And along the same lines, I thought that the way the technology was explained was perfect. It was explained exactly the way those characters would have explained it. We're used to films explaining made-up technology to us, the audience, through lots of convoluted on screen exposition. This film chose a more realistic path. "It doesn't matter how it works. Sit down and help us prevent a crime." I like that. If I wanted a lecture on time-travel theory, I wouldn't be going to see a movie.Relax and enjoy a fun movie!</fullReview>

Michigan,, or is it Canada's fault,, yeah some of it is far-fetched granted, but that's what makes it fun.. you get to do what if,, and wow i wonder if that could really happen; and furthermore given our own governments penchant for huge cover ups,, ie.. area 51, Roswell , the last 2 elections, j.fk. need i go any further, Denzel did a great job in this one i thought; he was right on cue with everything that he did in the film,, Val Kilmer wasn't too bad , though his acting looked kinda stiff, and forced, boy did he gain some weight for this role. all in all it was a heck of a ride .. Jerry Bruckheimer, and Tony Scott are a can't miss combination, and with Denzel in the lead , you can pretty well take it to the bank that the movie will be very good to say the least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After an apparent act of terrorism a special ops typed team composed of 5 or so people who have the technology to view 4 days 6 hours into the past of specified area, in an attempt to prevent/apprehend the one responsible.Denzel's character is an ATF agent who gets recruited to the team, and he makes the connection between a dead girl and the bomber. Basically the movie revolves around them trying to warn her about the bomber. The movie is much more detailed than that but that's the main premise of it all.Let's get a little info about the people involved with the movie.Denzel's character is great, as he always is, and he is believable as the agent who cares deeply about solving the case.Val Kilmer and his team are also really awesome. Especially Adam Goldberg, that guy should be a bigger star than he is.The best thing about this movie though is the direction/cinematography, the mixture of the "past" shots and the "real" time shots are great, and there is a sweet sequence where Denzel's character has to chase somebody in the past from the present that is awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>time travel is just to confusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was mediocre at best. Time travel is always confusing and filled with plot holes. Doug Carlin is brought in by the FBI and shown new technology that enables them to view what is happening 4 and half days in the past. They are trying to stop the bombing of a ferry in New Orleans. Doug wants to go back in time to stop the bombing and save Claire, whom he is fond of after having watching her.When Doug hops in the hummer chasing the truck that was driving around 4 days in the past was really pushing the realm of silliness. The whole idea is just to unbelievable. And why didn't someone come with Doug. He needed some one else to where the hat while he drove.Denzel plays the role good as usual. I just don't get time travel films very much. They are too confusing.FINAL VERDICT: I guess sci-fi fans will definitely want to see it. But some of the ideas in this were just too far fetched.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Deja Vu is a stunning blend of Action/Thriller and Sci-Fi that is somehow a very believable ride. Denzel Washington once again shows why he's on so many peoples favourite actors list, bringing so much character to the lead you simply have to want him to prevail.What i liked most of all about Deja Vu is the way it utilises the Sci-Fi without overpowering the movie; it doesn't often feel like a Sci-Fi film even though these elements are essential to the plot, and i think the the film makers deserve massive credit for this seamless blend, which is both captivating and at times extremely cool.I wouldn't say Deja Vu is flawless, but it is certainly well thought out, well cast and well executed, making it a very entertaining movie that most people should enjoy with ease.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am like Will Rogers when it comes to time travel movies, I never saw one I didn't like. But this film added a few new twists. The time travel was combined nicely with a crime investigation and an unusual love story. One sequence where Denzel's character drives a vehicle simultaneously in two time dimensions was great entertainment, and the best part of the film for me.This is one of those films that can be fun to watch a second time, to enjoy picking up some of the subtle elements that were missed the first time through.The story broke a few time travel rules and left some technical aspects unexplained, which will lead to criticism from the sci-fi purists. Closing these gaps would have made the story more complicated and changed the flow, so I think they were justified. I gave it an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Re Vu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard not to spoil the key aspect "Déj? Vu" is hiding from its audience in its trailers, but rest assured the movie is assuredly the most conceptually ambitious and science fiction-tinged film Denzel Washington has starred in in quite some time, and maybe even his career.Taking place in a post-Katrina New Orleans where Washington plays Doug Carlin, an Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) investigator looking into a ferry's explosion that killed over 500, he's brought into the fold by FBI agent Andrew Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer), who introduces him to a top secret, mind-boggling technology that a good portion of the movie invests its plot in.Because of "Déj? Vu"'s heavy dependency on the technology's far-reaching concept, a little mental compromise is required on our part, but it pays off fairly well in the end. In a sense there's definitely flavors from other modern works here: namely "Minority Report," "Enemy of the State" (which producer Jerry Bruckheimer also anchored) and "Frequency," the last of which co-star Jim Caviezel also starred in, albeit as 'The Good Guy' then (he plays Carroll Oerstadt, a patriotically confused terrorist, here).Paula Patton plays the confused damsel in distress in Claire Kuchever, who becomes the object of Carlin's desire early in the movie. She's nothing to write home about, but her role is crucial and delivered adequately.Washington does fall victim to several clichés, one being his formerly frowned upon typecast / now pleasingly expected role reprisal of a keen-eyed city detective. The other is the clichéd "intrigued outsider looking to push the limits of a technology he knows nothing about much to the chagrin of the technology's creators" deal. What the candid Washington does he does well, however, injecting his usual flair of charm and humor to overcome the film's banalities."Déj? Vu" manages to nod towards a number of genres and still make for a compelling two hours that never seem to drift too far outside the lines of reasoning. Despite a number of concepts and details vividly and vaguely familiar, it's a careful mix that quite often works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back To The Future 4 The DRAMA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie as with most movies was marketed sneakily. The trailer made you think it was Deja Vu but in reality it was TIME TRAVEL.This movie wreaks of plot holes, but the biggest problem was the forced scriptwriting to get Denzel into action sequences that were a joke. Apart from the fact that he probably killed several people in the car chase, this was totally unnecessary. For a US Government, Black Ops kind of project, surely if the glimpses of the past 4 days camera goes out of range it would be easier to have a helicopter with a receiver mounted to it to access out of range footage.Come on, sending a guy out in a truck with a helmet that let's you see the 4 days ago NOW, would be the dumbest car chase in Hollywood history, accept for Blues Brothers, but that's a comedy.The scriptwriters had a 22 minute twilight zone episode to work with and were forced to flesh it out in the typical Hollywood formulaic style. BRING BACK TWILIGHT ZONE.The whole thing with the red laser light piercing the time space continuum was in word, LAME, so was throwing a desk chair at highly intricate technology that could create a time space paradox or shut down the entire network, was very immature.If accessing the past was the case, and the fact that they could send back a note stating the facts of the future, why didn't they just send back another note to any one of the characters, like say VAL KILMER or his boss, or the DEJA VU computer geeks. One successful attempt and they give up, only to use a Special Helmet that blocks the vision of the driver. Come on, it's almost as if George Bush was one of the script writers.The clincher was after stating that sending a fly and a small animal back in time failed miserably, why then would they bother sending a human, also why didn't Denzel (A Brilliant Actor, just a bad Agent, where's Ari when you need him), strip down to the Full Monty for his time travel trip, even Arnie traveled back in time naked in T1 and T2.All in all this movie was a multi million dollar Twilight Zone episode that really needed some love and attention to bring it up to speed.Oh Jerry, Terry and Ted let some new writing blood on to the lot, who knows you might earn millions and educate your audience all at the same time.It seems TV is starting to, or already is, out writing FILMS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An overlong, far-fetched thriller that drowns in it's own preposterousness more and more as it goes along</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington- sure I've heard that name somewhere before???) is a Federal Agent called in to investigate when a New Orleans cruise-liner goes up in flames and terrorist activity is suspected as the cause. He crosses paths with Agent Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer) who he starts to work with and slowly piece the case together. But when the charred body of a young woman who appears to have been killed before the explosion is found, he falls even deeper into the case. Then Pryzwarra introduces him to a new technology that causes a ripple in time and see dreadful events before they've even occurred. So now Carlin is faced not only with the possibility of investigating the crime but going back in time and stopping it ever happening.In between making big 'event' movies and Oscar contenders, Denzel finds time to make pot-boiler thrillers like this and the (fairly) recent Out of Time. Not bad filler stuff, perhaps, but Deja Vu is a film that starts to drown so far in it's own ridiculousness that at over two hours it's a rather long slog to sit through.It's a less flattering patch on Denzel's CV just as much as on director Tony Scott's. And yes, you probably do get the impression you've been here before with this kind of film. **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fails to convince in its central concept but still has some good moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A car bomb destroys a loaded ferry on its way to Mardi Gras celebrations, killing hundreds in a terrorist attack. ATF agent Doug Carlin impresses his peers in the early stages of the investigation and is brought onto a select team by FBI Agent Pryzwarra. The aim of the team is to review surveillance footage from about four and a half days before the incident. Carlin quickly smells a rat and is told that the footage is actually made possible by a loop in time and is essentially a live feed from the past. With the murder of Claire Kuchever their only lead, the team start to follow her movements in the lead up to the attack; but can Carlin stay remote from his subjects when they seem so alive in front of him?It is no wonder that the trailer struggled to sell the high concept that this film is built around because the film itself really struggles with it. I'm not even sure where the writers started when coming up with this idea because, although it does have nice touches, it is generally very messy and nonsensical. It is not necessarily a problem in the idea itself but rather in the delivery. Is the central concept in The Matrix (for example) less silly? Well no, but it convinces within the universe created by the film. However with Déj? Vu this is not true and it doesn't manage to sell the idea to the viewer, with nothing really being constant within it and the concept conveniently drifting to help the plot. The problem with this is that it then gets in the way of what is otherwise a perfectly serviceable run-of-the-mill thriller coming out of the Hollywood machine (I don't mean this as a criticise but just an acknowledgement of what it is).As a result it doesn't flow as well as it should because the shaky foundation it is built on keeps on rearing its head. Individual moments are professionally and slickly done to the point that you forget the bigger picture and lose yourself in the moment (Fox's 24 gets by on this same idea of momentum keeping you questioning the past too much) but this doesn't last and soon you can't help but look around you and be unsure.Is it a bad film though? Well, no, it is actually OK but nothing more than that. Scott does all he can be expected to do with the material and he injects as much style and energy into it as he can and does produce a good thriller ? albeit a good thriller build on a very, very weak foundation. Washington is a strong presence and he relies heavily on that ? turning in an OK but entirely predictable performance. Patton is pretty but struggles to build a character with her position in the film ? it doesn't help that the makers decided that she has more value naked in an unnecessary shower scene. Kilmer is solid enough, as are Greenwood, Alexander and Goldberg. Caviezel deserved better than his simple character; he tries hard but can't really be the presence he needs to be.A solid enough thriller then, but just one that is hard to get into and stay with consistently mainly because it fails to deliver its concept in a convincing and engaging way. It has its moments but as a total film it isn't up to much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific, thrilling, engaging .....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film really surprised me. I got a lot more than I expected which was to see a stereotypical action, sci-fi, thriller. But it wasn't at all, it's engaging from start to finish, as you follow every move of the protagonist you succumb to his struggle, his weakness, his hope. This definitely impressed me, with it's clever take on scientific experimentations on changing a future. The way they project the notion is quite over the top but sure is acceptable for the way technologies going on right now. rarely do I actually enjoy a movie for what it is and it's contents, but this one really made an impact.Denzel plays his role as refined as always, as does the rest of the cast, except maybe that I had a little problem accepting caviezels performance. It's probably because his characters undeveloped and all I new about him was that he got rejected by the government as part of the service. Which brings to the conclusion that he really is messed up in the head, why bomb just for an unjustified reason, yes once again his character is crazy. Still I wasn't convinced on his portrayal(it wasn't intense enough). Coming back to the film, it's brilliant explosions, use of effects, camera techniques, that car chase, and unique story telling is definitely worth anyones time. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>decent movie, but time travel is what makes the movie illogical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first hour of the movie was extremely slow, but everything starts to come in place after that. The only thing I disliked about this movie is that it relies on Time Travel. There are many time paradoxes in the film that will make people very confused. The whole movie is basically about a terrorist blowing a ship up. One of the detectives tries to find out who does it and discovers that one of the dead bodies was killed and planted on the ship to make it seem like she was blown up. There is a big machine in which they can "see 4 days in the past" a live streaming video. Doug finds all the clues by looking into the past then decides to get sent to the past to save the woman, so he gets sent to the past and saves her but he dies himself although he still appears at the end of the movie because he was alive in the first place. Confused? I thought so. My head hurts just thinking of all the plot-holes and time paradoxes this movie has but it's just a movie after all... it's not real, so I am not going to ponder all the flaws in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing movie, but negligent towards public wisdom.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It Can be a Spoiler - So read it after you see the movie! Travel in time is not a new topic. There are many movies based on it, some of them excellent works (such as the Jacket or Butterfly effect), but Dejavu has some logical problems. The movie, without the scenes about monitoring and traveling in time, is in no way a fantasy or Sci-Fi. But the very time traveling issue is a fantasy element which is not logically supported by any proper background. On the other hand, if such a facility exists, many more important applications are there for it and the movie could have chosen a stronger application for this. I can also mention it as a weakness that if such a machine uses so much energy and its usage causes black out in the city, why the creators have not foreseen a proper power plant to supply the required energy? Another point is that such a technology is more strategical than it is put in a single person's disposal so that he, at his own discretion and after the working hours can put it into operation all by himself, not needing any technical coordination with other departments or any permission from higher authorities.That the organization having the facility is not interested enough to do such an experiment before a police officer talks them into doing it shows a terrible lack of incentive and sort of carelessness which is not justifiable for any person or entity having such a technology. But As I mentioned earlier, it's really amusing and Denzel Washington plays fine(he did much better in "Man on Fire" though).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually the ratings at IMDb are a good predictor of how good a movie is. How different this turned out to be with Deja Vu! I cannot understand that anybody would give this movie a 6 or higher as a rating.To me it seems that Tony Scott had decided to make another action movie with a typical Hollywood-like love story in it. The kind he's so used to making. But then he thought "well, let's do something different, let's try to be intellectual." This film definitely tried but did not succeed at all. The first hour of the movie was okay but then the quasi-spiritual part started. About traveling back in time and changing history. Including communication with the past, a high speed chase with someone who was driving there 4 days ago (hard to understand? not my fault) and Denzel Washington being morphed back in time like it's no big deal or anything.So, what was the message of this movie? Is it okay to change the past just like that? And how about this: in the attack over 500 people died but the reason why the main character wanted to turn back what had happened was because of this one girl and his partner in the police force. Kind of a selfish thing but hey, maybe that's how the directors see nowadays society...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful thriller, fascinating drama and sci-fi action all integrated into one ambitiously entertaining "Déj? Vu"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's heartwarming to know that the film was shot on location in New Orleans post-Katrina. "Déj? Vu" directed by Tony Scott with Denzel Washington in the lead role is 100% entertaining - top notch delivery all round vs. the disappointing/misleading "Happy Feet" rates only 50% - dazzling animation with musical numbers but poor story (in spite of #1 box office three weeks in a row). A hint to enjoy viewing "Déj? Vu" is to 'shadow' Denzel Washington's character Doug, ATF agent - just stay close to him and you won't be lost. Be fascinated by the space-time travel aspects at the 'time window lab' presented to you/Doug. Suspend your disbelief and you'll follow the plot with excitement and anticipation. A sci-fi fan or not, you'll be caught up with the pace that Doug is traveling, or his mind which is constantly thinking/rethinking, dissecting/searching for evidence, next steps - it's a ride you want to hold on to till the very end. It is human drama after all and you will be content. There are sprinkling of clues here and there if you should recall (but not essential) - loose strings will be gathered and you'll somehow get to understand/put together. Dashes of subtle humor we're given, too (for instance, "we once held hands" so Doug casually said) - it'd bring a smile and quickly we're transported to the next point. Hang in there with Denzel/Doug and a great time you'd spend guaranteed.Distributed by Touchstone Pictures, this is a Jerry Bruckheimer with Scott Free productions. Third time collaboration for director Tony Scott and star Denzel Washington (previously 'Crimson Tide' 1995, 'Man On Fire' 2004). Tight script co-written by Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio (who's also co-executive producer), with matching, enhancing score by Harry Gregson-Williams. Of course, the visual/special effects, explosives and chase scenes are challengingly striking, especially the 'time warp' vehicular sequences. (Washington's role and his air reminds me of his acting in d- Gregory Hoblit's "Fallen" 1998.) Jim Caviezel gave us a devilish heartless villain (yes, quite a departure from the sacred role in d- Mel Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ" 2004). I appreciate the two woman roles: Paula Patton as Claire playing opposite Washington and Caviezel with comparable energy and spunk; Erika Alexander as Shanti sitting there equally with her other colleagues (Val Kilmer, Adam Goldberg, Elden Hensen) at the time window lab - cool, how she describes the branching theory.Should you be interested in absorbing more about the 'fabric of space-time folding,' 'wormhole,' 'string theory,' visit the official site 'dejavu.movies.go.com' - click on 'About' tab and you can download the full production notes PDF file. (On page 8, physicist-consultant Dr. Greene explained in simplified terms about time travel, parallel universes, including the bit about seeing yourself in the mirror, that "you are actually looking at yourself as you existed 16 nanoseconds ago" ).We may have time travel, time warp movies before: d- Robert Zemekis' ever popular "Back to the Future" 1985, d- Peter Hyam's cop thriller "Timecop" 1994 (with Jean-Claude Van Demme), but "Déj? Vu" is special in that the production made the city of New Orleans, its people and landscapes very much 'a character in the film.' At the end credits, it's thoughtfully included that the film is dedicated to the strength and enduring spirit of the people of New Orleans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: Minor Spoilers First off, the movie does deal with Time-Travel but no real explanation given. The only explanation is the wormhole shown buy folding a sheet of paper make point A and Point B intersect which has been shown in numerous movies,by Stephen Hawkins, and probably on the 2nd gen of Star Trek Series.That is the end of the explanation. The government has created a machine that connect Point A to point B. They use it to look back in time and work to prevent a terrorist act.Washington (who is a great actor) does a decent job with the material presented but quite honestly,this move is no better or more realistic than Timecop although it has slightly better acting.If you want to see a good movie about Time Travel then rent Donnie Darko. If you want to see a humorous but unrealistic movie about Time-Travel then rent the back to the future movies.This movie is basically lake house meets Timecop. It has the action segments and the unnecessary love plot just to give en excuse to send Washington's character back to the past.With all this said, if you can turn off your brain, this is not a horrible rainy Saturday Movie when it comes out on DVD. It is just the type of movie you will soon forget afterwords. It is a typical Hollywood affair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The kind of thriller that will send shivers down your spine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a movie that has so many twists and turns, writing a review without a spoiler is a challenge. But if you've seen the trailer you already suspect that this film is part "Enemy of the State" and part "Millennium". I'd add its also part "The Lake House" and part (here's a stretch, but when you it you'll agree) part "Sharkey's Machine". The genre of films/TV shows that explore such subjects such as distant-viewing past events, alternate realities, time travel etc. have to tell an interesting/thrilling story while navigating a minefield of paradoxes and continuity nightmares. When they're bad ("Time Cop"), these films force the viewer back into reality to critique "mistakes". When they're good ("Somewhere in Time"), these movies sweep you along in a state of suspension of disbelief that lasts until you reach that shivers-down-your-spine moment (similar to the big Reveal in "The Sixth Sense"). That's the feeling I got watching this film.Finally, if you are a fan of Denzel Washington playing a character similar to ones he's played in "The Siege", "Out of Time" or "Inside Man", you'll enjoy his performance. He's a great actor, but he also has a knack for playing tough, sympathetic, confidence-inspiring "cops" -- the type you'd hope were working on your case.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was visually UGLY. The grating music and washed out colours are familiar for those who have seen "Man On Fire", but were totally wrong for this movie.The characters are two dimensional. We never really know what Denzel's character is like. We just know that he is lonely and smart, and are told over and over again how selfless and righteous a hero he is.Claire is beautiful, don't you forget that. Every moment she is on screen her beauty, frailty, loneliness and helplessness is rammed down the audience's throat. We really never get past her beauty and object of Denzel's heroic acts. The voyeuristic nature of the machine gives the director a convenience excuse to present Claire on screen in various states of seduction: hanging around in her bra; getting dressed; taking showers. Her worthiness as a human being to be rescued from a terrible fate is COMPLETELY dependent on her beauty and as an object of desire to the male hero.The incredible sexism and the recycled feel of the time-travel ideas in this film made me walk out with disrespect for the director and writers. Well, it's Tony Scott, so one should never expect subtlety anyway. The 3 points are for Val Kilmer, Bruce Greenwood and Jim Caviezel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who is familiar with Tony Scott's directing ability will know to expect an entertaining show with some good action, classic 360 degree aerial shots, and close up camera shots. Tony Scott and Denzel Washington reunite to make another film. Denzel plays the role of a cop who is asked to help the FBI in solving a terrorist attack using some state of the art equipment. In time, Denzel finds out that the power to look into the past has been created and becomes obsessed to save the life of a girl who has died. Denzel does a great job in acting as he always done and is matched with some great action shots and effects. The story itself is a very interesting one and gets you interested pretty deeply. By the end of the movie, there are a lot of unexplained events which causes the audience to speculate what in fact the story was about. Some more clarity could have settled some of these unanswered questions. All in all, if your looking for an entertaining movie with some great action, go check it out.</fullReview>

ATF Agent Doug Carlin(Well acted by Denzel Washington) begins to investigate, he soon comes a womens body, the womens name is Clare(The beautiful Paula Patton), at first he thinks she is a victim of the explosion, but has he digs deep, he discovers that she was killed two hours before the explosion, but he knows it is all connected. When he searches her apartment, he has the feeling of Deja Vu. Soon after an agent(Val Kilmer) brings on an experiment that he and his crew have equipment that can look four days in th past. That is all I'm gonna tell you, I'd rather not give nothing away. But I'll tell you this movie had great tension and great excitement.

		<fullReview>If it wasn't for Denzel Washington, I would've gave this movie a 6, coz this movie, even though it deals with a semi-new concept for Movies, it explains it from a very familiar SCI-FI perspective. And, thus this movie reminded me too much of Minority Report. I like the concept of real-time viewing using satellites and software that will recreate 3d imagery in real-time, that was very cool, and maybe even possible! The only problem is it's similarity with the format of many other movies, thus making every moment predictable and thus boring. It's like we have these Successful Hollywood writers that didn't know how to invest their money for previous successes and therefore are rehashing new concepts with old formula's in order to pay their Rent. LOL LMAO Nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie and the concepts thereof. Did that make sense ? Oh well, I think I'm still recovering from the Columbian Gold I enjoyed prior to viewing the movie. It was awesome. Or like Paris Hilton says about everything she can't truly understand, " It was HOT!" I'd like to see a movie with Paris Hilton, Britney Spears, and Lindsay Lohann and some other Beotch. They can call it, Apocolips: and the 4 horsewomen. The go about destroying the world and in fact they're the the daughters of Satan, sent by him to corrupt the world with their Seduction Debauchery and man raping. Something like that.Okay, that should be 10 lines of finely parsed text. I'm outta here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High-class entertainment, anchored by the usual solid Denzel performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In concept alone, DEJA VU is fairly unique. The government has invented a device that allows time to be manipulated in a way that the actual past can be viewed exactly how it happened. A thought like this could be analyzed forever, but DEJA VU isn't that type of movie, it's an action movie. Which isn't too bad, I guess.Denzel Washington plays Doug Carlin, an ATF agent assigned to a possible terrorist-related explosion on a boat in New Orleans, that has left 543 people dead, including a group of Navy sailors on leave. It is clear very quickly that the explosion was a bombing, not an accident. A woman (Paula Patton) with significant burns marks washes up on shore, but Carlin believes that she was not on the boat, making her a key part to investigating the baffling crime.Called to a secret operation involving the said time warping instrument, Carlin finds himself over his head. FBI agent Pryzwarra (a very chubby Val Kilmer) and a group of techies (played by Adam Goldberg and Elden Henson in a couple of seriously funny bit parts) explain that they can go back in time four days and see the past. Things get interesting when not only does Carlin start seeing the past, but starts living in the past. The movie's most exciting and conceptually innovative scene is a car chase in which Carlin chases after a person who is actually in the past. Trippy? I think so. In all seriousness, it is one of the best chase sequences of any kind ever put into a film.While the film is almost great, it stops short of greatness. Where similar sci-fi masterpieces such as THE MATRIX capitalized on its epic, mind-bending concepts, DEJA VU wimps out in a way at the end, closing on a good note, but only after a disappointing final scene. Overall though, it is high-class entertainment, anchored by the usual solid Denzel performance and with restrained direction from the usually frenetic Tony Scott (DOMINO, anyone?), as well as a thought-inducing premise.Review written by James Chapel for www.boxofficefanatic.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very tight screenplay that had me satisfied in the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie sneaked its way up to release without a lot of fanfare, which is unfortunately because this is a really well done movie.In simplest terms, Denzel Washington is ATF agent Doug Carlin investigating a New Orleans ferry bombing, and ends up falling in love with a woman victim of the incident.*** SPOILER WARNING *** Quite early in the movie, we are introduced by a new piece of surveillance technology that is capable of seeing anything that happened exactly four days and some hours prior to the present. It also turns out, that some of the present time can leak back into the past to the subjects being surveilled. With this equipment, Carlin has to piece together the events leading up to the ferry bombing, and perhaps influence the past enough to prevent the bombing from happening at all.Given this premise, the first third of the movie needed a stronger than usual dose of suspension of disbelief in order to accept that the smoke-and-mirrors bill-of-sale the operators (which to some extent remind me of the Lone Gunmen trio from the X-Files) of the machine tries to unload on Carlin in trying to explain the technology at work. Bear with the story however, and you will be rewarded in due time with a more proper explanation of facts. Keep watching the movie, and you will see all the loose ends tie up nicely.This is a very well written and tight screenplay. Give it a bit of slack at the beginning, and you will come out content.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is very difficult to make a film of this type without leaving "loose ends." In this case, they have succeeded to tie up everything very well. It is the sort of film you have to see again to catch all of the nuances. As usual, Denzel Washington delivers a great performance. It is a credible screenplay which delivers very well on its premise. The choice of location is especially appropriate. The parallels with the perils in today's world cannot be missed. There is no "grandstanding" or "preaching." It is a very well executed presentation of a very well written and excellently cast screenplay, and all involved are to be congratulated. I will see it again, and likely purchase the DVD. It is an "action movie" with intellectual depth, a rarity.</fullReview>

It would have been better to play that point by slight of hand. The technology, while believable in the a theoretical realm, is not practical, but after all, that is what movies are all about. Doug Carlin offers many insights into what is really going offers many twists as to story line as the movies progresses. Doug will go to any length to save a woman for who he have fallen for.

For his insight to analyze and quickly distinguish the relevant from the secondary crime scene, "Carlin" is integrated into a mysterious research team.Tony Scott's films always have detractors and supporters, who after seeing the film I am among the fans. This new film by Scott Quartet, Breuckherimer, Washington, Gregson-Williams brings controversy to have a terrorist as a script, which in America is very sensitive (remember the 11-S), but this can not be an impediment for become one of the best action movies of 2006."Déj?

In conclusion, this work is a must for movie buffs. It is an entertaining film and leave a good taste who like this genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ownership of some 700 plus DVD's and a couple of thousand Beta, VHS, &amp; Laser Disks I play movies most of the day and night. Tony Scott is in a class almost by himself. His art is always captivating with constant repetition. True Romance is my all time favorite Enemy of the State Spy Games Man on Fire Domino Deja Vu Mr. Scott's ability and artfulness increase with timeIt's like great music that never grows old or stale. The images, the dialog, the cinematography, the soundtrack all come together to stimulate the senses. Deja Vu ranks right up there with these works of art. It gets better and better as it grows on you like great music. Like the plot of Deja Vu - I can replay this over and over finding something new on each viewing with concentration OR I can simply keep it running as background while I write this or do other things. It's great art on the screen and great sound in the room. Deja Vu is complex and strange and a bit difficult to follow. After seeing it in the theater I wanted to stay and watch again. It's actually preferable to watch and re-watch on DVD. If you appreciate the style and pace of Man on Fire, Spy Games, Domino, Enemy of the State and True Romance you will appreciate Deja Vu. The acting is terrific - the characters are engaging and sympathetic. The tension and action are superb. The storyline is thought provoking and intensely interesting. Frequency, Groundhog Day, Peggy Sue, Time Machine, 12 Monkeys, Minority Report: If the subject matter of changing the past engages you then this particular version may astound you. Read REPLAY and hope someone makes the movie. This movie will be on my replay list in my 400 disk DVD player along with the other Scott Free titles listed here. The only 'holes' in this film are in the limited mindset of the reviewers here. Enjoyment of this film may require a liberal open mind and the willing expectation of wonder. Not for consumption by the constipated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Above Average Example of Typical Hollywood Dumb Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Deja Vu" is a movie along the lines of "Enemy of the State", where the basic premise is acceptable and the actors likable, but the plot depends on too much contrivance and a lazy script that insults the viewers' intelligence. Contrast this with exceptional genre films like "In the Line of Fire", and you can see how much more memorable such a film will be when the plot is both realistic AND thrilling.While I was generally entertained by the action, I was also constantly distracted by things that just made no sense: SPOILERS***** When Denzel Washington's character is shot through the body (not just a flesh wound), he is not at all bothered by it...he is not hurting, not in shock, not inconvenienced or disabled, and not even really bleeding....are these actors and directors intelligent enough to at least add some small element of incapacitation when characters are injured like this? This reminds me of "The Bourne Identity", where Matt Damon's character is fished out of the sea with multiple bullet wounds. All he is wearing is a foam wetsuit, yet the bullets stop just inside the skin, as if he had a steel body under the outer layer...this makes him recover immediately after the ship crew digs the slugs out of, oh, 1/2" inch deep holes...what, no punctured lungs, arteries, nerve damage, internal bleeding? What crap! One has to suspend a certain amount of credulity when viewing fictional films of this genre, but what cretins the screenwriters must think the viewers are when they come up with these amazing computer labs where only a few talented, and very young, people have such immediate access to everything. Anything the lazy script writers find convenient for the plot is suddenly possible with the wiggle of a joystick or the tapping of a few keys. I wonder where the lab is that it can be hooked to the power grid in such a way that it can cause a black out over a huge region? Must be a really big extension cord. Sorry, but a single load cannot do this...I'm in the power industry, but almost anyone can figure this out easily enough.The time warp machine has a limited radius, but it can magically fold time at a remote location over a low power headset device? Geez. We need better writers, Hollywood! That said, the dual car chase, with a car in the present chasing a car in the past was a pretty cool concept.I just got all clammy when Denzel aimed a laser pen at a flat screen monitor showing the folded-time woman in the past, and she saw it on the wall of her house. I don't care how the machine works, a monitor is a monitor and does not work backwards. Even if it was a special two way monitor designed by the creators of the lab, then it follows that the people in the past would all be standing around looking at the funny people in the lab watching them like so many zoo animals...if it is two-way, then all light would go through backwards, not just the laser pen light, for God's sake! I'm just getting started, but you get the idea.In my opinion, this movie will insult and bother intelligent, thinking viewers. Only through deliberate effort can such a viewer shut down their higher cognitive functions sufficiently for the film to be enjoyable.</fullReview>

Convoluted high concept thriller with the ultimate What If scenario - to wit: What If you could go back in time to save someone you loved from a horrible fate would you? That's the ultimate decision for an ATF agent (Washington) to make in his investigation of a terrorist bombing of a ferryboat in New Orleans as he discovers a top secret scientific team who are capable of time traveling in a 4 _ day window that asks more question than it answers, namely the scenario at hand's difficult chore set up by a hard-to-swallow script by Bill Marsilii &amp; Terry Russio and the hyperkinetic direction by Tony Scott just makes things implausibly laughable in spite of the Jerry Bruckheimer machine chomping at the bit with its over-the-top pyrotechniques and flashy visuals.

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film, but it had some uncomfortable moments. Denzel is his usual suave self and the story has some thought provoking, science fiction implications. Time travel paradoxes always make for interesting flights of fancy.The major thing that bugged me, though, was Doug Carlin's rant at the scientists/technicians over the time machine after he realizes he can affect the past. I felt uncomfortable during his rant and felt that it was an unnecessary plot dump.Magic technological devices in film just are ... they do not have to be explained.

		<fullReview>I personally thought this was a very good movie. intriguing concept for the plot. I liked how the a lot of the things we saw at the beginning came back to mean something at the end, even the small things. Denzel is always great. New Orleans was a great place for it to take place. I liked how they did show the devastation there. They didn't just film there and ignore what happened. The city became a character. I do think they could have done more with Cavaziel's character. he was great but didn't get as much of a chance to shine. I don't recall seeing the female lead in anything else before but she was good. Tony Scott once again did a great job directing. i think he has a great original style that comes out in all of his movies. Definitely one of the better Denzel movies in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What else should you expect out of a movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the movie at a Preview Screening at CSULB, despite the numerous technical difficulties, the movie was pretty good.When you hear Bruckheimer's name associated with anything, you usually expect something cutting edge that does not insult your intelligence, and this movie delivers on that. The plot, while not perfect or fully believable, had my interests up quickly. It has a hint of CSI flavor as the audience gets to see evidence and how it got there.I will agree with the other poster, in that the character development was pretty weak. The audience gets very little insight as to the lives of the characters, as well as what drives them to do the things they do. The acting was okay, but I cannot help but picture Washington on the football field in scenes where he chews gum.Back to the plot; the whole premise of the movie has little in common with the phrase Dejavu in that the audience is not convinced enough that the characters actually feel like what they are experiencing has happened before. It was odd how they turned a seemingly simple crime investigation in the beginning to an elaborate time travel plot. Much of the physics involved makes sense, yet some do not. However, keep in mind that it is a movie, made to entertain and not compel people's minds.Overall it was a decent movie. Once again no movie is perfect, and this movie had its highs and its lows. As described it is a huge mix of genres: action, drama, sci-fi, and some humor which works well enough to keep you on the edge of your seat.</fullReview>

He did a great job as a corrupt cop in Training Day. I was amazed by the weight gain of Val Kilmer. An actor I liked in Batman Forever and The Saint. Val Kilmer pulls a great job as an FBI agent. Overall, the movie is great, entertaining and thrilling. The film deals with theoretical physics. The movie tries to give an explanation of the folding of space. I recommend this film with an enthusiastic audience. To have an idea about deja vu, I recommend this film.

		<fullReview>This film starts well but descends into a mess of sci-fi nonsense pretty soon. Set in post Katrina New Orleans, US scientists have apparently managed to create worm holes and have warped space time fabric so much as to go back to past and even alter it. Yeah - right! Let them build better levees first.Anyway once you are on a slippery slope there is no turning back. Denzel and his merry men start going into the past and altering it. First it is a note that is sent through something that seems like a nuclear powered microwave. Then comes an even more moronic trip on a hummer with a space age goggle that looks at the past. Everything comes to a head when Denzel himself goes into the microwave to be teleported back to the past. But he only had to wear undies. Not even shoes for some "scientific" reason.The movie continues its downward spiral with Denzel falling in love, managing to alter the past (of course), dying and coming back again and making sure that the initial explosion never took place. All the children and families are alive ... thanks to this incredible machine that can now change the past. Hey - maybe in a sequel (god forbid) they will improve the machine enough to undo 9-11 or Katrina or even maybe WWII.The whole movie is just an insult to intelligence of the viewer.</fullReview>

The way it's all edited together really works for the story and adds to it.**potential spoiler** My absolute favorite scene in the whole movie is an amazing car chase that will absolutely blow your mind. That scene like so many others in the movie is filled with some very cool ideas about time, the present, the past, etc. I recommend this movie for anyone who loves Denzel, previous Tony Scott movies like Man on Fire (which I loved), or great action films.

		<fullReview>I saw this movie tonight and I thought it was pretty good. Usually I try to steer clear of time-travel movies because they seem too stupid to bother with. Time-travel is not possible and to try to make a movie where everyone is skipping around in time is just irritating.It's because they try to explain too much. I'm fine with wormholes and "bending space" but when they go into to all the scientific explanations, my suspension of disbelief starts to falter. I want to understand but never will because time-travel (TT) is just not possible.They did a good job working with TT in Deja Vu. It wasn't the movie revolving around this phenomenon, it was a good plot, some exciting action, and interesting dialog and situations... and some TT.Aside from time, I liked the way the movie looked. Like all the Tony Scott films, it has a gritty feel and there was a lot of motion--whether it was people running around or just the camera moving around still objects or people, I felt like I was in a hurry. Very edge-of-your-seaty.The only thing I didn't really like was TT-related. I won't give it away, but when it happened I immediately thought "This is why they shouldn't make movies about time-travel." Of course, I only thought that after I said out loud "DUH! Why can't you see that?!" But it was only a little thing and the forehead-slapping moment went away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely entertaining movie, although probably impossible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't exactly sure what to expect when I walked into the UCLA sneak preview, but boy was I glad I went.First off, what surprised me most about the movie was how sci-fi it was. I thought it'd be some supernatural phenomenon regarding deja vu, but it's really not, and even though the story they try to spin is fairly far fetched, it sounds cool. Don't try to analyze it afterwards either because you'll probably find some hole and then you'll think its dumb. Just watch, don't think. Overall though the story was pretty easy to follow.The cinematography was beautiful too, very stylish. The action scenes were intense and very realistic, similar to Tony Scott's other movie Man On Fire, which I thought was pretty good too. Deja Vu compared to Man On Fire? I think Deja Vu wins... but only by a little tiny bit.Denzel Washington is GREATTT as always. Val Kilmer is slightly weak in his role, but not to the point where it's painful to watch. He's also gained some weight... and has a weird bump on his neck. As for Paula, I haven't seen her in any movies before Deja Vu, but she is pretty convincing as well, and not to mention HOT. Acting overall was solid.The ONE thing that peeved me was the extremely WEAK love story that they tried to weave in. No. That's all I have to say.Long story short, go see it when it comes out. It'll be worth your money. 1337</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have you experienced this before? Quite probably . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever had the feeling that you've seen something before? Like when you're in a cinema and it all starts looking sickeningly familiar. Tony Scott's new movie starts with a hectic mix of shots of people having a good time but the discordant editing or whatever made me say to myself, "Any minute now, there will be an explosion or a similar disaster." I waited another full minute of meaningless collage. If this was TV I need that explosion about now to stop me changing channels. And then, sure enough, Whooooomph! Big explosion. Déj? vu!Denzil Washington is a law enforcement officer (Doug) who cannily discovers, after the explosion, a woman burned to death. Except that closer examination reveals to him that she died beforehand, so her death is probably a clue to the terrorist. He joins an elite force with the technology to see four days into the past. They give him an unbelievable explanation as to how this is done, and eventually a 'real' explanation (which is not done very convincingly either). Doug, being the sad, sensitive type, has fallen in love with the dead woman and offers to be flung back in time to save her ? just so he can prevent the devastation of course.About this time you will be getting Déj? yoohoos along the lines of, "I think I've seen this before ? was it in Terminator II or The Prestige?" At least by this point the explosions-per-minute ratio has ratcheted up a bit, so you may grudgingly feel you're getting your money's worth. But when you realise the two best scenes were in the trailer, it's easier to accept you've been had and just spend the rest of the movie waiting for them to appear.On the plus side, the action does eventually kick in, making it at least better than a bad episode of CSI, and a car chase conducted simultaneously in two time frames stretches the brain momentarily. Against this is a sci-fi element that will be clumsy and unconvincing to the most credulous of sci-fi fans and it bit too daft for those who hate such things. I was touched by the fact that it was made in post-Katrina New Orleans, although they probably needed the tax breaks just to break even.Déj? vu is neither pleasantly mind-numbing entertainment nor intellectually stimulating sci-fi, but is a tolerable action movie with a sweet enough twist. Some of the sets are cleverly constructed and the plot is a bit different to the average cops and robbers movie. Ironically, it is not likely to be a film you will remember.</fullReview>

Although Tony Scott's Deja Vu will never be accused of being awful, it's too dumb--on a logical level--to be taken seriously.Yet.This homegrown-terrorist-blows-up-500+-people-and-it's-up-to-Denzel- to-use-time-bending-to-save-the-day-suspenser is so entertaining that, ya just can't get angry with it, right down to the part where somebody shows up at the end of the flick you thought should be dead.I'm not hitting that spoiler alert, period!Time travel movies are, by and large, incoherent and illogical. Nothing new here with Deja Vu, but Washington and Paula Patton and Jim Caviezel and Adam Goldberg are all such comfortable performers that I actually shrugged at one point and got my harumph out of the way. Do not go all Spock on this flick. You'll become an annoying, overly-analytical, barely-literate movie critic with a zillion reviews on IMDb.And we wouldn't want that to happen to anybody!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most apposite movie title EVER!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deja vu indeed. Already seen. Over. And over. And over.And over.It was a pretty interesting flick until around the middle: the point at which the indomitable Denzel decides to go back in time. It had to happen though. I mean, without his going back in time, we'd have had a movie where he didn't French a broad, and that just simply wouldn't do!So, notwithstanding a solid first half, how is this movie idiotic? Let me count the ways:* Though sending living organisms through the "wormhole" had been tried before with disastrous, yea lethal, consequences, Denzel pulls it off with nary a cardiac arrest.* Denzel then strolls out of the hospital a few hours after said cardiac arrest (I'd like to see the fittest of patients do that in real life!) and proceeds to perform high-speed driving stunts to boot.* The obligatory damsel in distress had been kidnapped, blindfolded, had gasoline poured all over her, witnessed a massive close-proximity explosion and a gun battle. That would permanently traumatize to the point of delirium all but the most stoic and hardened of soldiers, never mind an innocent yuppie. Yet, literally 10-15 minutes later she's pulling a gun on Denzel, in total control of the situation, and then joins him in hatching up a daring and cunning plan.* We get to see Denzel's chiseled torso. Yay.* We get to witness a spark between Denzel and the damsel, set to schmaltzy muzak. (All the while, remember, the bomb is ticking away!) I guess it was meant to be a poignant "Aaaawww" moment, but it was so contrived and jaded that I just laughed. Such drek has the effect of lowering my impression of a movie by 20% right there. Here's a clue for ya, Hollywood: Real people don't fall in love while cleaning each other's gunshot wounds barely a half hour after they first meet. Take a few lessons from Bollywood about how to present a believable and moving romance.* The terrorist's motivation is never really discovered or disclosed, nor are his cause and affiliations. Yet, he - a lone, homegrown, wolf - manages to drive an S.U.V. without license plates and with a bomb the size of a barrel onto a ferry with hundreds of military personnel on board. Yeah. Right.* Upon realizing something was amiss with her beau's original plan, the heroine jumps onto the ferry from the shore. Nobody, apparently, detects that. One wonders why anyone bothers buying a ticket to go on a ferry if it's that easy to get on board for free.* The terrorist DOES make her though, but - whaddaya know - does NOT kill her! Instead, he tapes her mouth and locks her in a car. In the driver's seat. *double facepalm** The terrorist does, however, kill without a how do you do at least a half dozen heavily-armed servicemen wearing flak jackets, in addition to a few guards.* With bullets flying nineteen to a dozen on the lower deck, the seamen and other personnel crowd the upper decks, literally falling over themselves, to observe the spectacle.* The heroine starts up the vehicle whose steering wheel she was conveniently placed behind, and at the pivotal moment drives into the terrorist.* Several armed agents empty their magazines into the runaway vehicle with a massive bomb in it. But. Do. Not. Hit. The. Bomb.* Denzel dies. *bawl* But two minutes later another Denzel comes along. *whoop* The two ride off into the sunset... - or some such. *a tear*Give me a fracking break.And I don't mean "fracking."The thing is, Denzel Washington is actually a good actor, and I like him a lot. He is one of the few able to deliver his lines in a way that sounds totally spontaneous, almost as if ad libbing. This guano was beneath him; if I was him, I'd keep it off my Resume.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much info</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Déj? Vu is the kind of frustrating movie you can only appreciate if you understood it, which isn't an easy task when you consider the great mass of information one has to process between the different timelines. And you tire so much trying to figure out what is going on and rearrange the different elements of the plot that it takes away all the pleasure of watching a film, and in this sense we can say Tony Scott missed the boat.Moreover, the script is extremely convenient when it comes to technology: even though the science fiction context allows a lot, some credibility doesn't hurt, the English director went a little bit too far here.Paradoxically, this movie undeniably deserves a second viewing, but one doesn't necessarily want to see it again, especially as the time travel theme has been the subject of a lot other better productions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Potential classic ruined</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Major, major spoiler alert, because I'mm going to be talking about the ending. Deja Vu has all the makings of a classic, a sort of Memento meets Back to the Future, with twists as iconic and unexpected as the 6th Sense, Shutter Island or The Crying Game. But it all went wrong.I can suspend my belief enough to cope with the sheer implausibility of the science. Of course it's ridiculous - but this is sci-fi, although just why this amazing technology only works in central New Orleans is somewhat beyond me, presumably only as a pretext for the daft car chase scene, in which our hero manages to kill about as many people as died in the terrorist attack he is so intent on solving! And the way the pieces started fitting together was excellent. As Denzel explores the world of 3 days before, there are plenty of 'ah, now I understand' moments as we discover why his partner's car was on the boat, why his fingerprints are in the girl's flat, etc. The message is clear - no matter what Denzel does, he can't change the past, for his 'past' actions have already happened.The tension is knowing that no matter what Denzel does, the girl is going to die and the terrorist attack is going to happen. But then, for the sake of a Hollywood feel-good ending, Denzel does manage to change the past. But for the real cinema fan, the happy ending is really a disappointing one. Yeah, it's lovely to see the happy couple drive off together at the end, but that happiness is destroyed by the fact that in order for it to achieved, the whole film no longer makes the slightest bit of sense. A potential cinematographic masterpiece is suddenly no more than Hollywood trite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never mind the science just give it more cowbell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writers just love getting their hands on an excuse to do a time travel story. This shallow tale wades out into the murky waters but rarely immerses itself fully in the potential scientific and philosophical implications of what the characters claim they are doing. The result is a story that only works if you go with it and just accept things happen for narrative reasons and the magic time travel device is just there to do whatever needs it needs to do to accomplish thatATF Agent Doug Carlin is this film's identity of the standard Denzel Washington investigator savant character, so he's a no-nonsense clear thinker with Sherlock Holmes' observational skills and deductive reasoning abilities. A ferry full of sailors blows up while it crosses the Mississippi at New Orléans on Mardi Gras. Doug is one of several investigators on the scene. He gets spotted by FBI agent Paul Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer) who is impressed by his cool investigator skills so he recruits him to a super secret squad who have a magic time traveling spying machine that can give them a God's eye view of anything anywhere within the range of the machine but it can only see what happening 4 days 6 hours into the past, no earlier and no later. It has something to do with Einstein's rosy bridge according Dr Alexander Denny (Adam Goldberg) the scientist who accidentally tore a hole in the universe. It is two-way but it takes a lot of energy to send mass through it and it kills animals going through it (or crushes them into a tiny massively dense points of unspecific matter). You can probably see how this will go, but for now they use it to spy on people to see any sign of someone who might want to blow a bunch.. sorry, blow-up a bunch of sailors. They want Doug to use his unique abilities to tell them where to point their magic cameras. Doug has info on the dead body of Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton) who was found in the river but had died before the ferry explosion from the same type of burns as the victims on the ferry. The car bomb that blew up the ferry was also in her van so Doug has them spy on her (you can see why they needed Doug's amazing deductive skills here).Doug had the hots for Claire when she was a crispy-fried corpse so obviously he falls for her when he sees her walking and breathing (and showering) in the past. But Doug's really not satisfied which watching what happened in the past, he wants to change it. He sends a message back for himself but his partner Larry picks it up instead so rather than dying on the ferry Larry gets shot and his body is fed to the alligators. To get there was a pretty amazing, and very stupid, car chase with Doug following in the bomber in the present day as the bomber drives to his base in the past, using a portable helmet version of the big magic box. Now they know the bomber is Carrol Oerstadt (Jim Caviezel) who is one of those paranoid nuts engaged in a personal war with the American Government. He is arrested and the FBI are happy with lone maniac story so they shut down the magic box.No film would be happy with story that ending like that and we already have the rest all set up so inevitably Doug is going to back in time, rescue the girl, get the bad guy and save the day. At this point there is plenty of hints that this not the first time, lots of little clues that another version of Doug had already tried and failed to change events at least once before (or three times according this time-line from Wikipedia). I have to say this plot is clearly driven by the director's desire to tell the story his way with little attention to logic or stopping to explain itself to anyone thinking "Wait a minute , what?" There is something exhilarating about being along for the ride on Tony Scott film and despite my snarky tone I did enjoy this one.Rating 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So let me get this straight, you're trying to tell me that on the other side of this bridge, is the actual past?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Déj? Vu is directed by Tony Scott and written by Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio. It stars Denzel Washington, Val Kilmer, Bruce Greenwood, Paula Patton, Matt Craven, Adam Goldberg and James Caviezel. Music is scored by Harry Gregson-Williams and cinematography by Paul Cameron. Plot finds Washington as ATF Special Agent Douglas Carlin, who takes up the investigation when a ferry is bombed leaving many dead. Struggling thru with conventional investigative methods, Carlin's job receives an unexpected, and bizarre, boost when Special Agent Paul Pryzwarra introduces him to a top secret time machine. The device can show the events leading up to the bombing, but can Carlin avert the tragedy?With Jerry Bruckheimer involved in the production and Tony Scott directing, there's really no surprises as regards the texture of this film. Time travel is the given excuse this time, the premise smothered in bangs, crashes and adrenalin fuelled excess; with Washington adding considerable screen charisma as the focal point. The plot's a bit of a head scratcher if you try and delve deep into it, so best just to sit back and enjoy the ride. Take in the fun to be had with the notion that the cops have a time machine, therefore the baddies (a seriously creepy Caviezel) are at a disadvantage. Shift uncomfortably in your seat at a troubling love story etched into the narrative, and marvel at prime Scott chaos during a split-screen car chase. It's dumb popcorn fodder for sure, but at least it's fun dumb popcorn fodder. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time and again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tony Scott is a funny director, funny in the sense of bewildering at times. He can bang out an instant classic like "True Romance, "Crimson Tide" or "Man on Fire" but also crank out instant turkeys like "The Fan" and "Domino." He also has directed his share of hackneyed Hollywood fare like "Enemy of the State" and "Days of Thunder." In the case of "Deja Vu," this quasi sci-fi effort falls somewhere in the middle. The first half is breathtaking, beginning with the abrupt explosion and sinking of a vessel with hundreds of people aboard. ATF agent Denzel Washington investigates, and soon discovers the body of a woman that has washed ashore in the aftermath, but that was actually killed days before the bombing. He senses a connection. Government types show Denzel a sort of time machine, a device that allows them to view events several days in the past. They use the contraption to try to spot the bomber, and this is followed by a wild car chase wherein Denzel uses the device to "pursue" the bomber prior to the bombing. From there, things go quickly downhill. Denzel figures the machine can be used to actually travel back in time, and does so. His journey into the past is so preposterous as to ruin everything that went before. While there is shifts it focus to a romance angle between Denzel and the mystery woman. My advice: watch the movie up until the point when Denzel takes off his clothes and climbs into the machine. Then go find something else to do. Better yet, watch "Man on Fire" again, which doesn't strike a single false note.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How on earth does this kind of a film get 7.1 from the respected IMDb? The idea is that the US gov has invented (once again) a machine that can use satellites and surveillance cameras to see everywhere, including inside buildings. The acting is OK and the camera work is good, but I just don't get over those technical stuff, the ever beeping and flashing "computers" that can do everything else but change a light bulb. I do like Denzel Washington as an actor, he has good minimal movements in this film that make it human. There are even a few surprises, even if there are some "I knew it" -scenes. This movie just reminded me too much of Ghost Busters... When I want to see a time travel movie I try to find a comedy, such as Back to the Future. TT</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Someone should tell the writer of this film that if Denzel comes back from the dead at the end of the film, the lady who is alive is really dead because that's exactly what happened.When a ferry boat mysteriously blows up, killing over 500 people terror is rightly suspected. With terrorism on our minds constantly, this seems to be a good picture. The film virtually collapses when it becomes highly technical about using technology to get back into time. It is also very conveniently used to prevent this tragedy from occurring.The acting here is good but the problem is that these time-machine films boil down to the unrealistic. The film was often muddled as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There isn't another director working today whose films I look more forward to than Tony Scott's. Not his brother, not Spielberg, not Howard, not Tarantino,not Nolan, not Rami,OK maybe Scorcese and maybe the Coen brothers, but Scott's strength is that he is the PT Barnum of today's directors. Take Deja Vu, ridiculous plot with holes you could lead an elephant through (to continue with the circus metaphor), and yet not a frame was wasted. Critics have said that the convoluted plot took so much explanation that it dragged, and I just didn't feel that one iota. One thing Tony Scott's films don't do is drag. He just entertains like no other filmmaker today. Besides the Usual Suspects, True Romance is my favorite film of the last 20 years. The rest of his films are just solid entertainment. He is on a role that I hope will last for another 30 films. I love the guy, and Denzel is terrific as always of course.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing, if You Forgot Logic !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's undoubtedly a pretty movie. In rare time Tony displays the sane, more mature, side of him. I think that he released his passion for rotating the camera through the Snow white program's shots, so the rest was smart, sedate, and not showy. In a word artsy more than technical. Actually the problem isn't with the directing here. It's surely with that script.It's the good guy, the girl, the bad guy, the chase, the climax, and the happy ending. Yet, in such a different creative plot this round. The imagination is so wild; there is a mystery to be solved, a criminal to be caught, a crime to be stopped, and a love story to be complete all by time travel; it deserves the 9 years that scriptwriters (Bill Marsilii) and (Terry Rossio) sacrificed to finish writing it. I adore the time travel movies. The factor is magical and brilliant. Few managed to be as magical and brilliant. Here, it's magical but not too brilliant I suppose.It was so capable of showing all what it has through a unique thrilling way. The parallel story lines in the past and in the present worked well. However, it's slightly in the characters, then more deeply in the logic of its imagination, and seriously in the whole ? really weird ? third act.I have no idea why this cop loved this girl that much. And I knew nothing about the girl but she's an angel. And I don't know would he love, or re-love, her after the ending? I laugh right now, simply because these are silly questions that are not supposed to be asked in this entertaining flick; as much as it was really entertaining. You'd have hundreds of the movie's fans to answer them for you with an indignant look up their faces. So these things were appropriate in their own world, and that's why it's the slight matter. But when it comes to the Snow White program, I have to disagree. Despite that the main idea is wonderful, it wasn't built nicely. I couldn't buy nearly all what was said about "finding it accidentally", "the 4,5 days", etc. If 10 billions were spent for sending a small paper into the past, then what was the cost of sending a "man" ? And who paid? As much as I loved the moment in which the girl sees the light beam of the future (originally surprising indeed), as much as I refused it later; since naturally you've got to ask how in god's name she didn't see the light reflections of these guys' hand watches, glasses, buttons, and screens ever before ???!!! Let alone that it's hard to get all of that in a movie that looks realistic from the start, and didn't have wholly any Sci-fi factor but this. So how about the irony of having too wild imagination and a bit reckless dealing as well?!Speaking about reckless, I hated the third act which is a major plot hole. Whereas how the lead, who wrote to himself "u can save her" on the refrigerator and caused all of the bloody cotton, didn't manage to save her or else before? I mean the man, in the present, watched carefully what he already lived (the past/his future) although the girl died and the ferry exploded ??? How while the ambulance hit the home before the blowup of both, the results were negative; since according to that itself the lead saved the girl already and there is no case to investigate about in the first place ! See how this movie by this third act shoots itself in the head ! I don't believe this was played like that for the sake of matching the title of (Déj? vu) ! There must have been a first try where the lead did go to the past then failed. Review the moment in which his cell phone was ringing while looking at the body bags. Simply it was his phone and it was his body in the bag indicating, after the whole watching, that he went back in time already and failed. But maybe the production wasn't able to afford shooting that first attempt in despite of how it would have cleared up so many things and made the movie more coherent and less wrong. Maybe they thought that the movie would be so long to be tolerable. Or maybe they relied on the "ramified ways of the universe", with unsuccessful then successful tries (that we get to see or don't!), however in this case it's left for us to do the hard math and collect too many missing pieces !The ending was just a die-hard happy ending. I laughed a lot with the lead alive anew, having the girl alive too. This time I laughed for longer time lasted after the movie was gone. That what happens when the movie makers keep themselves busy with making a happy ending, more than paying attention to trivial matters like mind and thinking!But it's Hollywood. And this is a blockbuster. With (Scott), (Bruckheimer), and (Washington). Namely millions to be paid for millions ? hopefully more ? to be collected later. So don't mind being mindless totally there, or partly here. Because nowadays the major plot holes became a Hollywood tradition. Accordingly don't talk about being forced or illogical, since in these movies the forced becomes very logical for carrying out the holy status in which the viewer goes out of the theater fully satisfied. Nonetheless, after this movie I was satisfied, but not fully. I can't shut my brain down to this degree !(Déj? vu) is relatively disappointing if you thought about it. Highly disappointing if you waited for amazing love story through time travel. Amusing if you didn't do this or that.</fullReview>

I can't believe I'm reading mixed reviews on this movie ... some critics need to find another career field. Denzel demonstrated all that is best in an actor ... intelligence, passion, persuasion, leadership and charismatic appeal. I'm sure the ladies like his good looks too. The success of this movie was pivotal around Denzel. With that spoken, Paula is on her way to stardom ... she has all the best qualities.

		<fullReview>Deja Vu is a top notched policier that effectively bridges the sci-fi cop film romance gap with stinging aplomb. I had my doubts but 20 minutes into this effects filled bonanza I was thoroughly hooked. There is little point in going into the intricacies of the convoluted plot. Reading a description will only make you think, "That sounds to implausible." one would utter. Yes there are some inconsistencies. ("Shocked, I am shocked to discover gambling at Ricks!") If you think to hard about it you will, well think to hard about it. Fact is that when you watch it as opposed to reading about it it all seems to make sense. Deja Vu does an incredible job of suspending disbelief, even if you have to swallow twice you will be too entertained to care.The charge leveled against Denzel Washington is that he doesn't make serious pictures. Well that, my friend, is a good thing because his presence transforms countless Hollywood "product" into endearing fun. Remember "Out Of Time"? And how about "The Bone Collector"? Even "Training Day" was a pretty hackneyed project but the common denominator in all of these films is Denzel. He has done more to make run of the mill studio films bearable than just about any working actor and he doesn't disappoint here giving a great performance and elevating this hokum to near art. Denzel is the "everyman" that can act his way out of just about any situation, no matter how ridiculous, leaving the audience wanting more.A minor quibble is running length. Hitchcock once noted that a film's running time should not exceed the carrying capacity of a healthy human bladder and this picture stretches it a bit. There really is no need for about 20 minutes, particularly the film's extended conclusion, but who cares? It is a great deal of fun nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a fun thriller for me! Great story, just the right amount of suspense &amp; confusion, sci-fi, romance and some laughs. It kept me on the edge of my seat. Pay no attention to Pro &amp; adolescent reviewers that find this movie lacking to awful. I have read their reviews and have found that they tend to prefer films that are the most offensive &amp; political. Also, it seems that often they have not even seen the movie they are reviewing. Especially on this site, reviewers comment on films they admit to have yet viewed. They pretend to care about the technical aspects of films, but they really don't. I know because I used to be a movie snob reviewer like them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story in the Story: Tony's Bladerunner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My regular readers know I harp on and on about the tricks of narrative folding. Sometimes it must seem a stretch, but I believe this collection of devices to be at the core of cinematic storytelling. And others do too, obviously. This time, everything you see is built around this notion.The simplest folding is where the story provides for a movie within the movie, so that we the audience can merge with the audience we see on screen. Its all about getting us engaged; simple as that. I wish we had more films that mattered, that we can actually use in building a life, but Bruckheimer has his place too, I suppose. Especially when a Scott is involved.So what we get here is simple but extremely effective narrative folding, Scott's standard super-effective camera which knows how to be ambiguous in these matters, and both turned to the goal of grabbing us by the throat for a thrill. The fold this time is us watching a crime as detectives, and what we see is a detective watching the same crime. So perspectives overlap and we have several scenes where our screen contains people looking at their screen, notable in the same proportion. And we also have time folding, in fact the designated scientist explains it as folding with a piece of folded paper. This allows Denzel the opportunity to be driving at high speed in two time periods at the same time. Very clever if you must follow the Bruckheimer rule of car chases ? that they be spectacular. As with any Scottfree film, you must see it on a big screen, and I say that with some hesitation. That's because I know a director's cut will arrive on DVD. It'll feature some enhanced nudity. Ho Hum, nipples. But I expect it to alter the story the same way brother Ridley's director's cut of "Bladerunner" did. You will know from the trailers that Denzel's character goes back in time. Once. But you will see hints here of something that has been edited out, hints that he would have had to go back many times, like "Primer."When he appears at the hospital, he has a marking on his chest that only an experienced traveler would place, and that isn't there the first time he goes back.. At Clair's house, he carefully moves a glass of water as a signal to one of his future selves. At the marina, there's the appearance of corpse-reducing alligators. Note my prediction on this, I see into the future: Scott will un-dumb down this story.One interesting thing is that for the first time I can recall, Denzel's style of being is appropriate. Less interesting is how Hollywood thinks technical projects like this might look, all nice and neat with military guards all around and no maintenance techs to worry in the background. Nah.Summary: The girl is pretty. The threat has a ticking clock. The folding works and we are thrilled. Washington isn't repellent. Stay tuned for more complexity on the DVD.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predicted a Rubbish Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another crappy film from the crappy actor Denzel Washington. I luckily only managed to watch the first half an hour that's why I won't be able to comment much about this film. A friend of mine lend me it on DVD and it was complete nonsense first a ship exploded then Denzel came with his unlucky face and then he was interrogating a man. After a few moments later the film was slower than a snail. So it started off like a cheetah and became slower than my grand mum. Thirty minutes later I saved myself by ejecting the DVD and putting it back in the case I wanted to throw it out the window but then I remembered that it's my friend's. This is Denzel 's fifth film I've seen the other four are Man on Fire, The Bone Collector, Out of Time and Inside Man &amp; they are all rubbish. I don't know that his films are crap or because of him they are (probably because of his unlucky face) but after watching good for nothing "Deja Vu" I've completely made a commitment that not to watch any of his films no matter how good it looks &amp; that is final!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What if you had the ability to change the past?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You would warn yourself not to waste your time on this film. All neat and tidy and a load of crock at the same time. So many instances of knowing whats going to happen before it does (though this is not the makers intention?) it's not true. So conveniently wrapped up with a load of hokum illusions to theoretical physics. This film wants to be many things and just ends up being convoluted. A slick fast-paced "Tony Scott" action movie while being full of unbelievable attempts to explain a newly discovered ability to bend time and space(such an amazing, surely "Top Secret"* discovery is at the disposal of the FBI to toy around with. This would of been better with the Governator dishing some cheesy lines as he went instead of Denzel and co taking it so seriously. Bluergh!* Special mention goes to Val Kilmer. Oh Val, why oh why did you do such a great job in your first film only to be rubbish in everything else bar The Doors</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable but definitely frightening if not sickening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A strange film on a very trite and over-used theme. The dedication to New Orleans does not change that fact. After "Back to the Future" we cannot accept some of the rather sloppy elements we find in this film. A few examples. At the beginning, thanks to the machine to explore the past, we discover the car with the explosives on the boat did not have a number plate. How can security rules explain the fact that a car without a number plate was allowed on a boat transporting more than 500 people? The terrorist stole a car because he needed one. But he actually had one. So why did he use a stolen one? But the worst part is how the Doug from the future when arriving in the past does all kinds of antics, leaving all kinds of traces behind him in the past, obviously cutting short the plan of the terrorist, and yet the terrorist will fulfill his plan entirely in the first version of the attack, but in the first version still the investigation reveals the Doug from the future has already intervened in the past and hence should have changed the result of the terrorist attack by hijacking it off its normal course. If he was in the girl's apartment before the terrorist attack, leaving his finger prints and his blood everywhere, how could the terrorist succeed in killing the girl and blowing the boat up. And he the Doug from the future dies in the past, that would make him dead for the future. He could not come up alive and start everything like normal after the explosion. If the past is changed, then the future is changed too. If you die, you die and you do not exist any more. And the Doug who died in the explosion will not be able to arrest the terrorist who was killed just before the explosion, both being dead for the future. And if the girl managed to escape from the car when it fell into the Mississippi through a broken window, and she was not trained like a federal agent, how come Doug, a trained federal agent, could not follow suit and get out from the car through the same window? But we can suspend our disbelief and then consider the film as something that does not have to be logical. Pure action. Fine. What's the meaning of this action in 2006, five years after 9/11 and three years after the invasion of Iraq, not to mention today in 2008? Terrorist attacks in the USA come from white Americans who define themselves as patriots and consider they have to attack the security forces and the people of the USA to make them realize they have to start a third world war to stop the world from changing and to prevent the USA from becoming a second rank nation, and do not forget the USA became the first nation in the world after and thanks to the second world war. And in this scenario, one little bomb can kill more than 500 people. They don't need four or five Boeings to do that. One man alone, properly trained can be a lot more effective than Al Qaeda. That's what you call economy of scales. The second idea is that in such cases the terrorist, when caught, will be buried by the FBI into silence and disappearance because the government will not want details to be given on two subjects. First of all the absolute incapability of the state to protect the territory and the people of the USA. Second the fact that they possess a technology that enables them to reconstruct everything that has happened in a particular place, behind walls, closed doors and any kind of protection. There is no privacy and no protection of privacy in this new hi-tech vision. That is a lot more frightening than a few berserk patriots who consider the death of a few thousand people to be a good thing to arouse consciousness. There, beyond believability, this film is a really scary movie. "Minority Report" was frightening but they only read the future, and in the end dropped the technology for political reason. Here it is a lot worse since they can read the past, what really happened. We are trapped 100%. We are under constant surveillance and control by people, forces and agencies we do not even know exist or will exist.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrible movie, just awful...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not even a science fiction movie. Its ridiculous. Excuse me Denzel, but how could you get involved in this? Oh, for the money! Nothing is explained well. this movie wasn't supposed to be a comedy, but it is. But as soon they started to "talk" about wormholes etc this movie was over. Denzel Washington is usually worth watching, but not here - the movie is just too awful.It's a really sorry piece of work, anybody with the least knowledge of Sci Fi will Agree that this movie is just ridiculous.Tony Scott jumped off a bridge in L.A. not too long ago, probably dismayed over the portfolio of junk movies he'd made during his career. While that is indeed a shame, at least we won't have to worry about more movies like this from him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can anyone explain how he is alive at the film's end?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It looked to me like he died in the explosion but then he comes walking around the corner like he and the girl had not met, this film is twisting my mind. It just makes no sense to me. When they sent him back in time he seemed to recognize all of the stuff he had left at her house (fingerprints, etc), some kind of parallel existence maybe, explain how you interpreted it. And what became of the crew that was in charge of the device that let him go back in the first place? I enjoyed this movie but it left me hanging with too many questions. It has dogged my mind since I left the theatre and I can only hope the DVD will shed more light on the ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one big disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw a screening last night in Century City. Everything about the movie appealed to me before I saw it, Tony Scott, Jerry Bruckheimer, Denzel, Val Kilmer, Jim Caviezal and the story sounded pretty good. When I left the theater I felt pretty empty. I did not expect a time-traveling movie, but I wouldn't have argued if it was believable. From the minute we are introduced to a computer that can go four days in the past and show us footage through walls without the use of cameras, I sorta lost interest. There's suspension of belief, and then there's this. The acting was pretty average at best, but u can forget about character development. The script was flimsy, full of plot holes and feels like it was written by a teenager in my opinion. The only thing that saved it for me was the high production value: good soundtrack and good editing. I don't think that everyone agreed with me because when I left the theater I overheard other people saying they thought it was "awesome". So don't take my word for it, see it for yourself. But if you're spending cash on a ticket, there are better things on at the moment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Denzel and most of his movies, but this one was, like most of them this year was mediocre at best and ridiculous at worse. A cross between Timecop and Terminator, but at least the Terminator kept going back trying to get it right. The movie was interesting until he started falling for the girl and before the girl started getting in the way. I hate it when movies cast a female for distraction. I hate it when the female does the opposite of what she's told to do. The whole surveillance and possibility of changing the past was interesting, but like Timecop it would have been more interesting if alittle reality had crept in for the ending and not the ridiculous man being able to control everything ending that we got. Just one more thing I don't know about most people but I kind of getting tried of things blowing up and the whole terrorist, patriot thing. People who do things like blow up people are mentally disturbed and we should stop making them seem anything but that in the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad that they demonize patriots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't sure what this movie was about when I watched it. It grew more and more suspenseful and intriguing, involving the government and secret projects that can look in to the past 'as it happens' but only for a select window of time.Having said that, it is certainly a plot that is deserving of a movie. Well executed, well acted, well directed, taught, etc. Why did I give it such a low rating? They demonize American Patriots by making the main bad guy a Thomas Jefferson-quoting-patriot-murderer. Sound crazy? Yes. Indeed it is."The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants." - This quote is used by the 'bad guy' to defend his murder, in this movie, of a woman who 'got in the way'. Anyone can see that it doesn't even apply! The woman was not a tyrant, just an innocent bystander. Those who concocted this movie, chose to also demonize a very powerful quotation from America's very foundations; to do so takes very crafty cunning of the dark sort.It was this decision on God-knows-whose-part - to portray an American Patriot as a murderer (not even a freedom-fighter) - that ruined the whole movie for me. It is not only far-fetched with this attack on patriots, but insulting to those who believe in the America the Founding Fathers envisioned and fought for.</fullReview>
