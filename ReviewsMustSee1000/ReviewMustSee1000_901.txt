		<shortDescription>Beautiful, tragic, stunning.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The very structure of this film perfectly describes its philosophy - a never ending circle. And it's the structure that makes this film work so powerfully. From the shattering opening section, to the startling second part, to the third story that brings it all together, this is a great film. It's been overlooked for some reason, mentioned rarely in film magazines and in best of the decade lists. But it's a phenomenal work, one that needs to be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time is not a Circle, but War is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A poignant tragedy about hatred, war, love and taking sides.Time is not linear in the movie, but the director blatantly tells us that time is not a circle, so what is? The story is, and perhaps war is.The story is told in three parts, with highly ironic titles: Words, Faces, and Pictures. Each story has meticulously planned, but highly disturbing parallels. The story-telling of the movie requires diligent planning, down to every single detail, exceptional creativity, and extraordinary persistence. Perhaps that's why the director Milcho Manchevski was fired by both commercial producers Warner Brothers and 20th Century Fox for "creative differences"Before the Rain talks about hate, and how the power of hate can rise above love. It talks about taking sides, the central character in each section tries not to take sides, but circumstances often prove such efforts futile. As with Kiril and Aleksander.In the film, all events happened before the rain, this sense of urgency, this beautiful sadness, and this inevitable tragedy. Before the Rain is my all time favourite movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank you Mr. Manchevski</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is absolute perfection. I can't believe it took me 10 years to bump into it by accident. I was surprised to see it was made in 1994 when the entire time I watched it as a reflection rather than prophecy of the civil war that followed. The fluency of picture, music, and the story is perfect as viewer is taken from dramatic landscapes and slow paced life of orthodox priests to fast paced London streets and offices. Parallel stories in London fasten the pace even more. The movie shows we are all connected not only in time (past and future) but space (geography) as well. War and suffering in one part of the world affect lives of people in quaint London restaurant. The circle of human tragedy connects almost every character in the movie. But circle is imperfect. If the circle were perfect the tragedy would stop when circle completes. Alas, the tragedy spirals in time and space. Acting is very real. Time is not wasted overbuilding any character. The way soundtrack blends with the movie is pure art. Thank you for this movie Mr. Manchovski. As powerful as the movie is, it's unfortunate it didn't help prevent the civil war in Macedonia. When hate wins, innocence looses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beautiful, hard hitting, but still both simple and realistic. One of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. I saw it the first time in 1997 I think and I've seen it at least twenty times so far and it grows bigger every time. I love this movie and can't give any bad comments about it. Some amy say there are somebeautiful scenes here and some ugly scenes there, but I love it just like it is and it's hard to change that.Firs, the the acting is excellent and the main character Rade Serbedzija does a wonderful work as a cynical, down-to-earth photographer, who knows he can'tescape his destiny and identity, Katrin Cartlidge does an equally impressive job, as well as a lot o the Macedonian bad and good guys of the film.Secondly, the cinematography wonderfully depicts the harsh Macedonianlandscapes and sceneries, as well as the torn souls of the land. The music has the same impact and feels so natural with the cinematography.Finally, I could never complaint about the directors excellent work. This was his debut if I'm not wrong and that was very promising, but I suppose this was his "Citizen Kane" and it'll probably be impossible to make anything similar.One rarely sees anything from Macedonia.But this is not only good forMacedonian cinema, it should have won the Oscar that year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect Definition &amp; Explanation of the Macedonian Problem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film by Milcho Manchevski is the ideal when talking about explaining and defining the Macedonian problem. I am Macedonian but I live in Germany. So I think I have an overview so that I am able to criticize. The problem between the ethnic groups in Macedonia go around in circles. But in the end it turns out that the circle goes round like a ferry wheel. Everything is happening again and again. The circle is not round though. In every end there is a change. A change which always makes the new beginning worse. In a way it is like a spiral. And Manchevski is smartly telling three stories. They are not linear, but in a way they come close to what the problem really is like. With the last episode he connects the three stories, and you can feel the message - his message.Unfortunately this film was quite popular only in Europe and I think even in the US, but in Macedonia it was rarely seen by the people. I think if every single Macedonian Citizen had seen and understood this movie, it would be much easier to solve the Macedonian problem today. Because what it says is that we ourselves kill each other. Because of hatred and ethnic principles we force ourselves to fight against each other. And that is exactly why it is leading to nowhere. Because it is a circle...and the circle is not round. And one day, when the spiral is at its end, it's going to be too late.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Macedonia With Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The wars in former Yugoslavia have resounded in every corner of that region, and have ignited all manner of subsequent ethnic and religious conflicts within the newly-formed republics. Focusing world attention upon the region through the media has occasionally had the positive effect of raising awareness of the conflicts through art. The work of artists from former Yugoslavia has found an appreciation that has never really existed before, partly due to the fact that they are the most fit to interpret the events there. The republic of Macedonia is certainly experiencing its share of strife.Nestled in between the countries of Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Albania, it is surrounded by strained relations on all sides, countries that have refused to recognize its autonomy for a long time. A significant Albanian Moslem minority feuds with the dominant Orthodox Christian Slav population. Hardly a week passes without a new arms network running from Alabania to Macedonia being discovered. Despite the presence of U.N. peacekeeping forces, armed skirmishes ravage the countryside.Milcho Manchevski left his native Macedonia to pursue a college education in the U.S. He studied film at Southern Illinois University. Upon graduating, he moved to New York and began working on commercial, experimental films, and music videos. BEFORE THE RAIN is his first full-length feature, for which he returned to his native country to make. He was able to secure British and French financing with his creative, authoritative and topical screenplay. An inspiring tale about the senselessness of war and the fragility of humans and their loves, the film is, despite some minute flaws, one of the most passionate and sublime cinematic statements of the '90s.It has an intriguing, if not wholly original non-linear narrative structure. Through three episodes titled, "Words," "Faces," and "Pictures," respectively, the viewer is introduced to three characters whose lives interconnect from minute to strongly significant ways.Kiril (Gregoire Collin, of OLIVIER, OLIVIER) is a young novice in an Orthodox monastery who cannot help but hide Zamira (Labina Mitevska), a fugitive Albanian girl, from the villagers who want to execute her for murdering a shepherd. He does it out of the goodness of his heart, but perhaps also out of the beginnings of a lustful affection for her. They flee north in an attempt to find Kiril's uncle in Skopje, and meet with dire hardship and tragedy.Meanwhile, in England, Anne (Katrin Kartlidge, most familiar as the lisping goth girl from Mike Leigh's film NAKED), a photo editor is in the midst of a personal crisis. She is becoming more and more disaffected with her husband Nick (Jay Villiers) while experiencing a difficult, confused relationship with her lover, Aleksandar (Rade Serbedzija), an award-winning native Macedonian photographer. Unsure of what to do, she distances herself from both men, but cannot stem the tide of the turbulent events all around her. The story dispenses with her husband in somewhat contrived way, and she ends up trying to find Aleksandar, who has since left for Macedonia.Aleksandar returns to his native village, only to find that the overall climate has radically changed, and the simple life he tries to rediscover has since been made more complex by the feuds with the Albanians. His return is met with mixed reactions from warm welcomes from his close friends, to cold-shouldering by the newly-armed local anti-Albanian faction, to outright hatred from some of the Albanians. When his childhood love from a neighboring village seeks his aid to help protect her daughter, Aleksandar is thrust into the heart of the conflict, and his refusal to takes sides has tragic repercussions. Serbedzija interprets the role with a noble, morally centered sense of confidence. One of former Yugoslavia's most well known and respected actors Serbedzija found his role to be a way of protesting the conflicts in his region-"As an artist, as someone well-known, I had to speak out against nationalism and war. As Aleksandar was presumed to take sides, so was I. It's my story. What ends up happening to Aleksandar, when cousins take arms against cousins, has happened to many in former Yugoslavia and it could happen to me."With its non-linear structure, the time-line of the film is somewhat incoherent, and there are some plot developments in the middle segment, occurring in England, which are a bit too pat. These are balanced by the striking, somewhat exotic visuals and original, exhilarating neo-ethnic music by a group called Anastasia, fine acting (especially by Collin and Serbedzija), and an overall poignant sense of the waste of war, even a war in its beginnings. Manchevski illuminates his use of the film's title-"There was this sense of something heavy beginning to happen, something looming in the air. At the same time life was continuing as before. This story doesn't deal with the political aspects of how wars start. It's about human passion and how it can lead one in different, unexpected directions. It's about how a war somewhere in the world might get started and how that can affect your life regardless of where you are. Ultimately, it's about taking sides."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting - but why the middle section</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a 3 part film depicting events during the complex civil war in what use to be Yugoslavia. The first and third parts are set in the Balkans and for the most part are touching and authentic. A photographer returns to his homeland to witness the fracturing of it into war. This is well depicted in the movie - how communities that use to co-exist peacefully can somehow, through a tortured religious history,group pressure.. . gradually fracture into warring tribes. Another centerpiece of this story is a young girl forced to leave her village to try and save her life. The second part is mostly disconnected from part 1 and 3. The English woman is pregnant and having marital problems, there is a mafia style shoot-up in a bar. It is entirely irrelevant to the themes presented in 1 and 3. Part 2 should have been edited to coalesce with 1 and 3. The only reason for the second installment is to provide a back-drop for the photographer to return, after a long absence, to his native land and witness the fissures developing. Also in part 2 we see photographs of the execution of the fleeing young woman,but at this stage the photographer was already dead!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie has it all, amassing storyline with lots of great metaphors (even the title is a metaphor for forthcoming turmoil), great acting, beautiful music and colorful picture. The main storyline happens in Macedonia, but the movie is timeless and it is true for every conflict in the world, as in the movie the director in a beautiful way plays with time and places. Take any conflict in the world and you will see the same, how the violence can bring more hatred, turmoil and nothing good, and how hard can be to break this circle. But as it says in the movie the circle is not always round, it is not everything as it seems, and this circle of violence can be hardly broken. Truly a Masterpiece, and it won't be exaggerated if I say this is a movie version of Picasso's Guernica. The shapes are not easy to see, but when you see it you will understand it is stunning and it carries beautiful message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This story marks the essence of what's happened in Balkans (former Yugoslavia) in past few years, and especially the circular plot of the movie is very significant. I was really shocked with certain moments of this film!There's more lines in the plot - the story of native war photographer living in London, who wants to return to homeland - the movie itself starts with some kind of Romeo and Juliet war story - there's also a harsh killing scene in London restaurant, which is made by one of war radicals - very funny shot is that, when the UN inspection car stops at the hill far before the village, and after moment it returns back, while the village is guarded and divided by it's armed citizens - and maybe one missed telephone call could warn Alexander, who just returns to his birth village, and stop it all...After some moments the lines of this more complex movie cut through and the circle of violence comes to its finale. But we're just on the beginning chronologically, so it seems everything is just starting again...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before the Rain (1994) **** After only being available on bootlegged or used but extremely rare DVDs, the originals of which were released only in Macedonia and Turkey (given away for free in limited number), Milcho Manchevski's poetic and soulful examination of the futility of war and circularity of violence is set to be released on DVD proper through Criterion this June. Given that the film won the Oscar for best foreign film and earned numerous accolades from the major critics (Siskel and Ebert raved about the film on their show), one would have expected to see it on DVD a long time ago, but alas, it's coming now and getting the proper treatment.The film is set in Macedonia in the early 90s, as tensions between the 'native' Macedonians and Muslim Albanians flare. The story is broken into 3 parts ? words, faces, and pictures. Words follows a young monk, on a vow of silence for the last 2 years. He finds to his shock one evening in his quarters a young boy hiding in his bed. He runs to tell one of the monastery heads, but decides against telling after seeing the fear in the boy's eyes. The next day, armed men show up looking for an Albanian girl who allegedly killed a sheep herder. No one knows of the girl, but the armed men refuse to leave and keep watch in case she turns up. That night, the young Monk, Kiril, wakes to see the boy again, but this time in the light of the moon, and realizes that it is not a boy, but a girl with her hair chopped off. She is Zamira. He allows her to hide with him, only to be discovered later in the night by the other priests. The two are forced out under the cover of darkness, wished well on their way. The two seem to be heading for love, but that love will be swiftly and brutally taken away from them before it is allowed to materialize.Part 2, faces, takes us into the modern hubbub of London, where a woman at a photo agency, Anne, is embroiled in pregnancy and an affair with her Macedonian Co-worker, Aleksander (Rade Serbedzija). He has just returned from an expedition which has apparently traumatized him. His camera has killed a man he says. He asks her to come back to Macedonia with him, where he remembers life as peaceful and safe, despite her warnings and knowledge of the Balkan conflicts. Being pregnant, she cannot go, she must meet with her husband. Aleksander leaves alone to return to his homeland. While the war seems far away from bustling London, violence and hatred are never as far as they seem. Over dinner, Anne first tells her husband she is pregnant, it's his, and she wants a divorce. Meanwhile, a waiter and a patron, both speaking Macedonian, bicker. The tension in the scene is wrought, as Anne struggles to get the right words out and express her feelings and the two men head toward a devastating act of violence for Anne and her Husband.Part 3, pictures, returns us to Macedonia, and to Aleksander. He arrives home and finds his old home a disaster, and finds that his Albanian neighbours are fearful of him. Childhood friends are now bitter enemies, hatred runs hot between Macedonians and Albanians. Some in his family seem to be somewhat sympathetic, others militant, such as his cousin, Mitre, one of the armed men at the church in the beginning of the film. Aleksander inquires about Hana, a woman he used to love, and apparently still does. She is Albanian, widowed, and off limits. He goes to visit her, and finds that he must pass a roadblock, where he is suspiciously questioned by armed villagers. He is allowed in only after Hana's father confirms his identity. We discover that the man is Zamira's grandfather, and she is Hana's daughter. Aleksander will be asked later by Hana to help protect Zamira.I will not reveal here the interconnectedness of the film, as it is impossible to do so without revealing major spoilers. We come to realize however that the film is not linear in nature, but circular, a style employed in a much different film at the same time, Pulp Fiction. We also come to realize that there a number of subtle incongruence's in the plot. People who should be dead are alive - timing and events seem to be off. Manchevski was purposeful in his editing, and the inconsistencies are not simply goofs. Rather they fit the theme of the film, spoken or seen numerous times throughout the film ? "The circle is not round. Time never dies." The circularity of violence is manifested through the circularity of the plot: things don't always look the same but the result always is: destruction of life. Before the Rain is a film about our humanity and how it is destroyed by hate; how we are not only willing to destroy those we hate because we hate them, but that we will destroy those we love when they stand in the way of our hatreds. The film is a scathing indictment of the policies of war and hate, rendered through the heart and soul of art. I implore anyone reading this to seek out the film, which thankfully will be far more available come this June.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time Never Dies, The Circle is Not Round</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before the Rain is a film composed of three loosely interconnected episodes Words, Faces, and Pictures. All of these segments are dealing with the influence of the Bosnian War in Macedonia, and the unintended consequences war, especially racially motivated war, can have on people's lives. The first segment called Words takes place at a picturesque Macedonian monastery located atop a mountain.The cinematography is beautiful. There are lush green gardens, mountain ranges, and a vibrant sky with oversized and exaggerated features. Within the monastery itself there are lingering shots on pre- Renaissance paintings and the architecture of the compound. Words is undoubtedly the most visually stimulating of the episodes. The second segment, Faces, is odd when compared to the first and third. It doesn't take place in Macedonia, instead it is set in London and is entirely in English whereas the other segments are in Macedonian or Albanian with subtitles. It is also the weakest episode in the movie. The story is less interesting and maybe even a little boring, as it deals with a woman coping with an inconvenient pregnancy and her love for the man she has been cheating on her husband with, which is much less compelling than the creeping threat of bigotry and war that the rest of the movie focuses on. The cinematography is not very good is this section either; instead of the vibrant Macedonian countryside, Faces just takes place in a dirty city and lacks any of the interesting or stylized visuals that can be found in Words or Pictures. It also has the weakest links to the other segments. The only connection to the first segment are some photos of Kiril and Zamira that were taken after Zamira's death. These are only briefly seen and have no impact on the story. Because the link is so flimsy it would be easy to forget about these photographs or just discount them. If a person did that they might think that the first segment actually happened last and the rest of the film was just a flashback. The filmmakers clearly wanted a more complicated explanation to the films continuity, so by making it so easy to ignore certain details, they've undermined their own ideas. The only interesting detail is that Katrin Cartildge, who plays the protagonist in this episode would play a nearly identical journalist character who is also caught up in the Bosnian conflict when she appeared in No Man's Land seven years later. The third and final segment, Pictures, is the strongest of the three. It is the only segment that successfully contains story elements from the other two episodes, bringing in Aleksandar who was introduced in the Faces as the protagonist and giving the backstory of Zamira before the events of Words. It is the section of the film that creates the most tension and has the most emotional resonance. This segment also features several apparent homages to classic American Westerns. The scene where Aleksandar is riding a bicycle while whistling is reminiscent of the bicycle scene with Paul Newman from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and when Aleksander is going to his cousin's barn to help birth the lambs he is framed in the darkened doorway almost identically to the way John Wayne is framed in The Searchers. When Aleksandar first walks up to his old house the camera is at a low angle focusing on his destroyed house and roughly constructed fence as Aleksandar walks into frame from the left with the sun setting in the background. There are similar shots in Clementine and the Grapes of Wrath, both John Ford movies as well. There is even a moment where Aleksander gives a Zippo lighter to the father of former girlfriend, noting that they are often used in American movies. This reveals that the director has seen enough American films to know the minute detail of what kind of lighters are often used, so it is reasonable to assume that he would intentionally include the other references because he is a fan of the movies they came from. Aside from the individual stories the movie's big selling point is the way it plays with the ideas of time and continuity. In the second segment there is graffiti on a London wall that that says, "Time Never Dies, The Circle is not Round." This is also the tagline of the movie, and sums up the nonlinear approach the movie takes. Before the Rain came out in 1994 the same year as what is likely the most famous example of nonlinear storytelling, Pulp Fiction, but Pulp Fiction's approach is much different than this movie. While the scenes and story segments are out of order in Pulp Fiction they could be edited into a linear movie without any real contradictions. Before the Rain wants to emphasize these contradictions and make a story that could never be told in a strictly linear manner. The point of doing this seems to be to make a statement about the vicious cycle of war. How things mindlessly repeat over and over for no reason, accomplishing nothing. Particularly it deals with the way these ideas pertains to the Bosnian War. The film characterizes the war as being meaningless and motivated by prejudice. It's interesting to note that of the three major deaths in the movie, none of the three killed were soldiers, none were actually involved in the conflict, and in the case of Zamira and Aleksandar they are killed by their own family members. At no point in the movie does anyone successfully kill their "enemies." They only succeed in killing bystanders or the people they would claim to be fighting to protect. This seems to be the core idea of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The circularity of violence seen in a story that circles on itself. In Republic of Macedonia, during war in Bosnia, Christians hunt an ethnic Albanian girl who may have murdered one of their own. A young monk who's taken a vow of silence offers her protection.First of all, you don't see many films from Macedonia. At least, I don't. I suppose people in Macedonia may see more. But that was the first thing that struck me. But more to the point, the film is interesting for its blend of cultures and languages, and its (possibly) unique plot device of three stories that could go in more or less any order.I cannot say this was a film I truly loved, but it was one I admired. And it makes me wonder what else is out there from this same director or others involved. There is a whole world of film out there to be explored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before the rain-A Milcho Manchevski film which continues to stand the test of time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Before the rain' is a thought provoking film about the futility of violence. Among other things, it continues to question what is it that always turns friends into foes ? Why is there suddenly so much distrust especially between people who have always lived peacefully with each other ? This film was made at a time when Balkan war was at its peak which resulted in love and loyalties being tested through guns. In such a deplorable time, it seemed quite natural for violence to have become the preferred existential choice to settle scores. It appeared as if there was absolutely no scope at all for voices of reason to express their opinions. It was expressed through senseless, partisan cries of 'You don't belong here' and 'why' are you meddling in our affairs ? The notions of belongingness and identity are very integral to 'Before the rain'. They helped various characters to raise pertinent questions namely who belongs to whom and how is belongingness decided ? A sense of uneasiness is developed at all times when rain is about to fall. It might be related to heat or humidity. This awkwardness appears to recede with the advent of rain drops. In many ways, this brief explanation describes the genesis of Macedonian film 'Before the rain'. Lastly, 'Before the rain' would be remembered by critics and viewers alike as a profoundly humane film which depicted that love would always triumph over wanton acts of violence.</fullReview>

Same with Serbians. They have the same relationship like us Macedonians do. Thats why there's war in Kosovo (Hopefully there will be peace soon, when NATO stops bombing and killing innocent civilians) But I really recommend the person who is reading this to watch this movie.

		<shortDescription>One of the best artistic and neutral representations of one's country political and historic issues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really great movie, if not the best Macedonian movie ever. However, I felt compelled to mention that it is above all an artistic representation of the situation in the country. Namely, such "Romeo and Juliet" like conflicts between ethnic groups in the country do not exist, but are inevitable in the movie to emphasize the diversity and rich turbulent history of this region and at the same time give more appealing show for the viewer. Another impressive feature of this movie is the actual time-line which is not linear but rather presented in a circle sections. I also loved the musical score. Macedonian ethno-rock band Anstazija did some great remakes of traditional melancholic Macedonian folk songs.Manchevski's next hit "Dust" uses the same "action driven" plot to keep the viewer's attention, but as in this movie addresses much deeper issues.All in all, a must for anyone who appreciates European cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is incredibly powerful. For anyone who has studied Eastern European history this movie brings the Muslim-Christian relations and tensions into reality. WARNING: If you like movies to neatly tie up all loose ends by the the end, this movie is not for you! Just as the quote says, "Time never dies: The circle is not round," the movie leaves you with a lot of confusion and questions about the plot, but the message is no less incredible. If you like history then this movie is for you. I watched it for the first time in 10th grade in my AP European History class and it made an incredible impact on the way I thought about religious relations in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.Awesome movie that I highly recommend!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The circular plot devise worked well, and though it caught me off guard, I was impressed at how well everything connected and brought it to its conclusion. The dreaminess of the first part "Words" contrasted with the harshness and violence of the rest of the film. Not familiar with the Balkans, I was struck by the austerity portrayed in the film and left with a feeling of sadness at the futility of war, its profound and devastating effects on humanity. There is no love in such a world except where it can be found striving to reach vengeful hearts and hardened minds, and perhaps in monasteries perched high on mountain tops.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't really want to attempt a review, just wanted to say I thought this was one of the best films I've ever seen and very few of my acquaintances seem to have seen it. The male lead was one of the most appealing characters I've encountered in any film and the Escher like time device in the plot worked for me and really brings home the endless circle of violence in some parts of the world. Cinematography was breathtaking. Not for the faint of heart though, my wife couldn't handle some of the violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fabulous performance=Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know if Mr. Rade Serbedzija will be reading those lines. I really wish him to do so. With his performing as Alexander in the movie, "Before the Rain", he has engraved such a character in our minds, that made him so admirable, so extrahuman, so sincere.But with his act in the movie, "Eyes Wide Shut" -- though I should admit that it is one of the best movies I have seen within this year, -- as performing Mr. Milich, another former-Yugoslav and a greedy tux-renter-turned-pimp who doesn't bother to offer his daughter to strangers for money, Serbedzija stroke me with the bitter truth that he is not an idealistic adventurist who would waive his life to his beliefs, but an excellent actor.Hold it!.. This is not a compliment.I should admire his acting performance in changing between characters from an epitomized hero to a cheap pimp who'd even seek for free doctor's advice to treat his baldness.I guess after I saw Before the Rain, Serbedzija/Alexander has drawn such an image in my head that shouldn't occur to any movie watcher. I really believed that a movie character was real. Well, this was a good performance on behalf of Serbedzija, but a pure foolishness on my part.OK!.. I will never believe in movies anymore. But I guess, I'll still continue watching Before the Rain, by keeping it in my private collection. I'll never think about the fact that even an idealized movie character of the European cinema would some day be part of the pay-per-dream Hollywood movie industry to earn his life. Well good luck to you Mr. Serbedzia in the land of opportunities.Maybe, instead of praising Serbedzija, I should compliment the movie's director, Milcho Manchevski for an excellent work he has displayed on the silver screen. At least, thanks for such a good contribution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the movie quite a lot. Well done, with clear story line and conveying the ideas perfectly. I gave it 7 instead of 10 stars because of some incorrect historic statements. For example, one of the characters says that the Byzantines poked the eyes of 14000 "Macedonian" soldiers. This refers to the battle at Klyuch in 1014 where the Byzantine emperor Basil II won the battle and because of what he did to the soldiers he was called Basil the Bulgar-slayer (Boulgaroktonos Greek: &#x392;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3cc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;) - obviously no mention of any Macedonian soldiers. Oh, well, what can one do - that's the present day Macedonian view on history. I just thought that a movie of this scale should be correct in every aspect - both what concerns present day events and facts from the past.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's one of the best films that I've ever seen. I saw it many times, including the theatre sessions, when it was on screens. Photography, scriptwriting, direction, characters are in such a harmony that makes difficult to tell what is best in this films. The perfection of the text is so that the connections between characters and the film chronology can close in a circle without really closing it. The main sentence "The circle is not round" is both touching and intelligent, revealing the spiral of mankind's stubbornness violence - that never gets to an end - as the essence of the story. So up to date that unreasonable violence still keeps its turn, nowadays: like it happened in London, in the film, and today(10/08), at the airports. The soundtrack by "Anastácia" is also fantastic; and fits well with the atmosphere of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlooked gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a feeling that this film was somehow under-appreciated.Some of the critics deemed it too boring and hard to comprehend.I can't see why.This film has everything to make it a classic,perhaps not in the big perspective,but certainly in the perspective of Balkan and East European film.It is a vital contribution to their history.Rade Serbedzija is excellent here as the maverick photographer from Macedonia who lives in London and has an affair with a married woman,played by Katrin Cartlidge.After a trip to war torn Bosnia,Alexander(Serbedzija) comes back changed.He then decides to go back to Macedonia.Here one can wonder what made him take that decision. Was it because he had seen the uselessness of life and wanted to leave it all behind and die at home?In a conversation with a fellow Macedonian on the bus,Alexander is warned that things are out of control and he might lose his head to which he replies:"Thats alright.It's about time."This all gives an impression that Alexander is heading to find peace,and he doesn't care if it means living or dying.It turns out to be the latter.At the same time,his conscience is burdening him.He sees himself as an accomplice to a murder and therefore he can't forgive himself.On another angle,Manchevski is trying to show the world that Bosnia is not the only place where things are in turmoil.Right upon his arrival to the village,Alexander is stopped by a youngster carrying a machine gun and questioned.As he soon learns,the local population is now divided in two groups:Christians(Slavic Macedonians) and Muslims(Albanians).They are on the brink of a war and one of Alexander's relatives,the fierce Mitre(great appearance by unknown Bresliski) is the head of the war mongers on their side.The film is divided into three separate stories and I find the story with Alexander the best one.At the same time,each story shows the extremity of each nation:the first one with the young monk and Albanian girl on the run show the foul religious extremism of Albanians whose head is the girl's grandfather,ironically.The second story with Alexander and his kinsmen shows the fierce nationalism of the Orthodox Macedonian Slavs.And the third gives a glimpse of the typical Serb extremism through an episode where a mad Serb goes on a shooting rampage in a fancy London restaurant after a quarrel with a countryman.It brings a contrast between the Western Europe and Balkans,where the former is shown as more civilised and less prone to violence while the latter is the exact opposite.Originating from Balkans,I can recognize this as a correct portrayal of the stereotype.Everyone should see this film and learn from it.The battle between rationality and humanity vs. nationalism and savage principles is the key issue here.Can one hope for humanity and rationality to prevail on Balkans?This question echoes through the violent history of the peninsula and leaves no one careless.Taking sides in such a conflict is truly the hardest task.Manchevski's film gave the people of the Balkans and Europe a lot to chew on and I believe that is why this film was not well received everywhere.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Milcho Manchevski's film shows an amazing understanding of people, issues and life in the Balkans. This region is rich in history but its stories seem to be told mainly by outsiders who have come to the region rather than those born and bred in there.This film redresses that imbalance. But sadly, it is a prophetic film. It wasn't long before the issues it raises spilt over into violence in the region, as predicted. The film is intelligent, thought provoking, challenging and disturbingly realistic. It should be required viewing for those dealing with the Balkans in order for them to understand the human dimension. I love the way it highlights the physical beauty of Macedonia's countryside. It creates a stark and disturbing contrast to the political and ethnic ugliness and seems to suggest that life there can be beautiful.</fullReview>

I read someone contrasting "Before the Rain"'s vignettes with Tarantino's and I completely agree. Here it serves as much more than just a way to make a simple story seem complex.

		<shortDescription>From Macedonia With Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The wars in former Yugoslavia has resounded in every corner of that region, and have ignited all manner of subsequent ethnic and religious conflicts within the newly-formed republics. Focusing world attention upon the region through the media has occasionally had the positive effect of raising awareness of the conflicts through art. The work of artists from former Yugoslavia has found an appreciation that has never really existed before, partly due to the fact that they are the most fit to interpret the events there.The republic of Macedonia is certainly experiencing its share of strife. Nestled in between the countries of Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Albania, it is surrounded by strained relations on all sides, countries that have refused to recognize its autonomy for a long time. A significant Albanian Moslem minority feuds with the dominant Orthodox Christian Slav population. Hardly a week passes without a new arms network running from Alabania to Macedonia being discovered. Despite the presence of U.N. peacekeeping forces, armed skirmishes ravage the countryside.Milcho Manchevski left his native Macedonia to pursue a college education in the U.S. He studied film at Southern Illinois University. Upon graduating, he moved to New York and began working on commercial, experimental films, and music videos. BEFORE THE RAIN is his first full-length feature, for which he returned to his native country to make. He was able to secure British and French financing with his creative, authoritative and topical screenplay. An inspiring tale about the senselessness of war and the fragility of humans and their loves, the film is, despite some minute flaws, one of the most passionate and sublime cinematic statements of the '90s.It has an intriguing, if not wholly original non-linear narrative structure. Through three episodes titled, "Words," "Faces," and "Pictures," respectively, the viewer is introduced to three characters whose lives interconnect from minute to strongly significant ways. Kiril (Gregoire Collin, of OLIVIER, OLIVIER) is a young novice in an Orthodox monastery who cannot help but hide Zamira (Labina Mitevska), a fugitive Albanian girl, from the villagers who want to execute her for murdering a shepherd. He does it out of the goodness of his heart, but perhaps also out of the beginnings of a lustful affection for her. They flee north in an attempt to find Kiril's uncle in Skopje, and meet with dire hardship and tragedy.Meanwhile, in England, Anne (Katrin Kartlidge, most familiar as the lisping goth girl from Mike Leigh's film NAKED), a photo editor is in the midst of a personal crisis. She is becoming more and more disaffected with her husband Nick (Jay Villiers) while experiencing a difficult, confused relationship with her lover, Aleksandar (Rade Serbedzija), an award-winning native Macedonian photographer. Unsure of what to do, she distances herself from both men, but cannot stem the tide of the turbulent events all around her. The story dispenses with her husband in somewhat contrived way, and she ends up trying to find Aleksandar, who has since left for Macedonia.Aleksandar returns to his native village, only to find that the overall climate has radically changed, and the simple life he tries to rediscover has since been made more complex by the feuds with the Albanians. His return is met with mixed reactions from warm welcomes from his close friends, to cold-shouldering by the newly-armed local anti-Albanian faction, to outright hatred from some of the Albanians. When his childhood love from a neighboring village seeks his aid to help protect her daughter, Aleksandar is thrust into the heart of the conflict, and his refusal to takes sides has tragic repercussions. Serbedzija interprets the role with a noble, morally centered sense of confidence. One of former Yugoslavia's most well known and respected actors, Serbedzija found his role to be a way of protesting the conflicts in his region-"As an artist, as someone well-known, I had to speak out against nationalism and war. As Aleksandar was presumed to take sides, so was I. It's my story. What ends up happening to Aleksandar, when cousins take arms against cousins, has happened to many in former Yugoslavia and it could happen to me."With its non-linear structure, the time-line of the film is somewhat incoherent, and there are some plot developments in the middle segment, occurring in England, which are a bit too pat. These are balanced by the striking, somewhat exotic visuals and original, exhilarating neo-ethnic music by a group called Anastasia, fine acting (especially by Collin and Serbedzija), and an overall poignant sense of the waste of war, even a war in its beginnings. Manchevski illuminates his use of the film's title - "There was this sense of something heavy beginning to happen, something looming in the air. At the same time life was continuing as before. This story doesn't deal with the political aspects of how wars start. It's about human passion and how it can lead one in different, unexpected directions. It's about how a war somewhere in the world might get started and how that can affect your life regardless of where you are. Ultimately, it's about taking sides."</fullReview>

The reason why I think this is one of the best movies that deals with the Balkans is because it focuses on ethnic strife, but is made with a nostalgic longing for the past and a hope for the future.

		<fullReview>A recent trend in films is to present plots non-sequentially. This isn't done all the time, of course, but this radical way of constructing a plot have simply been overused in recent years. For me, the novelty has definitely worn off. Because of that, I wasn't as impressed with "Before the Rain" and many other reviewers.This film consists of three stories--all which relate to Macedonia and ethnic violence. However, while at first the three stories only seem to have this as the common thread, some of the characters also appear in multiple stories--making one larger story about hatred and ethnic violence. Story 1 is about an Albanian woman who is being sought by Christian Macedonians--and she's being sheltered by a monk who has taken a vow of silence.Story 2 is about a pregnant Brit whose lover is Macedonian. He has been living abroad for many years but leaves to go back--and leaves her behind pregnant. When she meets her husband to ask for a divorce, BAD things happen somewhat out of the blue.Story 3 shows the man in 2 in Macedonia and his return isn't as happy as he'd hoped.Each story is well done and interesting. The acting and direction are also quite nice. But as I indicated above, I am personally tiring of non-sequential films and the novelty has worn off for me. Well done but I am not in love with the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before the Rain has a similar format to Babel, with three separate stories which come together at the end. In the first, a young monk has taken a vow of silence and is protecting Zamira, an Aobanian girl on the run from the mob. He leaves the monastery and travels throughout Macedonia with her, attempting to escape.The second chapter involves a photo editor in London, having to choose between her husband, Nick, and a war photographer, Aleksandar. She gets caught up in a series of tragic events, beginning with a shoot out at a restaurant. The third segment ties the first two together through somewhat confusing flashbacks, and one scene, in particular is a definite timeline mistake. I sent an email to the director, and he says that it was intentional. Poetic license was is reasoning. The movie is a violent but realistic depiction of the war in the former Yugoslavia. There are no winners, only victims of another stupid and pointless conflict. Before the Rain is an excellent drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot praise this film highly enough. It is one of my all time favorites.This is an exquisite, haunting film that does not get shown enough. The three interlocking parts of the story slant time and recast different characters in parallel tales that form a wreath, not a sequence or circle. Each story follows a similar arc and includes similar elements: a hidden impregnation; an agonizing choice that reaches out to one that has already passed out of reach; an unexpected victim of violence; and the tragic back story of attack and retribution that dates back at least a thousand years to a late Byzantine reprisal. The elements map to the Christ story as if it had been compressed in a black hole, the virgin birth and sacrificial death compacted together and exploding out of a dazzling collage of violently mindless brutality and mindful attention--to prayer, to craft, to shepherdry. Where is the viewer? A tragedy that is so alive in current events calls to action. If we are mute witnesses, then the story will reach a point where we must testify to the tragedy(so the photographer's stills tell us). But what words could have stopped what happened? If we stand by and are glad that the story is not ours we may yet find ourselves in the story. It doesn't matter if the face is Balkan or Palestinian--ejecting the combatants fails as policy. In the end and ending, reentering the picture as participant, not witness, repossessing the ruins of home and taking responsibility for the fruit of love, means giving up personal immortality (the European illusion of celebrity) in exchange for a blood-soaked collective eternity.</fullReview>

It was the best I saw at Sundance that year. It is a moving experience and I'm glad that I got to share a piece of the vision that the cast &amp; crew bestowed upon the common person.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being from Balkans myself, I very much understand the mentality depicted in this film. There were some specific moments, especially in the first segment, where I felt extremely close to these people. But I think in the end Manchevski over-emphasized in this aspect of Balkan culture, making it more like an attraction for tourists than reality. Speaking about the pot: The main motto about the circle not being round is confirmed at the end and produces a very strange but nice feeling. The performances are excellent and so is the scenario. You should not miss this. It's a gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful look at the futility of hate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Before the Rain" is a compelling drama which examines the ethnic hatreds bubbling over the cauldron of Macedonia in the wake of the post cold war Balkan fragmentation. A masterpiece of filmcrafting with a circular story backbone and a cosmopolitan cast, "BTR" focuses on one war weary Macedonian photo-journalist who returns to his roots to find his homeland torn by ethnic/religious hate. A must see for those into serious drama and foreign films. (A-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before The Rain changed the structure of European film industry forever. This masterpiece remains a studybook for all young (and experienced too) directors all over the world. An efficient example how an artistic masterpiece can become a powerful political tool and a strong prophecy for a self destroying nation ( Quote: 'There is no reason fr shooting here Doc. - They'll find it. The war is an epidemy.) Of all the films I have seen in my life, as a fan of directors such as David Lynch and John Burman, I am ensured that this is the definite perfection in film art and industry so far. it is ridiculous to compare it to Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction', as some do, hence the significance of Tarantino's film (which is a work of art for itself, also) is trivial, compared to the cultural, political, multidimensional reality significance of Manchevski's film.

		<fullReview>There are a lot of trashy films and sub par performances out there. Soon we will learn who was the worst for last year. Among the contenders are Johnny Depp for The Lone Ranger, Ashton Kutcher for Jobs, Adam Sandler for Grown-Ups 2, Jaden Smith for After Earth, and Sylvester Stallone for Bullet To The Head, Escape Plan and Grudge Match.It is films like Before the Rain that makes movie going worthwhile and makes us forget the junk that assaults our senses.When we hear about Bosnians, Croats, and Serbs, we have a tendency to tune out. What do we care? It's not out war. But this film will put it in perspective in a way that you will care because all war is our war.Oscar nominated for Best Foreign Language Film, we will have to face the fact that we are often consumed by hate to the exclusion of all else. As long as that exists, we will be constantly at war.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it is a film about the dust of words. about power of self definition. about death. and hate. about courage. and a deformed universe. each character is letter of a testimony. each testimony is another cold circle of ash.and nothing else. a monk, a girl, a photographer. a village as scene of a profound crime. sure, it is slice from a war. but this war has not end. it is expectation, desire, ladder. a seed as demolition of another old order. for this cause the film is touching and impressive. because it is clear. and honest. because is a picture. the places, the dialogs, the borders of circles are only shadows of events. three stories. and the cruel silence. that is all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before the Rain is an allegory. Before the rain is the air heavier and flies bites and the same before civil war in former Jugoslavia. People starting to show their hidden hate and all are preparing for the war. Old friends become hostiles and the common sense is going to fade away. People are forgetting the value of one's life and young boys are becoming great soldiers with guns in hands. And as a summer storm the war is spreading and thunders warn us about its nearness.It shows the story of world-wide famous photographer who comes back home after many years spent in wars but finds again the war and the same story of man's foolishness. The way how was this movie made in kind of retrospective (in curious way) and marks the metaphorical thought mentioned in the title above (by the mouth of the priest). Next to all these there is shown a pure young love and some religious scenes as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before the Rain begs a second viewing as boldly as any movie I've seen, which is both a strength and a shortcoming. It is intriguing to feel so compelled to rewind and replay a video, but also frustrating when the objective is to decipher a purposefully confusing plot. That said, the plot is worth absorbing and the movie is worth reviewing. Manchevski delivers a strong message with interesting visuals and metaphors and a unique use of two languages and three stand-alone stories, which are simply told by themselves yet complexly, and confusingly at first, intertwined.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Human drama in the war torn Balkans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A historical background in the centuries-old conflicts of the Balkan region will help the viewer fully appreciate this film. Simply put, the movie tells the story of a Macedonian man who, while practising photo-journalism for an British photo service, decides that his duty to his homeland and family may well outweigh all other considerations in his life, including career and romance. The story is told using an ingenious cyclical storyline which represents the never ending conflicts of the Macedonian/Albanian region. It is important for the viewer to know that the fundamental historical conflict that is unexplained in the movie (leaving the viewer guessing as to the reason for the warring factions) is between Serbian Christians and Macedonian/Albanian Muslims. After seeing this film, I asked the same question I did after seeing Welcome To Sarajevo, namely, why are these people fighting? This distinction is NOT drawn in the film and the viewer is on his own but it is, nevertheless, an excellent film because of its sheer drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting images of Macedonia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about Macedonians and Albanians and the deep-rooted hatred and mistrust that exists. Filmed on location in Macedonia, the photographic images are quite superb and are backed by original enchanting music by "Anastasia". The film is divided into 3 parts called "Words"' "Faces" and "Pictures". I enjoyed the excitement of Part 1 set in and around a monastery high on a cliff overlooking Lake Ohrid. A young Macedonian monk who has taken a vow of silence finds an Albanian girl hiding in his room. He denies her presence when questioned by the other monks but eventually is found out and is excommunicated.The second part set in London does not have the haunting appeal of the Macedonian segments. The massacre scene is strong stuff. Altogether it is a sad and violent film which highlights the misery we heap on ourselves through ethnic misunderstanding. The remarkable thing about this film is that it was conceived by Milcho Manchevski before the recent outbreak of hostilities in Kosovo and the displacement of ethnic Albanians. An enigmatic expression is used frequently in the film: "Time never dies: The circle is not round". My interpretation is that we can continually strive for perfection though never attain it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this was my favorite movie until i recently saw stuff like natural born killers, eraserhead and buffalo '66. i've seen it twice, found it very impressive both times. i like the balkan scenery, pretty much all the performances (esp. kiril) and a lot of the small touches, like the clothing (american brands, even in bosnia) and the weirdness with time. people that ive talked to about this movie insist that it's a perfect circle, despite the quote "the circle is not round" and an incident in the movie that never made sense to me. when Anne is looking at the pictures that aleksander gives her, are there not pictures in there of stuff that happened on the trip that alesander died on? how could he be in london giving her the pics of stuff that happened right before he died in london. i don't mind this, i even like it, but it bothers me that no one agrees with me about it. in any case, the circular form is very cool, whether it's round or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeline Was Too Dischordant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously most people are enthralled with this movie. I wasn't. The music was good but the cinematography was lacking - too many shots shown over again. I watch a lot of foreign movies and, I guess, unfortunately had just watched "A Very Long Engagement" with cinematography that excelled. I suppose the message in Before The Rain was that time may not have been circular but it certainly comes back onto itself. The feeling I had was that the writer wanted to paint this little universe, which always repeated itself. Was this plot anything to do with the reality we all live in? No! We live in a linear reality and we don't see pictures of things that haven't happened yet. I thought it was more than depressing that the cycle the writer chose was punctuated with fusillades of gunfire from start to end. I thought "Dark Country" made better use of an enclosed circular universe.I also found the likelihood that someone could return to his old home after 16 years false, especially with the tribality and backwardness of the inhabitants which he had outgrown shortly after leaving. I have been traveling for 7 years and things are different. I could not go back to what was and be a part of those I knew. So the idea that Rade, world-wise traveler thought he could just enter his old stomping grounds did not make sense. He would have had more sense, particularly when he was met by a gun-toting guard. When he first arrived he saw his house had been abandoned so how could he not understand his old life had also been abandoned?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A predictably intense and depressing film about nationalism in Macedonia.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The London segments, i.e. the segments in English, though relatively short, drag the film down somewhat; the dialogue here is clumsy. The scene with the restaurant shoot-out is absurd and stupid: a Balkan mobster starts shooting at people randomly, a place where Cartlidge - a photographer or journalist - just happens to be, telling her husband she wants a divorce. (How conveniently her problem is solved, by him getting killed there moments later!). A little too far-fetched. Serbedjija is upset with Cartlidge because she refuses to follow him to Macedonia, him having given her very short notice! What is this, kindergarten?...The rest of BTR, which revolves around a couple of small villages, is much better, but suffers from a bad case of premonitia: we know Serbedjija will get killed; it's just a matter of time. The acting and the dialogue is solid. The film's main statement - that all sides in such a conflict are equally guilty - was a wise choice for the director to make. This decision is not to be taken for granted because most directors - particularly left-wing Western ones - aren't capable of approaching any political issue in a movie in a constructive, logical, fair, intelligent, and unbiased manner.Frankly, I saw this quite a while ago, hence am not sure what I'd think about it now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>politically correct but amateurish dud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this after reading all the positive comments here. They were all wrong. It has the feel of a film-school movie. The characters have no interest. The story is simple, though a little time-twisted. It feels less archetypal, or mythic, than simply schematic: assembled by a writer without much imagination. Some nice, though very drawn out shots of the landscape. Very slow. No chemistry between the main man and woman. Extraneous scenes of her and her husband (she's having an affair). A killing in a restaurant that also means nothing. Best scenes are early shots of the monastery. Too many closeups of the main actor, who doesn't do much acting. The question of why it's all happening is raised and dropped. In real life it's a terrible situation, and I feel for the real people. But this is a movie, and a bad one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It sucked butt.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a slow pace, weak plot, terrible dialogue and a Donnie Darko-timeline, this film has nothing to offer Americans. It is simply a collaboration of mediocre cinematography combined with fragments of a plot only suited for foreign-filmers who don't expect any character development, decent acting, "good" directing, or even a freaking point. It's a silent film, but with words, and it bored the crap out of me. First of all, I was confused. I have never been so frustrated with a movie; ironically, I expect this to be one of those films that you're supposed to allow it to affect you without worrying about it, but ouch what a headache...Okay... I'm very picky about my movies and usually blow off most "Hollywood" movies right away, unless I see that people like it or have some special reason to go see it, but even then I am often disappointed. Independent cinema is where it's at... but to be completely honest, most foreign films drive me mad. So many of them will spend 10-20 minutes just letting something "sink in"... that means no dialogue and often no score for an unfairly long amount of time! Dialogue is the key to successful filming, that's where the screenwriters should come in, and Manchevski is clueless. The dialogue was worthy of only Keanu Reeves and there was far too little of it to make a whole movie, so instead they showed us the same shots, and the same angles over and over again, against the sound of? silence, expecting dramatic effect. And then? oh no! A random guy pops out with a gun and destroys any hope the movie had in being any good. I must admit I was hopeful when the movie started, I watched closely, listened closely, thought openly, and was ultimately crushed by its inability to give me what I paid for. It sucked butt.</fullReview>
