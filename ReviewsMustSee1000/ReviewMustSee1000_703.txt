		<shortDescription>My Conchita...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to begin by saying that this is one of the most bizarre films that I have ever experienced in my career as a movie buff. I have seen some twist endings, some passionately bad French films, and even some stalker films, but nothing compares to the cinematic genius that I just witnessed. Being a Bunuel 'virgin', I didn't know what to expect coming into this film.I was ready for anything, but interestingly enough nothing will prepare you for this film. Deeply rooted in cinematic symbolism, we watch as two very interesting devises that are used to bring forth the overall theme of this film. Two devises that I have never seen used in a movie, until now.The first is the obvious. Bunuel successfully uses two different actresses to play the same role of Conchita. At first I thought perhaps it was going to be one of those 'twin' double-cross films where these two girls used this older wealthy man for all his money. I was wrong. Similar to the title of this film, this is a film about passions and desires. It divulges in the emotion of obsession, and the reaction a man can have on someone that he desperately and sexually desires. Mathieu is our possible victim in this story. While both are not the most interesting characters (both have flaws and troubles), they do provide some structured characters. Mathieu is willing to give up everything for this woman that he hardly knows, but is physically attracted to her. It is hard to say that he loves her, but he does lust for her. The dual role of Conchita in this film is used for two purposes. The first is as a distraction, while the second is emotion. Both Conchitas are different in their own way and are used to push forward the story. Whenever Bunuel needed to convey a different emotion, he would bring in the actress that best represented that emotion. At first it was confusing, but as the film progressed you began to see less and less separate actresses, but instead as one character. It is impressive how Bunuel created this illusion.As I mentioned above, there were two devises that I have never seen in a movie before. I explained above about the use of two women for one female role, but the second is a bit subtler. I briefly mentioned it above about how these two women (one character) were used to distract. If you pay attention to the film terrorism is a big part of the universe surrounding Mathieu. While he pines continually for Conchita, the world around him is falling apart. Bombings and deaths are at an all time high, yet he doesn't really seem to notice this. He is so caught up in Conchita that it seems like nothing else exists. He is oblivious to his surroundings. In fact, I would go so far as to say that we are also oblivious to the surroundings. Bunuel does this job of keeping our eye focused on the interchanging women that we sometimes forget or miss the actions surrounding this film. I believe that Bunuel is trying to prove the point that obsession does obscure your vision. It blurs your eyes and forces you to miss crucial elements of your surroundings. It isn't until the end when we are reminded violently of the truth surrounding our characters. I felt that Bunuel was slapping me in the face with that final scene. I had nearly forgotten myself of the terrorism outside, but easily he reminded me. This was a spectacular film that really opened my eyes to a completely new way of film-making. It reminded me of some of the early works of another favorite director of mine Francois Ozon. Both of these talented artists have their own way of creating a world and an emotion, and both do it with some of the most beautiful strokes of their mechanical brush. I would recommend this film to anyone that is willing to experience radical, yet provocative film-making at its best. You will be impressed.I cannot wait to include this film in my collection to watch over and over again. Thanks to Criterion, they have provided a beautiful packaging to this obscure film.Grade: ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film of our time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I would like to clarify the issue of the two actresses playing the same character, Conchita. Bunuel initially worked with Maria Schneider (Last tango in Paris) for the title role. In the course of shooting the film Maria Schneider quit; her reasons were that she could not understand, and therefor portray, the character as was requested by Bunuel. This honesty is to this actress' credit. Then Bunuel took the full logic of the character, Conchita, as a bi-faceted character indeed, sometimes cool and calm and serene (played by the quietly beautiful Carole Bouquet) and on other times sensuous and hot and lustful (played by the fiery beauty Angela Molena).Now what can one say about this masterpiece of a film? It is the eternal story of man chasing woman, to satisfy his earthly desires, and the woman who is sometimes romantic, sometimes wild, always passionate and self-conscious, driving the man mad, humiliating him and toying with him, then again satisfying his ego and deepest fantasies and even truly loving him. Freud knew it all along. Man and woman are surrounded by inexplicable events, absurd, surreal, strange as life can be. And their game goes on. In the course of the film Bunuel "winks" and reminds us of his eternal dislikes of the "bourgeoisie" -here in the form of an upper class rich and corrupt diplomat- who are genuinely so keen on etiquette and good manners, as evidenced by the rat that appears on the main character's dish ! and also the director's dislike of the church establishment and supposedly "devout" people as evidenced by the hypocrisy of Conchita's mother practically selling her daughter. It's a superb film, summarizing the eternal relationship between man and woman, amid normal extra-ordinary events, with top class actors under the directorship of Bunuel the genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Using two actresses for one role not a planned plot device</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contrary to the initial comment on this page, the director Luis Bunuel did not use two different actresses to play the lead role as a plot device to show "One actress for her placid nature and another actress for her tempermental side."While this is an oft-repeated misconception, it's not remotely true. In Luis Bunuel's autobiography, "My Last Sigh" (A fantastic book, still in print) the director discusses the reason for this unique directorial device, and how funny he finds it that so many "fans" assume that the choices were based on the actresses temperment or his desire to "express" something obscure. In truth, two actresses were used simply because the lead actress quit partway through production after having completed many critical scenes. Luis was beside himself over the wasted time and money in reshooting, so he hired a replacement to shoot only the missing scenes, and edited them irregardless of who was acting in a given scene. It served him well, as the end result was brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>surrealist masterpiece on self-conceit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film with my parents, &amp; ended up having an interesting discussion with my mother on it. I'd seen Le Charme discret de la bourgeoisie beforehand, which was probably helpful.The translation of the title reads, "that obscure object of desire" which is as relevant a title as could be. It's a surrealist film, which is only directly revealed not in the strange dream-sequences Charm employs, but rather in a very simple technical element: the use of two actresses for a single female lead. The two actresses are interchanged with seeming complete subjectivity. The only easy thread to denote is perhaps that one actress plays the more "French" side whereas the other plays the more "Spanish" side -- as though the character is meant to be Spanish, she grew up partially in Paris. I've read some theorizing that the one of the sides was emotive, &amp; the other distracting -- which is also plausible.However most of what I want to discuss goes to the core of the meaning of a surreal film. My mom, it must be said, does not care much for the surrealists. I must admit, I never was crazy about Salvador Dali. The problem I think both of us have had to varying degrees is our own base level of empiricism that surreality ignores. Obviously, one woman can not be two women in any literal sense. But I think this is where the value of surreality can be appreciated. Surrealism has an ultimate primacy of being able to discriminate completely against "insignificant time" (as I posted on before) &amp; even the ability to flaunt "insignificant time" as "significant time." The film itself I feel must be read as symbolic. Neither characters are particularly sympathetic in the sense that neither is particularly human. The male archetype is presented as Mathieu: older, richer, &amp; wanting sex. The female archetype is presented as Conchita (which is short for the Spanish name Conception): young, beautiful, virginal, but sexually aware. My mom projected literal psychology on both characters as being the opposing parts of a sadomasochistic relationship, with Conchita as the sadist. I don't think it's that simple.Conchita continually asserts a nearly narcissistic if not wholly so appreciation of her self &amp; independence. Whenever she feels Mathieu could own her she spites him with her assertions she is physically capable of providing for herself. Mathieu, in turn, desires Conchita greatly but does not seem to love her. He makes no overtures of marriage, &amp; in fact seems very resistant to the idea. Conchita is threatened by her "love" of Mathieu, &amp; the loss of independence it would engender, &amp; Mathieu is obsessed with his physical desire for Conchita.Throughout the film Bunuel seems to throw in irrelevant information about terrorism, which is only made more silly &amp; surreal by its treatment (one of the groups is called Revolutionary Army of the Baby Jesus, with a pantheon of other silly acronyms under it) &amp; his seemingly repeating this device from Charm. The film, I believe, depicts what obsessive desires about self do to blind us to the obvious reality around us. In this case Conchita's narcissism &amp; Mattieu's lust make the fact that their world is falling apart seem totally unimportant. Bunuel uses this right up till the final scene.Before I talk about the final scene, however, I want to establish another subtle surrealist thread through the film. Mathieu carries around a bag through several of the scenes. It is very out of place because it is a cheap rucksack (Mathieu is rich) and is never given an obvious purpose. It is just a seemingly random rucksack. We find out at the end that this rucksack is filled with lace &amp; lace nightgowns: some of which are ripped &amp; bloody. Mathieu &amp; Conchita drop this rucksack off at a shop, &amp; Mathieu gestures in amazement how an middle-aged woman stitches up a hole in a beautiful blood-stained lace garment shut, as if it'd never been ripped.The implication is not difficult to read, especially when we see Conchita's reaction, which is one of utter disgust. Mathieu is carrying around his past sexual experience, &amp; trying to show Conchita that to be deflowered (Conchita's virginity is a topic of much conversation) does not mean one's delicate feminine beauty is ruined forever. Conchita reacts to this comment by running away from Mathieu. He catches up to her and here is where Bunuel reminds of the outside word: they are both blown up in a terrorist bombing. Their explosion is the finale.Bunuel uses surrealism to give a prescriptive ethical message: if you are concerned only about your needs, you will be destroyed by the outside world, which does not concern itself with you. My mom didn't like the idea that this was about gender types because she said it doesn't really apply to any men or women she knows. I feel this is a bit denying, but I can admit it's not a literally applied dynamic. It is merely a symbolic message: if we took these gender roles to their extremes we would treat each other horribly, &amp; have no consideration for the greater good. I admit this is a somewhat simple, even didactic message. But I disagree that it doesn't have meaning for reality because it does not represent reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Depending on your point of view, this film is either a biting, insightful, timeless illumination of human dignity and indignity or a woeful commentary on how painfully slowly we evolve. The main story, humorous and poignant by turns, is punctuated by subplot bits that come right out of this week's news. Not bad for a film shot a quarter of a century ago.Fernando Rey is simply wonderful, and Conchita are fabulous! Bunuel, as always, is once again a delight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apt title, though it does give the movie away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>spoilersI really wish I hadn't known the title of the movie before seeing it for the first time. The plot is an examination of a walking appetite trying to fulfill itself by subjugating and controlling what it wants. Bu?uel brings this to life with Fernando Rey playing an older man who has every need and luxury covered, but cares nothing for it if he can't have an enigmatic young woman named Conchita. Played alternately by an austere beauty, Carole Bouquet, and an impish vixen, Angela Molina, Conchita literally morphs away from him every time Rey's character comes close to having sex with her. Until the very end, she confounds and frustrates him because she is what he can never have.This is one of those movies that irritate people for several reasons. As a number of other reviews point out, Rey's Mathieu and Conchita are pretty repugnant people. Simply put, the kind of person that expects movies to provide characters who are morally good people to identify with will be as disappointed with Obscure Object as with any Altman or Kubrick film. It isn't that kind of movie. The theme is a dark examination of desire, asking - is it inseparable from a lust for control? Mathieu spends most of the movie trying to buy Conchita. Initially, he tries to coax her with food like an animal. When he learns she's a virgin, he tries to buy her off her own mother in a weirdly inverted dowry scene. Once he feels he's got exclusive rights to her in his country house, he immediately tries to set her up in his late wife's room - as though she's a new acquisition to replace an old spot left empty. And finally, in the Seville scenes where we see Conchita behind bars several times, he tries to set her up as his private stripper/whore. Conchita feints and rebuffs him at every turn, always stringing him along with a promise to love him on a condition he will never be able to meet. Namely, to respect her freedom as a person.But she is the `object' in the title and the story is mostly retold by Mathieu himself, so it's almost impossible for Conchita to be a human even to the audience. What anyone can make out by the end is that Conchita is not only coming out ahead in her scam game with Mathieu, but that she is locked into a pattern of sadistic control herself. This quest leads, inevitably, to a kind of consummation where Mathieu beats the snot out of Conchita. Bu?uel films the blows carefully and the scene is uncomfortably long. Is this the control that Mathieu bought? As he relates the scene to the people in the train car (a wonderful device for the retelling of an amoral story) he grins ecstatically as he relates how richly she deserved his attack. Then, just like every other time he's felt like he was getting somewhere with Conchita, she turns the tables on him and he finds himself pursuing her. It seems pretty obvious that violence will continue to escalate and the stakes will be higher the next time Conchita winds Mathieu up. But before we have to see this, Bu?uel blows them up in a terrorist attack. Terror and crime exist as background noise during the whole movie. Sometimes seeming to reflect the Mathieu/Conchita plot in news reports and it reinforces the theme of people getting what they desire through violence. A terrorist bomb kills indiscriminately to achieve some desired end (and Bu?uel peppers the film with references to ever more absurd terror groups that could have no rational interest in common). A mugger by necessity takes what he wants from strangers. The plot of the movie is almost a literal redistribution of Mathieu's abundant wealth to the squalid Paris suburbs that Conchita lives in and the young drifters she travels with through her elaborate scheme. And the ultimate act of terror is Mathieu finally getting his hands on the protean woman he's been chasing and beating her into submission. Well, that's the penultimate act anyway before they too are consumed in some other person's desire for something that probably had nothing to do with them.It's a masterpiece. As questionable morally in its intelligent use of stereotypes as Vertigo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bunuel seldom disappoints</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bu?uel's "That Obscure Object of Desire" dripped with substance and stunned me throughout the entire film. The masterful working of the two women into the role of Conchita was wonderful. I do not believe Bu?uel for a second when he claims that he intended to use one actress, but she quit unexpectedly after shooting several critical scenes. If it is true, it is one of the more miraculous accidents in film right up there with Casablanca and The Third Man. I can be certain that he consciously gave the different Conchita's different personalities and modes of behavior. That comes across as being the focal point of the movie, turning a mediocre "one actress" film into an engaging event. If I had to put my money on something, I'd say that Bu?uel is pulling some Andy Kaufman trickery here... the film worked too well with the so-called "change of plans." Or... if you have enough monkeys on typewriters, you'll get the Great American Novel. I don't believe this was chance at all. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not your everyday love story, or is it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luis Bu?uel is still concerned with chastity and sexual morality. In 'obscur' he concludes a trinity in my opinion (after 'fantôme' and 'discret') and his career as a director. These three films represent roughly the films he made in b/w: 'fantôme' represents the surrealism and random dreams of his first films, 'discret' represents his critical anticlericism and anti-bourgeois denouncement and 'cet obscur objet du désir' represents a number of films in which Bu?uel expresses his concerns about sexual morality (Tristana, Belle de jour, Journal d'une femme de chambre). The great Fernando Rey (French Connection, Tristana, Viridiana, Campanadas a medianoche) and the great cinematographer Edmond Richard (Campanadas a medianoche '65, le Proc?s '63, Fantôme liberté '74, Charme discret '72) complement Bu?uel's intriguing techniques. Even the cover of the video (a stitched mouth) complements the preceding two (a statue of liberty with a limp torch, a mouth with two legs and a hat). Unfortunately 'obscur' is not as startling and inventive as many of Bu?uel's other films: it's not one of his best, but still very worthy.A man (Fernando Rey) step in a train, throws a bucket of water over a woman and tells his surrounding passengers (a professor in psychology, a judge, a child and her mother, who inquire because they're eager to hear the sordid details) about how he met Conchita (former maid, Carola Bouquet/Ángela Molina) and tried to win her by paying her's and her mother's bills. This bourgeois man thinks he can buy her love and her mother's help (like buying furniture, or like trapping a mouse with a mouse-trap). Those are the premises for a moralistic but incredibly subtle story (not a farce) about subversiveness. There is no music in the film, apart from the end scene and some flamenco source music. I do appreciate a film that doesn't need music to emphasize emotions. That was one of Bu?uel's many virtues.The mysterious actress Muni appears several times. But really strange are the two actresses playing the same woman. They probably represent the two Conchitas: one rational and very careful not to get trapped (wearing an iron maiden and a white handbag), the other with temperament, attracted to Mathieu but devious and deceitful (with a black handbag just one second after carrying the white one). In Mathieu's mind Conchita was a hypocrit (Rey: 'You will appreciate that she deserved the chastisement'). Or is it only the same woman in the mind of Mathieu? Are the two Conchitas representing Mathieu's constantly changing mind? Or did something happen to one of the actresses on the set so that Bu?uel had to finish shooting with another actress? Later that day Conchita carries a brown handbag, after having thrown a bucket of water over Mathieu she must have made some message clear to him, uniting the former two handbags in one (?) and uniting the two Conchitas in one? Their relationship explodes eventually. I'm wondering how that emerged from the novel by Pierre Lou?s: writer of 'La femme et le pantin' (1958).8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the last sigh of a master surrealist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few other directors would dare to equate the male libido with international terrorism, but the final feature by master surrealist Luis Bu?uel is a dark comic web of sexual obsession (too dark to be truly funny) set against a background of random explosions and political assassinations. The always dapper Fernando Rey stars as a wealthy gentleman who develops an all-consuming infatuation for his young Spanish maid, who by turns tempts him, teases him, refuses him, and finally humiliates him. All Rey wants is to carry his passion to its logical conclusion, but her (deliberately?) unpredictable shifts in mood, from coy temptation to spiteful rejection, leave him in a state of dangerous frustration. Bu?uel applies his usual sly wit to the otherwise cynical and pessimistic scenario (one man affectionately refers to women as "sacks of excrement"), going so far as to cast two completely different actresses in the title role and interchanging them at random. The film is at once perverse and disturbing, providing a suitably mordant swan song to a long and distinguished career in movie iconoclasm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Devil Is a Woman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last film of a great master, his "swan song" was based on the novel "La femme et le pantin" written by Pierre Lou?s. The novel has been adapted to the screen eight times, and among the films are Josef Von Sternberg's "The Devil Is a Woman" with Marlene Dietrich, Julien Duvivier's "La Femme et le Pantin" with Brigitte Bardot, and The Woman and the Puppet (1920) directed by Reginald Barker with Geraldine Farrar, American opera star from the Metropolitan Opera (1906-1922), one of the great beauties of her day, as well as one of the great voices of all time. It is not surprising that Luis Bunuel chose for his film the story of obsession, desire and all kinds of obstacles, including social, religious, and sexual that make it impossible to fulfill. All his films are explorations of the same theme, starting with the early "L'Âge d'or". "That obscure object of desire" is a story of Mathieu, a middle age businessman (Fernando Rey who had given great performances in four Bunuel's films), and a young woman named Conchita ? played by two different actresses (French serene beauty Carole Bouquet and Spanish sensual Ángela Molina) ? who alternately captivates and torments him. The director described his film as a "story of impossibility to own a woman's body". Luis Bu?uel claims that there were neither a reason nor an explanation for using two actresses for the same role, he just felt that it would be right: "I don't know why it should be two. It was automatic" (from the DVD interview). When asked, what the obscure object of desire is, Buunuel answered: "I don't know." I think it is the best answer. How could the obscure object of desire be described or defined? Bunuel was able to recreate in the movie the atmosphere of danger, uncertainly and insecurity. Wherever the main character goes in search of his object of desire, there are always bombings, shootings, and theft.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Obscure Dichotomy of Mind and World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cet obscur objet du désir or That Obscure Object of Desire marked the final film by Luis Bunuel. It is his cinematographic legacy and can be seen as a reflection of his production. It was totally an unexpected film by Bunuel. He had just made, according to himself, a trilogy (The Milky Way, The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, The Phantom of Liberty) of films episodic in structure and with no direct plot. That Obscure Object of Desire was much more linear in structure but just as ambiguous and challenging.That Obscure Object of Desire is an astonishing piece of work and could easily be seen as Bunuel's finest film. Like most films by Bunuel, this film has a lot to offer and is open for several different interpretations. The film is multidimensional and has got many layers; social, political and erotic levels. This idea is reinforced by the parallel worlds Bunuel had placed in the film. The new world is the world of Conchita - the world of terrorism; Luis Bunuel saw terrorism as the biggest issue of our time, and was contemplating questions whether it was justified to kill innocent people to achieve justice. He was thinking about these issues seriously, and this contemplating has clearly reflected on That Obscure Object of Desire.Then there's the old world which Don Mathieu represents - the world which is disappearing. Don Mathieu tries to get in touch with the new world but can't and finds himself taking more and more distance to it. I shall depict this a little through an example. The scene where Conchita is having sex (actually faking) with his 'lover' and, let's Don Mathieu watch through the gate. First he stays there, then he leaves, but after a while comes back. He takes distance to the new world but can't let go of the object of his desire. This idea of two parallel worlds and Mathieu in between of the transition is reinforced by the fact that this film takes place in two different countries - worlds; Spain and France. This separation to two worlds is shown to the viewer in multiple images but one quite illustrating one is the picture where first, the camera films high skyscrapers - close to heaven, but then slowly lands down and reveals cranky shacks on the ground. This theme of dichotomy repeats in the character of Conchita who is played by two actresses. The two different actresses reinforce the emotional charge and elusiveness of Conchita. Carole Bouquet represents the cold, frigid side of Conchita and Ángela Molina the warm, sympathetic side. They represent two contrasts of the character and this highlights the theme of dichotomy. It was common to use one actor to play multiple roles, for instance Jean Marais is Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast, but to use two actors to play one role was groundbreaking in the history of cinema and it worked, incredibly well. This elusive character also represents a very masculine perspective of women; volatile and treacherous. But to my mind it has nothing to do with Bunuel's own attitude, it just builds up the character, and Don Mathieu's Obscure Desire for Conchita; obscure because of the elusiveness of the character.The film portrays an artificial world, which Bunuel loved to portray as the world of the bourgeoisie. This theme was culminated in one of the most famous scenes in The Discreet Charm of The Bourgeoisie; where the characters realize that their life is just an act, performed at a stage - their life's fake, show, only display. That Obscure Object of Desire is told through Mathieu's, at times interrupted, monologue; and at one point one of the fellow passengers takes a clear contact to the camera as he takes a look at us. This contact proves that there is a camera - fiction knows that it is fiction, film admits only being a film. The life of the characters is just a movie - just an act.The ending of That Obscure Object of Desire is quite fascinating and left open for interpretation. The film is Bunuel's cinematographic legacy where the circle of his production comes to an end - the music by Wagner in the ending is a reference to Bunuel's first film, An Andalusian Dog. There is certain realism in the aesthetics of Bunuel, not in the perversions, bruises or honest portrayal of violence but in the behavior of the characters, and the wounds done by the actions of them. In the films by Bunuel, there are many wounds torn but the characters always try to heal them by sewing (Belle de Jour, Diary of a Chambermaid). In the final scene of That Obscure Object of Desire Don Mathieu and Conchita see a woman sewing a bloody sheet. The woman is sewing the wound of the society, healing the wounds done by the characters, but also the wound of cinema - torn by Bunuel.After this, Don Mathieu and Conchita walk away from the woman and, suddenly the entire place explodes. Luis Bunuel adored Fritz Lang's Destiny (1921) and it was one of his very favorite films. It's a film about Death who is tired of misery and agony - Bunuel was incredibly fascinated by this presence of Death and the communication with him. For Bunuel man could only live freely if he let's his life in the hands of coincidence, blind chance. But there is one inevitable destiny that awaits us all - death, in our bedroom or in the streets dominated by terrorism. The title of the film is obscure, elusive and indefinite itself and fits perfectly for this story with no end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"That Obscure Object Of Desire" is one of the most influential films I have ever seen! I remember liking it very much when I watched it for the first time long ago; but a few days ago I decided to watch it again and found myself completely absorbed in its magnificence and the splendour of suggestive details Bunuel entered into the film. Having two actresses playing the role of Conchita represent two separate moods and even personalities of hers. It is even stressed by the fact that one of them exits the room with one particular hair-style and enters again with her hair made in a different way. The "first Conchita" is French-looking, shy, subtle and demure, always with her head bend down, in an obedient, servant-like manner, whereas the "other Conchita" looks a lot more like a Spaniard, with big beautiful eyes and slightly curly hair, moody and demanding- the dominant side of her personality. There are two more, let's say, surreal details present throughout the film: one of them being the package Mathieu lefts behind at the beginning of the film which appears to be the same as the one out of which the girl in the shop window takes the blood-stained veil, and which supposedly contains a bomb that goes off at the very end; the other detail being the constant terrorist attacks, whether shown directly or by means of radio or newspapers announcements. Apart from the possibility that Conchita herself might belong to a group of terrorists, as her friendship with guys who at one point rob Mathieu suggests, there is also another point of view considering the relationship between Mathieu and Conchita, full of hatred- love/attraction-repulsion tension as some kind of a psychological bomb that would eventually explode. As I was watching this film, I thought it obvious that Conchita doesn't love or even respect Mathieu and that he's been trying, not only to take his money, but also to utterly destroy him, as some kind of a temptress. However, having seen that after gaining the property over the house in Spain as a present from Mathieu, and after ditching him in an abrupt manner, she still seeks him and torments him, I realised that not only he cannot live without her, but she as well possesses some kind of peculiar attachment to him, may it only be to humiliate him or being humiliated or even beaten by him. Therefore, I think there are no grounds upon which the theories that she is only after his money and nothing else might be based. This film conveys the ever-present motif of dualism of human nature, the motif that stretches back to "The Picture Of Dorian Gray" or "Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde", etc. It is also about human obsession with the (possibly) the only thing they cannot possess, representing one's own Holy Grail, in this case, the disputable virginity of the main female character. The film does not tell the viewers all men are swine who only want to physically possess women and nothing else, nor does it tell all women are devils in disguise who trick men into their spider web playing the card of innocence and virginity. It simply tells the story of humanity bound to its needs, fantasies and, above all, frustrations about things beyond their reach. The sick love(?!) story of mutual torment and humiliation, but also of mutual need and dependence upon one another, where the roles of who is the tormentor and who the tormented are not always as clear as they seem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... Bunuel (not Sam, in this case). This movie is again about human obsession! The trick using 2 different actresses for one role as stated by another user, is not unique per se, but heightens the surrealism of the movie. And it does work perfectly as to other films that couldn't handle that same weight. Or couldn't convey it to the viewing audience at least!While it has a slow pace, the movie feeds from it, especially because you have to get a grip of the story- and time-line you have to handle. It is not difficult to follow, but you might need to watch it a second time to really appreciate it :o)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The discreet charm of the phantom of Tristana.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pierre Louys 's novel had already transferred thrice to the screen:by Jacques de Baroncelli in 1928,Von Sternberg in 1935 ( "Devil is a woman" starring Marlene Dietrich) and finally Julien Duvivier (1958,starring Brigitte Bardot).When Bunuel takes a book ,he always makes it his very own :see for instance what he did with "Robinson Crusoe" !So his permanent features are present here even if personally ,I think that "cet obscur..." is the weakest of his latter days works.But even when Bunuel is not at his best,he's better than most of the rest .Like the bourgeois in "discreet charm of the bourgeoisie" are searching for a good meal which ,in spite of their dough,they can never get,Rey is on fire:he covets a woman ,he wants to have sex with her but something happens every time he is about to assuage his passion.Besides,in order to puzzle his pitiful hero,Bunuel uses two different actresses:Carole Bouquet's character belongs to the perverse young girls with a Madonna face ,recalling Deneuve's Tristana or Severine ("Belle de jour" )whereas Angela Molina is the sensuous bitchy woman (Djin (Simone Signoret)in "la mort en ce jardin" ;Pedro's mother in "los olvidados").Religion had always been Bunuel's b?te noire :here he works ,so to speak,on a large scale(the terrorists kill in the name of the Jesus baby !) and on a smaller one (Conchita's mother ,a military man's(!) widow, goes to church every day but she is not afraid of making a prostitute of her daughter .)The strange gathering on the train recalls that scene in "phantom of liberty "where the guests at the inn meet in a room in the middle of the night to chat,which Milena Vukotic's presence reinforces (she's featured in the two movies).And ,last by not least,Bunuel's final opus includes a tribute to Lumi?re's "l'arroseur arrosé" (1895).Quoting the pioneers of cinema,what a wonderful way to say goodbye!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is truly great about THIS symbolic film is that it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>makes you REALLY want to know what was intended. Many symbolic films are so twisted that they became pointless to anyone not still trying to earn that "A" in Filmology 101. Not this. Eventhe fact that none of the characters are likable isn't a turn-off, because they are so obviously just symbols. Nobody is supposed to feel sorry for any of them or see themselves or their neighbors in them.so, what was intended? I CERTAINLY don't know. The film is too well done for that. Here are guesses from other people; The George Dubya view of Brunel: The "War between the sexes" is not just a game. It is just as much a war as the "War on terrorism", and to come out ahead on either requires waging full-scale war. Sitting back trying to pretend either can be played with kid's gloves leads to annihilation. Hard to believe that is the point, but that fits as well, or better, with the film than some of these other views.The Andrea Dworkin view of Brunel: Given that Brunel dwells on chastity and sexual morality ... Is sex rape? Is stealing virginity, stealing? Interesting how horrible news is recited while the torn, bloody nightgowns are being exhibited, but just as the women begins to mend the holes, the radio switches to pleasant music. Are we to take it that man's dominance of women, even the act of sex, equates with terrorism? Again, hard to believe that is the point, but that fits as well, or better, with the film than some of these other views.The bigjack2 view of Brunel: bigjack2's comment on IMDb is the best review and the most plausible view. Read it. Vote for it. Get it to the top. It isn't far removed from the Bush view, in that focus on the analogy between terrorism/anarchy and the war between the sexes. I didn't know Brunel, but if big jack2 is right that Brunel held Trotskyesque views, this is probably the best analysis.Speaking of views at the top; how did people find the one form the film buff from Ohio or wherever helpful? He calls this "one of the most bizarre films"? Are you kidding me? I don't watch that many films. OK, I do watch a high ratio of obscure or artsy films, but this film doesn't even make it into my top 30 for most bizarre films I've seen. Mr. Film-buff says "Bombings and deaths are at an all time high, yet he (Mathieu) doesn't really seem to notice this. He is oblivious to his surroundings." Are you kidding me? Mathieu is shown reacting to these events with disgust innumerable times. What? He doesn't leave his career and move form Paris to Timbuktu? Is that what makes him oblivious? Mathieu went on with his life in the face of terrorism, just as people do today. Mr. Film-buff says "I would go so far as to say that we are also oblivious to the surroundings ... we sometimes forget or miss the actions surrounding this film." Well, I think it is obvious you were oblivious, since you didn't seem to notice the innumerable times he is shown reacting to these events, but please learn to speak for yourself. The film has so many great scenes. Why has nobody mentioned the scene where Mom asks Mathieu "So, you want to marry her"? and at that very moment, a mouse gets his neck snapped in a mouse trap in the corner of the room. Great stuff. Along that line, what was the point of the fly in Mathieu's drink? And why did the owner of the club refuse to serve Conchita just after she quit, but then the next time, he practically prostrated himself for her. What change was supposed to have occurred? Was it the point that she was now known to be living with a rich man, so she had to be respected?The other under-discussed method is the makeup of the strangers on the train. A dwarf, a judge, a mother, and her YOUNG daughter. Firstly, why does Mathieu tell this story in front of the young girl? Before she is shooed out of the cabin, Mathieu has already dived deep into the war-of-the-sexes aspect. And why a dwarf? A dwarf playing a psychology professor who "gives private lessons"? Huh? This has to be a slur on psychology professors, because this professor interrupts repeatedly to make blatantly obvious points, and acting smug while doing so. Is the point that most professors are mental midgets? I don't know. And why is the judge the least judgmental of the bunch?Another question; what is "obscure"? Certainly not Mathieu's desire to pound some poontang or steal some snatch. Does "obscure" refer to virginity? to something Conchita or the terrorist's want? I'd bet on the virginity angle, but who knows? I wish I had the time to watch this film about 10x. I'm sure I'd see something new each time.</fullReview>

But seriously, these bizarre additions are intrusive but do not actually disrupt the narrative (as heavy symbolism does in so many art house films.) They are intriguing. To me it is meant to offer the audience a clue that Mathieu's love for Conchita is not pure.

		<shortDescription>Duplicity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, Bunuel certainly made a strong exit, here. This is probably one of his most beguiling movies, one that is foundationally built on characters that are contradictions of themselves.Mathieu is sleezy and exploitative... and yet he really does love, or thinks he loves, Conchita, and makes an exuberant fool out of himself doing so. Conchita is likewise attracted to Mathieu... except it's not clear if she's just using him and leading him along, or if she honestly just wants assurance that his feelings are pure. In other words, Mathieu is the loving abuser and Conchita is literally the emphasis on the prude/slut dichotomy. AAAnd so you get to watch them, for two hours, nearly destroy each other in basically one of the best dysfunctional relationships ever put on screen.Lots has been said about the two actresses playing Conchita. It gets to become pretty obvious after a while, but at first it is wonderfully surreal, the sort of subtle gesture that Bunuel is an expert at doing. However, I think it was more daring having only one person, then, play Mathieu--and especially narrate it. Mathieu's duplicitous nature is such that he is the token untrustworthy narrator, and yet it's quite clear throughout the movie that he's talking nothing but the absolute truth. This adds another layer of questions to the proceedings: is it possible that objectivity and subjectivity have finally merged? Is Conchita's double-nature only what he sees in her, or does she actually change face? And then, of course, there's the sack. It's always nice when something is pointed out on-screen that leads to mystery, but that mystery is never stated. It seems, in the end, that the sack is really the only object that gives meaning to the narrative.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watching the bourgeoisie perform mating rituals {Luis Bunuel}</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another Surrealist satire from the comic eye of the Surrealist master. This one a work of a 76 year old. However, its fresh and alive, with a teasing, warm attitude that will give it, {I predict}, an eternal duration.What are the bourgeois up to this time? Well, the lead male Don Mateo, is having dinner at a friends {as the bourgeois often do} when, lo and behold, a perfectly charming and quite delectable young chambermaid fills his glass with wine {"the wrong glass, silly girl"}. Don Mateo takes one look at this fetching young wench and the most basic instincts instantly take hold of him. He decides at that moment he must have sexual intercourse with this member of the opposite sex. As the old adage goes "it takes two to tango" she, {she answers to Conchita}, is not ready to dance. "Whoa", she says and pushes him away. As with many men who understand their class advantages as a given, Don Mateo knows that he has something that adorable, sweet, sexy, Conchita badly needs - MONEY!! Conchita is no fool and her mother and the nuns who educated her have warned her, about being on her guard with men, who have their dastardly way, use her as a sexual convenience, and then go on to the next young sex conquest, She plays her cards close to her chest, and while keeping Don Mateo's libido flirtatiously in a state of excited anticipation, she leads him on a merry dance. The name of this dance is "That Obscure Object of Desire", its 103 minutes long and its delightful to watch.The scene where she goes with him to his country house promising to deliver the goods, and then climbs into bed wearing a chastity belt, had me in hysterics {and that's rare for me}. The movie is full of teasing, surreal jokes, and the absurd conventions of the bourgeois conformist life-style, are magically presented.Bunuel beautifully illustrates the "dance" metaphor by making Conchita a Flamenco dancer { a dance of passion and love} and then surrealistically turns the convention on its head, by showing her moonlighting as a nude flamenco dancer to earn some extra cash. {"Luis, Breton would have been proud of you if he had lived to see that scene"}. Anyway, this delightful entertainment goes through umpteen twists and shifts, all maniacally clever, until the curtain comes down Unlike Hollywood endings both characters retain their integrity {no depressing capitulation of will here}.What an "up" this movie is, and so intelligent. Don't waste your time watching the same old false story that Hollywood dishes out over and over again - watch this instead, you'll love it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just for a clarification...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As was mentioned earlier, there is two woman that play the part of Conchita. What is incorrect from a few previous review was why. As was mentioned from before, there is an autobiography called "My Last Sigh" written by Bunuel and his co-writer and good friend Jean-Claude Carriere. What was incorrect is how it mentions that it was somewhat a mistake to have two women take the part. Origionally, Bunuel wanted Maria Schneider from "Last Tango in Paris". After Bunuel and Schneider constantly argued and never saw eye to eye, she left the film. It was tossed around by Bunuel and Carriere prior to shooting that it would be comical to use two woman to portray the "obscure" nature of the character of Conchita. Though originally thats not what they chose, once Schneider decided to leave, Bunuel decided to give it a shot. So, then came the talented Angela Molina and Carole Boquet to play the role. One came in Monday, Wednesday, Friday and the other Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. It is even stated in "My Last Sigh" that it left both women in fear, thinking that at any moment, Bunuel would fire one of them and have the other re-film her shots. Either way one wants to believe, one cannot argue that it works to mislead and even distract from the elements of the subplot-line and the overall story in general. This also is something Bunuel would do, being notorious for other distorted narrative techniques such as a transvestite Jesus figure, incorrect time increments in Un Chien Andalou and even a dinner party consisting of everyone sitting on toilets, removing themselves to go use the "dining room".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>even though it was made many years ago, it stands up as a great film, wonderfully acted and directed. The previous reviewer says everything so I will just add that if you can find the uncut version, there is a scene with Conchita (Angela Molina) dancing flamenco in the nude that lasts a good few minutes and is not cut like in the Criterion DVD... this full scene adds weight and more strength to the film and brings home the main character's jealousy more. It is the turning point of the film and it is a shame that it was cut, not even keeping the uncut version for adults to see. This is the only scene that was cut from the film and when you consider what is in other films it is difficult to understand why, I think the main reason was to obtain a younger certificate for the film. If you are a fan of Angela Molina then check out 'The Eyes The Mouth' to see more of her. It was also good to see Carole Bouquet in 'That Obscure..' in her pre James Bond days. All three main characters are superb actors. Oh how I wish I could find the uncut version!..lol If you know where I can obtain a copy of the uncut (107 min duration) please email me at paul22@paul22.freeserve.co.uk ..enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry to disappoint all those who were trying to find some deep, intentional meaning in the choice of two actresses for the same role, but if Fernando Rey is to be believed, here's what he told me when I bumped into him at a party in the early 90's: he said that he and Bu?uel liked both actresses for the part, couldn't decide which one to use, so they used them both.Now, perhaps there was something working on the unconscious level about the dual nature of Conchita, but Rey maintained there was no grand decision they made regarding the specific scenes assigned to one or the other.Of course, artistic choices can be obscure, especially even to the artist, but Rey insisted it was just a whimsical idea, one which I thought worked brilliantly.</fullReview>

Conchita is poor and lives with her mother in a small flat. Mathieu gives them a lot of money, but mistakenly tries to buy Conchita away from her mother. Conchita is played by two beautiful actresses, but strange as it may seem, this doesn't effect the film negatively. Sometimes when one version of Conchita walks through a door the other figure enters the next room. But this unique style does work.Conchita teases Mathieu throughout the film and comes across as a manipulative vixen. Also, there is a group of terrorists bombing buildings and cars throughout the film. A strange sack is carried around and seen several times, too. These are the mysterious things Bu?uel likes to add to his films. You also get the feeling that Bu?uel knew this was going to be his last film with the ending, which is perfectly abrupt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Luis Bu?uel's last movie inspired by the book "La Femme Et Le Pantin" by Pierre Louys , which has been adapted for several other films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a typical Bu?uel film , as there is a lot of symbolism and surrealism , including mockery or wholesale review upon sexual behaviors and jealousy of higher classes represented by the great Fernando Rey . Recounted in flashback , it deals with the romantic perils of Mathieu (Fernando Rey was actually dubbed by Michel Piccoli) , a wealthy Spanish old man who obtains a gorgeous 19-year-old girlfriend called Conchita (changing physical identities : Angela Molina and Carole Bouquet , but Maria Schneider walked off the picture in protest at the amount of nude scenes) , daughter of a poor woman (Maria Asquerino) . But Conchita refuses to sleep with him . Bu?uel's masterpiece filled with drama , surrealism , romance , terrorism , and colorful as well as absurd images . Surrealism and sour portrait upon higher classes , an extreme sexual obsession of an elderly man on a very young woman and their subsequent sexual rites by the Spanish maestro of surrealism , the great Luis Bu?uel . "That Obscure Object of Desire" also titled ¨Cet Obscur object Du Désir¨ or ¨Ese Oscuro Objeto Del Deseo¨ is available with subtitles or dubbed and contains a lot of surrealist images , such as the sack scenes , when a gypsy carries a hog , baby-alike , and when it appears a woman mending a bloody nightgown , in fact , this was the last scene Luis Bunuel shot as a filmmaker . Luis Bu?uel was given a strict Jesuit education which sowed the seeds of his obsession with both subversive behavior and religion , and that would preoccupy Bu?uel for the rest of his career . Interesting and thought-provoking screenplay from the same Luis Bu?uel and Jean Claude Carriere , Bu?uel's usual screenwriter , and based on the novel "La Femme Et Le Pantin" , which has been used as the premise for several other movies , including : ¨The Woman and the Puppet¨ (1920) by Reginald Baker with Geraldine Farrar , "La Femme Et le Pantin" (1929) by Jacques Baroncelli with Conchita Montenegro , ¨The Devil Is a Woman¨ (1935) by Josef Von Stenberg with Marlene Dietrich , Lionel Atwill , Cesar Romero , and ¨La Femme et Le Pantin¨ (1959) by Julien Duvivier with Brigitte Bardot and Antonio Vilar . Very good performance by Fernando Rey as a middle-aged French sophisticate person who falls for his former chambermaid . Acceptable acting from two young beautiful actresses : Angela Mólina and Carole Bouquet , the decision to use two players to play Conchita saved the movie from dropping out . Maria Schneider was dismissed from the film , the true reason was her heavy drug use , which caused her to give a "lackluster" interpretation and caused tremendous friction between her and Bu?uel . Pretty good support cast gives fine acting ; it is mostly formed by nice French actors , such as Julien Bertheau , Milena Vukotic , André Weber and Spanish ones , such as Maria Asquerino and David Rocha . In addition , Luis Bu?uel cameo : as in 'Belle De Jour' and 'Phantom of Liberty' Bu?uel does another walk-on in streets , immediately after Fernando Rey's first scene , as Luis and his chauffeur are blown to bits on their way to the bank , victims of an unexplained terrorist attack .Thid wry and enjoyable motion picture was well photographed by Edmond Richard and being compellingly directed by Luis Bu?uel who was voted the 14th Greatest Director of all time . This Bu?uel's strange film belongs to his French second period ; in fact , it's plenty of known French actors . As Bu?uel subsequently emigrated from Mexico to France where filmed other excellent movies . After moving to Paris , at the beginning Bu?uel did a variety of film-related odd jobs , including working as an assistant to director Jean Epstein . With financial help from his mother and creative assistance from Dalí, he made his first film , this 17-minute "Un Chien Andalou" (1929), and immediately catapulted himself into film history thanks to its disturbing images and surrealist plot . The following year , sponsored by wealthy art patrons, he made his first picture , the scabrous witty and violent "Age of Gold" (1930), which mercilessly attacked the church and the middle classes, themes that would preoccupy Bu?uel for the rest of his career . That career, though, seemed almost over by the mid-1930s, as he found work increasingly hard to come by and after the Spanish Civil War , where he made ¨Las Hurdes¨ , as Luis emigrated to the US where he worked for the Museum of Modern Art and as a film dubber for Warner Bros . He subsequently went on his Mexican period he teamed up with producer Óscar Dancigers and after a couple of unmemorable efforts shot back to international attention with the lacerating study of Mexican street urchins in ¨Los Olvidados¨ (1950), winning him the Best Director award at the Cannes Film Festival. But despite this new-found acclaim, Bu?uel spent much of the next decade working on a variety of ultra-low-budget films, few of which made much impact outside Spanish-speaking countries , though many of them are well worth seeking out . As he went on filming "The Great Madcap" , ¨El¨(1952) , ¨The brute¨ (1952) , "Wuthering Heights", "The Criminal Life of Archibaldo De la Cruz" (1955) , ¨Death in the garden¨(1956) , ¨Nazarin¨(1958) , ¨Robinson Crusoe¨ , ¨Fever mounts El Paso¨(59) , ¨The exterminator Angel¨(62) , ¨Simon of desert¨(1966) and many others . And finally his French-Spanish period in collaboration with producer Serge Silberman and writer Jean-Claude Carri?re with notorious as well as polemic films , such as ¨Viridiana¨ , ¨Diary of a chambermaid¨ (64) , ¨the milky way¨(1968) , ¨Tristana¨ (70) , ¨Belle De Jour¨, ¨The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie" (1977) , and this his last picture , "That Obscure Object of Desire" .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this legendary well known Spanish film last month which I am sure a lot of people would have heard about and I really liked it. However over the last few weeks I have seen other films but my mind keeps wandering off to scenes of That obscure object of desire, then my like became an obsession for it, what a great film. It is what I call the complete package, its very VERY entertaining. The story revolves around Mathieu a wealthy middle aged widower who is very attracted to his beautiful new house maid Conchita. Mathieu woos Conchita by financially supporting her family, showering her with gifts and giving her the luxuries she never had. The wonderful twist in the film is that Conchita is played by two different actresses as if to portray two different aspects of personality of Conchita, we have the frigid virginal intellectual Conchita played by Carole Bouquet and then there is the fiery career driven Conchita played by Angela Molina. Just as Mathieu (Fernando Rey) is able to impress one Conchita to share his bed with him (yes this movie is about sex) Conchita changes and he is at the bottom of the hill again, it's as amusing as it's frustrating. This is my first Luis Bunel film which ironically was his last, I was very impressed with his direction, I definitely want to see more of his works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always knew I was not good with faces, but I didn't realize just how bad I was until I watched this movie. It was only after I finished watching the movie and read a review on it that I found out that Conchita was played by two different actresses in regularly alternating scenes. Once I read that, I could immediately remember the difference, though I had not noticed it at the time. In fact, there was even a scene in which a third woman, who happened to be a brunette, made an appearance, and I thought she was Conchita too. Apparently the purpose was to have one actress play Conchita when she wants to have sex and the other actress when she does not.Anyway, we see some terrorism. Then, Mathieu, a middle-aged man, tries to seduce Conchita, his maid, on her first day on the job, which is creepy (today we would call it sexual harassment). She quits as a result, but he keeps pursuing her (today we would call it stalking).And then we see some more terrorism. Our disgust for him as a lecher soon turns to pity, because she keeps egging him on, promising, enticing, getting naked, rubbing her body on him, but he must not have sex with her, because she is virgin and she is saving herself for him and that ought to be enough for him and besides, what kind of girl does he think she is anyway?More terrorism. The movie proves there is no fool like an old fool, because he buys her a house to win her love, but she locks him out and has sex with her lover while he watches from outside.You guessed it, some more terrorism. He finally gets fed up and says he knows God will never forgive her. But then he forgives her, and they get back together. But wait! They start arguing again. Suddenly a bomb goes off in the marketplace blowing them to bits.Thank goodness for terrorism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bunuel's final look into the black bleakness of humanity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great surrealist director Luis Bunuel's final foray into the exploration of the darkest sides of human desire and will is more straightforward than some of his previous surreal works, especially The Milky Way, The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie and The Phantom of Liberty. The other Bunuel film this may most closely resemble is Belle de Jour, which focused on the inner thoughts and obsessions of a bored, frigid Parisian housewife who dabbles in sexual promiscuity. Here, Bunuel dips into literature once again for a tale of obsession told from two, or perhaps three perspectives. The story is fairly simple and straightforward: a wealthy, middle-aged man becomes infatuated with one of his servants, thus beginning a long, torrid relationship between them involving numerous battles of will and determination. The twist Bunuel adds here is the technique of using two actresses to play the same character, the tempestuous Conchita, with each symbolizing her two sides of expression. Angela Molina plays the seductress while Carole Bouquet plays the cold, distant lover. The most interesting aspect of the film from this point is the tug of war these three play. The man wants to fulfill his lust for Conchita in every way, including physical. However, she remains distant, using every opportunity to tease him into submission before harshly rejecting his advances. Her excuse is that she feels going to the next step would lead to him disowning her as he would have done all he could with her. In this way, Bunuel sets up a deliciously comical paradox: both sides have legitimate points to their statements but neither can completely win over the other party.What remains with the audience long after the film is Bunuel's effortless ability to draw in the viewer with tantalizing imagery and ideas. His direction is so subtle, so smooth in its piecing together the story that at times it is hardly noticeable. This was a hallmark of his career, with less emphasis on flashy techniques and more focus on character, story, and thematic development. This final film is no exception and is a wonderful capstone to a memorable career. Bunuel's legacy may be his iconoclastic style, but his insight into humanity's frail holdings on its emotional designs should not, and will not, be overlooked.</fullReview>

Perhaps I found that Bunuel was almost making me take sides, and whatever side had me in a perpetual loop of 'what the hell' kind of logic. But then again, isn't that what Bunuel is best at? In a sense, one could look at his 'swan song', That Obscure Object of Desire, as his ultimate feminist tome, or rather critique. It's really a woman's right to choose who she wants to give herself too, and who's to say if Conchita (Carole Bouquet and Angela Molina) really does want to have sex with Matthieu (Fernando Rey) or not? I'm thinking pretty strongly after a second viewing that that's part of the point. Maybe it's because Matthieu sees her as an object- and not as a complete and total human being- that he'll never possess her, and more importantly that he'll never understand completely why until perhaps the end. But even then it's never really clear. The audience is almost given the most fractured romantic tale in modern cinema, where you do (or at least I did, if not more on the first viewing then both times) feel for Matthieu who is not really as flawed a bourgeois character as in 'Discreet Charm', and is actually a rather nice and easy-going fellow. But then Conchita has her point of view, which everyone *should* accept, but then the tables are turned, more than once, leading to why that bucket of water was poured on her at the train station before it took off.But that's part of Bunuel's genius, I think, and why That Obscure Object of Desire works as a kind of penultimate take of the battle of the sexes. It deals with little hints of societal madness (terrorism is everywhere, but our two main characters- even Conchita who's real lover may be one himself- seem to neglect in their misplaced passions), but more than anything each other's unwillingness to go further with themselves. Rey particularly is brilliant in the role of Matthieu, where he can play exquisite, charming, despondent, yearning, rage, and complacency all in great measure. While up against not one but two actresses, he holds his own very well with his character, however much his character's logic might skew. And on a first viewing- and perhaps this shows how strong a feminist tale it is considering as a guy I got almost too subjectively involved- one might not understand why Mattieu keeps on going after Conchita, even after her intentions are made. It's almost like the most uncomfortable satire of 'blue-balls' ever made. Conchita- played by two actresses- is sometimes (particularly on a first viewing) indistinguishable from one another, and it adds to the maddeningly seductive power she has over her old, aged rich follower.What ended up making me like 'Obscure Object' maybe even more than I should have is how well Bunuel manages the mind games- on both sides- with the cunning satire. It's really quick and hilarious in spots, and couple of moments had me rolling with laughter, like the random moment as the one rich man (not Matthieu, of course) is about to leave for the bank, but when his driver starts the car it explodes! Or when Matthieu comes to find another piece of Conchita's seemingly precious demeanor stripped away when he finds out how she 'really' makes her money in the small town, which is actually funnier not even because of her in the scene but for who she's dancing for. If anything the ending is most frustrating, as after all that's happened and been told, and even after the seeming break-up, they're still together. It's like a cruel, vicious prank, with the symbolism of a sewing needle thrown in for good measure. But because it's Bunuel, and by the age of 77 he for sure knows what he's doing, and it's more worthwhile than a lesser filmmaker would have gone for. His actual movement of the camera as well- which is often sort of intricate and precise and seamless and actually really powerful even in quiet scenes- shows how someone on his last film can still have the great sweep of his prime running through. In fact, there are a couple of camera moves that are on par with the best that come up in his masterpiece, Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie. Filled with uncomfortably funny, sad and jarring moments, and enough notes on what it means to hold on to one's sexual parts (or not) with one's partner to ignite an entire women's studies course for a semester at a college, it's a work from Bunuel I was glad to see again, to see more into the layers he places in it and to find that even when it's not meaning to it's quite the funny affair- and quite the way to make a final bow on an extraordinary career. The final shot, by the way, is like one last wink to the audience- if not a totally spectacular one- that still is in my mind after the film has ended. Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Other Side of She</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We as people in love tend to go after the unavailable, that which tempts us but manages to remain maddeningly out of reach, or just within the spectrum of possibility but vanishing at the last crucial moment. Love is strange, yet we pursue it like the blind leading the blind, moving around in circles, no beginning, no end, and with an increasing sense of futility.Mathieu is one of those men. He's been sent over the edge by the promise of love and has publicly humiliated a young woman at a train station with a bucket of water as she attempts to board the train he's on. Passengers sharing his booth react in horror, but he has his own story to tell. The more he delves into it the less it seems to be about love and the more it looks like an obsession-fixation with the impossible: a woman, the very same one he's splashed with the bucket of water, named Conchita, arresting and bewitching, but one who would make a tease seem innocent by comparison.Conchita is a horror -- a woman ugly on the inside as she is alluring on the outside. She brings only misery to Mathieu, but he can't seem to get rid of her, and she inexplicably returns to him over and over again to repeat a cycle of love-hate that slowly eats away at him. One moment she's kittenish, the next, cold. Every time they're about to reach the moment of sexual communion something happens, or she announces she's a virgin as she wears an impenetrable chastity corset to which she has the key. She's not above gifts... or using her male companions to also rob Mathieu of specific amounts of money. And on top of that, a soothsayer has the nerve to tell him that he is the one who treats a young woman badly and as an offrend for her services, has him give some coins to a young mother who is carrying a tiny pig in her arms like it were a baby.Still, the question remains, what does she want with Mathieu? She could be a latter-day Mildred Rogers, leeching away at the man she despises while manipulating him into a frenzy. She obviously knows her own sexual power: at one moment she lays on top of Mathieu, naked, teasing him with words and promises as he can only caress her and wish that one day she will relent and literally, let him in.Peppered throughout the story are allusions to terrorist attacks on the city where Mathieu lives. While it may just seem a little extra seasoning added to color the story, with Bunuel there is no casualty, and inexorably, like in THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE, violence comes and literally invades the domestic war that both Conchita and Mathieu are engaged in.Bunuel's last film is one of the least Surrealistic in nature as well as one of the most. It's a contradiction, like Conchita herself is a contradiction of personalities contained within one woman. Somehow people who saw this movie were under the assumption, before entering the story, that this would be a more Hitchcockian story like VERTIGO, but in having both Carole Bouquet and Angela Molina swap entrances and exits, he manages to convey the most cerebral of his incursions into Surrealism. A woman who is really two who is the embodiment of repulsion and desire even when she herself is a prisoner of her own need for teasing -- what better way to have two woman play one? While the cool, reserved, and near frigid Bouquet balances one side of the woman, the more emotional and girlish Molina pirouettes on the other, and in the middle, poor Mathieu (for once, a very sympathetic Fernando Rey), caught in his own struggle, telling his story, unable to go even when he (justifiably) beats her at the height of his rage. A more conventional ending would have had the two parting ways after their physical exchange, but Bunuel had other plans, and his last sequence is one that only he could envision for a story about the polarities of love and hate, desire and repulsion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie...esp. the ladies were gorgeous..the smooth, refined beauty of Carole Bouquet and the flair of Angela Molina...but what does shine through is the evident love of Conchita most of the time...I never really thought of her as scheming...there is the tantalizing part where she wants to be understood for herself...and tho Mathieu loves her...he is possessed by lust too...maybe that is the diff between men and women...remember, Conchita says she was attracted by his kind eyes..and all Mathieu wants is...well-u-know-what...he wants her and wants the consummation..too him that is the definition of and realization of love...Conchita has no such animal intensity driving her..she just want to be loved for herself and wants to be sure...I wouldn't bother too much if the ending is baffling...I do not want all symbolism and mysteries to be revealed...it does not matter...cheers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of Bu?uel's Tamest, Still A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bu?uel's fascinating masterpiece is a landmark of the erotic genre. A subtle drama with hints of burlesque comedy, it plays with an upper-class middle-aged man with too much money and time in his hands, and his sexual obsession for the elusive Conchita. She decides to remain virgin throughout the whole movie, however she uses her sex to manipulate Mathieu who's too blind to understand she'll never be his to possess.This is a frustrating movie to watch too - many times it seems Mathieu will be able to get Conchita to bet, only for her to change ideas in the last minute, however whetting Mathieu's attention through some glimpses of her naked body. I dare say she actually enjoys torturing poor Mathieu and his expectations. And I'm not sure we're meant to identify with his hang-ups, after all he seems just a bit too innocent to be tricked by Conchita so many times, however he's lust-driven.It's not Bu?uel's best movie, but the dialogue is outstanding - which European movies usually lack - and I really felt something for these characters, especially Mathieu, brilliantly played by Fernando Rey. This is a great place for Bu?uel newbies, it's got his personal touch of the surreal, but it's still linear and coherent enough like a normal Hollywood movie to be enjoyed by the average movie-goer.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The real Bunuel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much of what has been said above about "Obscure Object" is true. Somebody has already pointed out that the use of two actresses was the result of an "accident," the one that started the film quit.Nonetheless, once he accepts going forward with a different actress, but using the film already shot, it would not be beyond the "trickster" Bunuel, to employ the inexplicable fact of a second actress. Trickery on his audience was a natural part of the "Surrealist" approach to art, and this film is great art.One must, in order to understand the end of the film, know something else about the master film maker Bunuel.The leader of the Surrealists was Andre Malreaux who was a communist close to the Trotskyist section of that movement. Bunuel also held similar views.Those views were given expression by Malreaux when he said that the Surrealists "Descended into the streets with guns.."Bunuel held similar views.Others have here told most of the story without in my view penetrating to the heart of what Bunuel was saying.Those facts read from a social criticism point of view have the old as the hills game of tease between the old man and the young women taking place where in the background there is a civil war going on. The teasing game, given the ending, can only be interpreted as follows.The old man, in his part of the game represents the old way against which a revolution is ongoing. He cannot but drag around with him in the burlap sack, ought but the old morals vis-a-vis women. When those morals, the blood of the virgin (And here given it is Bunuel telling the story) are displayed in the window, and hint at the consummation of the relationship, not to mention a look back toward the virgin Mary, and the two go off down the mall and the whole place blows up, one is forced to conclude that the Surrealist and Comminist is foretelling the outcome of the ongoing revolution, the destruction in the revolutionary blowup and inferno, of all the old crap.In his own way the great artist Bunuel is telling everybody "Get with it." Revolution is on the order of the day and a new era is emerging.Jack Jersawitz 404-892-1238P.S. If anybody knows of the existence of the film without the excisions made for rating purposes I would sure like to know where to find it. j.</fullReview>

The full scene adds more 'weight' and sense of shock to the film and if anyone knows where this rare version of the film can be obtained I would be grateful to receive an email from you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old Man's Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this again, about 5 years after having first seen it, was, sad to say, rather boring, even tedious. Regretfully, after sticking it for three-quarters of the way through, I sped forward to the ending. Nothing was gained, it seemed to me, by having the girl played by two very different actresses, one Spanish, the other French. It highlighted the impersonal unreality of the role, and suggested that the atmosphere of impotence and mockery was all in Rey's mind. The object of his desire did not materially exist, and the flashback in the train was like a bad dream. The pace was strangely slow, although the incidents were varied. Rey seemed to be succumbing to a form of senile decay, unprotected by his wealth. In Bunuel's films the characters walk about a great deal, to and fro. They keep coming and going: the jump-cut is not for him. There's a great deal of striding or strolling along streets, walking up to doors, knocking on them, ringing bells, getting in and out of taxis, or other cars and limousines.The feeling that the story was seriously dated was a perhaps a reflection of its original publication in 1898. The emotional torture experienced by Rey somehow didn't seem relevant to the post-Elvis, post-Beatle world. The explosions that happened from time to time failed to update it. Bunuel made this, his last film, when he was almost 80. It made me feel as if I were 80, and I'm only 79.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absurdist masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I was forced to pick a favourite filmmaker, I would have to pick Luis Bu?uel. He saw people for the deeply flawed things we are, yet really kind of loved us for our absurd refusal to accept our weaknesses. His last film stars Fernando Rey as an urbane, dignified gentleman who falls hopelessly in love with Conchita, a young woman he meets working as his maid and who he actively pursues and couples with on and off throughout the film. She returns his affection, but refuses to let him conjugate their relationship. She alternates between hot and cold, promising to sleep with him and then withdrawing at the last moment, viciously rebuking him and then begging him to come back. This sounds like she is the villain of the piece, but it's never that simple with Bu?uel. Her repeated statement that she loves him wholeheartedly, but is refusing him only this one small part of her has a certain absurd plausibility to it. When Maria Schneider walked off the film, Bu?uel replaced her with two actresses. Conchita is alternately played by Carole Bouquet ("For Your Eyes Only") and Ángela Molina ("Live Flesh"). It's tempting to seek a pattern in this bold bit of weirdness, but really there's no deeper meaning to this move. It's a last bit of absurdist genius from a true master.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful film about the nature of women, and of desire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luis Bunuel is one of my favourite directors, and this is probably my favourite movie from his vast catalogue. (But I love most of his later films.) He has a unique, surrealistic view, but his talent for narrative and his great sense of humour always ensure that his movies remain accessible.I've always admired movies that manage to say something profound about the amazingly complex nature of women, about how they see themselves, and how men see them. The nature of love, passion, obsession - these are all intriguing questions, and Bunuel digs deep, to their very core.The fundamental duality of human nature is conveyed here through the use of two actresses in the same role - a very original device (though, funnily, it was born out of necessity), and the execution is flawless, merging the two faces of a woman into one. A true cinematic experience, highly recommended for every film buff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bunuel Affair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luis Bunuel is the 20th century's greatest experimental filmmaker. From the dawn of silent pictures, Bunuel had been turning heads and shocking the establishment with his with his bizarre, incomprehensible cinematic ventures. He came, saw and perfected art filmmaking forever with the help of his friend Salvador Dali, on the historically acclaimed short shocker "Un Chein Andalou". The question is, with such fame achieved at such an early age, what more did he have to prove? The answer is much more. As an auteur, he continued to make some of the most interesting surrealists masterpieces of recent memory, like the Twilight Zone-type suspense thriller "The Exterminating Angel". Most of his films centered on one common concept, and that is Bunuel's subconscious fascination of human sexuality. How it controls us, and destroys us. We enter, his final picture, "That Obscure Object of Desire", and it is by far his most sexually fascinating film of all. It is a torturous exercise of patience, impotence and aggravation. In the end, he absolutely encapsulates in one movie, what the Heteronormative experience is all about. What we have is the story of a wealthy bachelor named Mathieu, played impeccably by Fernando Ray, as he recounts to a packed train car of curious passengers, his story of love lost. He has fallen for a beautiful woman named Conchita, who teases him with her graceful ability to flirt with him. For the first half of the movie, they end up following each other, and enter each other's lives as if cupid's arrow struck the both of them. With all this newfound attention, Mathieu is revved up and ready to make love to her. Yet, with every advance he makes, it is met with very adamant rejection from Conchita. He tries to use money to convince her mother to marry her, but that doesn't work. He successfully gets her into bed, unclothes her, and realizes that she has a chastity brace hiding under her gown. Time and again, he keeps getting shut out of sex, and eventually, he begins to lose control of his self-respect and moral boundaries. By today's standards, he would be accused of trying to rape the poor woman. What makes the case of Conchita so fascinating, is how controlling and cunning she is at Mathieu's advances, and as a female character, Bunuel constructs what is in essence, a feminist hero. Well, make that, heroes. What do I mean? It seems as if Bunuel has cast two different actresses to play the role of Conchita, Carole Bouquet and Angela Molina. To my delight, and surprise I couldn't tell the difference. The casting of these two women were brilliant on the part of Bunuel, because they both represented Conchita with two strong and clever females, who drag Mathieu along through the entire film, and torture his sexual desires. Bunuel has always had a knack of portraying women as clever temptresses, like the scenes in "Au Chein Andalou" which portray the female character as fuel to the man's sexual fetishes, and yet get she gets the best of him in the end. One must ask the question of whether or not Conchita actually exists? Perhaps it's a figment of Mathieu's vibrant imagination. But does that really matter? She could be real or not real, in the end, Conchita is a metaphor for sexual perversity, and the ignorance of men. As with most of his films, Bunuel uses his surrealist imagery and story telling to convey a unique form of symbolism. One of the more unexplained and fascinating aspects of the picture was the ongoing crisis of domestic terrorism in France that occurred as the story of the two lovers was being told. The film so famously ends with Mathieu and Conchita dying in a bomb explosion. It was a head scratcher, indeed. But I concluded with something interesting, and that is that Mathieu and Conchita were leaving disaster everywhere they turned, and usually when there was a rift in the relationship. It felt that it was the universe trying to separate them from each other, as if Conchita's chastity wasn't enough of a deterrent. The film ends in a very unsettling fashion, as we see the couple shopping in a museum, not particularly happy with their relationship, but not particularly wanting to leave each other. It was almost as if the film itself had enough of such inane romantic indecisiveness, and just decided to end it all by killing them in an explosion. It was truly never meant to be, and Bunuel knows it. In conclusion, "That Obscure Object of Desire" is an affair not worth missing out on. It is the performances and storytelling that are the most attractive, and as his swan song, Bunuel knocks it out of the stratosphere, with explosions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fitting Swan Song For Spain's Abstract Maestro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Our obsessions can sometimes get the best of us. Whether it's a piece of art we want to perfect or a person we're dangerously fixated on, as long as you can't grasp your desires with your own two hands, it's as bothersome as a mosquito picking at your arm.Mathieu (Fernando Rey) is having such a dilemma. He is middle-aged, impeccably dressed, and well-mannered. He has been a widower for a few years, and the lifestyle of a lonely, wealthy man has been suiting him well. But that all changes when he meets Conchita, who is hired as a chambermaid. Conchita is 18, sly, and ethereally beautiful; she's played by two different women, Carole Bouquet and Ángela Molina. Mathieu wants her, Conchita reciprocates ? but she won't sleep with him.When we first catch a glimpse of Mathieu and Conchita's erotic love-hate relationship, they are on the hate side. Mathieu barely misses a train, but once he boards, a young woman chases after him. She dons a black eye, tears awaiting in her eyes. Mathieu tips the conductor, and in return, he receives a bucket, fills it with water, and dumps it onto Conchita's poor, beautiful head. At first, we think she's merely a victim. But there's more than what meets the eye.Once Mathieu finds his seat, the passengers among him stare at him with intense curiosity. After all, the scene they just witnessed was straight out of a telenovela or a Hollywood melodrama. As soon as Mathieu begins to explain himself, we are drifted back into flashbacked storytelling; that's when the film officially begins.That Obscure Object of Desire is Luis Bu?uel's final film. Few would choose to explore the themes of sexual frustration as a swan song, but yet again, one of Bu?uel's most memorable moments in his long career was when he mock-sliced a woman's eyeball in 1929. Bu?uel's odd decision to cast two actresses in the role of Conchita sounds strange in concept but in actuality is a brilliant move. In the more sophisticated, glamorous settings, she is portrayed by Bouquet, who possesses a sort of French New Wave attractiveness that is reminiscent of Catherine Deneuve's famous coldness. In the more hot and heavy, emotionally sarcastic scenes, the buxom Molina takes over, showing Conchita's more fiery, teasing side. But in either situation, Conchita is a both a fixture and a woman of otherworldly dimensions; Bouquet and Molina are superb.Because she is played by two different women, the point Bu?uel is trying to make is abundantly clear: Conchita's allure has nothing to do with her looks. Her inaccessibility is what makes her such a catch. Most likely, Mathieu has always gotten everything's he's wanted, from the time he was merely a child. The more he attempts to court Conchita, the stronger his simultaneous hate and passion for her becomes. He buys her expensive gifts. He lets her stay in his luxurious mansion. He pays off her mother's debts. He treats her like a goddess. While she says she loves him and has a clear appreciation of his favors, she simply will not give her body to him. Mathieu doesn't understand. How could he, a man usually treated with such respect, be rejected without any thought? He has bought Conchita everything she could ever want. His torture is both endless and fascinating. He is repulsed but unable to back away; no matter what Conchita does, the fact that Mathieu will never know what's she's like in bed could kill him. It's a shallow thought, yes, but That Obscure Object of Desire provides us with the fact that we don't truly know how much our wants and needs can affect us until it's proved that we can never attain them.Rey gives such a conflicted performance that it's hard not to feel sympathy for him. The premise of the film is so simple, and Rey's dilemma is almost of teenaged ambition; but you can tell that even if his conceptual love of Conchita is stronger than his authentic adoration, the constant rejection is like a slow dosage of poison. She says she loves him, but would someone who loves you really put you through so much pain? Through all of Mathieu's tears, bitterness, and closed off emotions, Rey is a knockout.In one of the final shots of the film, Mathieu and Conchita peer through a shoppe window; inside, a woman is fixing a hole in a piece of bloodied cloth. We take a closer look; the hole has not been formed by an accident ? instead, the woman is puncturing a hole, fixing it, puncturing it, fixing it again, and on and on. It mirrors the previous events in That Obscure Object of Desire; the desire grows, is destroyed by Conchita, is renewed, until Conchita destroys it again. Sexual frustration can suck, and That Obscure Object of Desire is a film that tops nearly every final film in any director's filmography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Luis Bu?uel depicts that an old man has every right to have sex with a young girl.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no Aristotelian middle path for films directed by Luis Bu?uel as they are either adored by his admirers or intensely disliked by his detractors. As a film, "That Obscure Object of Desire" might irritate you to a very large extent but it would never bore you. It is the mysterious tale of an old man who would go to any extent to make love to a mysterious young woman. His troubles start when he comes across two women in different forms who are believed to represent the sole woman of his erotic fantasies. Those who have studied psychology might see a reflection of Freudian theory in the film but it is far more simple than what one can expect it to be. It works well as the story of an old man whose very objective in his life is to make love to a beautiful woman. Although the theme of this film might appear as a cruel, bad joke, Jean Claude Carri?re-screenwriter and Luis Bu?uel ensure that the film discusses all key elements of the time during which it was shot. This is the reason why there is plenty of religion, sex and terrorism in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Luis Bunuel makes challenging films. This is a romance with a twist, two actresses playing the same woman interchangeably. A rich man, Mathieu, and Conchita, a beautiful flamenco dancer and his object of desire are in a volatile relationship from the start.Using flashbacks to explain why Mathieu dumps a bucket of water over Conchita's head while riding on a train; it is a very funny comedy. When he first meets her, she claims to be eighteen, and a virgin. She teases him endlessly and when he finally lures her into bed, she is wearing a corset so tight that he can't remove it, giving him a major case of blue balls. They break up and reunite several times. He sees her dancing nude at a night club, but still takers her back and buys her a house. She locks him out and lets him observe her having sex with another guy. Although she later claims that the sex was fake, he beats her. This causes her to say that he must really love her. When the train stops they leave together, arm in arm. The ending is a big surprise and unexpected. Excellent work from Banuel.</fullReview>

Hence, for example, the final explosion, concomitant with Conchita's whim, as she angrily makes Mateo let go of her hand.Another good movie that acts as a reminder of what suckers men can be when women get playful is the more recent french flick "L'ennui", with Charles Berling. Boredom and sexual attraction as catalysts of men's demise... In "L'ennui", the woman gives herself to the hero, but that seems to drive him just as mad, when she withdraws her affection, as Conchita drives Mathieu by remaining untouchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mix of early silent comedy, 70's soft porn and daytime soap - but not in a good way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a queer film this is. It appears to be about the hypocrisy and apathy of the middle classes, particularly their sexual hypocrisy, as expressed through the infatuation of a rich business man (of a certain age) with a young and beautiful Spanish dancer.The hero, Mathieu, spends the film time trying to get Conchita into bed and more specifically trying to achieve penetration. Sometimes she seems up for this, sometimes she doesn't. In any case there is always a problem when they get down to it, much to Mathieu's frustration. This obsesses him to such a degree that he is almost oblivious to the acts of terrorism that are happening all around him. It's not just in the paper, on the radio and on the PA in the shopping centre. He's mugged in a park, there's a shooting on his doorstep, he's held at gunpoint and his car stolen.To Mathieu this matters little compared with his ongoing bedroom antics with Conchita. Conchita is an unpredictable woman. Is she deliberately torturing Mathieu? In the end Mathieu thinks so and things turn violent. Even then, they remain somehow bound together.How did this film come to be so critically lauded? Is it simply due to the crude gimmick of having Conchita played by two actresses who switch between and within scenes? Oddly this quirk loses its strangeness as the film progresses and really adds nothing. The two actresses don't portray different sides of the same person (there are no fully realised characters in this film) as has been suggested. Conchita is as changeable and contradictory regardless of who she is played by. The film in general feels thrown together.It looks and plays like a mix of early silent comedy, 70's soft porn and daytime soap - but not in a good way.This is the broadest satire and not particularly insightful or funny. It has surreal touches. Is Bunuel messing with us?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)Carole Bouquet is the thinner Conchita who is somewhat severe. Angela Molina is the one who dances and seems more natural.Jean-Claude Carriere wrote the script. He may be the greatest screenwriter of all time. He has over a hundred credits and some of them are among the best movies ever made. Here's a brief list from those that I have seen: The Ogre (1996), Valmont (1989), The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1988), The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972), Diary of a Chambermaid (1964). There's some symbolism in Cet obscur objet du desir. Sometimes Mathieu (Fernando Rey) carries around an old gunny sack. We find out what's in it in the final scene. It represents Conchita's virginity. The terrorists in the background seem rather contemporary although this movie is from 1977. Mathieu is rich and therefore represents the established European society. Conchita and her friends represent the underclass. Both Mathieu and Conchita are really character types. He is the masher, the rake who is always working on a new conquest, although he is somewhat naive. She is the tease who uses her wiles to get what she can from him. Bunuel plays this ancient theme as a burlesque, exaggerating her coyness and his foolishness. The ending may suggest that in some way he has won, or more likely that they are still at a standoff, even while the terrorists escalate the bombings.The question of why there are two actresses playing Conchita has more to do with Maria Schneider, who originally was cast in the role, but left because of the nudity or because Conchita's character was too contrary, than it has to do with any plot or symbolic necessity. On the other hand, since she is that "obscure object of desire" (which really should be that "unobtainable object of desire"), and because Bunuel wanted to emphasize that Mathieu's desire for her had nothing to do with her personally, he used two actresses and made it clear that Mathieu didn't notice the difference! A bit of absurdity here, but Bunuel is comfortable with absurdity. All in all an interesting treatment of an ancient theme, but not one of Bunuel's best, even though it was his last at age 77.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bunuel's Greatest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That Obscure Object of Desire (1977) **** (out of 4) Luis Bunuel film starts off as a man (Fernando Rey) dumps a pale of water over a woman's head in front of various passengers on a train. The man then tells them the story of this woman, his desire for her and what led to the events on the train. Well, The Phantom of Liberty didn't stay at my #1 Bunuel film for very long. While this is certainly the best film I've seen from the director I'd go as far to say this is one of the greatest films I've ever seen period. I don't want to place a ranking on it since I would need more time to think things over but there's no doubt this would enter in my Top 20 at least. What I really enjoyed most was the little touch of having two actresses play the woman to show off both of her sides but you could go a little deeper and say the man didn't notice the two women and that's how blinded he was by his desire for her. The film really started off well, grabbing my attention but making my attention even stronger with each passing scene. The final moments were brilliantly done and the actual love story of the man is one of the greatest I've seen. The terrorist bits were rather strange but made sense and I'm glad Bunuel left out some of his usual surrealist moments and instead mainly concentrated on the story at hand. Bunuel also did a brilliant job at slowly building up the man's desire to the point where the viewer also feels his anger and desire for the woman. The performance by Rey was brilliantly moving and touching, as were the two female actresses. This is one of the best examples of a relationship between men and women and also shows the nasty games that can be played.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film would have to rank up there as one of Bunel's best, along with La Charme Discret de la Bourgeoisie. In this film he again uses actor Fernando Rey and a relative newcomer to Cinema, the ever beautiful Carole Bouquet.The film uses a very unique film device, which is the female lead is actually played by two actresses: One actress for her placid nature and another actress for her tempremental side. This makes the film fascinating viewing even more so that the women don't even look the slightest bit alike. The film also has those beautiful European situations such as Fernando Rey telling his story to a train carriage full of freaks and oddities.Just one of those exceptional movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having watched Bunuel's first film: Un Chien Andalou, I was expecting a film of a pretentious, pointless, and angering nature. I couldn't have been more wrong. This a brilliant narrative film, which grips you from the beginning. Throughout the film you will be questioning your own eyes, laughing at events before you and at the same time relaxing, and letting Bunuel's techniques entertain you. Give this film a chance, and you will be rewarded. Having watched it, I am sure you will be thinking about it for months afterwards. The themes and issues it raises are still very much relevant; sexual desire and frustration, the nature of desire, terrorism, the conventions within society that we accept. Bunuel has you questioning what you want in life, and challenges the decisions and feelings that you thought were reliable. Fernando Rey proves to be a reliable and likable protagonist, who guides you through events as he experienced them with the mysterious girl; Conchita.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By the end of the film - and only because I like French films and locations was it viewed without fast-forwarding - a guess began to form on the theory of interchangeable actresses, but just barely, because the Bouquet character also is deferring, postponing, and teasing about flirtation, phallus-teasing, and seduction in her early, similarly amiable encounters with the male lead. OK, on top of the dual-actress, one character conceit is the flashback narrative story locomotion on the train to diffuse further the confusing, the train characters all appearing to be affirming and approving in their voyeurism, which is/was unlikely. The cold shower action near the opening, so-to-speak, so as not to plant a spoiler, was apropos, a welcome clever breath of something memorable and comedic. Then there's the violence toward women who certainly deserved some profoundly negative consequences, and that being left unquestioned. Is that French? French in the late-'70's? Or just late '70's sensibility? Add to this messiness some of the usually lovely French female nudity; here it was mostly superfluous. The whole running-time engendered a "what's going-on" experience. Call a film "art" and any and everything is justified by pseudo buffs and celluloid artistes, and their wannabes. Yes, obsession meets insincerity, wily female opportunism, and reverse exploitation. But sometimes films, French, or not, are just bad, even when populated by a lovely cast and labeled black comedy, "cult," or "artistic." Good premise here; very poor French execution. (And, by the IMDb rating, it would seem my op/ed is the minority opinion. But, for consideration orientation, I liked "The Tree of Life," and got it - though it needed tighter editing for a shorter running time.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think Rey represents a sort of older, more humanist view of the world. The sac is a throwback to this. It also lends him a sort of imagery, as a worker, a man who made it on his own. The girl, is the new world, of terrorism, nudity, frigidity. At the end, the two have joined. He has given up his sack, she has given up her virginity. Their game is over. The end scenes are shot in silence till the very end. The explosion, perhaps it indicates Bunuel's negative view of the future.I always get thrown off by these great 70s movies.

A song I wrote in 1971 was written after I read the story. Since I did not see the film until much later,I had always assumed that I had read a review of the film. I believe what I read was the screenplay, which had yet to be filmed. Anybody? I really enjoyed the film, especially the use of two different women displaying different character facets. The first time I watched it, I barely picked up on it. However, after watching it several times, I discovered that along with this method, there are many scenes and "tricks" that Bunuel employed to bring his vision to the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this movie is like taking a tab of LSD: you don't do it for the harmless fun of it -- you do it for the thrill of the ride.Luis Bu?uel had an incredible career, starting with surrealist silent shorts, shot in grainy black-and-white on a camera that had far less capabilities than the video function of a modern-day mobile phone. This is his last movie, and it made me realise that the Luis Bu?uel of Un chien andalus is the same Luis Bu?uel of Belle du jour.A middle-aged wealthy businessman recounts his disastrous relationship with a beautiful young woman to his fellow passengers on a train ride from Madrid to Paris. As the train leaves, he showers a bucket of cold water on his estranged lover. At the end of the train ride, the girl equally douses him. In between lies a meandering tale of unrequited love, sprinkled with random acts of terrorist violence. A mysterious jute sack symbolising the relationship keeps resurfacing, and the beautiful Conchita is played by two actresses. You simply watch and wonder -- some of Bu?uel's cinematic ideas are brilliant, some are quixotic, some are just plain odd or even tiresome.This movie hinges on being able to convince us of the raw attraction between the lovers -- and unfortunately, it falls short in this aspect. Conchita appears to be quixotic rather than sulphurous and mysterious, Mathieu comes across as an old lecher who can't get over the fact that Conchita doesn't just lie back and think of Spain.The movie is based on a classic erotic novel by Pierre Lou?s (a notorious author in France, though certainly less popular in the rest of the world), originally entitled "The Girl And The Fool". Basically Bu?uel gave it the Bu?uel-workover. The result is a wild cinematic ride.I'm not rating this movie as it would be pointless -- I consider it hors compétition. This is the type of movie that takes some effort to watch, but that will stay for you a long time afterwards.</fullReview>

Nevertheless though this is great stuff, for some inexplicable reason we have two different actresses playing the lead role of Conchita. Why is that exactly? My theory is that Bunuel sat down and thought I wonder what would happen if I did this, so he did it.I won't go too thoroughly into the plot, but a man is basically tormented in different ways by a woman with shifting personalities (thus the two actresses).I liked this movie because it was so strange, the seventies were an interesting period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Belle D' Jour introduced me to Luis Bunuel. Now TOOOD continues this dark exploration of the European psyche. The women are innocent and vixen at once. Perhaps that is why Bunuel used two women to play the same part. I must say he almost got away with it seamlessly for my "lovely one" swore it was the same woman, but I got it by the time the flamingo nude scene appears. We were also shocked by the caresses of the chest scene, which in commercial film is rare today although in the late sixties, seventies, and part of the eighties, the obligatory nude love scene on American screens were mandatory. That's gone. Now we just have blood splattering gratuitous violence.My only objection to this film is the insertion of cheesy terrorist scenes. I don't know if these silly explosions, the unrealistic destruction of automobiles was limited by budget constraints, or if this was a campy outing of those funny terrorists we have come to know so well over the last forty years.The desperate Fernando Rey, the older, richer, still amorous over-the-hill desires his eighteen-year-old Conchita and the game begins.

In his final film, Bunuel keeps the narrative more straight-forward than in many of his earlier examples of surrealism. The only notable aspect to the story is that the title character, a woman who is by turns icy and flirtatious, is played by two actresses. No explanation is offered for this odd casting and the switch between hot Molina and cold Bouquet occurs without any rhyme or reason. Naturally, the critics and Bunuel worshippers declare the dual casting gimmick a stroke of genius. There's a clumsy subplot involving terrorists that leads to a predictable conclusion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Bu?uel is clearly hit and miss. What's interesting is that different people consider different films hits. This is perhaps his most widely appreciated, but I found it uninteresting. The arc is a report from a man on mutual attempts at exploitation that are never achieved.For me, Bu?uel is the strongest symbolic minimalist, someone who reduces the world to very few stalks of emotion and weaves them with extreme attention to poetic resonance. The camera is simply a display device. The poetry is all abstract: grates for emotional separation for instance. Everything is envisioned first as a clear conflict -- I imagine it beginning as a simple diagram. Then he writes, and for him, writing is dialog. There are very few real images in his films, and of course those images are meant to have symbolic power as a result. Everything is obvious, clear, spoonfed. He's Rohmer except where Rohmer has situational irony, Bu?uel's is symbolic.Spanish filmmakers are no more vexing than other Europeans, but they seem to be only of three types: those that exploit Borges-like reflexiveness; those who wallow in the purported free-spiritedness of the sexual encounter, and those who merge the two. I find Ruiz a success, Medem as well with Almodóvar promising. Bu?uel is only of historic interest, a cinematic draftsman.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>decent, not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I thought this was a fairly good movie, I keep asking myself WHY so many films by Luis Bu?uel are so highly praised? Maybe it's just that his films don't appeal to everyone and I am just one of the ones who "doesn't get it". This is possible. All I know is that I've seen most of his most famous films and didn't love any of them. In general, they were decent, but that's really about it.This film has some excellent aspects, though. I like the general kinky story line--a seemingly innocent woman about to be seduced by a dirty old man--and, then, the tables are turned and you find out that the "innocent woman" is one sick woman--and, then, you see that the man is actually a good match for her because they are BOTH sick puppies! Their sado-masochistic relationship is certainly entertaining. I also liked the style of the film as the older man (Rey) recounts his tale to enthralled train riders. I even liked the bizarre touch of having two rather different looking women DELIBERATELY play the same woman interchangeably throughout the movie--some real weird but fun stuff here.However, the odd touches and constant references to terrorist groups was stupid. I know this was a reference to the director's political leanings but it just seemed irrelevant. Either he should have, in my opinion, followed up and hashed this out more or it should have been excised from the movie. As it is, it just didn't fit but wasn't really weird enough to make the movie surrealistic.Oh, and by the way, this movie is a lot like his other film THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISE, as in that case people always were looking for dinner but never got fed--in this case, Rey was looking to score but somehow, despite coming VERY close, he never actually did!PS--to the parents, this movie features a lot of explicit nudity and implied sado-masochism, so it would be appropriate for younger audiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interest portrait of male obsession of women, but marred by violence and sexism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie about the fundamental theme of male sexual obsession with a woman. The wealthy old bachelor Mathieu is intrigued by beautiful young Conchita, who lives in poor conditions with her mother. He becomes more and more sexually obsessed with her as she keeps turning down all his attempts to have sex with her and varies between feelings of love, indifference and hate towards him. He keeps following her around Europe and is increasingly obsessed and violent.Bu?uel lets two women play the same character, symbolizing the conflictual sides of her personality. This is a brilliantly outrageous idea, no matter whether Bu?uel intended it or not, as the other commenters have discussed at length.This brings me to the fatal flaw of the movie. I was disturbed by the sexism, violence, and repulsiveness of the main character because the movie never makes it completely clear where it stands towards him. The movie puts us on the side of the man trying to understand him as he becomes more and more obsessed with her, tries to buy her from her mother, has her deported, tries to rape her, and brutally beats her. His obsession never drives him to the tragedy that would be morally logical outcome, but the movie ends symbolically without conclusion.</fullReview>
