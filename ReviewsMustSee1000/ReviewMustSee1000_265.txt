		<shortDescription>generally likable comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard not to like "Big Daddy", though diehard fans of Adam Sandler may well cringe at this further step in the sentimentalization of the comic actor. For although this film has raised the hackles of a number of overly sensitive worrywarts for its seeming endorsement of permissive parenting, the film is, in reality, far more soft-hearted than hard-edged. Actually, this seems to be, probably, the wisest direction for Sandler to go in at the moment because, as an actor, he conveys an aura of genuine likability that fits well with his Average Joe persona. "Big Daddy" might have been a better film if it had not given in so easily to sentimentality and predictable emotional uplift, but Sandler's deadpan portrayal of an immature adult forced to grow up into responsibility-laden fatherhood makes the film relatively enjoyable.Sandler portrays a 30-something loser living in South Manhattan, who has been milking a minor foot injury to the tune of a $200,000 court settlement and whose life, consequently, consists of miniscule employment, a general lack of direction, and a girlfriend who's ready to move on to an older man with a "5-year plan". When a little boy suddenly shows up on his doorstep (the hitherto unknown son of a friend of his), Sandler decides to temporarily take him under his wing in the hopes of winning his girlfriend back. Thus, a man with almost no resources of adult maturity attempts to instill skewed life lessons into a willing, highly impressionable young mind. This leads to Sandler's teaching the boy to indulge in predictable, but surprisingly timid, antisocial behavior such as urinating on public buildings, staying up late, tripping unsuspecting rollerbladers etc. The film is not always at its peak of creative freshness at such times, but Sandler's lowkey cynicism provides some humor.As Sandler grows to care for his tot and the inevitable forces array themselves against him to take the child away, the film veers off in the direction of sappiness and maudlin tearjerking. One may be moved at times, but one also craves the satirical sharpness and bite that a more courageous screenplay might have provided.The movie does display an enlightened view of gays (though Hollywood has yet to get past the point where gay characters can do more than merely twinkle at each other), but it loses points for its rather nasty tone towards old people. Still, any film designed to send Dr. Laura into spasms of psychoanalytical outrage should be respected and honored.Overall, "Big Daddy" is a movie that, if it had taken more audacious pathways, might have been a firstrate comedy. As it is, it provides numerous chuckles and a cuddly warm feeling - and that, given the state of much of big screen comedy these days, is about all we dare allow ourselves to expect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film a lot when I was younger, I laughed my arse off. Then I lost the video, and I discovered it when it fell on my head about a week ago. It hurt, but the film was worth it. I laughed again, I nearly cried when Julian got took away, and it brought back a lot of memories. I don't normally like Adam Sandler, but this is one of my favourite films. Its underrated, mostly by adults, as soon as I put it on, my Nana took one look at Adam Sandler and went home. She said he "Over-acted and wasn't funny." I know a lot of other people who think this movie is a big pile of crap, but they have no sense of humour. I would recommend this to anyone who likes to laugh..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adam Sandler in top form!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While all of the somphoric pre-teens will be giggling silly at the childish potty jokes shown in AUSTIN POWERS 2, the real adults will be laughing their heads off in a much funnier film called BIG DADDY. This is Sandler's sixth starring role feature, and it seems that the sixth time is a splending charm. This is Sandler's best work yet! Now in case you are wondering, I enjoyed both HAPPY GILMORE, and THE WEDDING SINGER. But there's something charming and wonderful on why I enjoyed BIG DADDY more. Perhaps it's seeing a over-grown kid taking care of a little boy. Or it's Sandler mixing his in your face attitude that he gave in HAPPY GILMORE with his soft-spot attiude from THE WEDDING SINGER. Whatever it is, it works, and it works very well! The simple plot of BIG DADDY is a 5 year old child is left on the doorstep of Sandler's apartment. It turns out to be the child of his roommate (Jon Stewart), who's on his way to China for a legal case. So what is Sandler to do, but to give him to the child protective service. But it's a holiday, and they are closed, so Sandler keeps him for a day, then another day, and... well you get the picture. But the plot doesn't matter much with this film, it's the laughs, and you do get plenty of those. But you also get a wonderful supporting cast. There's a good support from Jon Stewart, the always wonderful and beautiful Joey Lauren Adams, Leslie Mann, and Kristy Swanson (the original Buffy the Vampire Slayer). And what's a Sandler movie like if you don't have his usual character actor friends in small comic roles; Rob Schrieder, Steve Buscemi, Josh Mostel, Allen Covert (the caddy from HAPPY GILMORE who was also the limo driver friend in THE WEDDING SINGER), and Jonathan Loughran (the lazy-eyed football player in THE WATERBOY). There's even a funny cameo role by director Dennis Dugan, as the man who refuses to answer the door on Halloween, while Sandler is taking his adopted son trick or treating. This film was a lot more funnier that THE WATERBOY, it was also funnier than THE WEDDING SINGER and HAPPY GILMORE. It was believe it or not, more touching. You can understand why Sandler doesn't want to let this boy go, since he reminds him so much of himself. And Sandler sees that being a father figure isn't only fun, but it redeems himself from the lost of his girlfriend. I have to give both Sandler and director Dennis Dugan (the same director of HAPPY GILMORE) a round of applause. They teamed up for a comedy that is not only successful, but will make A LOT of money. Sandler and Dugan are the best comedian/director team since the late John Belushi and John Landis. I'm just hoping that they will continue to do films together in the futrue. Until then, take your date, your friends, or heck just go alone and enjoy one of the funniest comedies (next to ANALYZE THIS, ELECTION, and RUSHMORE) of this year. This is a wonderful treat! ****1/2 (out of five)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adam Sandler vehicle - nuff said</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Big Daddy- Sonny Koufax (Adam Sandler) is the irresponsible guy - he has no manners, and no clue. Although Sonny has somehow managed to get a girlfriend, she is tired of his aimless ways, and gives him an ultimatum - do something with your life or I leave. Fate steps in with a ready-made 'solution': Sonny will raise the little boy who was dropped off at the apartment with a note proclaiming his roommate (Jon Stewart) the father, his girlfriend will realize his newfound responsibility, and all will be well. Plausibility this movie doesn't have. But we are talking about Adam Sandler, the man who has given us such brainteasers as Happy Gilmore, and Billy Madison. Sandler's frat-boy humor - childish and, scatological - has however, drawn a huge following as evidenced by The Waterboy's huge box office, (a movie that I myself enjoyed and will surely be pilloried for). I expected one thing from this movie - a good laugh. And it delivered. The obligatory tearjerker scenes were painful, but thankfully few and far between. If you are in the mood for some humor-light on cheap Tuesday, give this movie a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sandler's funniest!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies are made for us to ponder questions of morality and ethics. Some are made for us to question reality. Some are made for us to find ourselves.This movie is not one of them.This movie was made for one reason and that is to make us laugh. And it does that very well.Sandler plays an incredibly irresponsible derelict that has no real job or ambition in life. He gets a kid left on is doorstep and he is forced to care for him. The story needn't be described any more than that, we all know what happens. But it is what this movie does to our senses that makes it worth while. In short, it makes us laugh hysterically. This film is a whirlwind of jokes and hilarity and when it stops to let you catch your breath it still entertains you. I admire films like this. They aren't meant to be Instinct or The Siege ( two films that I absolutely love ) but all it aspires to do is entertain you; take you away from life for 90 minutes. And let's face it. Sitting in a cool theater with a bag of M&amp;M's, a cold Coke and a funny movie is a perfect way to spend a lazy summer afternoon.This is a great movie and it will make you laugh. That's all it is, nothing more, nothing less. And we should be thankful for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rather funny movie featuring Sandler.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a Sandler fan in the least, in fact for the most part I do not enjoy his movies. Still, this one was a rather funny little comedy even if it did have a rather unbelievable premise. Guy loses girl, guy tries to get girl back by taking in a kid who may or may not be a friend of his kid. So aside from that you have your funny scenes of Adam trying to raise a small boy to the best of his ability while also getting the attention of a new female in his life. Granted some of the jokes were just lame such as Sandler dressing up as the boy's favorite toy, but for the most part the jokes were hits. It did tend to get a bit sentimental towards the end, but not as bad as other movies of this type tend to get. Jon Stewart is in this one as is Sandler buddies Rob Snider. Steve Bushemi is also in it, but his appearance in the movie is rather stupid. So for a rather good comedy that isn't really great, but not unbearable like many Sandler comedies can get try this one on for size.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and surprisingly touching.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adam Sandler (The Waterboy, The Wedding Singer) has pulled off another hit with Big Daddy. Sandler stars as a lazy law-school graduate who won't take the bar exam. One day when his roommate goes on a business trip to China a child arrives at the day with a note claiming to be his roommate's son. Sandler takes the kid for a day and after having a good time decides to keep him to impress his girlfriend who doesn't think he's trying to grow up. His girlfriend dumps him and he's stuck with the kid. Not surprisingly Sandler isn't a good father, but soon he bonds with the kid and he learns how to be a good father. This might sound like a cheesy feel-good film, but with Sandler the humor is kind of low-brow, but often hilarious. The film does also offer a few touching scenes between Sandler and the kid. Sandler's performance was very funny, but reminded me a little of Jim Carrey's performance in Liar Liar. Liar Liar if you have seen it was a regular Carrey comedy, but offered a couple of serious scenes which Carrey pulled off well. Carrey then went on to do The Truman Show and win a Golden Globe. Sandler also has a couple of serious scenes which he nails well. I'm not suggesting that Sandler is going to become a great actor (like Carrey seems headed for) but he may have the skill to do it if he wants. Leslie Mann (George of the Jungle, The Cable Guy) and Joey Lauren Adams (Chasing Amy, A Cool Dry Place) are both good as sisters. Jon Stewart (The Faculty, Playing by Heart) is solid as Sandler's roommate. Twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse are convincing as the kid. Finally, two favorites of mine have very funny supporting roles. Steve Buscemi (Reservoir Dogs, Armageddon) is good as a homeless friend of Sandler's. And Rob Schneider (Judge Dredd, Knock Off) is hilarious as an immigrant delivery man who is good friends with Sandler. Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sonny Koufax (Adam Sandler) is an unemployed layabout who claims that he is unable to work due to an accident he had involving a cab from 2 years ago. Sonny is a self-absorbed individual who generally thinks of no-one but himself much to the annoyance of his girlfriend. However, when a 5 year old boy named Julian (Cole Sprouse) ends up on his doorstep, Sonny claims to have adopted Julian in order to try and win back his girlfriend and prove himself worthy of her affections. Whilst Julian is in Sonny's care, Sonny does some growing up himself in the midst of some rather questionable antics as a caretaker parent.The marketing for this film was always questionable; the film poster shows Sandler and the boy standing in front of a door and urinating against it. In this respect it does itself no real favours as there may be many people that decide not to watch it because it looks like it's going to be crude and juvenile from the poster. In fairness this isn't completely inaccurate as there are some aspects of the film that are a bit juvenile and crude, but the actual bulk of the film is quite charming and sweet and fairly enjoyable and I'm just puzzled as to why a fairly sweet-natured film was marketed so poorly. Anyway I digress...Sandler's comedy films have sometimes proved problematic because some of the characters he has portrayed have been unlikeable or unsympathetic. In Big Daddy though, as things progress it becomes fairly obvious that Sonny's actually an OK person that just needed a bit of a kick up the backside. Looking after Julian gave Sonny a purpose in life and as mentioned it gave him the kick up the backside that he'd needed for the last 2 years. The chemistry between Julian and Sonny was also really good and the two of them share both funny moments and tender moments - I thought that Sonny telling Julian that wearing sunglasses meant nobody could see him was a funny idea and quite sweet as well.There are some weaknesses to this film; firstly a lot of the acting here is rather mediocre (although Steve Buscemi was good fun in the limited screen time that he was given). The film was also a little too light on laughs for my liking - although the warmth and charm of the picture compensate slightly for the slight lack of humour. The film also gets very soppy towards the end and I also found some of the character shifts to be a bit dubious. The script offers few surprises and is fairly predictable, but I always say it doesn't matter if you know outcome B at point A as long as you generally enjoy everything in between and that pretty much sums up my feelings about this film. It's hardly Oscar-worthy, but it has some funny moments, it has some charm, and it surprised me by being better than I expected it to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Corny and far-fetched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I watched this movie and thought it had some good sequences, but then again, it was just corny. Like at the very end at the court hearing when everyone grabbed their cell phones and called their dads while sobbing - that's just utter crap. Apart from that I don't like Adam Sandler, which I concede is a personal bias. Nonetheless it HAD some witty sequences, although most of them did not seem genuine and are unlikely to occur in reality. I mean the basic approach was generally fairly good, but some scenes are simply too far-fetched. There are much more substantial movies out, so we definitely needn't praise this one too high. It would have been much better if the storyline had a stronger emphasis on the interpersonal burdens and struggles and less on the comedy aspect. Here again Adam Sandler was just the wrong actor to aim at such a transformation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The whole premise in Big Daddy is unlikely. A lazy bum finds a kid delivered to his doorstep and in order to impress his girlfriend, decides to take care of him until a better home can be found. He then goes on to teach him everything he knows about life. Which amounts to about...nothing.There were a few chuckles, but it wasn't that funny of a movie. Wow. A kid wet his bed. Funny. Wait, no it's not.Adam Sandler's performance was surprisingly rather weak, as were almost all of the actors and actresses involved.And the ending was one of the worst endings I have ever seen! Just because all these people say that he loves the kid is no reason to give this guy, who doesn't have a steady job, who is not married, and has friends who are all other bums.All in all, a good concept</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Sandler film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Big Daddy was released during he summer of June 1999, and it was Adam Sandler's most successful and biggest box office worldwide hit for many years (until Grown Ups in 2010). Sandler plays his typical characters that he has played so well over the yeas and here he is very similar yet plays it well that it connects well enough with the story,and the flow is great. Big Daddy is construct in which, as ever, the world is that safe, hurling logs in the path of speeding roller-bladers is satisfyingly amusing, while the American legal and social services systems seem to operate on a chaotically arbitrary and scarily trusting basis. Though the film manages to be quite consistently funny, with each juvenile gag balanced by the odd spark of wit and outrageousness, although a courtroom finale allowing Sandler and his writers to get their father-son relationship themes out of their systems, is predictably and excruciatingly over the top. The film manages to blend comedy and drama well, and the conclusion and several final scenes who that the writers were able to make the viewers have several touching moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hooters! hooters! hooters!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hooters" is a word heard about 15 times from Adm Sandler in this movie every time he sees his roommate's girlfriend, Leslie Mann, who once worked at Hooters, and now Adam just can't let that go. Adam's roommate has another surprise for him. The day he leaves on a business trip to Japan, his son gets dropped off at the door from social services. Actually, it's just the five year old kid that's there by himself from social services. Last time I checked, S.S. is not allowed to send a small child to someone's house unsupervised. But don't ask. This film has a number of implausabilities. Such as, how in the world did Adam get away with lying about who he was to S.S. the first time he went there with the kid and met with social worker Josh Mostel? I would think they would automatically ask you for I.D., especially if you're there about temporary custody of a small child. And how on earth did Adam break into that man's house so fast when he and the kid were trick or treating and the man refused to come to the door? He must've not had his doors locked too good. Not smart thinking when living in NY.Anyway, the movie had some good and funny parts too. I liked the little relationship that started between Adam and Leslie Mann's sister, Joey Lauren Adams. And there were some good bonding scenes between Adam and the kid. Some amusing moments included: Adam finding out his ex was sleeping with a 60 year old man, or as he called him, the Pepperage farm guy. And Adam saying to him: "hey old man river! Zip it or I'll break your hip!" Then Adam making fun of Rob Shnieder for not being able to read, especially with the way he said it when he was disguised as "Scuba Sam", the kid's toy " Scuba Steve's" father. Then there was Adam's talk with the kid's uptight kindergarten teacher, with her saying that his kid was the smelly kid. Then he asks her what he should do about that, and she answers "you should start by paying more attention to his school work". Yeh, OK, that will take care of him not smelling anymore. Then the Steve Bucemmi guy, a bum who says how he ruined his life by going through the " doing mushrooms" phase. And I really enjoyed the "lamb and tunafish" and "spaghetti and meatballs" analogy joke in the courtroom between Steve Bucemmi and Rob Shnieder. (I really liked Steve in the film "Ghost world". That was a really good film). Unfortionately, " Big daddy" also had a lot of vomit and pee jokes which I definitely coulda done without. And I also could've done without that spit thing Adam taught the kid.Finally, the social services finds out that Adam had lied about who he was, and he has to go to court. What really bugged me about the court scene was the judge. She sat there for the longest time remaining quiet while all of the different friends and family of Adam's defend him and say how good he's been to the kid. Then Adam's dad comes up to the stand and argues with him for a while about how he should never get custody of the boy. Then Adam says a couple of convincing, heartwarming things about the kid, and then Adam's dad finally says"your honor, my son deserves this child". Then everybody in the courtroom agrees and cheers. Then suddenly, after all that, that bitch of a judge then suddenly starts going on a rampage about how Adam should not only not have custody of the kid, but he should be in jail. Why would she keep quiet all that time while Adam redeems himself, and everyone else including his uptight dad acknowledges that Adam is fit to have the kid, and then all of a sudden she goes off on such a rampage? That really bugged me. I know that he shouldn't have lied about who he was to S.S., but the judge should've been mentioning that earlier in the court session and all the way through it, not her saying nothing until the very end when it looked like Adam was going to win, and then suddenly going off. Anyway, those are my two cents about this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surprisingly Sweet Sandler Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lazy law school grad (Adam Sandler) adopts a kid to impress his girlfriend, but everything does not go as planned and he becomes the unlikely foster father.Someone at Netflix thinks I like Adam Sandler. Beyond their own film (Ridiculous 6), they have recommended this one and "50 First Dates" and even "8 Crazy Nights". For some reason, I have been caving in a little bit... but I do not plan to watch a Hanukkah movie in February. Sorry, Netflix.As with "50 First Dates", it turns out that I was pleasantly surprised... this humor is not crude. A bit juvenile at times, but not overly so. We see an Adam Sandler who genuinely cares for other people. These are not the comedies that made him famous like "Billy Madison" and "happy Gilmore", but are still well worth appreciating in their own right. Plus, Joey Lauren Adams never made a bad movie.</fullReview>

If your looking for a movie that is hilarious with a little Truth and Drama every now and then try out this movie. If your looking for a movie about being a farther than maybe try a drama, or a movie that is based on a true story.

		<fullReview>I really like this movie. I can't believe that it took me so many years to finally watch it. I think I just forgot about it, at some point.This movie is about Sonny Koufax, mostly. He's a 32-year-old law school graduate. He has a nice apartment in Manhattan and his life seems to be pretty good. However, there is one problem. He does nothing. Ever. He sits on his butt and lives off an investment that was the result of a lawsuit he won, one year ago. So, yeah, that's a problem. Even though it sounds like a nice thing to do, but not for that long. When his friend, Kevin, is on a business trip, it is discovered that Kevin has a son that he never knew about. Sonny has to take care of the boy until his father returns. At first things don't go well, but then Sonny ends up loving him. I thought he might've adopted him, but he doesn't. Instead, they stay close and Sonny gets married and has children of his own.Overall, I give this movie a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Big Daddy was made around the time that Adam Sandler was evolving. Having just finished The Waterboy and The Wedding Singer, Sandler is back to his old self. Luckily, his material was new and fresh, so he was not very hated.The character of Sonny Kofax early on in the film is pretty much Adam Sandler playing Adam Sandler. He is a 32-year-old law school grad who works one day a week as a toll-booth ticket- taker. The rest of the time, he lazes out buying worthless junk and lives off a successful lawsuit filed two years earlier. This first little bit is typical Sandler. But there's no fart jokes which make it more of a cute kind of funny. When his roommate (Stewart) is out of town, a child named Julian (Sprouse) drops by with a note claiming to be his. He lies to social services saying he is his roommate and adopts him, hoping it will show responsibility and maturity. When his girlfriend (Swanson) dumps him for a much older man, Sonny tries to take the kid back. When he grows to love him, he tries to fight to keep him. So we get regular Sandler progressing to a more mature version of himself. Yes, there is silly toilet humour, but nothing that crosses the line of stupid and unfunny. When he adopts Julian, it is funny to see someone irresponsible like Adam Sandler caring for a 5-year-old. He has no idea what to do. This day in age, young parents are the norm. Teens always get pregnant. Since they are still kids themselves and not fully mature, they have tough times raising their own. Big Daddy kind of reflects that: he is immature and adopts a child. But the responsibility that he takes on makes him wake up and smell the coffee. He must discipline him as well as give him freedom. Of course it is hard to get the hang of, but that is all part of parenthood and Adam Sandler adds humour to that in all the right spots. Because he got a dose of reality, his love life strengthens when he falls for Layla Maloney (Adams) and finally becomes a successful lawyer by the end. Big Daddy offers us truly funny and clever Adam Sandler humour, along with a beautiful glimpse at fatherhood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adam Sandler still funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sonny Koufax (Adam Sandler) is a law school graduate who's living off the $200k from a frivolous lawsuit. He has a menial job as a parking lot attendant, and his girlfriend can't take it anymore. His best friend/roommate Kevin (Jon Stewart) is getting married with Big Boobs McGee (Leslie Mann). Everybody is growing up and moving on. Then a kid (the Sprouse twins) gets dropped off with a note claiming to be Kevin's child.This was when Adam Sandler was still cute and funny as the wise cracking slacker. He and the Sprouse twins are funny together. And it's got a good story of a manchild learning to grow up. His arrested development schtick is still hilarious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somehow 'Big Daddy' has a certain persuasive charm despite Adam Sandler's supposedly endearing loser displaying a worrying line in aggressive behaviour, child corruption and home invasion, and the film's tendency to dabble in outrageously manipulative sentimentality, particularly towards the end. What won me over to some extent, aside from Steve Buscemi's scene stealing turn as a homeless guy, is how the movie breezes effortlessly through the comedy scenes with a lack of neediness that's quite refreshing in a weird way. This is the first decent effort from regular Sandler hack Dennis Dugan, whose apparent penchant for big knockers doesn't do the film any harm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Like most of Adam Sandlers movies, okay the humor is what people would call "low", but i didn't like this one at all. It was not funny and as a big fan of 'Big Daddy' and ' Jack &amp; Jill' this one was really a disappointment. He's a complete idiot in this one, he's to aggressive and rude. A Hockey player that plays golf so that he can save his grandmother's house? That's just stupid and that's all what this movie is about, stupid jokes. The only think i liked about it was the cameo of Ben Stiller. I like his goofy movies more, like 'you don't mess with the zohan' " Mr.Deeds' ' Big Daddy'. Those are funny and tells you a comical story. I give Happy Gilmore 3 Star out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sandler has another talent, but throws it away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon finishing Big Daddy I had a feeling of optimism and disappointment at the same time. This is one of the few perfect examples showing that Adam Sandler can effectively make a drama film, with some mild comedy, and create a relatively passable picture, but he opts out for cruder, more one-dimensional projects that provide little wit. This among 50 First Dates, Click, and Funny People can be viewed as the delightfully surprising Sandler pictures. The rest you can feel free to discard.I'm too amazed at how tolerable some of the pictures where Sandler is out of the frame are. By now, most are aware of the Happy Madison regulars; Sandler, Rob Schneider, David Spade, Allen Covert, Peter Dante, Kevin Nealon, and newcomers Kevin James and Nick Swardson. I found Happy Madison's Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star and Grandma's Boy to be entertaining works, if marginally forgettable, but also observed how when Sandler is working as producer, the end result is more often than not better. We'll see if that formula continues to thrive. I have quite a few more Happy Madison pictures to dig through.Here, Sandler is actually rather capable playing the doughy man-child Sonny, who is 32, works one day a week at a toll-booth, and somehow still managed to snag the beautiful girlfriend. He manages to remain in stable conditions living off restitution payments from a petty vehicle accident. While Sonny's recently engaged roommate Kevin, played by, yes that, Jon Stewart, is off on business in China, Sonny is greeted with a five year old named Julian (the Sprouse twins) on his doorstep, and a written note claims that Julian came from a night of partying on Kevin's part. Unable to return home, Kevin puts Sonny under the care of Julian, and Sonny winds up lying to Social Services saying he is Kevin.So, when Sandler's character is the parent, what do you think will happen? Insubordination? Mischief? Rambunctiousness and chaos galore? Well, you're right, but all in a muted form. What Sonny winds up doing with the kid is rather tame and not expected from the usual Sandler schtick. There's even a hint of nice sentimentality, that comes in the form of pleasantness rather than conventional schmaltz. He allows the kid to utilize options rather than orders to hopefully round him out to be a better person, rather than evolve into a miserable degenerate late on in life. Ultimately, the focus is more on the slapstick and the crudeness of the picture, and we go from some marginally sentimental scenes to jokes about Sonny's relationship with his gay friends (Covert and Dante) very quickly. But even then, the film never truly becomes dismal or reprehensible.There's even a love story, with the beautiful Joey Lauren Adams playing Layla, Kevin's fiancée's sister. She keeps the story from truly going too far into the sea of despair, and is even involved in some of the film's best scenes. The one I immediately think of is the bedtime story.What ultimately stops Big Daddy dead in its tracks is formula, which truly isn't taken in a way sharp enough to wholeheartedly recommend. Its mixture of slapstick and charm is impressive, the performances are nice, and the delivery is rarely rocky, but at times, the film becomes a tad too contrived, incorporating textbook pieces like the inevitable courtroom scene at the end and the "cute kid says naughty thing" cliché. For Sandler, it's a step up, and he may want to consider more of the impressively sassy kids films with a nice heart.Starring: Adam Sandler, Cole Sprouse, Dylan Sprouse, Joey Lauren Adams, Jon Stewart, Rob Schneider, Leslie Mann, and Steve Buscemi. Directed by: Dennis Dugan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Middle of the road Sandler comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adam Sandler can sometimes be amusing, and sometimes be lame as well. I first saw this particular film starring the former "Saturday Night Live" comedian some years ago, and wasn't blown away, but do recall finding it mildly amusing. However, many years later, I watched it a second time just last night. This time, quite a few gags made me snicker, but that wasn't enough for me to exactly call it a good comedy. This could be because it wore a bit thin with a second viewing, or because I now have higher standards than I did years ago. Maybe it's both.Sonny Koufax is a lazy, extremely immature 32-year-old who only works one day each week as toll booth collector, and most of his money is from a lawsuit. His girlfriend is fed up with his childish lifestyle, and one day, a five year old boy named Julian shows up at his apartment door. This boy is apparently the unknown son of Kevin Gerrity, Sonny's friend. He decides to adopt Julian in an attempt to prove himself responsible and mature and save his relationship with his girlfriend. Unfortunately, it's too late, as his former girlfriend already has a new lover. After this, Sonny attempts to get Julian back to his mother, but learns that she has died. So, the toll booth collector takes the boy back, and soon grows to love him. Taking care of a kid turns out to be an eye-opening experience, but since he adopted him under a false name, he may be in for trouble! Unsurprisingly, Sandler plays an immature goofball in this movie, the typical kind of character he's often known to play. His antics in this movie are sometimes mildly amusing, but sometimes not. A mite too many jokes about breasts may come from his mouth. The movie also has some mildly amusing slapstick in places, but once again, not hilarious, just mildly amusing, and it doesn't save the movie. The gross-out gags don't really work, either, including Julian's spitting talent. Aside from the humour, "Big Daddy" is supposed to be a touching story about responsibility and fatherhood, and this also only works to a certain extent at best. Basically, this is pretty much an average effort overall, one of Sandler's dismissible films, though it is better than "Just Go With It", the last film of his I watched.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who would thought that a Sandler's movie would have such plausible plot and story. Most of his films are tiring and out of story (hey that's an achievement!). "Big Daddy" begins being very funny and tries to maintain it throughout it's running. I can say it is kinda peculiar; first, it shows how normal the American society reacted to homosexual couples, and more than that, how they were acceptive in seeing a child spending time with that couple-- don't get me wrong, but in my country, back in 1999, this movie would've been banished or at least censored. Also, it shows how comprehensive American society was with adopting kids-- again, in Brazil, people were really really prejudiced towards this subject. Sandler's acting is clearly improved from his past films and he still wasn't a hack actor as he is nowadays. Movies involving child are usually very emotional, and this one follows this rule. Most scenes with the little guy are sensitive and heart-whelming, mainly the court speeches. It's just a shame that the court scene was extremely clichéd and Hollywood, otherwise I would give it a higher rating than 7. Overall "Big Daddy" is a great movie, if you're able to ignore some things in that court scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A boy in a man's body must begin to take responsibility</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, this is another Adam Sandler movie in the vain of Happy Gilmore and the Waterboy. In this one he is a lawyer who chose to spend his post college life bumming around rather than get a job. In essence he is a child in an adult's body. The reviews all say that he dropped out of Law School, but he did not. He finished Law School, and the movie implies that he was quite good, but he simply doesn't want to work. The fact that he managed to get $20 000 off of a cabbie who ran over his foot is more evidence that he is actually quite a good lawyer.Everything is going okay, okay in the sense that his girlfriend is upset that he isn't taking any responsibility for his life and has gone away for a while. She then ends up dumping him for a much older man, who Sandler has the pleasure of paying out. One day though a kid lands up on his doorstep which is being given to his flat mate, who is in China. Sandler at first decides that he will use the kid to prove to his girlfriend that he is capable of being a responsible adult, but in the end decides that he likes having a kid.Triple J hated the movie, having a go at the moral point that we must one day grow up and take responsibility. I might appreciate the radio station for the music, but their attitude that responsibility sucks and that we should live life in a hedonistic and self-centered way is basically immature. I personally think the theme in the movie is quite relevant when aimed at a culture of slackers and dole bludgers that sleep in til noon and live a life of getting wasted. I remember a friend who had a kid, and it so much of a hassle that he ended up splitting up with his girlfriend. Even though he wanted the kid, I highly doubt that he would be able to effectively look after it, especially since he spent a large amount of his day stoned on marijuana.Sandler takes the attitude of lets give the kid a choice and don't ram rules down his throat. He lets the kid pick his name (Frankenstein) and lets the kid choose what to wear. He then becomes paranoid that kids at the school will introduce him to drugs so he spends time with them trying to find out is they actually know anything about drugs (which they do not).The main theme of this movie is responsibility. Here Sandler chooses responsibility, but in the end he lands up in trouble because of the way he went about it. In our eyes he is a far better father than many that really exist, but in the eyes of the state he is a liar and a cheat, and no matter how many lawyers he has behind him, there is no way that he can throw that off of him. In the end, he realises that he must take responsibility for his lives and the lives of those around him if he is going to be taken seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is the best movie on father-son relationship. Yes, i know it is commy, but if we want message we can get from any effective media.The child enters the life of Sunny, &amp; he is taking care of him in his own way, he lets child do as per his wish..., i think of that always, children need to be allowed to do what they want, they learn about right or wrong themselves faster than we think. I often see parents yelling on small children, b'coz they do crazy stuff, ask lot of question, i hate those people. If u don't want to answer them, don't produce them.And in court, when street man says "I will live on street rather than under his rules", yes, most of the dads drive their teenager mad, they mess with child's head, especially with sons. They think they r doing for his best, but they really screw things up. I am 1 of those, i hated my dad so much that for years i didn't talked to him, &amp; my way to express my anger was smoke n drink with my friends with similar problem. I m telling u, if father son relationship improves worldwide,more than half of teenager will be free of alcohol &amp; drug. Later my dad told me, he is that short tempered n violent b'coz of his dad??Very serious subject is handled very hilariously. Adam Sandler's best movie. All actors r good. I think every father-son should watch this movie together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adam Sandler: Worst Parent Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw this movie on Crackle.com, I thought "Hey, Adam Sandler is funny, so I'll like this movie" After all, people love pre-2000 Sandler. Unfortunately, this movie is hardly funny. Most of the humor comes from how much Sonny (Sandler's character) fails at being a parent for Julian (his son). Basically, Sonny allows Julian to do whatever he wants. I'm fine with that if it's only for the humor. The problem is WHAT he allows Julian to do. Some examples are: peeing in public, covering all messes with newspaper, etc. You're probably saying "Well, Julian is only a little kid, he doesn't know that he's doing the wrong things" That's where you're wrong. Sonny is TEACHING him to do these things. At this point, I became steamed at how utterly dumb Sonny is, but the nail that seals the coffin is that once Julian goes to school, he does these things. Unsurprisingly, his teacher is not very happy. "Julian should've known not to do those things in SCHOOL, it's common sense, duh", you say. Allow me to repeat myself: SONNY TAUGHT JULIAN TO DO THOSE THINGS! And not once does Sonny tell him not to do it in school. Don't blame the kid, blame Sandler! At least Sonny teaches Julian the right things afterwards. Now when Social Services takes Julian away so they can take care of him until a new family comes by, most people would start crying, but I say "Thank God!"Now let's get into the good parts of the movie. The other humor comes from Rob Schneider, who is treated as the comedy relief of the movie. The stuff they do to him is actually quite funny. Also, the movie does get better in the 2nd half. My favorite scenes are when Sonny and Layla are together. I'm not sure why I like those scenes, but I do.Summary: The movie had potential to be funny, with Sandler being the idiot parent allowing the child to do whatever he wants, but it suffers greatly. Most of the humor felt nonexistent, though the movie got better in the 2nd half. Overall, if you're a die-hard Sandler fan, check it out, but everyone else should keep looking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Big Daddy (1999)When this film first came out I loved it. However, I was 12. Now when I watch it I still find it funny at times but not as great as I use to, much like other Adam Sandler films from the late 90s and early 00s. A man named Sonny Koufax tries impressing his girl friend by becoming a foster father to a kid whose father is Sonny's roommate Kevin. The Kid, Julian, arrives while Kevin is in China for business and Sonny decides he's going to raise him his way. Soon he falls in love with Kevin's fiancé's sister Layla and trouble with Julian comes around as wellBig Daddy is clearly implausible but it is a comedy so that's usually expectable. It does have a decent story and drama and the comedy is usually pretty decent but it seems to be a little scattered. It was kind of like a big montage. It just kept showing random parts of Sonny and Julian hanging out. The parts with Layla seem to go normally but the parts with Julian seem kind of armature-ish. It doesn't seem like good writing, it seems like someone just brain stormed funny things to happen with a kid and put them together. Adam Sandlers performance is basically the same as in Mr Deeds, Wedding Singer, Anger Management, and so on. nothing special but it works for his comedies.. The Sprouse twins did a great job playing Julian, and all the rest of the cast did pretty decent. Rob Schneider did his normal funny supporting role as usual in Sandler's films, and he, along with a cameo by Steve Buscemi, has some of the funniest parts in the film. Anyone who is a fan of Adam Sandler should like this film, especially fans of his films around 2000 (Wedding Singer, Water Boy, Little Nicky, etc.) It is Definitely not Sandlers funniest film but it's pretty high on the list. Most likely liked by the younger crowd but some adults should still find it good or at least tolerable. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adam Sandler has been a very funny guy with all the comedies that he does, and Big Daddy is no exception. In Big Daddy, Adam Sandler plays Sonny Koufax, an irresponsible guy who lives off the money he made in a lawsuit where a cab ran over his foot. He works only once a week at a toll booth that lets drivers into New York.He doesn't care about not having a legitimate job or doing something with his life. This causes his girlfriend Vanessa, played by Kristy Swanson, to dump him.When a five year old boy named Julian shows up at his apartment and he finds out that the kid is his roommate's, he decides to take care of the kid. Raising the kid causes Sonny to act more responsible. He hopes it will make Vanessa want to take him back, but she has moved on. Sonny still decides to take care of the kid, teaching him how to handle things his way. He changes even more when Julian's teacher mentions to Sonny how he is acting up, and not behaving properly. This causes Sonny to act even more responsible by teaching him how to be clean, eat right, and dress properly. It becomes a learning experience for both Sonny and Julian.Later, he uses Julian to get the attention of a girl named Layla, played by Joey Lauren Adams from Chasing Amy. They hit it off and start to love each other.Along with Sandler and Adams in this movie, Jon Stewart from The Daily Show plays Sonny's aforementioned roommate. Peter Dante and Allen Covert play a gay couple who are friends of Sandler and Stewart. Rob Schneider plays a delivery guy who frequently comes to Sonny's apartment. Steve Buscemi plays a homeless guy.This is one of the funniest Adam Sandler movies. Director Dennis Dugan shows that he does great working with Adam Sandler.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sandler's top performance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1999, Big Daddy was really Sandler's biggest emotional role. Big Daddy plays and hides around the fact it's actually a touching drama. It wraps itself in a gripping comedic tale of an immature 30 year old child growing up to become an endearing and tender father.Sonny Kofax, played by Sandler, pretends to be his roommate, Kevin, to gain custody over a child who comes to his doorstep in a desperate attempt to win back his girlfriend Vanessa, before she leaves for good. After the plan backfires and Sonny realizes that he can't handle the kid, he tries to give him back to Social Services. But, while Social Services searches for a family for Julian (Dylan and Cole Sprouse), Sonny bonds with him, morphing into a loving and caring father.Nowadays, most people will tell you that Adam's most heart-wrenching movie is the overrated "comedy" known as Click. I beg to differ, as Big Daddy, is not a comedy in first priority. It pretends to be a comedy, and while it is gut-wrenching hilarious for a large portion, it's mostly an emotional film and tugs your heart strings and floods your eyes.Adam cannot out do himself in Big Daddy, no matter what other roles come his way. It's simply his best movie and his best performance. It's not just how emotional he gets in the movie and how easily his performance touches you...it's also how unbelievably funny he can be. His comedic delivery is still at the top of the game and better than it's counter parts Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison. I'd say Big Daddy is even funnier than The Waterboy. I think the biggest reason this movie is successful is because Sandler's character is not mentally handicapped like The Waterboy, or an idiot like Billy Madison or something like that. He's a regular down-to-Earth guy who's just had a bunch of mishaps and is just trying to do the right thing.It's not just Adam who provides comedy and emotion. Rob Schneider provides and huge number of escalating laughs as well as Leslie Mann pretty much began her career here. Jon Stewart plays Kevin and has some good lines and helps support. I especially like Allan Covert and Peter Dante's roles and how they fall into the story so perfectly. Cole and Dylan Sprouse should also garner a ton of credit for emotional moments and a mass number of laugh out loud moments.Honestly, there's nothing not to like - or even love - about Big Daddy. It's a great movie for all audiences and a real tear jerker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Big Daddy is a good Adam Sandler film that is funny the whole way through even though it is not quite as good as stuff like Happy Gilmore and I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry. This movie is about a guy who when he loses his girlfriend to an 80 year old and gets given a 8 year old boy on accident he decides to keep him to show his girlfriend he is responsible. But when he realizes she is not coming back he begins to like the 8 year old boy leading to fun. Overall this show is funny and Adam Sandler's great talent is not wasted on this movie. It may not be his best but is definitely worth a watch. I rate this movie a fair 63%. You should definitely watch it though as it is funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes me wish I had kids!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie in the $5 bin at Wal-Mart recently and decided to buy it. My older sister had told me it was pretty good, and being a fan of The Suite Life of Zack and Cody, I thought I'd enjoy seeing the boys when they were little. After watching the movie, I think $5 is pretty cheap for such a great movie--I would've been willing to pay more! I really enjoyed seeing Adam Sandler's character dealing with the major responsibility of taking care of a kid, and Cole and Dylan were really cute and funny as Julian.Even though I love this movie, I'm giving it a 9 because there are a couple objectionable parts. I probably wouldn't show it to really young kids, partly because of those things and partly because I wouldn't want them to imitate some of Julian's behavior. With that said, I highly recommend this movie to anyone else, because the good in this movie far outweighs anything objectionable. If you love kids and enjoy seeing people learning good values and responsibility, you'll probably enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The big daddy is a nice movie. Its light, nice, clean (just a light kiss) funny and good to watch movie. It gets a little bit emotional towards the end. But not too much. Adam is great as ever. The little kid does the job well. Yesterday I watched "Because of Winn-Dixie". Though I liked that movie than this one. It could have been more good by putting in more comedy. May be I expected a bit more comedy stuff (because of Adam Sandler?). OH! not to mention the best sequence was the one in the court where Adam persuades his father in the hearing of the case to keep the child with him.Anyway, its a nice to watch family movie. I had a great time watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Sandler comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was one of Sandler's three funniest next to "Billy Madison" and "Happy Gilmore" This movie actually turned out to be a dramadey because it was dramatic in scenes. This was a good movie because of that. It actually has a really good story. This movie was good in all directions. Adam Sandler did a good job in this and so did the kid. It had a good story and an okay script. It seems like it had good directing for this movie. Adam Sandler did not deserve to win or even be nominated for worst actor at the Razzies. He just did not deserve it. Totally not. This was a good movie. 7/10. Just don't listen to the next couple of lines. This was a funny movie. This was a good movie. yes. It was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie again shows just how brilliant actor Adam really is. His touching portrayal of a guy stuck with a kid whilst clueless about the certain activities that are involved with bringing them up is hilarious. Adam shows a man who has to partake a journey and learn to be less self-centered. The kid is cute and guaranteed you will fall in love with him (he has a devilish twinkle in his eye) with the rest of the cast really giving it their all. Layla is stunning as Adam's love interest whilst his ex goes on to become someone he always looked down on = a HOOTER girl. So yeah our hero or heroes live happily ever after. Though it's kinda sick she hooks up with a guy old enough to be her father/grandad. Ps Love her face at the end!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great film, a funny comedy, The court room was a touching scene. None stop laughs and Rob Schneider adds to the comedy value. "Hippopotamonononomus, That's not fair, You give him all the easy ones", True comedy. Good for all family. I admire Adam sandlers techniques and the way he can interact with almost any other type of actor. It really does emphasise the point of Lazy people and their daily goings. Great acting by Dylan and Cole Sprouse, Instant Stars. Parts of the films humour is rather rude though, Although Im sure tomato ketchup is tasty, Im also sure it'll make you sick. Impressive spit he has there. I couldn't stop laughing at the Tramp, Man he was funny, and also the XXX night light, That was hilarious. It really does show you how parents can influence their children and should take more care in what they say or do around their kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was great! I don't usually like Adam Sandler movies, but his role was amazing! The way he took care of his "son" was so touching yet hilarious at the same time. Well worth the time to watch it and you won't stop laughing! As he starts to fall in love with Julian, he takes on a whole different persona and becomes almost the ideal father figure. When they go to court, everyone can tell that Julian would rather be with Sonny, Adam Sandler, than go with the Social Services guy because of the hilarious bond they have constructed between one another. This movie is a classic Adam Sandler with his humor, but it has a softer side too. Sandler fans won't be disappointed and new comers to his humor, or one's that don't really like him, will find this one of the funniest movies for it's time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was kind of the beginning of the end of Sandler's first run of hilarious movies. Up until this film, everything he had made since his SNL days was hilarious. I mean, Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison and the Wedding singer all in a row: that's quite a run! This was the first truly mediocre film he made and unfortunately, there were many to follow. I remember seeing this film in the theater with some friends who were all big Sandler fans and I didn't really laugh that much at all. Neither did they. I was the only outspoken critic, though. I felt that this film was a big letdown from Sandler's earlier work. Definitely replaces the zaniness for the sentimentality and it just didn't work for me. Note to comedic actors: don't grow up! Keep making funny comedies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright. Adam Sandler plays dysfunctional characters all the time. What made people think he wouldn't be like that in this film is beyond me. Get ready for dysfunctional in a funny way. If you can't handle seeing someone "parent" in a "dysfunctional way", this is NOT for you. Don't waste your time with this one. But if you can appreciate a total "loser" who doesn't even have a five-year plan who suddenly finds himself taking care of a kid the best he knows how, then try this one. This is not for kids. This is not for people with "homosexual issues", either. The plot was hilarious, the acting was actually good in most parts. Some of the acting was wooden, as is usually the case when certain roles are given to actors who aren't comfortable with what they have to do. Maybe the casting could have been better there. For anyone who has seen this movie, "Hooters!". Everyone else can watch the movie to catch this reference. Enjoy this one with people who know that life in film is NOT to be taken seriously. Be on the lookout for Rob Schneider. His character is delightful and happens to have a cameo in a later Sandler film. (Mr. Deeds) Strange but true! I loved this film. But then, I found Sandler's character to be delightfully dysfunctional. And I certainly didn't take it seriously!</fullReview>

I love it because it contains laughs, is original in its own sense by providing a situation in life which does not occur often. The twist involved at the end is definitely unexpected and well executed. The cast of characters and the way they all blend and know each other makes you feel like you've known them for years. Above all, the sad parts will always make you sad. It's a perfect mix of tragedy and comedy. Big Daddy is definitely a must see for everybody.

		<fullReview>I liked Big Daddy. I first saw Sandler when i was a die-hard Brendan Fraser fan in the late 90's and watched Airheads. Didn't think much of him then but I think it was Anger Management that made me think twice about him. So lately I've been watching quite a few Sandler movies, 50 first dates, Spanglish, Big Daddy, The Waterboy, The Wedding Singer etc.The Wedding Singer is by far his best movie yet, I think. But Big Daddy isn't too bad. I mean yes, it's got the typical Sandler gags and it does hit a low brow but that's as far as it goes. Sandler is very good and Schneider is as usual funny as hell. The kids have done a pretty good job too. THe story line is....i wouldn't say unexpected..I think I saw the same kind of story on a Steve Martin movie once called A Simple Twist Of Fate. something like that. So the story isn't totally new. There's the relatively new humor where gay couples and mean old men are concerned. It's a good movie but if you really want to watch Sandler at his best it's Click, Anger Management and The Wedding Singer!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adam Sandler's movies tend to rip off an original idea, but I'm still a hard-core fan of him. In this laugh-out-loud comedy, Sandler collaborates with "Happy Gilmore" director, Dennis Dugan again and long-time Sandler movie writer, Tim Herlihy to channel Charlie Chaplin's silent hit, "The Kid." In this loose, and unrecognized remake, Sandler plays thirty-something ne'er do well, Sonny Koufax, who lives off a $200,000 lawsuit from the year before and works at a toll-booth a day a week. His girlfriend, Vanessa (Kristy Swanson), is fed up with Sandler's character for doing nothing and later in the movie dumps him for a senior citizen-aged boyfriend. Since Sonny's sympathetic lawyer roommate, Kevin, (Jon Stewart) represents his firm in China, his kid that he doesn't know about ends up in the hands of Sonny. At first, the kid might be the benefactor for Sonny and Vanessa to get back together, but it doesn't work out. Aside from that, Sonny pretends to be his roommate and might be in deep water by the state of New York. Sonny grows up while caring for Julian, and aside from illegally adopting the kid, he invents his unorthodox method of parenting and the "Kramer vs. Kramer" effect and dramatic matter falls into place. While taking care of Julian, Sonny finds a new girlfriend played by Joey Lauren Adams."Big Daddy" is hilarious and Adam Sandler shines in his semi-mature role. The jokes are hair-raising and many of them could serve as many oddball catchphrases. Cole and Dylan Sprouse are sweet and good-natured as curious Julian who adopts Sonny's anti-social behavior as his own. Though, it seems fast paced and forced, the emotional elements of the film really deliver. Whether it's Sonny coming to terms with growing up or showing how Julian feels, it comes together and stays genuine. The writing by Sandler and Herlihy still continues to be a force, and the weird, quirky characters that are in most Sandler movies steal the show, such as Mr. Herlihy and Nazo, the delivery guy. This is one of the best comedies I seen since "Kingpin" and a hysterical farce. "Big Daddy" delivers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>funny and uplifting inoffensive comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS Adam Sandler has done some funny films over the years. Often slapstick based, he's a bit like a cartoon version of Ben Stiller. Whether playing a country boy with a skill for American football, a guy dating a girl for over and over again or as the son of the devil, Sandler manages to get some of the more obscure roles and make them fun. "Big Daddy" is yet another example of the Sandler mold where he gets a random character and adds an element of 'nice' to them. The film is an often very funny film, with many familiar faces, and by the end you are happily satisfied with this inoffensive comedy.Sonny Koufax (Sandler) is a lazy waste of space. Attempting to prove his love for dream girl Vanessa (Kristy Swanson), Koufax creates some major social security nightmares when he 'adopts' the long lost son of his flatmate Kevin (Jon Stewart). Spending huge amounts of time with the kid, Koufax, the worlds biggest layabout, slowly begins to bond with the boy and develop into the father figure we know he can be.Adam Sandler films are always great fun. Often with the same supporting cast as previous features, it is often a case of 'whos who'. Whether it's the cameo from Steve Buschemi, the regular appearance of Rob Schneider, or appearances from Peter Dante and others, the films always look like they were hilarious to film and undeniably great fun. Yes, the acting might not be award winning standard, but who cares when the group of actors all work so well together."Big Daddy" is brilliantly written too. Often referring to 'Hooters' jokes, the film is not without cult references, but more often than not the funniest scenes are when slapstick is fully embraced. Scenes where Sandler teaches the boy to trip up roller blades for example are particularly funny, as are scenes where up tight members of society are given their comeuppance (including a cameo by director Dennis Dugan). The film is just a simple, uplifting comedy. It never tries to be anything special and it knows what it is.There's not much else to say really. Adam Sandler is one of those people that you either love or hate. Mostly inoffensive, his films thrive on slapstick and childlike humour. "Big Daddy" is no exception to this rule and as a result Sandler and supporting cast thrive. Often funny, always entertaining, this film is just the sort of thing you can relax to. Good family fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Matter What People Say, This Is One Of Sandler's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reasons unknown to me, user's on this site seem not to like Big Daddy or Adam Sandler films altogether. I, however, have found that most Sandler films aren't that bad and this one seems to have a point and a caring message.Sunny Koufax (Adam Sandler) is 32. He's has a nice apartment, a degree from law school, and a nice roommate, Kevin (Jon Stewart). Except for one thing. Sunny does completely noting and is hated by most people. In fact he is an jerk all together. One day, Kevin leaves on business for China and after a day, social service dumps five year old Julian (Cole and Dylan Sprouse). Sunny adopts him as Kevin to impress his girlfriend, but after she isn't impressed, and Sunny learns that the kid will go to an orphanage due to his mothers death, Sunny begins to take care of him. With the help of Nazo (Rob Schnieder)and Sunny's girlfriend Layla (Joey Lauren Adams) he attempts to raise the boy.Much to his success, Social Services doesn't attempt to keep track as Sunny learns to teach Julian to read, take him to school, trick-or-treat, and have act in play. Soon things are going well but Social Services is figuring out what is going on and Sunny will do anything to hang on to his new love of a son. Sandler does some of his best acting of his career. The story is funny, it's a caring, and it is creative. Sandler leaves some of his tough guy attitude at the start but breaks out into a loving father and acts with talent he hasn't shown until Spanglish (2004). Cole and Dylan Sprouse both play young Julian and each bring laughs and parenting issues out which would be presented to a single parent. All in all Big Daddy is one of Sandler's best. Big Daddy. Starring: Adam Sandler, Cole Sprouse, Dylan Sprouse, joey Lauren Adams, Rob Schnieder, Jon Stewart, and Josh Mostel.4 out of 5 Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a great comedy done by Adam Sandler. It shows us that love can come in the strangest ways. When Julian(Cole and Dylan Sprouse) gets dumped off on Sonny Koufax's(Sandler)front step, he automatically tries to get rid of him. Then he gets dumped by his girl for an older man. So, Sonny tries to adopt poor little Julian to impress his ex. She is not impressed. Koufax is stuck with little Julian, and they begin a friendship which really makes them both believe that it is real. Koufax never got along with his dad, so he takes a totally different approach at being a father. He lets his new son, Frankenstein, do anything that he wants. He ignores his friends about giving the kid back. Koufax really grows attached to Julian, even though he is not really his son. I think that the director is trying to point out that adoption is okay. Just don't do it to impress your girlfriend. He created a comedy with one of the funniest comedians there are. He pulled out his emotions and showed us that he really does have a sensitive side. I would recommend this movie to everyone. It happens to be one of my favorites. I think that is funny when he tells everyone that Sonny taught him how to pee on a building. He also learned how to pick up girls in the park. This movie gets five stars in my book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm generally a fan of Adam Sandler films. I've enjoyed many of his films. Okay, they're "big concepts", they're predictable, but there's adam sandler and I love him. I missed a few of his films and this was one of them. Hey, they're usually just silly fluff, but I enjoy them. And when it comes to silly fluff this film is no exception. And, as I expected it was the usual silly fluff from Sandler and company. But in an Adam Sandler film, it's a simple question. Did you laugh? And the answer here is yes. Yes. But not enough. It's hit and miss. And the misses win. It pleads for more. Rent this if like me you're a Sandler fan and have missed this one. Or if you've run out of other comedy choices. Otherwise, it's totally forgettable.</fullReview>

But he played it so truly that you almost beleive he is a delivery guy. So did Adam Sandler. I like the way he is talking. It would be cool if they make such good films as Big Daddy (Adam Sandler) and Hot Chick (Rob Shneider). Also all other pals in these movies were great. I like the scene most where Julyan had to leave Sonny. He is holding Adam's hand and there are tears in Adam's eyes. And little boy says "I will never listen to Kangoroo song"</fullReview>

A kid from an orphanage arrives at his doorstep one day wondering if Sonny is his father. Sonny expects to have this problem resolved soon, but after a while the kid (Julian) grows on him, and Sonny takes on a parent type role, unknowing of the problems that await. -I recommend this for a person looking for a comedy, but I however only recommend seeing it once or twice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A so-so film, at best -- "Little Miss Marker" this ain't!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't agree with all the critics that Adam Sandler is a talentless buffoon, and I've liked quite a few of his films, but I sure didn't care for "Big Daddy" too much. In a bold departure from his other `loser' roles (yeah, right), Sandler plays 32-year-old Sonny Koufax, a brainy law school graduate too smart for his own good (talk about miscasting); a kid with a lot of potential who dropped out of the world of adult-like creditability to spend his days sleeping-in, eating carry-out food, goofing around, drinking beer, watching TV and contending with typical slacker diversions. So, in a misguided attempt to impress his girlfriend, Vanessa (Kristy Swanson), and prove he's responsible, Sonny unwittingly adopts a five-year old boy, Julian (Cole and Dylan Sprouse), who in actuality, is his roommate's illegitimate son. And while he takes his role as father somewhat seriously, he's more than a bit unconventional: Sonny's teaches the boy to trip roller-bladers (unfunny), to dress how he wants (funny), to piss outside in public (unfunny) and to help pick up chicks (funny). In fact, the movie sways between funny and unfunny so much that you're sitting on the middle of the fence by the end of the film with no attachment to any of the characters. Only the weak-ass story-line, the unmistakable predictability, and the recycled, abusive jokes about foreigners, old people, homeless folks and homosexuals jolt you into truly disliking the movie. By the final courtroom scene, you just wish the judge would march everyone off to Devil's Island, especially Steve Buscemi (making yet another eccentric cameo). The kid, I digress, is kind of cute, but if you're looking for this kind of story, check out either version of "Little Miss Marker."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw the ads for Big Daddy on TV, I just rolled my eyes, thinking "Oh, yeah, it's just another stupid Sandler movie... Whatever." I just saw it the other day, and it was nothing like what I expected. True, there was some typical Sandler crudeness, and the same old guest cameos, but the story is very good.(Possible spoilers...)Sonny (Sandler) is a good-for-nothing bum who doesn't have a job and lives off the stock earnings from a settlement he got when a taxicab ran over his foot a few years ago. Out of the blue, a little kid named Julian gets dumped on his doorstep. The situations that follow are funny, cute, and very amusing!The chemistry between these two is SO cute. Some of the best parts come from the fact that Sonny has no idea how to deal with children. When Julian throws up or pees on the floor, all Sonny does is spread newspaper over the 'accident' and leave it there. Then there's Sonny's makeshift "nightlight" for Julian (a neon "LIVE NUDES" marquee,) Julian's new name, and the bath. ("Why do I hafta wear a swimsuit?" "Well, Julian, I don't know the rules about adults and kids and the naked and... just sit down...")There were a few too many "Hooters" references for my liking, but they weren't enough to detract from the Sonny/Julian story. The circumstances surrounding Julian's "But I wipe my own *ss!" exclamations made me cry, but the court scene was a little too preachy. ("Hello, Dad?")All in all, I wouldn't take this on a baby-sitting job or ask my younger siblings to watch it, but it's a very good movie to rent and watch with friends, a date, or just to feel good. I say 9/10 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soft Sandler...Not such a bad thing (?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie could be seen as a follow-up to Sandler's own Wedding Singer. Both movies are indeed comedies of the Adam Sandler brand, of course, but both also have a soft, sensitive side as well. After the worst comedy of my life, The Waterboy, I was sort of glad to see this come along. Although it may not be over-the-top hilarious like Happy Gilmore or Billy Madison, it still sustains repeated viewings and even tugs at your heart-strings a little bit. The story revolves around Sonny Koufax, a 32-year old law school drop-out who lives the life of a slacker, ever since he won a wealthy settlement from someone who ran over his foot. He doesn't take his life seriously, he has a one-day a week job, and both his father and his girlfriend are constantly nagging at him about his laziness. After an argument early on in the movie, Sonny decides he needs to do something to prove to his girlfriend he is responsible, and thus, you have the set-up for the movie. Both Rob Schneider and Steve Buscemi have their resident roles in this Adam Sandler flick and provide much supporting humor. Joey Lauren Adams (Chasing Amy, Dazed &amp; Confused) plays Sandler's love interest and Jon Stewart (The Daily Show, Half Baked) plays his lifelong best friend and roommate. The movie is actually a little unpredictable. Although you know problems are going to arise towards the end, as evidenced by the buildup, the ending is a little unexpected. This is not Sandler's best work (look to Little Nicky and Billy Madison) but it is one of the better movies of it's kind. It is never manipulating and it is thoroughly entertaining and funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adam Sandler (again!) plays an idiot who works one day a week and is a law school graduate.When a kid is dropped off at his doorstep,he takes responsibility of the child until social services can find him a new home with new parents.Everyone is against him looking after the kid and things start to move downhill as he learns what parenthood is like.This movie is alot better than it looks and sounds,Adam Sandler is hilarious and the supporting actress's and actors are great. The movie is yet funny,but also touching and dramatic.I suggest renting this film before buying it,but anyone whose not to fussy will love this movie.If you're a fan of Adam Sandler and you havn't seen this one yet,what are you waiting for? I rate 4/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this movie is bathetic (yes, bathetic)and deliberately sentimental (right down to the clique music playing at the 'touching' moments). It doesn't have great role models or soul-searching value.But you know what? You catch Sandler actually acting in it - and acting pretty well. Of course we get his anti-social ranting, played before in Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison, but you also get Sandler handling the love interest well and interacting with the kid on more than one level. 'Punch Drunk Love' shouldn't be such a surprise to critics or audiences after the work he does in this movie and "The Wedding Singer".The movie has it's usual Sandler moments (gross/disgusting/questionable moral value), but he was also showing us a little more heart and a little less psychotic behavior with this one. So he may have been doing this to bring more women and children into the theater? The fact is he is CAPABLE of doing it (which I sincerely doubted before this came out) and that should be worth a few points.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dangerously Bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written by a first-timer with Adam and his former room mate, Sandler portrays a 30-year-old going on 13 who cannot utter a line that isn't either idiotic, rude or obnoxious. That is precisely why his "romance" scenes are absurd: why would ANY woman be interested in in this loser? The plot centers on him reluctantly adopting a young boy. He then proves to be the worst father image that I've ever seen in film. He terribly neglects him to get him out of his hair, by allowing him to do ANYTHING he wants. Sandler rewards the boy's anti-social and sometimes cruel behavior by laughing and considering it "cool". He creates a direct path to the slammer for this child. This movie sets one of the worst examples to both children and parents. Children will want to be able to have the freedoms the boy had and under-educated, low-income and lazy parents will want to let their kids "do their own thing" like Sandler did. There is no protagonist. It's phoney sentimentality is nauseating. It is also a downer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The lines are clearly drawn on the topic of Adam Sandler. The critics stand almost unanimous in hatred, while the fans continuously sing his praises at the box office. And that line is perhaps the most clear on this movie, Big Daddy, which got Sandler some of his highest ratings at the box office, and at the same time some of his most negative reviews.The critics are missing the point. Adam Sandler is not a great actor, because he's not required to be. He's found his niche doing likable little sophomoric comedies that, for the open minded, are often quite funny. Unfortunately, with Big Daddy, he falls somewhere in the middle.Adam Sandler plays Adam Sandler playing Sonny Koufax, who is essentially a 30 year old 15 year old. Coasting through life on the money he made in a court settlement, Sonny is living the high life. That is, until his girlfriend of several years begins cheating on him with a much older man. But, as luck would have it, an answer is provided in the form of Julian, the young son of his roommate, who mysteriously shows up on Sonny's doorstep.Thinking that he can prove his maturity by caring for the boy, Sonny becomes an unlikely father figure to the boy. Predictable Sandler-esque plot twists ensue. Anyone who is familiar with movies will be able to predict how it will end up. But you get some laughs along the way, and that's all Sandler is trying to do. It's neither his best or his worst film, but it is worth a look. (**1/2/****)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What more can you ask of a film, than beautiful ladies, comedy to make you burst, a killer sound track, good solid acting (especially from Dylan and Cole Sprouse) and a genuinely nice story. I was sceptical when this film 1st came out but after watching it, you can tell it was going to be a brilliant film. The film starts of too slow probably it's only flaw. But the comedy is typical Adam Sandler (especially his use of ridiculous voices. [see The Wedding Singer]). The best scene by a mile is when Sonny is teaching Julian (and Nazo) how to spell ["Hip, Hip Hop, Hip Hop Amamoose"]. Another excellent scene is when Julian is copying everything Sonny says ["How much wood can a wood chuck chuck if a wood chuck could chuck wood?"]</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS]Adam Sandler is Sonny Koufax, a 30-year-old goofball living in New York. His girlfriend, Vanessa, doesn't think much of him.He tries to impress her, but nothing works. His roommate, Kevin Gerrity had to go away on business in China one day, and right after, a 5-year- old boy showed up on Sonny's doorstep. According to a note, it was Kevin's kid. Sonny decides to take care of the kid for a while, after all, how hard could it be? He soon finds out. The kid, Julian, immediately starts throwing up and peeing every couple of minutes. One of the scenes I like is when they try to be in time for McDonald's breakfast, but were 30 minutes late. It's really funny.Sonny decides to show Julian to Vanessa to show he's responsible. But she got a new beau. A middle aged one. So Sonny continues to raise Julian. He wanted his name changed to Frankenstein and wanted to go to school, while Sonny went out with his new girlfriend, Layla. Pretty soon, the teacher informs Sonny of Julian's poor conduct, as well as displays of lude behavior Sonny taught him, so Sonny immediately begins teaching Julian proper ettiquette. But before long, head of Social Services, Arthur Brooks, discovers that Sonny Koufax had fraudently called himself Kevin Gerrity to get Julian which was a big offense. Sonny had to do something, so he pooled his friends together, including Layla and Kevin, and went to court. He even invites his own father who thinks Sonny's a moron, but Sonny convinces even him that he is responsible enough to take care of a kid. Unfortunately he doesn't convince the judge, who gives custody to the real Kevin Gerrity. Though it didn't turn out the way they would've liked, our story still has a happyending. Some familiar faces: Josh Mostel, who plays Arthur Brooks, played Principal Max Anderson in Billy Madison. Steve Buscemi who plays the homeless guy, played Danny McGrath in Billy Madison, and also stars in Little Nicky and Mr. Deeds. Tim Herlihy, Sandler's friend and co-writer, plays the giant kangaroo. I recommend this movie! The Wedding Singer wasn't as good, neither was The Waterboy, but this is a pretty damn good Adam Sandler movie! You gotta check it out! I recommend it!-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Adam Sadler, he is so funny at times and then he is so professional. This is one of those films where he is serious and funny at the same time. I love the way he plays such an irresponsible 30 year old, who wants to live a college life all his life.Than suddenly he must become a father after he adopts a kid(his roommates son, he didn't know about) thinking that would help his relationship with his girlfriend (Kristy Swanson).I'm sure everyone knows about the movie. I want to comment on the DVD, I have both the DVD and VHS versions and I think this DVD is great, of course they could've added a cut-scene section. What I like most about the DVD are the music videos one is " WHEN I GROW UP" by Garbage and a remake of Guns' N' Roses' " SWEET CHILD O' MINE" by Sherryl Crow. So in closing get this DVD and if the DVD makers decide to make a better version I'll bye it. 4 OUT OF 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In "Big Daddy" Adam Sandler plays a slacker who adopts a child to impress his girlfriend. When this doesn't work he tries to give the kid up, and that's whent this movie becomes more then just a lazy, stupid Adam Sandler movie.I'm not saying this is the best of movies, but the stupid messed up character he played in such movies as "Happy Gilmore" and "The Waterboy" isn't felt as much in this movie. Instead he replaces it with a slacker that only cares about himself. He adopts a little boy and the result is funny, as his lazy slacker tries to take care of the kid. The movie has many entertaining moments but has some dark moments too. When they try taking the kid away from Sonny, it folds into a family court case that gets a little sappy. Overall I reccomend this fim due to the brilliant but crude humor that makes it funny. Sandler doesn't have to play stupid to be funny, overall, and he has help from Cole and Dylan Sprouse (the cute twins who play the boy), plus friends such as Jon Stewart and Rob Schneider. He also has a small romantic affair with a woman (Joely Lauren Adams) that doesn't play a big part in the film, which is good because the plot doesn't need it anyway, even though Adams is entertaining in the part.Overall Score: 4 out of 5 stars or B (in an A through F scale)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I know that in my other reviews, I've classified some movies as my all time favorite, but this is the ultimate truth. Big Daddy is in a three-way tie for first place of my favorite movies along with Young Guns and Silent Rage. Adam Sandler plays a lazy lowlife who adopts a kid illegally by portraying as his roommate, to try and get his girlfriend back. Well, his girlfriend leaves him for an older man and Adam Sandler has to take care of the kid, which he grows to love. Even though this movie isn't what you really expect from an Adam Sandler movie, which is basically laughs 24-7, it was an awesome movie. Rob Schneider had a funny role as an uneducated delivery guy and Leslie Mann as the 'Hooters' chick whom basically is made fun of. The soundtrack to this movie is awesome too, although I'm not in it for bands like Limp Bizkit, their song was one of the best. A good movie overall!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An "Adam" bomb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If movies were bombs, BIG DADDY could take out Hiroshima. The plot seems almost schizophrenic, as we are invited to cluck our tongues in disapproval as Sonny makes an idiot of himself and then urged to root for him in the movie's God-awful courtroom climax. It doesn't work, and ultimately neither does the film. Sonny's not an underdog; he's just a plain dog - period.I really have nothing against Adam Sandler. When it comes to classic comedy, he is a precious diamond in the rough. His aw-shucks, Simple Simon shtick - a marriage of Jimmy Stewart and Forrest Gump with a dash of Jim Carrey thrown in - never fails to endear him to audiences. When he really turns on the charm (as he did as the sweetly naive Southern buffoon Bobby Boucher in THE WATERBOY), he can do no wrong. But there is another Adam, and this one is as horrid a counterpart as Mr. Hyde was to Dr. Jekyll. I'm talking about the anguished man-child of HAPPY GILMORE, the painfully scarred soul so full of self-loathing that he has to punch out innocent bystanders and spew sewer language to bolster his fragile ego. That's not funny, but incredibly sad. If we laugh at such rampages, it is only due the comfort we take in knowing that it's just an act.Sandler, fortunately, doesn't resort to a lot of that here. Instead, he wants us to view him as a prototypical merry prankster who just can't contain his chaotic id every once in a while. That's fine and good, but you have to question the innocence of Sonny's dalliances when there is a five-year-old boy present. And since prepubescent children can be as mimetic by nature as circus monkeys, the image of young Julian as a Sonny-reared adult poses a fascinating quandary: how much good-intentioned permissiveness is too much when raising a kid? If you let some little boy call himself "Frankenstein," order thirty packets of ketchup for lunch, pee on the side of a building, and hock loogies in public - will he still be able to get a date for the prom when he's eighteen?Urged on by Sonny's erratic role-modeling, Julian shuttles back and forth incongruously between apple-cheeked munchkin and overly precocious demon child. For some reason, we're supposed to find that hilarious; it is, but only because of the banality of it all. It just doesn't seem right for the twins who played Julian to get in front of the camera and humiliate themselves just so a bunch of grown-ups can make oodles of dough.There are, to be sure, plenty of chuckles to be found in BIG DADDY. Most of them, however, are tinged with the irony of our awareness that in real life such events wouldn't be quite so amusing. Not that the talented cast doesn't give it 110 percent, though. As Sonny's girlfriend, Joey Lauren Adams does a decent job of salvaging the comedy through sheer earnestness - this despite the fact that she's got that gratingly breathy voice that suggests a permanently crushed larynx. Rob Schneider strives valiantly to make us smile with his dopey immigrant character, but in the end he just contributes to the movie's smarmy attitude. The always-welcome Jon Stewart shows up for a spell, though he isn't given the opportunity to really let loose with the withering quips like he does on Comedy Central's "The Daily Show." And it's a great pity indeed that the mesmerizing Kristy Swanson is here reduced to such a faceless character with a one-joke role. Her remarkable animal magnetism alone would have done much to redeem this comedy from cinematic hell.</fullReview>

I thought Corrine (Leslie Mann) and Vanessa (Kristy Swanson) were VERY snobby. This was because they didn't treat Sonny with a whole lot of respect most of the time. In addition, I thought that Julian (Cole Sprouse, Dylan Sprouse) was a REALLY cute kid. The thing about BIG DADDY that grossed me out were the messes that Julian made -- Especially when he threw up after bouncing around a little bit while he had "The Kangaroo Song" on. To me, Layla (Joey Lauren Adams) was a REALLY nice, smart, and pretty woman. In conclusion, I recommend this smash hit to all you Adam Sandler fans who haven't seen it. When you see it, prepare for lots of laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adam Sandler is without a doubt one of the funniest comedians/actors around. He can make a relatively dull storyline into a really amusing film with his unique humour. The more of his films you watch the more you can appreciate his humour and his collection of "actor buddies", i.e. Rob Schneider, Allen Covert.I have watched Big Daddy many times and it just gets better. Sandler continually shows his comic genius and you can tell that his co-stars enjoy working with him.

		<shortDescription>Adam Sandler meets Charlie Chaplin. "Huh?" You ask. Read on ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Around 80 years ago, Charlie Chaplin brought us "Six Reels of Joy" with a feature-length film called "The Kid". It featured Jackie Coogan, Jr., who would eventually grow up to be Uncle Fester in "The Addams Family.This film is basically a modernization of that film from way back when and here are the similarities: A "Ne'er-do-well"'s mundane life is interrupted by the arrival of a kid who needs a home. Although he's not what most people have in mind as a father-figure, he takes him and raises him as well as he can. Together they get into much mischief and misbehavior. The Ne'er-Do-Well tries not to become too emotionally attached, but finds out just how much he already IS attached when the authorities take the kid away. And the Ne'er-Do-Well does anything he possibly can to keep him.Now, don't get the wrong idea; I'm not hyping "Big Daddy" and saying it's as good as Chaplin's version, but I DID enjoy the film. And, even though the courtroom scene was unrealistic, well, A) It's just a movie, and B) It's a Comedy Movie.As far as bad influences are concerned (whizzing on the walls, tripping rollerbladers, and swearing), well what about how The Little Tramp kept himself and "the kid" fed (the kid throws rocks at people's windows and breaks them, and instantly Charlie sells them new windows)?Oh well, I enjoyed this film. And, by the way, in mention of Charlie Chaplin, I need to correct an error on my comment for the movie "Chaplin". I wrote it on the day after his 112TH Birthday, not the 119th.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Big Daddy must have been one of the worst movies of 1999. The only watchable movie that I think Adam Sandler has made was probably 'The Wedding Singer.' So it was no suprise to me when this movie was horrible. The story line has been done so many times before. Adam should stay away from drama completely and stick to only 'comedy,' because this was an extremely weak attempt. The little boy in this movie is adorable. He can't act...but hey...who needs acting talents when they have a pretty face? Joey Lauren Adams was good in this movie, with the little she had to work with anyway. Leslie Mann is a fairly good actress...but the whole hooters thing...please. This movie was funny at all. I didn't even find myself chuckling at any point of the movie. What was there to laugh at? A little 6 year old cussing? Yeah...that's good. Just doing his part towards the deconstruction of America. Or a little boy peeing on a wall? Oh yeah, that's even better! Or how about we laugh at a guy falling down on his roller blades, Adam harassing a little black boy about alcohol, or some really lame hooters jokes. If you usually like Adam Sandler's slapstick stupidity, then you will probably like this movie. If you like intelligent movies with a plot and original ideas...then avoid this movie at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is very good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Big Daddy is one of Adam Sandler's best movies. It's very funny without getting too silly &amp; stupid!! This is a very cool movie about a guy who has no idea about how to raise a kid. If you like Adam Sandler being stupid, then you might want to skip this one, but is you want to see him do a pretty cool movie as a normal person and still be funny, then go see this now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable, but annoying and repetitive.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Big Daddy isn't a great film, it isn't totally bad. It is actually a vehicle for Sandler, which makes it enjoyable and witty, but somewhat annoying and repetitive.Here's how the pertinent details bolt to formula this time around: professional layabout Sonny (Adam Sandler) has reached the age of 32 without getting married or using his law school degree. In an ill-judged effort to impress his departing girlfriend, Vanessa (Kristy Swanson), Sonny reaches an agreement with his flatmate, Kevin (Jon Stewart), to take custody of his illegitimate five-year-old son, Julian (played jointly by twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse). The (new) girl is snowed-under attorney, Layla (Joey Lauren Adams). The lesson is taking responsibility for one's actions and in this case, that means Julian's childhood.Big Daddy is probably one of Sandler's mistakes, it is his worst film apart from The Waterboy, but, weirdly, that doesn't stop it from being most enjoyable. The biggest flaws are that the story rushes far too quickly, therefore you don't care for any of the characters, and the camera-work is shoddy, but if you can ignore those things, you'll have a pretty good time.Sandler fans, drive right in, other critics, just be cautious.I rate Big Daddy 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm one of the few people I know that actually thinks Sandler is funny. And Sandler didn't let me down - the movie is funny. SPOILER: But, the last 15 minutes spoiled the entire movie. Let's just say I couldn't wait for the credits to come up. Why you ask? That typical American plot where the hero wins his loved one by pouring out his soul to them in front of total strangers. Shame. But - overall it was really good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adam Sandler plays his good ol' self again, nothing we haven't seen before. Personally I don't even like him that much but I won't attack him here 'cause I don't hate him either I simply don't think he's funny. This film got a few light laughs out of me (you know the kind where you laugh for a second, mostly because the laugh is triggered from hearing other people laughing). It got a few smiles out of me (you know when something is funny and gets you to smile but doesn't quite get you to laugh). But that's about it. Nothing hysterical (my favorite comedy movies being Airplane! and most things Steve Martin). Adam plays a guy who works as a toll-booth operator once a week, yet still affords an apartment the size of a football stadium. One day a kid shows up on his doorstep, it is his room-mates kid, but the room-mate is on his way to China ("Which is in Asia, which is by Europe"). Adam adopts the kiddo and a bond is formed. Adam's sense of humor is not for all people, if for some reason you find peeing on restaurant walls and tripping innocent skaters in the park funny then this movie is for you. The laughs I got were triggered not from Sandlar's character but from the others, especially the brilliant performance by the Sprouse twins (who should have been credited right after Sandlar but you know how Hollywood hates crediting kids first, even though sometimes they are so much better then the adults, then again sometimes they are unbearable, in this movie's case it is the first). Bored? Got nothing to do? Big Daddy is on in half an hour? See it. Bored? Got friends? They're available? See them.</fullReview>

The character, who played by Adam Sandler think that he can impress his girlfriend by doing so. After going through several hardship and burden, he met this girl who is the sister of his friend.

		<shortDescription>Great, Adam at his best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have saw every Sandler movie so far, even the movies in the beggining that were somewhat hard to stomach (Going Overboard, Shakes the Clown), and as his movie career progresses, unlike many actors, instead of getting worse and worse with Adam it gets better and better, as soon as I saw Happy Gilmore for the first time I knew this guy would make it big. Okay, so the plot of big Daddy is a guy who went to school took law has enough education to be a good paid lawyer but just wants to take it easy so he has a job on the weekends at a toll both. His girlfriend tells him he needs responsibility in his life so shortly after that a kid shows up at his doorstep. His roomates kid though his roomate has no knowledge it is his. So he calls social services and keeps the kid, in the beginning he is a bad influence on Julian, but at midpoint he goes to school and Julians teacher talks to Sonny and he says "I've let my kid become the smelly kid in class? What's wrong with me!!! So From then on Sonny becomes a great role model for Julian cleans him up and helps him learn. This movie has I believe the saddest end to a comedy I've ever seen, a comedy with a plot which is rare but when found is a very good thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, I thought Big Daddy was cute and funny, but it doesn't really qualify as a brilliant film. Although it is a great flick for Adam Sandler fans, I don't think it should be considered one of the best movies ever, because it is something we have all seen before, a stupid Sandler takes on something without doesn't know what he's doing.

		<fullReview>Adam Sandler is finally in a movie that is easy to enjoy and not just plain stupid. The Waterboy was a horrible movie and why it was declared so funny is beyond me! Big Daddy is a funny and sad story. It also introduces the amazing talents of Cole and Dylan Sprouse, who play the kid that Adam adopts in the movie. Full of remarks that are mean but very funny to watch, Big Daddy delivers a better comedy plotline than "Happy Gilmore". Funny performances are also given by Rob Schneider who plays the delivery man of a restaurant that Sandler always orders from. Let's just not give the movie credit for adding drama to this humourous film. Joey Lauren Adams plays Sandler's girlfriend and the romance going on between Sandler and Adams is greatly displayed even though I think that they got serious with each other a little more quickly than is realistic. If you're tired of watching corny comedy movies that fail to be funny, Big Daddy will surely please you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ladies and Gentlemen, the new Adam Sandler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BIG DADDY seems the ideal vehicle for Adam Sandler to follow his breakthrough hit THE WEDDING SINGER. He probably would have preferred to sit out THE WATERBOY completely, but it made $150 million and the juggernaut rolled on.BIG DADDY is an awkward mix of the ?chick flick' and the Adam Sandler blueprint. It tries to follow both models simultaneously, and isn't half as funny as it should be. If it were, Sandler would be sending up the syrupy storyline, rather than sending it out.That is the film's Achilles heel. It plays more like a sellout than a subtle change of direction. While the pairing of the star and a ten year-old kid is an apt match, this is the NEW Adam Sandler, who thinks we're supposed to cry as much as we laugh. I nearly cried, for all the times I should have been laughing.It worked before. There has never been a more charming formula film than THE WEDDING SINGER, Sandler's finest film to date. But simple as the set-up is here, the filmmakers conspire to derail it. They so desperately want us to care, they subject us to the most laboured resolution a comedy can stoop to - the courtroom climax.Happiness - rather than satisfaction - equals value for money in the blockbuster stakes. BIG DADDY is quite funny. It is pleasant. But it wants to have its cake and eat it too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not ashamed to admit (well maybe a little ashamed) that I am an Adam Sandler fan. I've sat through them all-Happy Gilmore, The Waterboy, Airheads, The Wedding Singer and now this. The plot is fairly basic if not improbable. He plays a layabout loser who shares a flat with Jon Stewart (The Faculty) and one day after his girlefriend leaves him for an older man he decides to 'get responsible'. It just so happens that a young boy is delivered to his flat and this is where the fun begins. At some point in this movie you are left wondering if it is the boy looking after Sandler or Sandler looking after the boy but that all adds to the fun. There are plenty of laughs but they are mostly due to a supporting cast which includes Steve Buscemi (Airheads), Joey Lauren Adams (Chasing Amy) and the boy who is played by the Sprouse twins. Mind challenging it is not, funny it is, I just hope that Sandler soon changes his character before he becomes type cast as that lovable loser forever. Rating = 3/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone on here is saying "it was made for kids, judge it like that, etc." Well guess what? I'm 15 years old. And I hated this movie. Not as much as Armageddon (I don't think I hate ANYTHING as much as Armageddon) but it's pretty high up there.I'll admit, Happy Gilmore was kinda funny, but every other movie Adam Sandler touches is pure comedic poison. Here, I'll sum up every Sandler movie: Adam yells. Adam beats up people for no reason. Adam acts like a total retard. Adam speaks in "funny" (not really) voices. Idiots in movie theaters laugh. Adam rakes in $500 kajillion. Adam continues making crappy movies. Repeat ad infinitum. Why he continues to be so successful I don't know. But hey, in a world where Tom Green is considered funny (pfft, yeah right, about as funny as the holocaust) what more can you expect? I like crude humor as much as the next guy (I loved There's Something About Mary) but only when it's FUNNY.Every Adam Sandler movie has a premise of sorts. They figure "hey, let's put Adam Sandler in a fun, wacky and zany situation! We'll have 'em lined up around the block!" This time it's "Adam adopts a kid" Ho ho. My sides are splitting already, let me tell you!Adam is a law school graduate (the funniest thing about the movie. Adam Sandler as a LAWYER???? Bwahahahahaha...) who holds a toll booth job seemingly once a week, and yet can somehow afford to live in a gigantic New York apartment. One day a kid shows up at his door. He decides to adopt him (surprise surprise) and teaches him how to be an antisocial violent sociopathic moron who will probably end up in rehab by the time he's 10. See what a great parent he makes?We're supposed to laugh at him teaching the kid to throw sticks in front of rollerbladers. We're supposed to laugh at them peeing on the side of a building. We're supposed to laugh at Adam threatening a guy into handing over a ton of candy. Oh, and I forgot the most rip-roaringly funny scene of all: Adam insulting his ex-girlfriend's older lover, commenting on his "old balls". Is that supposed to be funny? Oh, it is? Oh. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Please excuse me while I collect myself after laughing myself silly.As can be expected, there's a "crisis" when the kid is going to be taken away. We're supposed to be sad about this; I consider it a cause for celebration. We're soon subjected to all sorts of sentimental "awwwwwwww" scenes that give Full House a run for its money. Break out the puke buckets - this one's a doozy.There is exactly one funny sequence in the entire movie: the little kangaroo dance video. It perfectly sums up all those godawful kids videos out there, and it got some genuine laughs out of me. Then the kid pukes and ruins the whole scene. I also thought Adam getting hit by a car was funny, but only because watching him get hurt is always nice to see. Like he said himself, why couldn't the guy just kill him? But that's better than Billy Madison's 0 funny scenes, when you're forced to stare at the screen mouth agawk, mind burning out at the sheer stupidity of it all and realizing that 90 minutes of blank film would be a laugh riot compared to it.Oh, and Steve Buscemi's in this movie. Why Steve, why? You make Fargo, Tree's Lounge, Reservoir Dogs, tons of other great movies...then you make Armageddon and three Adam Sandler movies. I guess we've all got bills to pay...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Sandler Film Yet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adam Sandler is very well known for his comedy and that talent has put him the top spot in box office gross. The box office buzz started when he made a football comedy called The Waterboy which surprised a lot of critics for its success in the box office making it over 100 million dollars. Sure The Wedding Singer became a box office hit too but it did nothing like The Waterboy and Sandler did it again with Big Daddy. A movie in my opinion is the best film Adam Sandler has ever made. It's well acted and well directed and has a lot of touching moments.(unlike other Sandler films) Actually the best part of the whole film is when Sandler crys. I'm not saying that because its touching but its surprising because whoever thought of Adam crying in a movie. Big Surprise!!! But he isn't the only star of the film. The littler kid, which is played by twins, make this movie work too. Also stars like Jon Stewret, Rob Schinder and Joey Lauen Adams. Great film for the whole family!!! Even if you don't like Adam Sandler.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Made little sense, but if you like cute ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Big Daddy has one or two moments, but mostly it is a movie that stuns you with its lack of believability, which is the price tag for an overemphasis on cuteness.I enjoyed Adam Sandler's Happy Gilmore, and The Waterboy. Both of those movies, while silly, had at their cores at least a possibility that these events *could* happen, if all the right pieces were in place. Big Daddy not only lacked that quality, but it left you *praying* that our adoption system isn't so bad that it would allow a child to be essentially given to a new parent with so little regard to the child. It also left you pondering the many answerless events that occurred, such as:- How does Sandler's character afford such a big spread in the city? $200,000 doesn't go that far in NY. - Why would Layla fall for such an obvious player's ruse, and then not see his total lack of ambition or positive qualities? - How does Layla's sister come around so quickly? - Does the adoption system really send kids to stranger's houses with a note, and then accept confirmation over the phone? - Can a main character so clueless analyze his father so accurately, through his anger over their relationship (and apparent lack of understanding of it through the years)? - Do "Scuba Steve" costumes grow on trees in the hallway?The biggest flaw was that Big Daddy left you hoping the child would find a new parent soon, because you knew that this was not a good situation for either the child or the adult (Sandler's character). This greatly reduced the laughs, as the viewer felt more concern than empathy for the poor kid. Just when you thought like you had seen enough bad parenting, the film tried to yank you back into its embrace by providing an, "Ohhhh, that's cute" moment. I found that practice insulting.Ultimately, I know three women (including my wife) who saw Big Daddy and all of them liked it. I can only assume the Cuteness Factor overcame their misgivings. I can suspend my belief as well as the next guy, but it helps to have characters and a plot that looks like they and it are going somewhere... and when they get there, it also helps that it makes any kind of sense.I gave Big Daddy a 5, and that's probably generous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweetie hooks a big daddy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie follows the homeless and unwanted Julian (acted by the twins Cole &amp; Dylan Sprouse) as he trys to find a dad. The target of his affection is Sonny (Adam Sandler) who acts and lives as if he was a 12 year old boy himself.Needless to say, movies like this have happy and predictable endings. The fun is in getting there, in seeing Sonny who initially rejects taking in Julian turn into a father in the end. With many hilarious adventures along the way, most based on bathroom humour.The twins have that waif look so necessary for movies on this theme. Blonde, with big eyes, and ears that stick out, Julian is the boy to open the hardest heart. Who could resist such an attractive waif? Who wouldn't wish him success in finding a dad?The girls certainly can't. For Adam discovers that girls like men who are fathers, and they like the little kid too. Julian helps Adam to win his girl, so finding himself a dad and a mom.Three comparable movies come to mind. Similar themes, of a homeless and unwanted child finding a dad, but all treated in a more serious fashion. None of them are comedies like Big Daddy, though they all have comic moments.In 1934, "Bright Eyes" starred Shirley Temple as Shirley, the little orphan girl. Shirley loses her mother to a car accident, and her father to an aeroplane crash. Her father's best friend, Loop Merritt (James Dunn, who was almost as famous an actor as Shirley Temple) becomes her new dad. Like Sonny, he starts out reluctantly in the dad role, and becomes converted to this position.In 1980, "The Earthling" starred Ricky Schroder as Shawn, the 10 year old boy orphaned by a crash of his family's motorhome in the Australian bush. He is found by Patrick Foley (William Holden, in one of his best roles), who is fatally ill and not looking for a companion. Neither does Shawn particularly want a father, but he needs someone to look after him in the wilderness. See the two warm to each other, ending in a dad-son relationship.In 1998, "Goodnight Mister Tom" starred Nick Robinson as Willie, and John Thaw as Tom Oakley. Willie is evacuated from wartime London to Tom's village, and billeted with the crotchety old man. Willie's mom is killed during the Blitz. The two develop a trust in each other, and recognize the benefit of a love between them. Each fills a need in the other's life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film does not start off that well, but when you get into it, you realize that its actually not that bad. Adam Sandler again portrays a character who is sweet, misunderstood and irresponsible- fairly similar to his character in The Wedding Singer, and it works well. There are a couple of things which could be deemed as politically incorrect in todays world, but this is a comedy, its not supposed to be taken seriously. Dylan and Cole Sprouse are excellent as the adopted kid, even though the character can be a little annoying at times. Unfortunately the female cast have very little to do, Joey Lauren Adams is pretty much wasted in her role which is a shame, after making such a big impression a couple of years ago in Chasing Amy. In some ways I was expecting this to be a little better than it was, but there were still some scenes which really did surprise me. However, it did seem that too much time was focused on Adam Sandler, instead of allowing the supporting characters to develop a little more. Probably worth a look, but you have to be in the mood for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to like this movie, because I generally enjoy Sandler's silly brand of humor. But this movie is just not up to his normal standards -- I am sure it's the fault of the screenplay, but it just doesn't deliver. And the movie seems to really have to try to make it to the normal hour and a half length.Skip it unless you like to be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thinking about it now it is hard to say whether this was a good movie or not. I certainly didn't laugh as much as I did at Waterboy or Happy Gilmore, but still it was pretty funny. It surprisingly had some touching moments in it. It also had moments that made no sense at all, like the fact that the real dad is gone the whole movie and just shows up at the end like nothing was wrong. Well all in all it was worth the 3.56 it cost to rent it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always enjoyed watching Adam Sandler movies. I thought it couldn't get any better than "Happy Gilmore", but Sandler proves that it CAN be done.This comedy has it al: many laughs, enjoyable to watch and a touching end.It is difficult to recommend comedies to someone, but I highly recommend this movie to people who also enjoyed "Happy Gilmore". The delivery guy is played by Rob Schneider who also plays in my favorite tv-series "Man Behaving Badly" aka "It's a Man's World".You can easily watch this movie 20 times.Rating: 7,5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie very much. Although it was not as funny as most Sandler movies it was just an overall fun movie to watch. The kid in this movie is absoluetly adorable and it was great watching Adam and this boy play pranks on everyone. It had a smooth plot, convincing actors, interesting characters and not to mention the hot girls in this movie. The only complaints I had were that the movie was a little short, and there was the lack of the usual Adam Sandler Ludicrousy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big film with some big laughs!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From a psychotic golfer to a lunatic waterboy-cum-american football player via a wedding singer in the 1980s and a grown man back at school, Adam Sandler still manages to portray the same sort of character in Big Daddy. He is still the same loveable character with some form of repressive behaviour. This time around, he plays Sonny Koufax, a law graduate who works as a gate toll man at a car park one day a week. For the rest of his time, he seems to sleep...big time!! That is until, by a twist of fate, he is lumbered with the job of looking after the son of his friend, Kevin(who doesn't know he has a son and is out of the country). Cue much mirth as father figure and son bond. Check out Sonny's attitude to spillages and the constant ribbing of his friend, Corinne for working at a particular type of bar while she was at medical school. The twin boys who played Julian managed throughout the film to be cute rather than sickly sweet and just downright irritating. The child's crying did get annoying from time to time but that only shows why Sonny always got annoyed too. Adam Sandler manages to deliver one of his better performances (but that really isn't a compliment after "The Waterboy") and manages to portray a man who falls in love with a child quite well. Joey Lauren Adams turns in a mediocre performance as the love interest. The twin boys are quite convincing , whilst the fabulous Steve Buscemi steals a slice of the limelight as a homeless guy. As a film, it should mostly please but be ready with the sick bucket in one of the most farfetched scenes of cinema in recent years when every man in the courtroom start declaring their love for their fathers. On the whole, though, most people shouldn't have a problem with it as Sandler's sparkling brand of comedy shines through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vehicle does not a movie make</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Am I missing something here? Are people actually going to movie after movie starring Adam Sandler in droves to see a good movie? Have I missed the boat somehow by skipping "Billy Madison", "Happy Gillmore", and "The Waterboy"?I can breathe sigh of relief. I now know why I missed those wonderful opportunities to see these and other Sandler movies; I saw them coming a mile away and steered clear to avoid wasting two hours of my life. Ah, yes, its all clear now. "Big Daddy" has shown me what I have been missing, and boy, it ain't much.Actually, I have witnessed the other movies listed above, belatedly, and that is why I feel qualified to say that Sandler has created his own niche of bad movies, a new genre. Call it Sandlerania, if you will. In any case, they all follow the same basic formula. His character starts out as a loser, an implausible event occurs that gives him a purpose, and he emerges victorious in the face of impossible odds. Usually there is at least one attractive woman lurking nearby, but not nearly as noticeable as the product placements that fill every scene."Big Daddy" continues this proud tradition with the story of Sonny Koufax, a loser who spends one day a week working as a tollbooth operator, and the rest of the time living off a large settlement he got from being hit by a car. His girlfriend wants him to move on with his life, maybe go back to law school, but Sonny is far too self-absorbed, and she walks out on him. This is the smartest thing anyone does in this movie.He shares a luxurious studio with his successful roommate but is dismayed to learn that he will soon be getting married. While his roommate takes off on a business trip, Sonny has a kid literally dropped onto his doorstep one day, with a note explaining that this is his roommate's son.He goes through the usual period of standoffishness, but quickly decides he sort of likes the kid, and with the hastiness of someone deciding to get a puppy, he arranges to adopt him as a way of proving to his ex that he really can be mature when he wants to be. Too bad she's already hooked up with a guy old enough to be her father (prompting a series of lame insults about getting old from Sonny), and Sonny finds himself stuck with the kid when he is astonished to learn that he can't just return him.The kid (named Kevin), a 6-year old played by Jon Stewart, isn't bad as kid performances go, but what's interesting is the way it was difficult to tell their personalities apart. Sonny has the mentality of a 6-year old, so they make a good pair. However, if cases like these are any indication, it is small wonder that the DYS has taken a lot of damage to its image lately. Sonny's favorite ways to spend time with Kevin involve tripping skaters in the park and showing off to his friends how he can "hock a loogie". Ho ho. When the kid needs to go to the bathroom, Sonny tries to use one in a stuffy upscale restaurant but is turned away by the maitre'd. He and the kid urinate on the front door instead. Ho ho, again. There is an extended scene when they go out for breakfast which plays like a drawn-out product placement for MacDonald's.I guess this is supposed to be funny, but I did not laugh once during "Big Daddy". I was too busy thinking about how screwed up this kid would be when he got older. In any case, Sonny meets a love interest, played by Joey Lauren Adams, who figures into the plot so meaninglessly that I wondered why they threw her in at all. It all comes down to that old standby, the courtroom scene, where Sonny argues for his right to adopt the kid. He argues that he has gone through a journey of self-discovery that has made him a better person. It is a waste of film to portray this, since 2 hours is exactly 1 hour and 59 minutes more time than it would take for someone with Sonny's depth of personality to complete this journey.The problem with Sandler's films is that they are too obviously written to be a vehicle for him. I do not argue that he can be a funny stand-up comic; his work on Saturday Night Live would support this. But he's too hit or miss to carry a whole movie by himself, and the writing is so contrived, with one obligatory scene after another, I just can't be compelled to care. I wouldn't mind seeing Sandler as a supporting character in a movie with some intelligence. And a lot fewer product placements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't like Sandler. I really don't. He is rude, looks like an escaped prisoner and is not really a terrific actor. The only reason why I visited this movie was... my girlfriend making me. Did I wasted 2 hours? No, not really. If you're planning on having a blast, forget about this movie, but if you're in for a good laugh,...We've seen this kind of story before : totally unprepared man has to take care of a child. Remember 'Kramer vs. Kramer' or more recently 'Look who's talking' This particular story is not a real showcase of a good solid scenario. The way the kid is brought into Sandlers life is hilariously rediculous (a thirteen-something kid gets a fiver for dropping of a 5 y/o orphan. Yeah, right) and the movie finale is a complete disaster (the one moment you're in court, the next you're on the street with the on-screen announcement that over a year has passed) where even the tearjerker-line gets totally abandonned.Nevertheless, it's worth going if you just want to relax and laugh, without having to concentrate too much. Also worthwile is Steve Buscemi as a homeless bum, the numerous remarks on Hooters (they must be big-time sponsors of this movie), and the Sprouse twins. Even someone with a completely frozen heart might melt from them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sandler plays Sonny Koufax, a law school graduate who's so lazy that he hasn't even bothered to take the bar exam and works one day a week as a tollbooth collector and lives on money as a result of a lawsuit he filed against a Taxi company for running over his foot a year ago. Irresponsible in his ways, he sees all his old law school buddies take on life as busy lawyers while he watches with indifference. He gets a big surprise one day when a kid shows up at his doorstep who is the son of his roommate/best friend (Jon Stewart), a lawyer out on a business trip. Sonny gets the idea to use the kid to impress his girlfriend. She leaves him and he's stuck with the kid and soon bonds with him. Occasionally, the boy helps Sandler out with dating an attractive lawyer (Joey Lauren Adams) who also is the sister of his roommate's fiance (Leslie Mann), a doctor who strongly dislikes Sonny. Trouble ensues for Sonny though when the welfare office catches onto him and a legal battle begins between Sonny and the welfare for custody of the child. Sandler is funny and proves he's got a lot more to him than one liners and bathroom jokes. Particularly funny performances include Rob Schneider as a short tempered immigrant delivery man and Steve Buscemi as a bum.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the movie Big Daddy, there were some good characters. Sonny, the main character was a person who society would call a "loser." He works as a toll collector in a tollbooth. The little boy Julian, who was orphaned somehow ended up in the hands of Sonny. The roles that these two actors had gave a lot of humor to this movie. Since the character was played by a little boy, it gave the audience a sense of sympathy for Sonny who was to take care of him. The movie wouldn't be the same if the Sonny was taking care of a teenager.  Also in the movie, the story line was good. The main story was mostly about a total loser of a guy being handed a 5 year old kid. He learns to love Julian. The story is interesting and new. This story was also humorous because two people from two different worlds try to live together. All in all, I liked this movie, because it was cute, had good characters, good story, and was funny.

		<shortDescription>From a teenagers point of view</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The comedy Big daddy was an awesome movie for the whole family to see. This Movie had it all, jokes, great acting, and action. Some of the more interesting parts were when the little boy wanders away from his Big Daddy (Adam Sandler), and also when the two of them get into trouble tripping people in the park. It was als interesting when Adam Sandler and th e little boy try to develop a relationship together.In the movie, Adam Sandler does a great job acting out his part. Even though the movie is not nearly as funny as som of Sandlers other movies, it is still really good.An example of adam's good acting skills is when the little boy and he are out at the park walking to Mc Donalds. In this part Adam is walking with the boy when the boy decides that he needs to go to the bathroom. The boy tells Adam that he needs to go to the bathroom and adam turns to the boy and tells him to go on the wall. This was very good acting because for a child to get up enough cuourage to go to the bathroom on the wall infront of strangers must have been difficult. In the movie, there are a reaw really cool action shots that take place. One of my favorite acting scenes is when Adam and the little boy are going trick or treating for the little boys first time.While trick or treating for the little boys first time. While trick or treating Adam and he boy were waiting at the door for a person to open but the guy sits there and ignors them.After waiting for a while Adam tells the boy to just wait out front of the guys' house and adam goes inside and hits the guy a few times and makes the man give Adams little kid all of the candy and food that the kid wanted.One of my other favorite scenes was wthe scene where adam and the boy are at the park having fun tripping people. The boy and adam team up and lay sticks accross the rollerblade trail and watch the rollerbladers trip over the strings onto there faces.The movie was a very good, and was a financial success. The action shots were very enjoyable. I believe taht this is a good movie for the whole family to go and see, i highly recomend it.written By: Justin, SAN RAMON HIGH STUDENT</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sandler Does It Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the heels of the Wedding Singer and the Waterboy, this is yet again another great Adam Sandler vehicle. This movie has one great ingredient: Sandler trying to take care of a kid. The chemistry between Sandler and the kid is great, even though you know Sandler is not father material you are kinda rooting for the two of them to stay together. It is this relationship that is at the very heart of this movie and makes you want to stick around to the very end to see what happens. Everything else in the movie is either icing on the cake or is unnecessary. In the icing on the cake category I would have to include Sandler's constant battles with his roommate's girlfriend ("Hooters!"), Rob Schneider's delivery guy character, and Sandler's relationship with his ex girlfriend ("Hey, Old Man River..."). In the unnecessary or lame category, Sandler's blossoming relationship with a new girl (I never liked this pairing) and SPOILER Coming... the courtroom scene at the end wasn't well done. A really good movie, which will entertain and delight all who watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Big Daddy - **Big Daddy is one of those films that is impervious to film criticism. Adam Sandler fans could not care less what the critics think of his films. And those who take film criticism seriously need not read a review of a Sandler film because the trailers alone make it clear the movie should be avoided. I have seen only one other Sandler flick, Happy Gilmore. This film and that one are about equal, I'd say.The plot goes a little something like this: Sandler plays Sonny Koufax, a lazy underachiever who lives off of a $200,000 legal settlement he received when a cab ran over his foot. One day, shortly after Sonny's roommate Kevin (Jon Stewart) leaves for a trip to China, a young boy appears at Sonny's door. The tyke, named Julian (and portrayed by Cole and Dylan Sprouse), is Kevin's illegitimate son. Apparently the mother is sick and wants Kevin to raise the lad. Sonny pretends to be Kevin, adopts the child, and presents this to his girlfriend Vanessa (Kristy Swanson) as evidence of his maturity. Vanessa dumps him anyway, and Sonny finds himself a single father unprepared for the duty.Much of the film depicts Sonny's unorthodox fathering style, which basically consists of letting the child do whatever he wants. He wears whatever he wants (including a cummerbund,) eats whatever he wants, and even urinates wherever he wants. To be honest, I found a lot of this material amusing. But I also found it to be repetitive, crude, and even sad in a way. Luckily, Sonny soon realizes that fathering is more than mere friendship. So he makes the kid shape up, do his homework, and relieve himself in the proper fashion. Just when things are going well, however, a courtroom finale rears its ugly head and Sonny must prove that he is fit to be a father.Adam Sandler may be a gifted comedian, but he is not a talented actor. He walks though this film as if in a drug-induced trance, barely ever showing a hint of emotion - or even consciousness. As Julian, the Sprouse twins are even less successful. Certainly they are cute, but they have no acting skill whatsoever. Whenever Julian is called upon to cry, for instance, the actor must turn his back to the camera. The courtroom scene which concludes the film is positively baffling. It lacks realism, insight, comedy, even coherence. And why the bizarre obsession with the Hooters restaurant chain? It is a running gag whose comedic value is questionable the first time it is used, much less the twentieth. Yet the movie is not a total loss. There is a certain charm in seeing a kid trying to raise a kid.</fullReview>

It's just used to be funny not mean spirited and they resolve the problem of the kid's violence problem. This is better then the Water Boy because Adam's character seems more real and the situation is more funny.

		<fullReview>Next to "The Waterboy", Adam Sandler's latest opus is extremely watchable. The story is ridiculous. However, individual scenes are cute and funny. Others are lump-in-the-throat sentimental. There is a little something for everyone as Sandler takes on the temporary parenting of his pal's son. The boy is five years old and is played by identical twins. There is some gross out visual humor for the teens. Sandler's romance with a young attorney is sweet and touching. This is no award winner, but you could do worse than spending an hour and a half with Adam Sandler as the titular "Big Daddy".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was a a great movie! It made me laugh and cry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Big Daddy was a really good movie! I enjoyed seeing a different side of Adam Sandler. This movie showed the more caring side of him that we really don't get to see much. The movie shows what I think he would really do if he had a kid. The best part was when Julian threw the stick in the way of the skater. It was great! At first, I thought the ending would be sad because I thought he was going to lose Julian, and never be able to see him again. That's when I cried. Than at the end, Sonny finally gets his life together and has a child of his own. If I could I would make everyone see this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as funny as "Happy Gilmore", not as heartwarming as "The Wedding Singer", but still a great film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say? I love Adam Sandler!I'm a big fan of all of his movies but I've noticed a bit of a declining trend in their quality lately. BILLY MADISON and HAPPY GILMORE are cult classics and really could never be expected to be beaten. They are Sandler at his best in my opinion. I also loved THE WEDDING SINGER which displayed Sandler's romantic side as well as a few laughs. To me, the WATERBOY was a bit of a disappointment and I expected BIG DADDY to be the same. However, I found BIG DADDY to be very enjoyable and I came out of the theater feeling good about it. It wasn't nothing great but it has proven its worth already by remaining in the top 5 movies in the nation for an entire month. This movie contained some depth that was lacking in Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore but that just might be what made it less funny. Sandler's films now contain more drama which may not be an entirely bad thing but they make the films more of a dramatic comedy than simply a comedy. I thouroughly enjoyed returning actors and actresses from past Sandler films who made their appearances in this movie. It was neat to see. For instance, the WATERBOY's mud dog quarterback and the WEDDING SINGER'S fonzy-like limo driver play a gay couple in this movie and Principal Adamson from BILLY MADISON is a social worker in BIG DADDY. All in all, it is a fun movie and above average from anyone but Sandler. I thought it could have been better coming from him but I still enjoyed myself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly more mature, just as funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adam Sandler has made his career playing goofball characters with little or no social skills, usually with good results. "Big Daddy" is almost the same. He plays a law graduate who would rather work in a toll booth one day a week and sleep away the rest of the time in his brothers apartment. One day a boy comes into his life (his brothers kid from an affair) and he sees it as an opportunity to get his girlfriend (the lovely Kristy Swanson) back.Chaos ensues after as Sandler adjusts to fatherhood, learning all the things you have to learn in parenting. Social services eventually finds out Sandler is not who he claims to be and removes the child from him. It is a surprisingly touching scene as the boy is taken, as well as another scene when Sandler attempts to regain custody at a court hearing.Most of the movie is typical Adam Sandler, with various bodily functions used as humor...but the bits with Joey Lauren Adams and his attempts to romance her have some true funny qualities without being "bathroom"."Big Daddy" is a very funny movie, the kind of fall on the floor funny movie we need more of. The slightly more serious turn from Sandler is mild enough that only real die hard fans of "Billy Madison" will notice any real difference.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TV Commercials Took all the Punch out of the Lines in this Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you saw the commercials for this movie, you saw this movie. It's the classic case of a movie preview spoiling the actual film. Poorly produced promotions either oversell the film, or show the best parts of the film so there's nothing new when you see it. This was the unfortunate case with "Big Daddy." The film consisted of nothing but cheesy lines... which strung together the funny parts... that we'd already seen on the commercials... so they weren't funny. Get it? Don't get me wrong, I think Adam Sandler is a funny guy, but this film just didn't work for me. Its a sugary sweet story with a kid... so what can you expect? Uh, yeah. That's exactly what you should expect. If you didn't see the commercials, and you like sappy movies with doughey eyed kids... you'll love it. Otherwise, don't waste your time or your money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the second Adam Sandler movie that I have seen ("HappyGilmore" was the first) and I must say that I am very favorably impressed! It's not that Adam Sandler is superbly skilled as an actor. It's what he did with the material in this movie that counted with me. This movie delivered more of what attracts me to any movie in the first place.It takes more than just amusing gags and sick, sarcastic humor tosatisfy me at the movies. I need substance. I need a reason for being there. "Big Daddy" made me laugh, but it also promoted a strongmessage of family value: namely, that strong familial relationshipsmatter, are important in this cynical, often crazy world we have created. Adam Sandler manages to deliver this important message in a '90s idiom without sounding preachy. If he continues to make movies like this one, he may prove to be a voice effectively bridging the gapbetween conservative "establishment" values and the more cynicalvalues of '90s liberalism."Big Daddy" is worth three stars out of four. Go see it!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No villain necessary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm writing primarily to defend this movie to those such as Blake French (fifteenth comment from the beginning) who cannot enjoy a movie without the presence of a greasy, evil antagonist mischievously twirling his moustache and laughing that you-better-watch-out-or-I'll-get-you laugh. Blake, for your information a movie's villain is not always such a character. A story can have several types of conflicts that need resolving, whether it be man vs. man, man vs. nature, man vs. himself, etc. In this movie, it was man vs. himself, man vs. his upbringing and man vs. the system. These created enough conflict without the help of a Tybalt. It was a touching movie with a lot of heart and an ending that let you know that everything had turned out for the best. Of course, there will always be those who want to see the oppressed daughter scream "NO mother, I won't marry Cal!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BIG fun and BIG excitement!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adam Sandler is one of my favorite actors of all time, and "Big Daddy" is the best heart warming comedy I've ever seen. In this movie, we see a much different side to the Great Mr. Sandler...the more tender side, but the former SNL icon never loses his humour! This is my second Adam Sandler movie by the way. The first one was 1998's "The Wedding Singer". Watching this movie, makes you look at Adam in a much different way: He's funny, he's dramatic, he's sweet, he's tough, he's a big kid, he loves to have fun! Seeing the smile on Cole and Dylan's (who both share the part as Julian) faces light up makes you feel that tender side to Adam Sandler! Plus no matter what event happens in this film, there is always something funny that comes in and takes over the dramatic stride to these events!!!"Big Daddy" is a comedy with heart warming excitement which makes you never want to leave the theater and something that the whole family could enjoy! Adam, Cole, Dylan, and the rest of the cast light up the big screen in "Big Daddy". And it all ends in a very surprising ending!!! A must see!!!! :o)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some good laughs, but,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently took my family to see Big Daddy and we enjoyed it and had some good laughs, as I expected we would. I was perturbed although, to have to explain to my children why the two men were kissing. As an aspiring screenwriter I'm instructed over and over again to include only what moves the story forward or reveals character. I found none of this in the sub plot of the 2 gay friends of the Adam Sandler character. Before everyone goes ballistic and labels me as intolerant or something, just check out the movie and see if I'm not right. I don't want to pay for a movie and have someone's agenda preached at me. Billy Wilder said, "I don't make them pay a buck and a half and then ram a lecture down their throats."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After a disappointing Waterboy, Sandler brings himself back up to par.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seemed to me that Sandler may have lost his touch. After Happy Gilmore, Sandler's movies started to go down hill. The Wedding Singer was a very good movie, but had little of the constant fratboy humor that Sandler is so good at. The Waterboy was awful and continued his fall from comedy prominence. Big Daddy is Sandler's funniest movie since Happy Gilmore and has proved that Sandler has not given up on the idea of making a good plot along with complete silliness. Sandler does a fine job in the movie and continues giving the audience all it can handle in laughter, but he still continues to do nothing but play himself. Joey Lauren Adams comes to the wide screen audience as a much more mature woman than her past roles in Chasing Amy and Biodome, but she is given little chance to shine and her part could have been played by anybody. As always, the guest appearances are great. John Stewart does a pleasant job, considering he must play a serious role. Rob Schneider shines as the delivery guy and basically does the best acting in the entire movie. If you were like me and spent much of the movie trying to figure out where you saw the "Hooters" girl from in your past, her name is Leslie Mann and she played Matthew Broderick's love interest in the Cable Guy. Overall, if you're a Sandler fan and have enjoyed his past work, this will please you. The story is well given and the movie keeps on a good pace. Like any other Sandler movie, the occasional "What the hell...." and strange ending are all there and you will be constantly laughing. Sadly though, Sandler has still been unable to catch the frat boy magic of Happy Gilmore or Billy Madison. I give it a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I generally like Adam's movies and can't wait for the next one to come out, this one was a big disappointment. It was way too cute to the point of almost being an afternoon soap opera with an occasional frat joke shoved in. Add a kid as the focal point of the movie, ala schwarzenegger in the last action hero, and you take the focus and purpose off of the main character. If the main character carries the movie, like most of his movies do, then the picture falls flat, as this one did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly touching, Sandler triumphs again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to Big Daddy expecting it to be funny, but I was very surprised at the way it evoked emotion. It reminded me strongly of The Wedding Singer, another movie that I didn't expect much of.The difference? Well, there's a lot of difference between the two, but the primary one was that this was driven by Sandler *alone,* while the Wedding Singer was driven a fair amount by Drew Barrymore's talent. Actually, there's a lot of difference - the types of jokes are completely different... Adam Sandler doesn't get to sing a song in this one. It's not a love-driven plot at all (except maybe his love for the kid he's taking care of).There are a lot of laughs in Big Daddy, and most of them are more sophisticated than the lowest-denominator puke and pee jokes. And while there are a couple gross cheap laughs, it's saved by the fact that the characters aren't just stupid people, like the Something About Mary cast or the Dumb and Dumber guys. Sonny Koufax (Sandler's character) may be working part-time at a toll booth and have a complete mess of an apartment, but he's got stock market investments and he knows all about law, he's just not motivated. Koufax is more of a rogue than a buffoon - he reminds me a bit of Randall in Clerks.The basic plot is that Koufax gets a kid delivered to him with a note saying that the kid is his roommate's son - the roommate, unfortunately, is out of town for a long while on business. In the meantime, Sonny could just hand the kid off to social services, but he decides to keep him to try to impress his girlfriend. When that doesn't work out, he ends up keeping the kid and taking care of him, and he grows to really love doing it.There were a couple of scenes that really didn't work for me, namely the scene where he talks to the kid's teacher (who screamed "overacting" and "one-dimensional" to me), and the court scene near the end - none of it made any sense. But in the end, they didn't get in the way very much of this charming and intelligent movie. This one will have staying power, too - it's not just a cheap laugh with no substance. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sandler Fools with Maturity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie, expecting nothing. Not that I don't find Adam Sandler funny. He was amazingly good in "Wedding Singer" and rescued "Waterboy" from mediocrity. It's just that I'd been so saturated with the trailers that I figured it would be a string of gags, with no purpose. Well, it's not. This is a well-rounded romantic comedy -- albeit on the same scale of profundity as "Notting Hill" -- that holds together well. Sandler is fine, inspired at times. But it's the lack of meanness, the good-humored tolerance of gays, the acceptance of alcoholics and street people, and the general positiveness of the plot that sets this apart from a lot of recent comedies. There are cheap laughs, but they are puke and bodily function jokes. I was pleasantly surprised. You will be too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong: I'm a 15 year old male that has two of Adam Sandler's CDs. Adam's Sandler's OKAY, but Jim Carrey could beat his humor anyday. What happened to the "Happy Gilmore" days, Sandler? I miss those.Most scenes in "Big Daddy" set up the jokes better than delivering the joke itself. Confused?For example: When Adam Sandler (excuse me, Sonny) rushes in to McDonald's for a last-minute breakfast and finds that breakfast is no longer served, I was expecting Sonny to do something extremely funny (like reach over the counter, grab the lady, and do whatever humanly possible to get that breakfast , chew out the manager, like in "Falling Down",etc.), he just yells and deflates the set-up of the joke.When the guy standing next to him remarks,"Nice parenting.", I was almost sure Sonny would throw the WHOLE tray and beat the crap out of him. Instead, just a brief scene of Sonny tossing his fries.And what a poorly constructed ending: too serious to be funny, too funny to be heartwarming.Want genuine Sandler laughs? Get one of his CDs.

		<fullReview>When going to an Adam Sandler movie, intelligence is not expected, at least in his characters. This time, intelligence isn't even shown in the writing. I know Sandler wanted to do a more touching comedy, but it can't succeed when you are supposed to be sad and the kid remarks, " but I wipe my own ass." It was cute sure, but for drama, it didn't work. The humor gets old, and if you've seen the trailer, you've seen 99% of the funny, or so-called funny, scenes. The multiple Hooters comments get really old, and they aren't clever in the first place. The film seemed unfullfilling. I don't know what I expected though from a film where Adam Sandler is a good father. I laughed minorly. The first half-utter crap. The second- mediocre. Sandler fans enjoy. Others, stay clear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although not your typical Adam Sandler movie, Big Daddy is great. It is extremely funny and has a well developed plot. This kid is dropped off at Sandler's door, it belongs to his roomate. This kids mother is dying, and has nowhere to go. Adam Sandler grows into having an affection for the kid and he pretends he is his roommate so he can keep him. When he is caught by the Social Services, he goes to court for custody of the child and is both pleased and disappointed by the outcome. Custody is awarded to his roommate, which is much better than him being put in a foster home. This is a great movie, it is funny and original. It is definitley a must see!!</fullReview>

I thought this was 100 times better than the terrible movie he made in November (THE WATERBOY), I didn't think it was funny at all. But this movie makes up for it.

		<fullReview>Remember Liar, Liar? It made a film like The Truman Show possible for Jim Carrey because it helped prove that he could pull off a serious role with dramatic weight and still be funny and continue to carry the humorous scenes that bridge the more 'straight' parts of the movie where the story moves forward. Sandler isn't a great actor, but this movie has depth, emotion, and credibility.

		<fullReview>I keep seeing comments about how Sandler has sold out on this movie. I have been watching Adam Sandler since "Going Overboard" and his humor and acting skills have grown with him. But, if you are going to see an Adam Sandler movie thinking it's going to be an Oscar caliber film, you are living in a bigger fantasy world than most of his characters. Adam Sandler's movies so far are done for one reason, to make people laugh. I go to his movies, he makes me laugh, and the relationship works that way. As long as he keeps making movies I'll keep going to see them. Well, at least as long as he can still make me laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3/4 of a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adam Sandler is growing up, and that looks to be good for us all. For the first time in his short leading man history, Adam Sandler has chosen a role in a movie that is not a comedy. Sure, by genre maybe, but not the in the traditonal sense.The beginning is slow, until the kid shows up. Honestly, without the cute twins playing the part of Julian, this probably would've fallen on it's face. But, the first act set the film up good. The second act showed a great dynamic, and a good theme of how important it is to be an adult (your basic Adam Sandler theme). Unfortunately, the film moves away from this theme in its resolution. Instead of making Sandler become an adult and finding what's really important in life (which they do to some extent but not enough), they change the resolution to the "happy ending" with the kid finding a home and all of his friends growing up.But ...Throughout the film, all of his friends are seen as the more responsible. Why is it such a shocker when the boy's actual father (Sandler's friend) takes custody of his boy? It's not. The ending becomes sappy and predictable. Something not characteristic of a Sandler film. The Wedding Singer has more heart, The Waterboy has a better joke, Happy Gilmore has a better plot, and Billy Madison is still the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A family film for drunken frat boys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm kind of unsure what target audience Adam Sandler is shooting for. This seems to be his attempt at a heartwarming family comedy: hence frequent urination jokes, a particularly chunky vomit scene, jokes about wiping one's ass and a nonstop parade of breast jokes. I hate to come off like a prude, which I'm not, but I'm getting really repulsed by these films that keep lowering the bar as to what is deemed acceptable fare for kids. You know that this film is going to attract many, many kids and will be accepted by most parents. But even ten years ago there would have been an outcry about this kind of material in such a film. Now - no big deal. That's a sad comment on all of us. The film itself is typical Adam Sandler except for the new and not altogether welcome element of schmaltz. Its too mediocre to get worked up over, I guess. Oh - Joey Lauren Adams is adorable with her chipmunk smile, but dare I say, perhaps not the world's most believable lawyer?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wonder how long it took to paste together the script for Big Daddy? Anything longer than a week would be shocking. Let's see, mix in a lot of peeing, gratuitous Hooters jokes, some vomit, a couple of loogie tricks, a contrived ending and we're almost done.Don't get me wrong, I usually like pee and vomit related humor - but it just didn't work for me in Big Daddy. One of the many problems was that almost every halfway decent scene was given away in a trailer (a tell-tale sign of a "lacking" story). Additionally (and sadly), the Steve Buscemi and Rob Schneider characters were utterly unfunny.Overall, I did chuckle a few times, but left the theater shaking my head and murmuring disparaging remarks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is incredible, it's a must see, it's funny and very touching. I've noticed that the critics hate it, but that's OK they are incapable of enjoying a movie - it's their job. This is one of the very few movies I have actually recommended for friends to see, I usually don't bother giving recommendations to people.The story, and the movie is really very simple. And when I left I felt kind of like this was a very "light" movie, and yet I enjoyed it immensely. Don't try to analyze it, just watch it and enjoy. Who cares if some of it is implausible (but possible) - a lot of it is for humor effect, and besides this is a movie to watch and enjoy, not to analyze.I also read some comments that keep referring to Adam Sandler - and comparing this movie with his earlier ones - that's a very stupid thing to do. Just watch this movie all by itself, don't force the movie to be the same as other ones you have seen, it's quite unique.Maybe critics hate movies so much because they keep comparing movies to others by the same actor(s) and asking why didn't they do this and why didn't they do that, which was in the other movie - very very very dumb. Why exactly should every movie have elements from every other movie an actor has made? Is being unique not allowed?And finally in closing, if you read the other comments - you will notice that every negative comment will attempt to analyze the film, and all the positive ones will just tell it was great go and watch, or other kinds of global generalizations (it was funny, the kid was cute, a nice message and a great story).So do that - watch it, don't analyze it.(OK OK, one analysis, the movie does a really great job in portraying the love that father and their sons can develop - read the credits at the end where they dedicate it to fathers who have put up with us.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adam Sandler Strikes back and better than ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fatherhood, it has its happy moments and very frustrating ones, especially for a goofball who is still a kid himself. That is what "Big Daddy" is all about, or maybe it's a how to guide on how not to raise a kid. Either way it has the right ingredients for a good comedy flick. Directed by Dennis Dugan (Who also directed Happy Gilmore) , "Big Daddy" is another winner on Adam Sandler's Part. He definitely outshines his last quirky character as Bobby Bouche in "The Water Boy." In this movie he seems to act more like his regular funny self, unlike the farfetched character of Bobby. "Big Daddy" reminds me more of "Billy Madison" where he interacts with little kids and acts like one himself. In fact, you may recognize the actor who plays the social worker in "Big Daddy." He was also in "Billy Madison" playing the elementary school principle. You will also recognize Kevin who is played by Jon Stewart, the host of "The Daily Show" on Comedy Central. I hear Adam Sandler and Jon Stewart are best buds. The story goes something like this: Sonny (Adam Sandler) finds a five-year-old kid at his doorstep named Julian. (Cole and Dylan Sprouse) This kid is supposedly the unknown son of his roommate Kevin. (Jon Stewart) Sonny ends up falling for Julian's cuteness and tells the social workers that he is Kevin and Julian is his son, which is totally false of course. Sonny agrees to take care of the boy until the social services can find a foster family for Julian. Well, he ends up liking cute little Julian and wants to be his father to impress his girlfriend Vanessa (Kristy Swanson) who threatens to leave Sonny because of his lack of responsibility and a decent job. She ends up leaving anyway to be with some sixty-year-old because he has goals and has made something out of his life. Yeah whatever, just wait till you see what Adam Sandler says about that in the movie. (No I won't tell you, you will just have to go see the movie.) The rest of the movie is all about Sonny trying to keep and take care of Julian while also trying to win over his new love interest, the sister of his roommate's fiancé. Sonny seems to be sort of a loser guy and doesn't have a "real" job. His roommate seems to be a successful guy. He has a great job, his life is going somewhere, and he gets engaged on his birthday. This just leaves Sonny dreaming about the good ol' days. He works one day a week at a tollbooth. He supports himself with the money he got from suing a cab driver that ran over his foot. For one night of agony the judge thought it was worth $200,000. His Dad thinks of him as a failure and a disgrace to the family and his girlfriend leaves him because his life was heading nowhere. But that all changes once Sonny meets little Julian. Sonny has a very different approach to being a parent in the beginning of the movie. His theory (And I'm not lying) is let the kid do whatever he wants and eventually he will learn to pick the correct choice. Sonny blames fathers for all the messed up people in the world because they were too strict. I think it is actually the opposite, but that's Sonny's opinion. So in the beginning of the movie he lets Julian Pick whatever he wants. Julian changes his name to Frankenstein, eats ketchup for lunch, and wears huge boots with his underwear on over his shorts. It doesn't take long for Sonny to realize that his theory is incorrect, especially when he discovers that Julian, or Frankenstein, chose not to take a bath for a week straight. Then he decides to get a little more serious about this Daddy business. While watching the end credits I discovered that two people, Cole Sprouse and Dylan Sprouse, played Julian's character. You guessed it, the director pulled the twins trick on me again. I never even noticed. Uh Oh! I'm getting flashbacks of Mary Kate and Ashley again. I hope they stop soon. Anyway, the kids did a satisfying job. They tried to make the Julian Character as cute as possible. Playing Julian's character would be very easy I would imagine. He hardly says anything during the whole movie. He just says various phrases like, "I have to go to the bathroom," "Are you my Daddy," and "I can wipe my own a$$" His character has to be cute, very cute. He also seems to have some sort of a bladder problem. He urinates countless times during the movie and in various places like his bed, behind buildings, and on trees. Adam Sandler did an excellent job of course and so did Jon Stewart. I was a little disappointed in Sonny's new girlfriend though, her character just didn't flow well and she had a terrible voice. That doesn't hurt the movie very much. It's tolerable. Steve Franks did the movie's writing and story. He does a great job of putting good lines in the movie and adding goofy characters to give the movie a certain flavor. Like the old man at the bar who always tries to pick fights with Sonny and calls him a woman. He gets beat up every time of course but he's always thirsty for more. Then there's the deliveryman who stops and hangs out at Sonny's house every day. He has a strange accent and can't read. There's also the homeless man who keeps popping up at just the right time in the movie to deliver a good chuckle. There are many others, which show the great screen writing for this movie. There are all these good lines in the movie but I have a hard time remembering them all.I would have given the movie a better rating, but I didn't really like the ending. I was expecting it to end in a certain happy way but it didn't. The movie surprised me and had an ending that was different and not so happy. It wasn't a sad ending, but it wasn't the happiest ending either. It was semi happy. You will understand what I mean if you see the movie. I guess Dennis Dugan, the director, wanted to be different than everybody else and go against the flow. He didn't want to give you what you would expect. I guess you could call it artistic, but the audience might not like his artistic approach. We will see. Big Daddy does have a theme to it. Parents have a huge role in the lives of their children and it's their responsibility to teach them how to be responsible adults. It shows that being a parent is not an easy job. You have to teach kids right from wrong and spend a substantial amount of your time with them. Parents have to use every trick up their sleeve to raise a kid or kids. In the end it is worth it and you will be rewarded with a great family. All in all "Big Daddy" was an excellent movie despite its ending and other little complaints. I watched the movie to get a big laugh and I did. So, in my book this movie was a great success. Let's just see how "Big Daddy" can fare against other comedies that have come out recently like "Austin Powers" and "Noting Hill." I really liked this movie, but considering I'm a total Adam Sandler fan you might not feel the same about it. I don't think you have to be a Sandler fan to enjoy this one. Trust me, it delivers the laughs. It's very creative and, well, it's just funny.</fullReview>

His relationship with the kid was fun to watch when it wasn't overly sentimental and he has taken another baby step towards maturity with it. The biggest weakness was that the schmaltz was laid on pretty thick. The Wedding Singer's emotion was subtle and subdued and, therefore, had more resonance. This was so contrived. Whenever Adam gazed at the oh-so-cute and precious little boy, the heartfelt music would build. In the predictable climactic courtroom scene, the whole audience is supposed to respond with a collective "Aaawwwwwww". Instead it was more like "Pleeeeaaaasssssee!!!"</fullReview>

The movie is warm and often very funny but it has some cute, heart-tugging moments too, with only a few scattered instances of the coarse, irresponsible humor that is usually abundant in his films.This could be Sandler's biggest hit yet. He won a lot of new fans with "The Wedding Singer" and those crossover fans seem to have followed him in droves. I found this movie highly enjoyable and recommend it highly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw it today. First day it came out. Adam Sandler has another great comedy role as Sonny, who "adopts" Julian(Cole and Dylan Sprouse), Sonny's brother's son unconscious that he has one, when his mother gets sick. He ends up on Sonny's doorstep, and they soon become close friends. Mixed with a touch of sorrow towards the end and a surprising ending, this a must-see movie. Adam Sandler is extremely funny, and Cole and Dylan follow right in their "father's" footsteps, and you'll fall in love with these darling bad boys. Easy 10! Go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eh....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While not every film needs to be an improvement over the previous, it's surprising to see Adam Sandler do such a light comedy. (That is not an endorsement.) In trying to appeal to all audiences, he really reaches none. The humor is childish, but not so childish that you would want children to see it. For good measure, Sandler favorites Rob Schneider, Josh Mostel, and Steve Buscemi show up, and you can tell their scenes are supposed to be wacky, but it just seems like forced tries at reproducing the silliness of the earlier films.There are a few good laughs, and Adam Sandler is likable, as usual. Yes, the kid is quite cute, but really, how much do we need to know about this kids' bodily functions? Joey Lauren Adams is always an entertaining actress to watch, and there are a few other recommendable aspects, but if it's true Adam Sandler you're looking for, wait for the next one, or break out your favorite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Make Room For "Daddy"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Wedding Singer" showed the world that Adam Sandler wasn't just yelling and poo jokes. He gave a delicate performance and made the romantic comedy his best work to date. You could easily tell growth was occurring, and the film responded by being extremely popular when nothing much was expected from it. "The Waterboy" was made during Sandler's "Wedding" success, thus not able to build on that growth as an actor. "Big Daddy" has the ability to see that a less silly Sandler can still achieve serious coin. While no "Truman Show", this new film plays up the emotions with the hope of showing off some dramatic chops that Sandler might possess. The result is a perpetually funny film that has the brains not to ruin the wacky stuff with superfluous tears. Reuniting with his "Happy Gilmore" director Dennis Dugan (who has a great cameo as the man who wishes he answered the front door on Halloween), Sandler stars as Sonny Koufax, a slacker who cannot seem to get his act together. In an attempt to impress his girlfriend (Kristy Swanson), Sonny adopts a child that was mistakenly dropped off at his front door. The two soon develop a affinity and become a very unique father and son combination. The story is basically an excuse for Sandler and co-screenwriter Tim Herlihy to shower the audience with gags involving typical child-rearing frustrations. Peeing in the bed, disobedience, first day of school, and a very funny bit involving shopping for groceries are all touched on. Intermixed with the usual oddball humor that I love about Sandler-Herlihy screenplays are nice quiet moments encompassing Sonny's romance with a lawyer played by Joey Lauren Adams. It is this segment of the movie that Sandler shows off the lovable charm that oozed out of the flawless "Wedding Singer". Without Drew Barrymore around, the romantic moments in "Big Daddy" seems more of a screenplay conceit that a real subplot. Still, they are funny and touching in a roundabout way. Now I say this with a straight face: Sandler has yet to really write and headline a bad film. Movies like "Happy Gilmore" and "Billy Madison" get beat up all the time over their adolescent jokes. I for one praise the comedian for remaining funny just as the box office stakes are rising. "Big Daddy" is packed with grand jokes and a healthy sense of the odd that made the previous pics so endearing. Writer Herlihy provides the exquisite one-liners and Director Dugan keeps the visual gags fast and proficient. The three are an impregnable team that I hope can continue this run for another film. When it comes to the dramatic moments, "Big Daddy" doesn't really falter, it just stumbles a bit. It comes off as a bit fake to see Adam Sandler trying to muster tears over his beloved child. I don't suggest that Sandler is incapable of dramatic work, but this film forces it a bit. Standing back and letting the drama lead the way might have been a better option. There's an audience to please out there, so the baby steps on display here might the right way to do this. In ten years, when "Adam Sandler in 'Macbeth'" opens, I'll be first in line, assured that Sandler can be the actor that I suspect he wants to be. "Big Daddy" shouldn't frustrate anyone looking for big laughs. This streak that Sandler is on has been marvelous, one film after another just pure fun. As long as he continues to write his own material, as long as the jokes remain ambiguous and risky, I'll go to the ends of the Earth defending him as a true original. A man who's films should not be dismissed so quickly.---------------- 9</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartfelt charm, hysterical comedy, and a positive message makes for an adorable and hilarious slapstick comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Adam Sandler a lot, but recently with Blended and The Cobbler, he's starting to lose his goofy touch what made his humor funny in the first place. I loved the most recent movie he's done called Pixels in 3D, but he truly shined back in the day. One of his best movies is Big Daddy, which is a very funny and surprisingly charming comedy that shows that Adam Sandler can still try his best at being hilarious. The movie has a strength of having pee and throw up jokes, innuendoes and slapstick, but the crudeness and simplicity of the comedy will make you laugh out loud. The movie is very sweet, without being too corny to be considered cinematic cheese. A lot of the unimportant characters are actually the funniest and most interesting of the bunch. Julian is just too damn funny here, he has a ton of antics that are a few of the highlights of the movie. Overall, Big Daddy is a hilarious and heartfelt gem that should be better received.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adam Sandler really began to peak in the 1990's after he hit it big on SNL. He quickly was pushed into Going Overboard in 1989, which wasn't terrible but wasn't good either. Then he began to receive more work throughout then while people seemed to have a feel for him and he became well known, sort of how Seth Rogen is coming into his own now. Sandler really is well known for just playing a normal guy with such a short fuse that ends up getting into a major crisis. If you don't believe me then watch this movie. It can be touching at moments and tear jerking for some of you out there, but for the most part this is a Sandler comedy that you don't want to pass by.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, BIG DADDY is a hilarious, but kind of crude movie. If you ask me, Sonny (Adam Sandler) was a hilarious guy, but he should have shown Sid (Geoffrey Horne) a little more respect. I thought Corrine (Leslie Mann) and Vanessa (Kristy Swanson) were very snobby. This was because they didn't treat Sonny with a whole lot of respect most of the time. In addition, I thought that Julian (Cole and Dylan Sprouse) was a really cute kid. The only things about BIG DADDY that grossed me out were the messes that Julian made, especially when he threw up after bouncing around a little bit while he had "The Kangaroo Song" on. To me, Layla (Joey Lauren Adams) was a really nice, smart, and pretty woman. In conclusion, I recommend this smash hit to all you Adam Sandler fans who haven't seen it. When you see it, prepare for lots of laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a great comedy done by Adam Sandler. It shows us that love can come in the strangest ways. When Julian(Cole and Dylan Sprouse) gets dumped off on Sonny Koufax's(Sandler)front step, he automatically tries to get rid of him. Then he gets dumped by his girl for an older man. So, Sonny tries to adopt poor little Julian to impress his ex. She is not impressed. Koufax is stuck with little Julian, and they begin a friendship which really makes them both believe that it is real. Koufax never got along with his dad, so he takes a totally different approach at being a father. He lets his new son, Frankenstein, do anything that he wants. He ignores his friends about giving the kid back. Koufax really grows attached to Julian, even though he is not really his son. I think that the director is trying to point out that adoption is okay. Just don't do it to impress your girlfriend. He created a comedy with one of the funniest comedians there are. He pulled out his emotions and showed us that he really does have a sensitive side. I would recommend this movie to everyone. It happens to be one of my favorites. I think that is funny when he tells everyone that Sonny taught him how to pee on a building. He also learned how to pick up girls in the park. This movie gets five stars in my book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sandler stars as a crude N.Y.C. slacker who's too lazy to do anything with his life even though he's a law school graduate and his father is a prominent Florida attorney. A kid shows up at his doorstep one day and he adopts him as a desperate ploy to win back his demanding girlfriend, that is until both of them unexpectedly develop a mutual bond. Undeniably silly, but very funny comedy is very likely to offend some with its immature, atypical parenting style, but it's well-cast and overflowing with Sandler-esque gags. Buscemi and Schneider have amusing supporting roles as a philosophical bum and a witless delivery man, and the film's climax is hilarious. **?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adam Sandler has found his niche, but it appears to be in decline. We don't need to go into an analysis of what this gig is, we all know it well. Like other recent crossover comedians from Saturday Night Live, Mr. Sandler has taken a limited comedic repertoire and parlayed it into feature length films. Unlike most of the others of his generation, Mr. Sandler was succeeding, and succeeding well. Until the last couple of years that is. Now each new movie appears to be another step downward, and "Big Daddy" is a big step. The characters in "Big Daddy" are pitifully stereotyped. Not just Mr. Sandler's character, but all of them. You know what they are going to do and say before they do it. And the humor is cruel and mean, a Sandler trademark. Of course in the end he learns his lesson, becomes a good man, gets the girl, and everything is forgiven. Gag me. Long story short?avoid this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A compendium of a given culture can often be found in works which it finds funny. One of today's leading pop humorists, who worked his way up the ladder on tv's "Saturday Night Live," is Adam Sandler.Following his film comedies, "Happy Gilmore," "The Water Boy" and "The Wedding Singer," Sandler now attempts a work combining sentimental touches. Sandler seems to have a similar goal as did Jerry Lewis, especially in Lewis's live work: get laughs at any cost -- no matter how much the material may be offensive to some people. When one can get by that premise and the often crudity, grossness and outrageousness of the material, a profile of contemporary American pop humor begins to emerge. There are more than frat lads attending and supporting Sandler products, and "Big Daddy" may be a useful gague of low-level popular comedy. Joey Lauren Adams, remembered from the interesting "Chasing Amy" is on hand for some romantic moments, and Cole and Dyland Sprouse provide the comedy's youthful catalysts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I laughed once...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adam Sandler seems to becoming an acquired taste. Most people either love or hate this guy, I somehow am in the middle. My only fault with him is that he continues to play the same characters: goofballs with bad tempers who at the end have a heart of gold. "The Wedding Singer" made me laugh a good amount of times, "The Waterboy" made me laugh a few times. This film made me laugh once. Everything that goes on is so stale and silly that we've either seen it before or just don't laugh. Even with that said, this somehow(???) made 90 million dollars, so Sandler and his writing buddy Tim Herlihy will have no shortage of studio execs who are willing to give their stuff a try. This time he's paired with a friend's unknown son, who he ends up caring for until the father returns from a business trip to find out he exists. They go through an assembly line of moments; making rollerbladers crash, spraying wizz on the side of buildings, helping Sandler attract a woman. It's all too dull. The kid is even annoying most of the time, with his "I can't sleep" and puking and swearing. The cast aside from the main two is pretty good, veterans you should recognise. Adams, whose helium filled voice usually hampers her characters, is pretty enjoyable here. And Leslie Mann, though not unpleasant to look at, was totally wasted as a big boobed acquaintance of Sandler's. He drives her (and us) nuts with his endless Hooter's waitress comments. You wanna kick him in the head and say "enough already!" The one original element in the movie was the ending, which surprised me a little, but there's really nothing here to give you any fun. But don't listen to me, the thing made 90 million. And the one thing that made me laugh: the irony of the comment "a sh*tload of p*ss". Hey, I just laughed typing that. Maybe I should say this movie made me laugh twice then.</fullReview>

The story was a good idea but it seems that trying something new with a plot that is not a new and not very very original failed indeed. They were trying to make it different than those usual become-a-parent-in-one-day-plots but in the end it wasn't very funny.

		<fullReview>This was a horribly unfunny movie. I just don't get this Adam Sandler phenomenon. He's just not funny, at least in a movie. The jokes are so tired and stale. I can always see the joke coming in an Adam Sandler movie. Wait, here it comes, hold on, almost there, HA! Oh boy that was funny. I guess you have to be not too bright to like his movies, or maybe I'm not bright enough (although I doubt it), I just don't know. I love Monty Python, I like the Farrelly brothers' movies (especially Kingpin), I even chuckle at the Ace Ventura movies. The one Adam Sandler movie I enjoyed was Happy Gilmore, where Sandler was his usual obnoxious self but was actually funny. Wedding Singer was tolerable, probably due to the presence of Drew Barrymore. The Waterboy was horribly overrated as well, although it was better than Big Daddy. In Waterboy, at least some of the supporing characters are mildly amusing, although Sandler himself is perhaps at his most annoying. I like Jon Stewart and Joey Lauren Adams (and Steve Buscemi is usually one of my favorite actors), but they cannot overcome the horrible dialogue and the terrible comic timing. The kid is so cute he's just annoying, and Adam Sandler is flat as a pancake. The worst thing in the movie, though, is the agonizingly, putridly unfunny Rob Schneider, who should thank Sandler for giving him bit parts so that he can pay his rent. Schneider's unnecessary bit as the restaurant worker is exceeded in annoyance factor only by his HORRID cameo as the "you can do it" guy in The Waterboy. I wish Adam Sandler well, I just hope that he can put out a movie one day that is actually deserving of the popular acclaim he is now receiving. Of course, with the fickleness of the public, that movie would probably bomb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adam Sandler is great, but something is missing. ** out of ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Big Daddy," is a movie that just doesn't work. Throughout the production I felt like the movie was missing something-like there was a major hole in the film's structure. It had a hero, a problem, a solution, subplots, complications..so what is it missing? I thought about that question, slept on it, and at first I thought it was the absent character chemistry between two very important characters, but I soon detected myself wrong. The movie is lacking a villain-the bad guy. You see, if a movie does not have an antagonist then the audience only can root for the good guy, which soon becomes old, especially when the hero is someone like Adam Sandler. And if there is no competition, the good guy has only one option; to succeed. Where is the tension there?The character Adam Sandler appropriately plays is named Sonny, a man who still lives like a ten year old. He is irresponsible, unclean, vulgar, tactless, and has the idea that the way to take care of a spill is to put newspapers over the mess. His girlfriend threatens to leave him unless he "moves on to the next phase of his life."Sonny is developed with great filth and realism (which is a good thing). After we know about him a little bit and see the movie's first act though, the next issue is brought upon us; Sonny somehow receives a young abandon child and decides to adopt him in order to stop his girlfriend from leaving him. But when he begins to develop cute relationships with this boy, and discovers that his girlfriend has already found a replacement for Sonny, he starts to question weather to give up his companion, or to keep him as a little companion.There are laughs in "Big Daddy," and quite a few of them. Most evolve from either Sonny's temper and very short patients span with the adopted kid, or selected one-liners said by Sonny. Adam Sandler's last film, "The Waterboy" failed because his character had no boundaries. In "Big Daddy" he releases a character who has substance to him, who learns from his mistakes, grows in his maturity. This is the kind of humor he was born for.As for the rest for the film, beyond the villain missing, the adopted boy is used as more of a plot device than an actual character, although he does throw in a few funny one liners. You see, first we have an internal problem, Sonny's girlfriend is going to leave him if he doesn't straighten up his act, then the filmmakers throw in an external problem that both movies the plot into the second act and partially solve the first internal problem. When filmmakers use characters as act breaks instead of situations, we have a really hard time getting to know the used character. "Big Daddy" is a perfect example of how when a movie uses a character for a plot point that they seldom have the time to develop him or her, thus the lack of character chemistry between Sonny and his adopted son.There is another problem with the movie and it's funniness: right about at midpoint, it begins to develop a sappy look at the external problem; Sonny has broke the law to keep this kid, should he be able to be his father, if not, what will become of him. Well, I hate to say it but the movie is all down hill from here for a couple of reasons. 1) This is not a tearful issue, the boy, whom we hardly know, is going to a be with someone else. 2) Sonny is an awful father. He doesn't deserve to own a dog let along a kid. So if were supposed to root for Sonny, who is not a good person, to keep the kid, I'm sorry, but that will not fly with me. The orphanage will do a much better job than he. But wait, is Sonny now the villain?"Big Daddy" isn't a terrible film, nor is it a good one. In fact, it stands right about in the middle of the average and satisfactory level, which, unfortunately isn't enough for me to give a recommendation to. However, I do indeed give the movie credit for making me laugh, for there are many, many lesser comedies that do not at all. So if you're in the mood for a shallow laugh with a few structural flaws check out "Big Daddy": worth the trip but not the ticket price.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The critics will surely eat this movie alive but with little or no effect on its predetermined box office strength. This movie tries desperately to appeal to mass audiences, sugarcoating Sandler's humor, giving him a "cute" kid for the female, touchy audience and including plenty of bathroom humor for the preteens. However the marketing wizards neglect the 18-24 age group who will most likely upon seeing this movie do the same thing the kid does--throw up. The movie has none of the zany, random but hilarious humor of "Billy Madison" or "Happy Gilmore", or even "The Wedding Singer" to some extent. Three sight gags are recycled throughout this whole dreadful film: The kid urinates on things, causes rollerbladers to fall, and covers foul, liquid messes with newspaper. God, help us when Sandler isn't funny anymore. I guess when someone hands you $20 million, you do what they say--even if that means making a phony, pitiful excuse for a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK people, lets not get too carried away with this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Big Daddy" is a diluted, sappy, and truly dumb film. The only redeeming quality of this picture is, well, the little kids that played Julian were pretty good. Everything is sooooo sweet in this movie that if you don't cry your some kind of insensitive jerk. At least that's what the score makes you feel like. With more fluff than your dryer's lint screen and more intended tear jerking scenes than your average Lindsay Wagner TV movie special, this film dilutes Sandler's humor. Many people who have commented on "Big Daddy" to this point say that it is the best Sandler film while "Happy Gilmour" and "Billy Madison" were just plain stupid. Look, Gilmour and Madison weren't supposed to be nice comedies for nice people. I enjoyed those two films infinitely more than Big Daddy, so maybe I'm void of feeling or something. Moreover, if those aforementioned Sandler films are "dumb" this one is just plain offensive. The court room scene is THE dumbest, most unrealistic, downright awful court scene ever. If you've seen it you know what I mean. I was able to stomach the film until then, I remember saying to myself "maybe they're trying to make a commentary on the sad state of affairs for foster children," but nope - not even close. The only way to describe the courtroom proceedings is surreal. If Dali had been a filmmaker he couldn't have outdone the downright absurd quality of it. This movie sucked, and if you thought so too you must also be an insensitive jerk. The "touching" parts of the film were SAPPY and PHONY, Jon Stewart should be banned from acting in feature length motion pictures (as much as I like him on the small screen). He always picks dumb roles for himself - in his touching scene at the end of "Big Daddy" its painfully obvious just how bad he is conveying emotion. I guess I just can't say enough bad things about this movie, so I'll add that Joey Lauren Adams (who is sexy and intriguing in all other films I've seen her in) is dumpy and wasted on this Sandler vehicle. When she cries (endlessly) throughout it makes you wish she'd just go away and leave us (the audience) alone. All in all I hated this movie and would recommend it to all nincompoops who like to snivel and blow their nose during boring, boorish, idiotic, falsely emotional films...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie and would say in all confidence it's Adam Sandler's best effort, yet. It has that Sandler touch to it like all his previous films but it's got that little something extra that makes it that much better. The young twins who portrayed little Julian were just adorable and charming. The characters and actors playing them are all entertaining and what Adam Sandler movie wouldn't be complete without the genius of Steve Buscemi. The kids should love it as well as those of kids at heart. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vulgar and dangerous display of easy laughs..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film presents a deplorable example of an 'anti' politically correct attempt which falls into vulgarity. It teaches how to despise old people, gays, lawyers, judges, and people who earn their living while it encourages to admire people who urinate on the walls of a restaurant, provoke the breaking of legs of children, and live as parasites. The danger of this film is that all is presented under the cover of a 'touching' situation and is supposed to draw tears from us.. Then we wonder how it happens that kids end up by raping or killing other children.. A film like that should be forbidden to children, then adults may find it boring.. So where is the audience? 47 Million made in two weeks. Vulgarity pays!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Its always been an American film staple to have a simpleminded but purehearted hero. Chaplin invented the image. He would be appalled at how the notion has beenappropriated by the US Republican party. An excellent character is all that matters, especially compared to the archetypical Democrat played by the worrywart "responsible" father: the real Big Daddy.In this case, it is more than just the image that has been stolen, on which Sandler has built a career. Here we have a whole movie stolen, down to the fawning eyes of the kid. Wouldn't be much of a crime if they worked harder at it. But it is put together in such a slapdash way that it sputters all over the place.Ted's evaluation: 1 of 3 -- you can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Big Daddy is clearly and with out a doubt one of the worst movies ever made. From the terrible, repulsive, acting, to the soggy story, to the bad acting, an awful film. Adam Sandler gives one of the worst performances in the history of film. What was he doing in this movie? Did he want to be in it? It doesn't appear so as his performance has no life whatsoever. His scenes are painful to watch and he's painfully not funny. The whole movie is. Jon Stewart, and Rob Schneider are also horrendous. The women in this movie are totally and completely wasted. The story is so far-fetched and implausible it would be dumb to describe it. One of the worst films ever made. A far to generous ONE is what I had to rate this piece of blank.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the first Adam Sandler movie I saw. I must say that I was impressed. Sandler plays Sonny who is just a cheap, low-life guy who works at a tollbooth and he has family issues. Then one day, a 5-year-old kid was dumped on his doorstep. He decides to take care of the kid even when there is legal trouble involving him and the kid. I thought that Dennis Dugan did a good job as directing. The chemistry between the actors was OK, but it works. There were fine performances by the Sprouse twins, Rob Schneider, and Jon Stewart. I also liked the music of this film. I enjoyed listening to the two versions of "Sweet Child O' Mine" by Sheryl Crow and Guns'N'Roses. Last of all, the film was pretty funny. This is a nice fit for your movie collection! I rate this movie a 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the 1st movie of Sandlers downfall, After this he hasnt made a very FUNNY movie in such. Although i've heard Punch Drunk Love is a master pieceso i cant say much on that cause i havent seen it. But this movie is very basic &amp; not very funny at all, A lot of hollywood comedians go through this same pattern,he need to make one of his older style movies e.g. Airheads, bulletproof or happy gilmore. Imagine if he makes a movie likeHappy Gilmore now, that'll be huge, because he's a lot more famous nowthen he was back then. Although i have to say GOING OVERBOARD was totally pathetic. Sandler is a funny guy but the directors r making him do more family movies for some reason. Look at Mr deeds very much like big daddy, not VERY funny. I'm not very sure if i'm making any sense now</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't sure what was worse -- the muscle cramps that accompanied cringing at the horrible sentiment scenes, or the strain that resulted from rolling my eyes so often at the supposed humor.The movie starts out bad enough, when slothful Sandler seems to have absolutely no motivation for doing something with his life, yet he can rattle of a dazzling defense of a complex court case that has the lawyers scratching their heads. I almost turned the movie off at that point because I figured it wouldn't get any better. But, being a fan of Adam Sandler movies, I thought I'd forgive him that one and see what else he had in store.Unfortunately, there wasn't much. The plot moves forward with him deciding that he can resolve his maturity issues by adopting a child. The utter implausibility of this is maddening. But the kid comes off pretty cute, so I settle in again.The kid soon becomes as annoying as Sandler in this movie. Suffice it to say that Sandler spends the movie showing the audience what a big star he is, degrading women at every possible step of the way, spouting his customary crude humor in shallow, stupid remarks, and basically maintains a macho attitude because, being Adam Sandler, he can get away with it.Fortunately, it blows up in his face. Sandler's characters are usually strange, but they have some redeeming qualities that generally make for a fun movie. Not this time. In this film, he is apparently suffering indigestion from being too full of himself, and it shows. Hopefully, he will get over that and continue the progression in quality that his movies showed up through The Wedding Singer.</fullReview>

I liked it better than Waterboy and Happy Gilmore (hell, I haven't even seen HG). This was an excellent movie, and it was funny. I don't really like Sandler's usual immature frat-boy humor, but in this movie, it was too sweet. Julian, the little boy, was adorable, how can you not love his little lisp?ANd oh my god, they cussed a few times. So what? Yeah, there was sexual remarks, big deal. This is almost 2000, get used to it.The ending was brutally sad, he couldn't keep the kid. But if he did it would be unrealistic. But Kevin Gerrity (played by the super-yummy Jon Stewart ;P ) did get his son back, and that was expected.9/10By the way, who was it who said Sonny was homeless? I oughta smack you for that. Idiot.

		<shortDescription>A Profanity-Laced, Urine-Soaked Wasteland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Big Daddy" has the misfortune of premiering in 1999, when the field for Most Pathetic Film of the Year is loaded with flicks like "Idle Hands" and the runaway winner so far, "Baby Geniuses". But give Adam Sandler credit: He took a decent budget, backing from a historic studio and a couple of well-respected co-stars and managed to come up with the most disgusting, stupid and unwatchable piece of cinematic garbage this summer."Big Daddy" is a profanity-laced, bodily-fluid-soaked wasteland of a film with no redeeming value whatsoever. Instead of thoughtful, amusing or touching scenes and dialogue, the viewer is treated to an endless display of urine and vomit cascading forth from the confused little lad at the centre of the proceedings. Basically, this film is a ruder "There's Something About Mary", only this time the butt of jokes is five years old. There's something more than a little disturbing about masses of adults and teenagers paying $8.50 to laugh at a little boy vomiting.The only reason this film got made, of course, is because it serves a higher purpose as 90 minute recruiting video for Hooters restaurants. The Hooter Girl and "big bust" jokes are funny for the first five minutes, but quickly grow tiresome as Sandler uses them over and over.Sadly wasted in this film are the significant talents of Rob Schneider and Steve Buscemi, both of whom perform admirably in minor roles. Unfortunately, the two are onscreen far too briefly to provide any sort of counterweight to the sorry mess created by Sandler and co-stars Joey Lauren Adams and Leslie Mann. Adams, who possesses a voice reminiscent of a hysterical toddler, tries desperately to be lovable, but falls far short. Mann's Corrine--whom we are supposed to believe worked her way through medical school as a Hooter Girl--provided the greatest levity of the evening. Her character is far too malicious to have ever succeeded as a waitress, and a Hooters job at that? I've seen a bigger bustline on a Bulgarian gymnast.Whatever creativity and humanity Adam Sandler had in films like "The Wedding Singer" has been completely lost. With "Big Daddy", he has shown he is completely out of ideas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Adam Sandler Foolishness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Casting five year old twin boys as Adam Sandler's costars in this 1999 Columbia Pictures release was a very good idea. After all, Sandler's usual man-child character had to have somebody that he could relate to. Sandler portrays Sonny Koufax, a man who just might be the pure epitome of somebody who's not responsible. However, if that theory wasn't tested then there would be no film. In an effort to possibly win back his girlfriend (Kristy Swanson) who has left him because of his being irresponsible and has since taken up with another man, he offers to be a guardian for his traveling roommate's (Jon Stewart) son, Julian (portrayed by twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse). Agreeing to assume full responsibility for a child makes Sonny think that Swanson just might change her mind about leaving him. It doesn't happen and now child services won't let him return Julian. Sonny learns to grin and bear the situation by attempting to bond with Julian and in so doing, he gradually begins to feel more like an actual responsible father figure. Of course things get complicated when Stewart eventually returns home and a custody battle begins (Julian has grown attached to Sonny by this time). Even this dramatic seeming scene evolves into more adolescent comedy. Sandler's fans should enjoy this film but since I was never especially a fan of Sandler, I consider it to be just another crumbled up piece of paper in the sorry recent film comedy wastebasket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boy, did this movie suck. Even though it's only 90 minutes, it felt like it lasted 4 hours. Happy Gilmore was OK, but Sandler's other works have really blown. One reason i didn't like it is that Sandler's character is a jerk. He yells like a moron in a McDonald's, harasses a man (the film's director) in his apartment, spoils the kid, and causes bodily harm to skaters.And it wasn't funny. We're supposed to laugh just because he and the kid p**s on the side of a building. bodily functions are not funny. They were when I was a little kid, but I've grown out of that. Anyway, that little kid was pretty annoying ("Pweese pway da tape"), and far from being cute. The majority of today's comedies seem to be aimed at immature people with low IQs whole will laugh at anything. I miss edgy, satirical, intelligent comedies like Dr. Strangelove. Watching Big Daddy was like being tied to a pole and beaten with a wet sock. I guess other people like that experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Daddy Small Brain.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Big Daddy (1999): Dir: Dennis Dugan / Cast: Adam Sandler, Leslie Mann, Kristy Swanson, Rob Schneider, Jon Stewart: Big scene involves Adam Sandler teaching a boy to urinate on a wall. That was the advertizing poster as if the studio felt that the toilet was inappropriate. Perhaps he should have taught the kid how to wipe his ass with the film's script. Title regards higher adolescence with Sandler put in charge of a kid. It is obvious that he will grow to love the boy and avoids having him placed in a foster home. Director Dennis Dugan still hasn't improved any. He still uses mindless vulgarity to get a cheap laugh. This sort of humour can be funny within certain context but here it just looks desperate. The big joke is suppose to be Sandler as a father figure but nothing he does is remotely interesting. Leslie Mann plays his brain dead girlfriend. Kristy Swanson plays his brain dead ex-girlfriend. Did I mention that Rob Schneider was in this sh*t too? Jon Stewart plays one of Sandler's friends who is forging ahead, but career wise, this is only forging ahead to embarrassment. One could argue that this film regards adult role models and bringing children up within a safe environment but the main agenda seems to be urine and fart jokes that become way outdated within the first twenty minutes. Perhaps they should urinate on this film and see if it will flush down the toilet. Score: 1 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Irresponsible slacker Sonny Koufax (Adam Sandler) begrudgingly 'adopts' his best pal's son Julian (played by twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse), teaching the kid how to act as irresponsibly as he does. Inevitably, Sonny realises his mistake and rectifies the problem, but is eventually rumbled by the social service, who want to put Julian in care. Faced with losing the little guy forever, the layabout smartens up his act, hits the law books and prepares for court, determined to win Julian back.A massive dollop of schmaltzy Hollywood cheeze designed to tug at the heartstrings but leave a big smile on the face, Big Daddy is extremely formulaic stuff that simply lets Sandler do his thing: be a likable loser who learns a valuable life lesson and changes his ways for the better, all the while delivering crass gags about urinating in public and women with big boobs (Leslie Mann and Kristy Swanson bearing the brunt of many a Hooters joke). If Sandler's name in the credits doesn't make you want to turn off instantly, then this should prove a reasonably fun way to waste your time?just don't go expecting too much from it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite a few remote laughs, but not enough to make it overly entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been a die-hard Adam Sandler fan, but think he is sometimes amusing, sometimes lame as well. I first saw this particular film starring the former "Saturday Night Live" comedian three years ago, and wasn't blown away, but do recall finding it mildly amusing. However, three years later, I watched it a second time just last night. This time, quite a few gags made me snicker, but that wasn't enough for me to exactly call it a good comedy. This could be because it wore a bit thin with a second viewing, or because I now have higher standards than I did three years ago. Maybe it's both.Sonny Koufax is a lazy, extremely immature 32-year-old who only works one day each week as toll booth collector, and most of his money is from a lawsuit. His girlfriend is fed up with his childish lifestyle, and one day, a five year old boy named Julian shows up at his apartment door. This boy is apparently the unknown son of Kevin Gerrity, Sonny's friend. He decides to adopt Julian in an attempt to prove himself responsible and mature and save his relationship with his girlfriend. Unfortunately, it's too late, as his former girlfriend already has a new lover. After this, Sonny attempts to get Julian back to his mother, but learns that she has died. So, the toll booth collector takes the boy back, and soon grows to love him. Taking care of a kid turns out to be an eye-opening experience, but since he adopted him under a false name, he may be in for trouble! Unsurprisingly, Sandler plays an immature goofball in this movie, the typical kind of character he's often known to play. His antics in this movie are sometimes mildly amusing, but sometimes not. A mite too many jokes about breasts may come from his mouth. The movie also has some mildly amusing slapstick in places, but once again, not hilarious, just mildly amusing, and it doesn't save the movie. The gross-out gags don't really work, either, including Julian's spitting talent. Aside from the humour, "Big Daddy" is supposed to be a touching story about responsibility and fatherhood, and this also only works to a certain extent at best. Basically, this is pretty much an average effort overall, one of Sandler's dismissible films, though it is better than "Eight Crazy Nights", the last film of his I watched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big on laughs, daddy-o, one of Sandler's best efforts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sonny (Adam Sandler), a lawyer by education, opts instead to live off the settlement he received after a car accident injury. This upsets his girlfriend, Vanessa, who works hard and longs for marriage, family and a solid future. Thinking he is about to lose her affections, Sonny grabs at the chance to adopt a young boy dropped off at his doorstep. If he shows Vanessa he is good father material, perhaps she will stay with him. It doesn't work! Vanessa bolts with a 60-something man who, as she notes, has a "five year plan". Sonny, therefore, has to learn to take care of the little lad himself, something totally alien to his existence. His parental care is unorthodox, to say the least, as Sonny's version of a night light is a glowing beer marquee. Nevertheless, the two of them learn from each other, in a positive way. At an outing in the park, the little boy even helps gain the attentions of an attractive female lawyer named Layla (Joey Lauren Adams). But, what will children's services say when they find out Sonny is not really the boy's father? This is one of Sandler's best films. His gross-out humor and facial expressions are still present but his love for the new little boy in his life is real and touching. The rest of the cast is an absolute dream, with Adams, Leslie Mann, Rob Schneider, and especially Jon Stewart, doing great jobs at their respective roles. The NYC setting, costumes, direction and production are very nice, indeed. Do you want easy laughs (sometimes a bit raunchy) and offbeat humor in a film but still welcome romance and darling children in the same view? Hey, daddy-o, you could hardly do better than this movie. It's many facets make it prime material for almost any group and its humor is very infectious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was hilarious. All-out hilarious. But, and this is something that I liked, it threw in some drama and almost angst. It is Adam Sandler at his best. Of course, all Sandler movies are great - Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, The Wedding Singer, etc. But this is TOPS. The absolute best movie coming from some of the absolute best actors.It's not all Sandler - it has probably the best supporting cast you'll ever see. I was incredibly impressed with the Sprouse twins, Dylan and Cole, who played Julian, and laughed out loud at the antics of Naza, the foreign food delivery guy portrayed by Rob Schneider, an old favorite in Sandler movies. And then there's the beautiful Joey Lauren Adams playing Layla, one of the most real actresses I know. Even the director, Dennis Dugan, makes an appearance as the Reluctant and Unprepared Trick-or-Treat Giver.Finally for the real review: Sonny Koufax (Adam Sandler) is a 30-something slacker in Manhattan who works one day a week in a toll booth. Needless to say, he isn't paid much, and he's been living off the $200,000 insurance money of a minor foot-injury from 2 years ago. He's sure his girlfriend is about to break up with him and he needs something - something big - to get her to stay.His roommate Kevin Gerrity (Jon Stewart) is on his way to China for some sort of business trip. Less than an hour after Kevin left for the airport, Sonny open's his door to find innocent, 5-year-old Julian (D&amp;C Sprouse). A letter, brought along with the kid, says Kevin is his father. After calling Kevin, who had no idea what was going on, Sonny decides to adopt the kid to show his girlfriend Vanessa (Kristy Swanson) that he isn't as irresponsible as she thinks.Sonny calls the Social Services office, calling himself Kevin Gerrity, and makes his proposal.Afterwards he takes the kid to meet Vanessa. Upon arrival, Sonny finds that she's gotten with an elderly man with a 'five year plan'. He leaves, hoping never to see her again, but more importantly, not sure what to do with little Julian.He goes to the SS office, still posing as Kevin, and asks to make his guardianship temporary until a foster family gets lined up.Through the days Sonny gets closer and closer to Julian until the two are inseparable. Guess what? A foster family comes and Julian has to leave. When Sonny's about to nix the foster deal and make it permanent, SS finds out he's not Kevin Gerrity, but Sonny Koufax.Julian leaves and Sonny's miserable. Desperate to get the kid back, he takes it to court. And I've given too much of the movie away already, so you'll have to figure out what happens next on your own.Bottom line: "Big Daddy" = THE BEST MOVIE EVER. You HAVE to see it if you haven't already. ***** (Out of 5)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cant even tell you how much I love this movie. Literally, i've probably seen it about thirty-five times. Every time my cousin comes over my house and sleeps over we always plan on watching Big Daddy.Adam Sandler plays basically a lazy bum in this movie, that works at a toll booth. He adopts a Julian and fakes his name to be Kevin Gerrity, the man he was supposed to be sent to. He teaches Julian many things along the way, mostly negative things but that is what makes the movie funny. Like every Sandler movie, he falls in love. He ends up falling in love with Kevins girlfriends sister Leila. He has Julian go up to Leila at a park and bribe her to go to Sunny's (Sandler) apartment. In the end they end up marrying each other and all of that stuff.There are many funny parts during the movie but i don't want to give them away. and I do encourage you to see this hilarious film, it is highly recommended. in my opinion, It is Sandlers funniest and best. 10/10*</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My brother said this is one Adam Sandler movie he didn't like, but I got the biggest laughs in the movie theater, it was the first Adam Sandler movie I saw. I love Adam Sandler's movies, his formula is playing a guy who either is rich or becomes rich, and is a goofy, incompetent slacker, who's really sweet and a little over caring, but can just burst into anger, and than quickly apologize. Adam Sandler plays Sonny, a goofy 32-year-old slacker, who adopts a little 5-year-old boy named Julian who's mom couldn't ake care of him so he ends up at Sonny's apartment. The gag that became really well-known was Sonny and Julian peeing on a wall, which happens cause Julian couldn't wait to go. the thing that really made me laugh when I was younger was the demented kangaroo tape Julian watches several times. oh, but cover your eyes, I didn't find it amusing, just growse for my tastes when Julian does his spitting trick. There's a gay joke at the beginning with two guys kissing at a ceremony. My brother can think not, but I thought this was Adam Sandler's funniest movie, well, maybe Happy Gilmore. The thing is Julian takes after Sonny, whos touchy and tries to be like a father, but you can see what a goofy, incompetent slacker, and what happens when they take on a huge responsibility! Like Billy Madison taking over as a college professor instead of retaking school! Julian takes completely after Sonny and even learns Sandler's steryotypical sociopath behavior. Sonny seems to evolve.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Big Daddy is not one of my favorite Sandler movies, I have much distaste for it not because of Sandler, but for the little kid Frankenstein or Julian whatever he is called, he is a bad actor and really made me mad. Sandler and Joey Lauren Adams are great in this movie dispite the poor choice for the kid role. Big Daddy is good for some laughs and worth a look, hopefully you will like the kid's acting better than I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the best of the Sandler films. It doesn't try to make you laugh as hard as LITTLE NICKY and it is more serious than THE WATERBOY and HAPPY GILMORE. This is the best one of the series. Let's hope that there is never a LITTLE NICKY repeat. There was no seriousness in that film. This film manages to make you laugh hysterically and even touches you in some parts with all of the fatherly-love bullsh*t. BILLY MADISON stayed in the middle, with little dramatic stuff, little super-crude humor and a lot of regular humor. This movie is like that, only it has a lot of dramatic moments, a lot of crude humor and some regular humor and romance.BIG DADDY is a really good Sandler movie. Let's just see how he does with his upcoming MR.DEEDS. The best thing that one could be is a repeat of this film. BIG DADDY: 5/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, like The Waterboy, basically serves as a vehicle for Adam Sandler. He plays a childish, irresponsible slacker (that seems to be most of his roles) who adopts a foster child to impress his girlfriend, which backfires when his girlfriend breaks up with him, and he can't return the kid. Impossible situation? Not if you're a character in an Adam Sandler film, as he winds up making the most of it. There were some pretty funny moments in this movie, and some seemingly mandatory tearjerker scenes as well. Decent at best.** 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Big Daddy is such adorable film. Adam Sandler stars as Sonny Koufax a guy who has just been dumped by his girlfriend Vanessa, (Who left him for an older man.) when suddenly he gets stranded with a young boy, Julian (Played by both-Cole and Dylan Sprouse.) and this leaves Sonny looking after him. The things that they get up to are *really* funny and Adam Sandler is brilliant as always. Joey Lauren Adams is also good as Sonny's love interest Layla. Rob Schneider and Steve Buscemi also give small but good performances as Nazo and The Homeless Guy. Big Daddy is a great film which is obviously VERY funny and I give it a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie of 1999!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, all Adam Sandler movies are alike! Just like this one, he's playing Sonny Koufax, a crude loser and not to mention a slacker who doesn't realize yet that the world is passing him by. In this movie, he adopts an orphaned five-year-old (played by twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse) after he meets Layla (Joey Lauren Adams) a girl he fell in love with to show he can be responsible and believes it's a sure fire way to win her affections. That plot formula has been totally underused and in this movie, done way over the top! Adam Sandler is one of those actors who only know who to play one role, a lazy slacker/loser! I don't know what posessed me or other people who ended up disliking this movie like I did to go see it to begin with! This movie was totally ribald and vulgar. I also believe it teaches kids who see this movie to do whatever they want no matter how offensive it may seem to other people because the kid has an idiotic parent/guardian who will never punish them! Heck, the kid even uses profane language, and that's supposed to be funny?! Talk about a bad influence! As it turns out, when this movie was first released, it became the most overrated movie of last summer! Sad, isn't it? And of course, loser Sonny Koufax triumphs in the end. Boring! I also feel sorry for the twins who played the little boy and Joey Lauren Adams for particiapting in this ridiculous excuse of a movie! My best advice is don't waste your money or time with this pathetic mindless dribble of a movie. RUN, don't walk away from Big Daddy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To those who are understanding, this movie is terrible.I expected it to be.If you're wondering why I saw it,I had some notion that it would be just a cut above Sandler's ordinary material and might invoke some laughs - I was wrong. Sandler has never invoked any laughs in his movies, and never will. If there's ever a scene where, say, he gets creamed after provoking some strong person, that might be funny. But things haven't changed, all his personas remain the same. i.e., acting like a spoiled 5 year old, yelling, screaming, talking like a little baby, and making fun of people, etc. The film portrays him as a Law student, which is probably the funniest thing in the whole movie (Not laugh with funny, laugh at funny!) He is left to take care of his roommate's kid, and I'll let you find out what happens from there. He obviously won't drive him to pre-school on time. He obviously won't teach him to be a patriotic neo-conservative, and the movie will obviously go by with its share of bathroom and other humor relating to bodily functions. Too bad it wasn't funny. I learned my lesson from this movie, which is avoid a film with Sander on the credits. I don't care if it's a sequel to Braveheart, time is valuable! One last thing I wanted to point out was how Steve Buscemi ended up in this movie. He's the guy you always see in indy-films. Is he friends with Sandler? Was it a gambling debt? Who knows!!!! </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since when can a cruel, self absorbed lazy crook become a hero? Why when he's an Adam Sandler character!Sandler in Big Daddy plays a loafing, almost lawyer (he hasn't bothered to take the final exam). He's living the Modern American Dream. He's a rich slob. He's Sonny Koufax and shares that groovy New York loft we see in these films with a fellow called Kevin (Jon Stewart). Kevin is unexpectedly delivered a son, five year old Julian (played by twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse) and circumstances contrive, as they do in the movies, for Sonny to try out the daddy lifestyle.He does this not because he feels minimally sorry for the child, but mainly so he can win back his wavering girlfriend Vanessa (Kristy Swanson) who's sick of Sonny being utterly selfish. He figures that if he adopts this ready made son, well, then he won't have to go through that tiresome baby business.Sonny's not a nice man. His favourite sport is to go down to central park and trip up skaters with branches off trees so that they crash violently in front of him. When he and Dylan later get tossed from a restaurant he and the boy urinate on the restaurant's front wall. This is supposed to be funny and I suppose it is, but it's also nasty.Dylan follows his new Dad's example but is made to be as cute as possible, even when he's tripping up skaters, which helps to soften Sandler's image in the film. But still, Sonny never redeems himself, well not as much as I would have liked. Sonny is almost totally self centered.Adam Sandler has a huge following, although I despair at an audience who find films like Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, The Waterboy and Airheads to be supremely entertaining. I can only surmise that these people choose to choose dim witted door mats to be role models. The Wedding Singer and now Big Daddy are different. They at least reveal Adam Sandler characters who's intelligence is measurable, in The Wedding Singer he's even likeable, but would you invite Big Daddy home to meet your mother?Should this matter? Am I being churlish if I complain about characters giving bad examples. After all some of the most satisfying screen characters are out and out villains.The difference here is that Sonny Koufax is something of an everyman. His behaviour is portayed as being reasonable even if it isn't. He's the fellow on the next block and he just doesn't care. There's no remorse at all.The shame of it is that many in our community will accept Sonny's morals as being fair, as being a reasonable reaction to the business and social environment within which they find themselves enveloped. Why be fair and loving, accept responsibility, even for your children, if it seems that your community doesn't give a damn for you unless you rip off an insurance company or clamber violently up the blood and bone human ladder.Sonny is a cynic in a cynical world and heaven help us if too many of us feel that way.</fullReview>

Even sadder, the film's main conflict is resolved far too easily. Not that any of us expected high drama from the guy who released a song called "The Longest Pee," but the screenwriters took the easy way out on this one. At least in "The Wedding Singer," there was a satisfying conclusion. In "Big Daddy," Billy Idol isn't there to save the day, and Adam's courtroom speech just doesn't cut it. Still, this one's worth a couple of bucks during a matinee. Just don't expect "Big Daddy" to do for Sandler what "Liar, Liar" did for Jim Carrey. He's still a one-note comic.</fullReview>

When it is time to return the kid to social services, Sandler fights to keep it. Yuck. It is galling to think Sandler makes millions and millions of dollars turning out such pap.

		<fullReview>It is a sad sad movie. So sad, that thrashing it feels like kicking a lying man. In the balls. I'll be adamant, though. I'll thrash it anyway.I tried to look past my burning hatred for Adam Sandler movies. Either I didn't succeed to eliminate the tunnel vision or the movie is just that bad.The plot is harebrained. What happens in this movie is so not right, it's practically painful to watch. The ridiculousness and gleeful disregard for reality are high all the time but reach their absolute peak during the sham of a court trial at the end.I really hope that scene was intended to be a parody. It's not very clear as it makes a sharp turn towards melodrama at some point, but I'll be generous and give it a benefit of doubt.. I have nothing against parodies. I'm, in fact, a big fan. So there wouldn't be anything wrong with it being a parody, were it actually a funny parody. Or innovative parody. Or even, at the last resort, a pretty parody. Instead it was just a sorry parody. That particular brand should be punishable by law.The characters are either ludicrous, like the hippie homeless guy Steve Buscemi, or bland, like the squeaky-sounding Lawyer Lady, who must have suffered some tragic head injury in the past, since she completely bypassed the normal female reaction to being hit on by Adam Sandler, that is franticly running away.The acting isn't particularly bad, but also nothing more than passable. Especially the kid actor wasn't a very good choice. Wait, kid actors, plural, the identical twins. Not that I noticed before the end credits. Most of the time, they come across as obnoxious rather than cute. I'm pretty sure that wasn't the intention. On the other hand, what can you expect from... five-?... six-year-olds? OK, I'm not impartial here. Doubly so. It's not only an Adam Sandler movie. It's a kid movie, too. With a real kid, not just an Adam Sandler character. I didn't like kid movies even when I was a kid myself. Actually, I didn't like kids, too. Still don't. The movies like 'Big Daddy' certainly won't make me change my mind. They only confirm me in my conviction that children are stupid annoying little monsters that should be kept doped till they reach 16. Perhaps that's a little extreme, but I never believed in half-measures.All in all, 'Big Daddy' is an unfunny, disgusting movie. Well, as it fits into a category that I privately call a physiological comedy, it couldn't be any different. I never understood the 'charm' of the humour focusing on pissing, vomiting, spitting and other situations involving bodily fluids, and that is the only sort of humour you can find here. The fact that the main character and the kid bond over urinating in public is wrong on so many levels, that, I think, it'll be better if I just stop thinking about it. Does male bonding really look like that? Really? I'm going to ignore the gross trick with spit that the kid does at some point to impress the adoring audience, because if I don't then I won't be able to stop wondering whether it's actually physically possible. And I don't want to do that.Then, there's the thing with the main character himself. Well, not only one, but I have to prioritize. He's supposed to be one of those simple, good-hearted characters, that the viewers just can't help not to love. My impression is, he's a despicable, vulgar, moronic parasite with anger management problem and an abominable concept of hygiene. Against all reason I hoped he'll go to jail after all. No such luck, of course.Oh, and the pansy lawyers. The ones that hug a lot, make puppy eyes at each other and, generally, are less manly than the main character's squeaky girlfriend. It shouldn't come as such a surprise anymore. but it still gets to me when I see that stereotype. It pisses me off to no end, which is a bit weird as I'm not a gay man myself. Or even a man, actually. Fortunately, the unofficial rule that gay men can be portrayed only as flaming queens or psychos, is slowly becoming just a matter of historical interest. Dumb comedies are always the last to catch on.I admit I'm angry. Mainly because I had to watch that monstrosity all the way to its senseless end. Frankly, I didn't even want to start. I'd have preferred to stay blissfully unaware as to how really bad it is. However, Lady Fortune felt particularly sadistic that day. I was at my friend's place, without really announcing my visit first, crashed the movie night, it wasn't my choice. I had to swallow my pride and suck it up. Cruel, the life is.</fullReview>

Recently, I saw "Bid Daddy"... and now I am sure: Sandler is the worst excuse of the comedian of the last 20 years, and perhaps of the century. And as for this movie, it's terrible even by the "Sandler standards". I'm just too tired to count the reasons why it's so awful... let me just tell that the day Adam Sandler deserves to be called an actor and a comedian will be the day Ed Wood is granted 10 posthumous Oscars for his life work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If someone were to count lines spoken by each actor, I suspect that Adam Sandler's Sonny talks three times as much as the rest of the cast added together. That's not a good thing. He just never shuts his mouth; every scene has Sandler shooting off his yap in a bored monotone that's like listening to fingernails on a chalkboard. Sonny becomes the foster parent of a kid named Julian to impress an ex-girlfriend. Pathetic premise: exploiting a child for a self-serving ulterior motive is not funny. Sonny's efforts to bond with Julian consist of annoying the kid and you with his ever-moving mouth. Also, he takes the kid on humorless visits to Hooters. A new girl comes along, and the predictable schmaltz between Sonny, girlfriend, and kid begins. All the while Sandler continues to jabber on. Throw in some subplots of Sonny fighting with his room mate's fiancé, his parasitical living off of a lawsuit settlement, and you have this "touching" movie about a guy who gives you no reason to like him.Then a plot twist emerges in the film's last-ditch attempt to make something out of this foster parent story. A court case occurs which is (apparently) intended for touching emotion, but pads itself with stupid people yelling out in court for no reason, and other slapstick that doesn't evoke laughs. Some irrational contrivances at the end are forgivable, given the approach of the movie, assuming you haven't shut the movie off before this. Flawed, has a few moments, enough to give it a 4.</fullReview>

Portraying Sandler adopting a boy (twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse), the movie certainly gives adoption a good name, even if it uses complete silliness to do so. It's mostly interesting how the movie shows that he has to mature more in the process of raising this boy.One noticeable thing is the presence of Jon Stewart (I believe that this was before he started hosting "The Daily Show"). Also appearing are Adam Sandler regulars Josh Mostel, Allen Covert, Rob Schneider and Steve Buscemi, plus Joey Lauren Adams as Sandler's hubby. A really enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The more Adam Sandler movies I watch, the more I dislike the guy. Admittedly, he never bugged me up until projects such as "The Waterboy," which seem to have scarred his earlier vehicles -- including "Big Daddy," a movie about a slacker who adopts a kid in order to prove his responsibility to his girlfriend. Predictable mayhem ensues.Sonny Koufax (Sandler) is a loser sharing an apartment in New York City with Kevin (Jon Stewart from Comedy Central's "The Today Show), who has to visit China and is leaving the place under the care of Sonny for the week. But the first day of his departure, a small five-year-old kid named Julian (Cole and Dylan Sprouse) arrives at the front door with a note, a la Paddington Bear. Kevin appears to be the boy's father, so Sonny hatches a great plan: He'll take care of the boy until Kevin returns, and prove to his girlfriend that he is responsible by passing the kid off as his son.Sonny is a graduate from law school, which is extremely hard to believe, considering how dumb he is. When Julian wets the bed, Sonny grabs some newspaper and lays it down over the sheets. "There 'ya go, dry sheets," he says, before leaving the room and retreating to his bedroom.The image of a caring father-figure that Chaplin invented in "The Tramp" is rather modernized here. I think Chaplin is probably rolling about in his grave.I'm not going to bash "Big Daddy" for teaching bad morals. After all, there's a reason it's PG-13, and any parent who lets their kids see this are just about as responsible as Sonny. Too many critics criticize films for inappropriate subject matter, despite their adult ratings. Example? There's a scene where Sonny is trying to "weed out" the bad kids at school -- despite the fact that they're mere kindergarteners. Sonny sits on a playhouse, circled by little kids, and says, "You know what else is good? Smoking dope!" It's a very funny scene to watch in context with the movie, but it could come off different to younger childrne. Don't let your kids see this movie.There is a repetitive cameo in "Big Daddy" by Steve Buscemi as a wandering homeless man. Buscemi often pops up in Sandler's films, which is surprising, since they're in a completely different range of acting. I did notice, however, that two films Buscemi has appeared in support McDonald's -- there's a long gag about the morning breakfast cut-off in this movie, and John Travolta subtly bashed Burger King in "Pulp Fiction," which also co-starred Buscemi. Personally, I think Burger King is much better. But let's not get sidetracked...The movie relies on Adam Sandler for its hits and misses. The problem is that he's not as enthusastic here as he was in "Happy Gilmore." It's one of Sandler's best comedies, which is sort of sad. I wish he'd make more films like "Punch-Drunk Love." He does have a bit of potential, and he was OK on "Saturday Night Live," but he's wasting his career by making these repetitive films that recycle the same characters and situations, with little twists at all.Does the movie have laughs? Sure. But they're strongly overpowered by the misfires. "Big Daddy" is a movie to approach with caution, even as light entertainment.2.5/5 stars.- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my worst movie ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't like the movie, cause of the boring «as usual» Hollywood story. The actors are really below average acting, nothing new or really funny happens, and it is merely a wasted time watching it. The story is simple, and the only good thing is the 5 year old boy. Overall I'm glad the video on Ebay was just $1.10, so it didn't hurt to throw it away. That's one of the few movies that really disappointed me. Hope I see Adam Sandler never again that bad. Maybe there's a kid out there liking it. For me it's plain junk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the worst movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Big Daddy is clearly and with out a doubt one of the worst movies ever made. From the terrible, repulsive, acting, to the soggy story, to the bad acting, an awful film. Adam Sandler gives one of the worst performances in the history of film. What was he doing in this movie? Did he want to be in it? It doesn't appear so as his performance has no life whatsoever. His scenes are painful to watch and he's painfully not funny. The whole movie is. Jon Stewart, and Rob Schneider are also horrendous. The women in this movie are totally and completely wasted. The story is so far-fetched and implausible it would be dumb to describe it. One of the worst films ever made. A far to generous ONE is what I had to rate this piece of blank.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Adam Sandler's Gig Daddy is a funny look at responsability. Sandler works well (as usual) as a lazy lay around, but the film also has a soft side to it, the kids who play the little Julian (Cole and Dylan Sprouse) bring something to this film that no other (besides Wedding singer) have. Heart. Funny, cool and nice film to watch with friends. Steve Buscemi appears as a bum in the funniest scene in the movie. A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Third grade humor...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolutely unbelievable fantasy and utterly sophomoric? A personality who's gone through law school, unless they have been on meth for a long time, would not "teach" such anti-social and potentially punishable behavior. Writers should have made him a writer, an architect or even a doctor... but a lawyer? Please! The stick would not be on the ground it'd been on a part of their body. Don't even think that a lawyer would have the capacity or audacity to respect the child's choices and would have been mortified by some of the outfits. A lot of writing license and not poetic. Really hard to swallow syrup in the court room with his abusive dad... Teens are not too far from the third grade so they might enjoy yet another Sandler waste of time and money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Disappointing Movie From Sandler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amazing to think that at the turn of the century Adam Sandler was hyped as being on the brink of mega stardom . Even more amazingly he was at one point the world's highest paid movie star ! No doubt his loyal fans ( All three of them ) can reconcile themselves with being first in line to see his next blockbuster performance since no one in 2005 queues to see a Sandler movie , especially if it's released direct to video It's easy to see where Sandler went wrong . BIG DADDY has Sandler play a bit of a loser just like every other movie that has " Starring Adam Sandler " in the credits or should that be " Starring Adam Sandler because Ben Stiller turned the role down " ? . Here his girlfriend dumps him and he finds out his ex wife has died and so his infant son who he's not seen is thrust on his doorstep , but if you're expecting a heart warming tale similar to THE KID you're going to be disappointed since it's " Starring Adam Sandler " so the story takes a turn for the worse as we're treated to some very infantile humour I do feel slightly guilty for writing an overly honest review of BIG DADDY and apologies too if it's rather brief but Adam Sandler is a comedy actor I've never warmed too . I find his performances very repetitive and formulaic and this movie is no different . I will say that it's not helped by he fact that I re-watched MEET THE PARENTS a comedy that improves on multiple re-viewings and stars Ben Stiller a very similar but superior comedy actor to Mr Sandler</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Likable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can understand why Big Daddy or Adam Sandler mayn't be for everybody. I am not a fan of Adam Sandler and Big Daddy while a likable movie and one of Sandler's better films could have been a little more. Sandler himself while the character takes a while to warm to is good here, as are the supporting cast, the kid in particular is very cute rather than annoying. Apart from an occasionally predictable story, some uneven pacing and one or two slapstick moments that are more cringe-worthy than funny, Big Daddy has a heartfelt and entertaining story with some scenes that did touch me, nice production values and soundtrack, a fun script, good direction and some slapstick and gross-out moments that worked out better than anticipated. All in all, a likable film. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What does it take to grow up?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adam Sandler is an immature New Yorker with no intentions of growing up. One day a little boy is abandoned at his apartment. He gets the idea, that if he adopts the child; he can get in good graces with his girlfriend. She thinks he is not responsible enough in his current life style. Typical monkey see, monkey do. This is funnier that I thought it would be, because I am not a Sandler fan. "Potty" language gets tiresome in a hurry. Decent performances by Jon Stewart, Joey Lauren Adams and Rob Schneider. Director Dennis Dugan plays a small part as a rattled Trick or Treat giver. If you like 'em cute and funny, don't miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Daddy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like a good comedy, with a good star, and a good cute story, then you will probably love this film. Sonny Koufax (Adam Sandler) is the lazy school graduate with a nice apartment, a couple of good friends, and a pretty lame job as a toll booth collector. His life is changed though when one day a man asking for his friend Kevin Gerrity (Jon Stewart) brings a kid, Julian McGrath (twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse), and until he can get a new family (the mother dies soon), he is stuck with him. Julian does for a while continue to be quite annoying, with lots of peeing and puking, but the longer he stays, the more Sonny begins to bond with him. He settles on not bossing him around too much, and letting Julian, or new name 'Frankenstien' makes his own good decisions. Oh before I mention this part, I should say his ex-girlfriend Vanessa (Kristy Swanson) left him and is now with an old guy, anyway, Julian also helps Sonny to find his new love with Layla Maloney (Joey Lauren Adams), sister of the girl who hates his guts, Corinne Maloney (George of the Jungle's Leslie Mann). Troubles start to unravel though when the guy at the adoption agency finds out Sonny was pretending to be Kevin, and Julian is taken away till the "big case" to decide custody. Only lawyer Layla, his friends and father Lenny Koufax (Joseph Bologna) can help Sonny get the right to keep Julian in his custody, but it is from the impersonating that he cannot keep him, and Kevin, the biological father gets him, but don't worry, Sonny and Julian stay in touch. Also starring Josh Mostel as Arthur Brooks, Allen Covert as Phil D'Amato, Rob Schneider as Nazo, Peter Dante as Tommy Grayton, Jonathan Loughran as Mike and Steve Buscemi as Homeless Guy. The gross jokes are great, it is a touching story, and both Sandler and the Sprouses are great characters. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overly sentimental, crass and with far too few laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sonny is dumped by his girlfriend for a lack of ambition in his life. A day later he has a five year old turn up on his doorstep - the unknown son of Sonny's friend Kevin. In an attempt to show how responsible he is, Sonny lies to social security and takes Julian in as his own boy. However over the time together, Sonny comes to love Julian - making it much harder when the authorities eventually realise he is not who he claims to be.While I dislike Adam Sadler films on the basis of them being generally silly and stupid, more often than not I end up laughing at them. While his humour is juvenile, sometimes it can be imaginative and so off-the-wall as to force me to laugh!' However I was surprised to see how few of these moments there were in this film. Instead the film seems to have aimed for a more sentimental approach and, in doing this, it fails really badly. The whole film becomes overly cute - sickly rather than involving or moving.There are a few moments that are very funny but these exist in the daft characters that usually inhabit Sadler films. Here it is with Nazo and Steve Buscemi's homeless guy. The rest of the film just doesn't work and is only really funny in a dumb, rather uninspired way - which did absolutely nothing for me. Aside from the two funny characters the rest were pretty vapid and lacking any twists or weirdness in them to make them funny - like I said, it felt like Sadler was very keen to make a mainstream movie that upped the family emotions for the Saturday night crowd. Sadly this robbed this film of any of the unique humour that I felt worked in his films.Sadler is pretty poor in this film. A lot of the time he isn't very funny and actually comes off being irritating and immature. Acting like a jerk with a child is not particularly funny or endearing. To this end Adams' character is even worse, as she falls for him - and Adams, (cute as she is) cannot convince. Stewart is OK but has little screen time. The Sprouse twins look very alike and also add the quality of neither being able to act. They place Julian far too cutesy and unlikeable. Would have been much better if they had been realer kids as opposed to the saccharine creations that Hollywood spits out all too often. Mostel is a nice inclusion, as is Schneider but the film is stolen by Buscemi, who was the only character to really make me laugh consistently.Overall this should still please Sadler fans as they tend to have a very high threshold when it comes to his films. However for me the funny elements of Sadler's films seems to have been really scaled back and all that was left was this rather stale and unfunny humour that traded on sickly sentimentality and cute kids.</fullReview>
