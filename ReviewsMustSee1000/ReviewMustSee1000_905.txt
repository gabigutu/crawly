		<shortDescription>Awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who has experienced addiction in their lives, whether your own or someone close to you, will find this film cutting. It is not about the reasons leading to addiction or the recovery, rather it is about the experience of the addiction in its raw reality. Even if you have not experienced addiction in your life, the story is worthwhile and the photography stellar. Ryan Gosling is the perfect portrait of a good person who got lost. His portrayal of a crack head is almost too good. The dialog is not pretentious or assuming and not overused. The story unfolds itself in a very natural manner. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty and sensitive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in Brooklyn, New York where he currently lives, Ryan Fleck's first full-length feature, Half Nelson, is a gritty, sensitive, and emotionally harrowing film that meticulously avoids the inspirational clichés of many teacher-student films and the obligatory violence of films set in the ghetto. The title is derived from a wrestling move in which you turn an attacker's strength back on him. In the case of Dan Dunne (Ryan Gosling), an idealistic eight-grade history teacher in an inner city school, he turns the attack on himself, inspiring his students by day and drugging himself at night with crack cocaine.Dan is a well-liked teacher and basketball coach whose parents (Deborah Rush and Jay O. Sanders) were liberal activists during the 60s and 70s, participating in protests against the Vietnam War but have now substituted alcoholism for political passion. Like his parents, he wants to make an impact on the world but is disillusioned with the current political climate and, out of frustration and fatigue, (like many on the Left today) has drifted into a self-induced stupor. Believing in social justice and that society can be changed through education, he teaches history, to the chagrin of the school's administrator, in the form of Hegelian dialectic, showing that change results from a clash of opposites.Dan shows his students videos of seminal events from the last fifty years such as the 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education ruling that paved the way for desegregation of the schools, clips from the civil rights movement, and Mario Savio speaking on the Berkeley campus during the Free Speech Movement. To its credit, the events in the film do not occur in a political vacuum but attempts to tie in the failed protests of the Left to Dan's drug habit are not entirely persuasive. Dunne's life begins to spiral out of control when one of his students, thirteen-year old Drey (Shareeka Epps), discovers him in the girl's bathroom passed out from ingesting cocaine. Instead of becoming frightened or angry, Drey brings him water and helps him to gradually come down from his high.Drey comes from a family in which her mother works a double shift and is rarely at home, her father is out of town, and her older brother is in prison for selling drugs, but she is mature and street-wise beyond her age. She promises to keep his secret and both find that their unlikely friendship satisfies an emotional need that Drey cannot find with her classmates and Dan cannot find with other adults. He is dating a fellow teacher (Monique Curnen) but his behavior with her is erratic and his political speeches and drug habits soon turn her off. A former girl friend from his period of rehabilitation (which he said didn't work for him) tells him that she is now getting married which pushes him further into a downward trajectory.The emotional highlight of the film is a confrontation between Dunne and Frank (Anthony Mackie), a suave drug dealer and associate of Drey's older brother who recruits Drey to be his collector. While Dan wants to steer Drey in the right direction, he is hardly a role model and the results, while promising, are inconclusive. Although the premise of the film is somewhat implausible, Gosling's performance of the charming but flawed teacher is completely credible, so nuanced and touching that we root for him in spite of his capacity for self-destruction. Shareeka Epps is equally convincing in her powerfully understated performance as his tough but sensitive young friend. Co-written by Anna Boden and supported by an outstanding original score by Broken Social Scene, Half Nelson "stands and delivers" one of the finest films of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If the strength of the medium of film is to relay meaning which cannot be expressed in words, then I don't think a review of this film on my part would be worth much. In the spirit of keeping things trite, let me just say I have seen quite a few films, quite a few classics, quite a few masterpieces, and frankly, none of them have moved me as much as this film did. How the BRILLIANT director/writers whom I'm sure we have not seen the last of, managed to weave together seamlessly political commentary, commentary on the nature of the modern family/relationships, existential struggles, racial tensions and ironies, and the very struggles with which we are born by simply being human, is beyond me. The end result was nothing short of a masterpiece. This movie will make you think, feel, and hope. Perfection projected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awaking To Ryan Gosling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ryan Gosling made happen what happens only once every so often. Made me look at what I seen before under a new magnifying light. He took me with him and showed me, with the most astonishing clarity, the complexity of a talented man dragged down by a legacy of good intentions and addiction. We're permitted to visit his family once and we understand what he's fighting with without any weapons. He doesn't blame anyone but he's the result of his own DNA and he knows it. His bright moments, the explanation of what History is for instance, is a glimpse into the man he could actually be, fully. The humanity that Ryan Gosling lends to his character on his darker moments it's as chillingly real as it is moving. The chemistry he establishes with the wonderful Shareeka Epps is as powerful as the one he established with me. I want to meet him, I want to meet Dan and while I was thinking that I realize I know him already. He lives next door to me, he's related to me, I was his friend. This is what superb performances do. They re-awake you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HALF NELSON...A Ryan Gosling Film Triumph</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ryan Gosling delivers a performance in HALF NELSON that is a marvel to watch and to see the talent which this young man/actor brings to the film and screen. Every frame delivers the intensity and drama within this young teacher's life and the issues he handles with his addiction and how he strives to reach his students in the classroom through honesty, humor and the lessons of history delivered on screen. Just watching Gosling in every frame is a triumph in what character development is all about, along with the brilliance of his performance. Gosling adds HALF NELSON to his outstanding work in the films THE UNITED STATES OF LELAND and the gorgeous NOTEBOOK.Shareeka Epps as a young, struggling student, is a perfect foil to Gosling, and her intelligence and strength matches that of Gosling as they both deliver scenes that are memorable and tremendous. From the classroom to the basketball court, to the painful addiction scenes, Epps and Gosling make HALF NELSON come alive with anger, pain and the true pathos of life represented in America today.With the final scene in the film, one can only hope that the characters may move from despair into lives which might give them a sense of hope, and finally a chance, as with the lessons of history, to move beyond their unhappy past into a brighter and more rewarding future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not One False Note in this Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Half Nelson" is a spare, original story with exquisitely natural and fresh performances delivered by Ryan Gosling, Shareeka Epps and Anthony Mackie. The film covers ground somewhat like what we've seen in "To Sir, With Love," "Dangerous Minds," "The Blackboard Jungle" and other inner-city school dramas. Only this film focuses on the lives of one teacher and student in an intimate and up-close way. "Half Nelson" looks at specific lives and does not generalize. There is little exposition, and so much of what we learn about the characters is deduced from how they said something, rather than what they said. At times, I found myself laughing and smiling through what is a rather disturbing story because of the way the characters react to the circumstances they find themselves in.I can't say enough good things about this film and highly recommend it because it is well conceived, directed and performed.I hope it receives support and recognition during the film award season so that a wider audience will find and see this independent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The litmus of test of good art is in how it affects you. I saw this film yesterday and still can not stop dissecting and discovering new aspects of the story. There is a truth in this film that can't be put into words. This is the sort of film that needs to be seen by everybody. The frailty of being human is never so more eloquently laid on film than in this movie(and I'm not just talking Ryan Gosling here). The writing/directing team need to be looked at for academy award nomination. This is some of the best American film has to offer. Casting for this film I can imagine must have been difficult, the choices made were nothing short of perfection. Shareeka Epps, Ryan Gosling and Anthony Mackie all deserve Academy award nominations. Look at this movie Hollywood this is what film is supposed to be. This movie will stay with me forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saving Oneself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ryan Gosling gives an off-the-charts, startling, emotionally charged performance as Dan Dunne, a young and unhappy man who is disenchanted with the world and himself.The camera follows every emotion that surfaces in Dan's mind and face and soul; we watch him spend every waking moment pondering life and its intricate hypocrisies, intolerance, and continuous disappointments, we watch him spend every waking moment pondering his own personal failings and let-downs, we watch him spend every waking moment trying to escape his anguish through drug abuse, and we watch him spend every waking moment mentally and physically punishing himself for his failings by engaging in drug abuse.In addition to the abuse of drugs, his emotional decline is accelerated by his career as a history teacher (and coach) in an inner-city run-down school where a few, if any, students graduate highschool, let alone advance to college. We readily discern that he has given up all attempts at trying to reach out and inspire his students to fight against the injustices and misinformation that exist in the world.His mental anguish and desolation and severe alienation, melded with rampant drug use, has nearly destroyed him.His only hope of survival is being inspired by one of his own students, Drey - whom he has made an incongruous connection with - to save himself.As Drey (Shareeka Epps) struggles to accept Dan's failings - in the hope that a friendship with him will help both of them overcome their circumstances - she unwittingly leads Dan further down the path of self-destruction, which can only end with a clarifying moment of salvation or untimely death...Half Nelson is a masterpiece film, emotionally purgative and hypnotically realistic; its depiction of people who only experience fleeting moments of happiness in a retrogressive, bleak world is so realistic that it is visually and spiritually and emotionally soul-shattering.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 'dialectics' indie filmmakers Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden created in "Half Nelson" is realized by Ryan Gosling and Shareeka Epps' unarguably nuanced performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ryan Gosling is truly amazing in his film role deliveries. His breakthrough role in "The Believer" 2001 was explosively intense. He consistently gives integral reflective portrayals, even for a departure romantic role in director Nick Cassavetes' "The Notebook" 2004, he was absolutely convincing as Noah who loves Rachel McAdam's Allie to the core. Here in "Half Nelson," he appears to disappear into Dan Dunne, a high school teacher with an ideal and a crack addiction problem. That sure sounds contradictory in terms: a teacher being a role model, while drug addiction a totally unacceptable behavior. As Dunne wrote on the blackboard in the beginning: 'Dialectics,' the film "Half Nelson" is in itself dialectics demonstrated.Gosling's Mr. Dunne the history 'teach' doubling also as basketball coach, meeting (a solid matching delivery from) Shareeka Epps' Drey, the 13-year old student who 'found' him and 'witnessed' his secret - theirs is a relationship, naturally portrayed, of two 'opposing' forces as dialectics as can be. I felt Drey is the primary force that 'helped' Dunne's secondary force to yield and together, they created a contradiction anew as life goes on.I remember from a 1969 book, a quote that might describe the heart of "Half Nelson": "Contradictions are the source of all movement and of all life. All things are in themselves contradictory and it is this principle, more than any other, which expresses the essence of things."In a way, contradictory yet similar: Dunne and Drey both are 'on their own' trying to hang on, to manage the conflicts in their life's journey. Do we need all the answers in life? Do we have to know why someone behave as he/she does or something happen as it did? Director Ryan Fleck and co-writer/editor/producer Anna Boden tried not to 'over-explain anything'. Sometimes the answer can simply be: "I don't know." "Half Nelson" is an ambitious film. Besides 'comments' on educational system, single parent family strife, Dan's addiction predicament, the script also managed to include political viewpoints unobtrusively expressed through talking heads of single student reciting historical civil rights movement events. The 'R' rating does indicate some intimate scenes, clever inter-cuts juxtaposing what the two forces were each doing at the moment. Music (by "Broken-Social-Scene") is timely applied at certain segments but sparingly. Well-rounded supporting cast, especially Anthony Mackie as Frank the 'friendly' dealer who may want to do right by Drey but only in the way he knows how within the realms of selling drugs (reminds me of w-d Boaz Yakin's "Fresh" 1994, brilliant debut performance by Sean Nelson as the 12-year old interacting with a dealer 'mentor').Kudos to all involved on "Half Nelson". The film was shot in Brooklyn, New York. Thanks to ThinkFilm for being the distributor (documentary: Spellbound; Murderball; March of the Penguins; drama: The Last Kiss - Italy; Kontroll - Hungary; Gus Van Sant's Gerry).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Half Nelson--a moving and thought-provoking film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Half Nelson twice at the San Francisco International Film Festival and liked it even better the second time. Each actor is memorable and convincing. Ryan Gosling is amazing as Dan, a charismatic but drug addicted teacher?an academy award level performance. Gosling was voted best actor at Sundance, 2006, in an IndieWire poll, which also picked Half Nelson as best film. Shareeka Epps is equally riveting as Drey, the student who learns his secret, voted best actress in the Sundance IndieWire poll. Epps also led the list of six of this year's breakthrough performances by the New York Times. Anthony Mackie is anything but predictable as a local drug dealer. Half Nelson packs an emotional wallop, but also has solid political and philosophical substance. Here are comments from ten viewers at the SF Festival where it won the International Critics Prize (FIPRESCI). This prize is established at international film festivals, and its aim is to promote film art and to particularly encourage new and young cinema."Intense, deep, human, scary, dark, sad, happy, hopeful, depressing, awesome. . ." "Great story. Great film. I enjoyed it a lot. A lot to learn from this film." "Wonderful character development (and great actors!) Very real movie." "Makes you think. Loved it." "Great acting to go along with the wonderful writing. I only hope they both make it through (Drey and Dan)." "Beautifully shot, beautifully acted, and just like life in which ideals can float on top of emotional turmoil and children teach teachers." "Outstanding. Very creative and absorbing." "Enjoyed the film, especially the close shots, which added to my initial discomfort and eventual resonance with the themes of closeness and discomfort." "Great movie. Lots of complex characters. Loved the historical political references." "Half Nelson isn't half bad! In fact, it's rather perfect."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>half nelson needs t o be reexamined</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been reading many reviews about this film for weeks so I was anxious to see it. I was hoping for something new.There seems to be a very prominent but hard to overlook attraction by young, talented, new white filmmakers taking up the subjects of urban black and Latino lives as fodder for either liberal expression, societal outrage or possible fetishism. From "Maria Full of Grace", "GirlsTown", "Everyday People" (HBO), "Quinceanera" now "Half Nelson", we have story lines looking at underprivileged black and Latino folk through a prism that seems to be very similar. In these stories there is a little sadness, some anthropological observation, a fair amount of non judgmental characterizations and realism but as independent and daring as these films claimed to be, they are no better than watching "Dangerous Minds", a studio film of a few years ago. Don't get me wrong, I'm not mad at you. Most black filmmakers seem to be preoccupied these days with the three p's-Tyler Perry, Tyrese and taking the money so it's hard to complain when other filmmakers find the stories of black and Latino culture such a rich place to be.So here comes "Half Nelson" as the latest in this stream. I really wanted to like this one but it falls into the same unfortunate traps as the others. I'm watching this film and seeing the absent of any black adult with any speaking part with a positive image for this young girl to benefit from. Ryan Gosling is a gifted and natural artist and Epps is quite good and real but the choices the writer and director make are choices that show where they are coming from. Dan brings in the light because the lives of the kids in his class are in the dark. With Epps' mom working so much are we to believe Epps is not loved? Hard to know. Her father is not around but apparently without a voice or point of view and dogged by her mother. Her brother is in prison but he doesn't seem to be evolved enough to realize that he must do differently when he gets out. And then there's Mackie's character, a good guy but he's selling product in the community. The man's a businessman but not quite the positive role model you'd like to have any kid look up to.The polyglot nature of our world gives us all configurations of relationships in how people find family, opportunity and friendship but I never found what Dan is going through in his addiction particularly profound or revealing. Sure he's high half the time, sure he's aimless and passionate like a lot of aimless and educated young white and black folk who don't know what to do and how to affect change in this world but when you make a movie and lay your hero in a world he knows little about, give the world a little more credit. Switch the situation around. take out the drugs and go back thirty years and you have "To Sir with Love". The only difference, Poitier's character had a chip on his shoulder not a monkey on his back and the kids he was dealing with and Lulu's character particularly didn't want to take that chip off, she wanted to learn from him. I don't know what this 13 year old learns from Dan. Maybe she's learned how to take care of a guy who needs someone to take care of him, which really sets her up for an unfortunate job title in her future. We don't know what she dreams about for her future. We have no idea. She sure has not learned much about the civil rights movement in what is shown in the film. He is trying to impress on the kids to expand their minds in a semi Socratic educational style but these kids are sponges and a point of view from a teacher is not actually teaching. I want to know the filmmaker's point in making this film. I'm really curious. That's my two cents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Half Nelson is stunning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to drive to the other side of town to see this movie, and it was well worth the drive. Over twelve hours after seeing the movie, I am still feeling the emotion of it. Ryan Gosling. as teacher Dan Dunne, is real, authentic and warm. Sharecka Epps, as student Drey, is stunningly mature in the way she can totally convey emotion by the expressions on her face. I found that much of the movie's drama was played out in their eyes. Watching Dan and Drey learn to be in a relationship together was powerful, emotional and sweet. This is a movie about life at its rawest, and how two people, both human and very real, learn to live in the rawness and beauty of life. It is a movie about hope. One of the best movies I have seen in a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Biggest Let Down of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like The New World last year, this movie was the biggest let down of the year. Here's why:First of all, the premise was intriguing, and I wanted to see this movie really badly. While watching it, I kept saying that it would get better soon, that the premise was still building. But as the clock ticked, nothing was happening. It's about a guy who's a teacher that snorts as well, and what he does. However, he just hangs around, and doesn't do anything. At the end a bit of a resolution happens, but it isn't really anything. While Shareeka Epps, the young actress in the film, looks like she has potential, she is given few lines and all she does is WATCH her teacher get worse and ask him to stop futilely.Finally it ended and I knew I didn't enjoy. Then it took me a second: what is the title about? Nobody is named Nelson, nobody gets put in a Half Nelson, and it seems off. People claim it is a metaphor for the character's situation, which in my opinion makes no sense because all his problems are self inflicted. That doesn't make sense.Skip this one, it's a let down, and a movie that didn't need to be made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Addictively compelling turns by Gosling and Epps; one of the year's best films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HALF NELSON (2006) **** Ryan Gosling, Shareeka Epps, Anthony Mackie, Tina Holmes, Deborah Rush, Jay O. Sanders. Gosling gives one of the year's best performances and an Oscar worthy turn as a Brooklyn high school history teacher whose unorthodox teaching methods and charming personality are belied by his addiction to crack that is discovered by one of his students (newcomer Epps, in an amazingly natural debut and should also be nominated as Best Supporting Actress). Instead of a melodramatic life-lesson awkward approach the film focuses on the unlikely friendship bonding between the two not-so- dissimilar characters who each are fumbling to some sort of redemption. Novice filmmaker Ryan Fleck and his co-screen writing significant other Anna Boden craft a well-thought and well-fleshed-out character study into the minds of an addict and the results of his actions with well-timed sequences that flow fluidly from one set-piece to the next effortlessly with sprinkles of humor and a stand-out supporting turn by Mackie as a neighborhood pusher friend of Epps' that easily could've been a stereotype but is nicely sorted out into a complex narrative device. One of the year's best films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Negative portrayal of both NYC teachers and inner-city students</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a NYC public school teacher and a black woman, I know not where to begin with the faults of this film. It is yet another portrayal of the great white emancipator who sacrifices himself to teach the poor colored children of the inner city. He disregards the civil rights curriculum provided him by a black principal in favor of his own agenda. In each of the teaching scenes, he is presented as the fountain of knowledge, giving the children all they need to know about the world. He discusses change with them, nay, revolution, but the students themselves are never depicted as empowered. With exception to Shareeka Epps, who is probably changed for the worse, the children are pawns in his power play to "change the world." This brings me to the relationship between Gosling and Epps. She has but one positive black adult in her life (her, of course, overworked and underpaid single-parent mother) and yet she is most affected by a junkie, white male teacher, who adopts a "black-cent" and coaches girls' basketball. She, in essence, becomes his mammy, caring for him and nursing him even after he calls her -- a 13-yr. old -- a "bitch" and grinds on her during a school dance. The "mammy" itself makes an appearance in her drug-dealer, pseudo-big brother's home and its significance is never explained to her, perhaps because the writers themselves don't understand it. Or maybe they do, and "Half-Nelson" is their ode to it.All in all, this film perpetuates the theory that liberal white teachers are doing children of color favors by "sacrificing their ideals" (as stated in the "Story" section of the official website) to teach in inner-city schools. It is riddled with inaccuracies about teaching in NYC, i.e. his being alone in a school; teachers are NEVER left alone in schools, particularly after school events. It also perpetuates the theory that inner-city children are surrounded by exclusively negative influences, from family members to neighbors, and are waiting for someone to step in and rescue them from themselves.Critics who believe this film is inspirational need to examine themselves and what they really think about their relationships with and responsibilities to blacks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The inner city teacher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The job of a teacher in an inner city school deserves to be recognized as it is not an easy job by any means. Dan Dunne, who is a history teacher, and a coach of the girls' basketball team, in addition of the difficulties of his daily life, has an added problem in that he is an addict of cocaine and other substances.As if that weren't enough, his life is a mess as well. It shows in the way he lives, his messy apartment, the way he keeps himself. That doesn't mean he is not an intelligent person, but drugs have taken a lot from him. Dan is a man with leftist values. We see it in the way he teaches his class about recent events that relate to his almost all black students.Drey, a sensitive student, appears to be a loner. She has seen what the drugs did to his brother, now in jail for dealing. He has been put away for a while, but ratting on Frank, the big man that used him to distribute the dope. Her single working mother, Karen, is having a tough time making ends meet with a job that doesn't pay well.Drey sees in her teacher Don a flawed role model. While Don is kind to the girl, she realizes he has a huge problem as an addict. Their relationship comes to a standstill when the girl, who has decided to work for Frank, comes bringing cocaine to a house where she sees Don in a horrible state. Their relationship will no doubt suffer on account of this experience. Surprisingly, the film ends in a hopeful note as Drey comes to visit Don to share a quiet moment with him.Ryan Fleck directed with a keen understanding of the situation at hand. Mr. Fleck also contributed to the screenplay with Anna Boden. The film is painful to watch, at times. Yet, it doesn't depress us the way we thought it would. Ryan Gosling gives a sensitive portrait of the man who has stooped low and doesn't know how to climb back up. Shareeka Epps also made an impression as Drey. Anthony Mackey, a fine actor makes an excellent Frank. The same can be said about Karen Chilton who plays Drey's mother. Deborah Rush has a chance to shine as Don's mother."Half Nelson" shows a realistic portrait of the world it depicts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, Sensitive Film About Addiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ryan Gosling is such a hottie, and such a good actor, he could be working full time as a Hollywood heart-throb. Thank goodness he chose to take part in this somewhat small and controversial movie.A story of two people floating about, wanting to do the right thing, but truly adrift--not knowing how to get there.One is a child, bombarded by the desire of others to get her into the drug business, and the other is her teacher, a drug addict who feels it's his duty to protect her... But of course, he can't, because he is an addict himself.The acting is phenomenal all around, and the story is absolutely beautiful. Anyone who has ever experienced addiction, or been close to someone in that situation, will absolutely love this story.It's a profoundly real story... and it's a story of hope.Watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nelson's lessons linger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Half Nelson, the first feature by director Ryan Fleck, steers clear of the inspiring clichés of teacher-student films and the usual violence of films set in the ghetto.Half Nelson is a character study, with a meager plot stretched into a one-act film. Not to say this is a bad thing. If one wishes to be thoroughly entertained, steer clear of this film. If one wishes to have a comfortable time at the movies, steer clear of this film. However, if one wishes to view a unique and risky example of independent cinema, see this film.Any viewer can tell how much blood and sweat went into making Half Nelson, which was shot on 16mm for less than $1 million. Ryan Gosling is truly admirable for seeing something in this screenplay. After breaking viewers' hearts in The Notebook, Gosling carries this film. Gosling plays Dan Dunne, a Brooklyn middle-school teacher who is addicted to crack cocaine, with admirable subtlety. It's a performance that will make the audience cringe with anguish and sympathy as Gosling takes one self-destructive step after another.It isn't surprising to hear that Half Nelson was once a short film by Fleck titled Gowanus, Brooklyn. That film starred the young actress Shareeka Epps as a bright, tough African-American girl named Drey in Dunne's class. The film characterized her unlikely friendship with Dunne, after she discovered his crack habit. Epps reprises her role in Half Nelson, and is astonishingly good in her feature debut, giving a real, down-to-earth performance. Rounding out the main cast is the charismatic Anthony Mackie as Frank, a local drug dealer who is actually nice.Anna Boden's screenplay, co-written by Fleck, is filled with ranges of intensity, awkwardness, sadness, and humor. Fleck veers from the norm in his direction, giving an extremely claustrophobic look into the lives of the characters.Half Nelson, although somewhat painful to watch, will stay with you for a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A drug addicted teacher is trying to redeem himself and recover but falls further into his addiction.A young African-American girl is being drawn to the wrong side as she is left alone.They both have one thing in common.They are alone and lost and they are full of despair.They are searching for a friend that understands them,a friend they can share their feelings with.They befriend but can't maintain their friendship.This relationship is often misunderstood or misinterpreted but they know that they are friends and they are trying to help one another.But they are separated by their conditions.Dan is deteriorating in his recovery from drugs.And Drey is further isolated and drawn to the wrong side of life.But in the end they find each other and see themselves as each other's hope.Everything about this film is real.It's emotions are real,characters are real,situations are real.You can easily relate and connect with the characters and the situations they are in.It's extracted from our everyday lives.And it's an inspirational film with hope spreading out.It's not one of those clichéd and overly familiar tales about hope and redemption and finding oneself.It's unconventional approach makes it a standout film.A wonderful character study and compelling drama.It's disturbing to see one go through so much personal suffering.The nightmare of losing yourself.Some of the moments in the film really are hard-pressed but they were necessary.And they are done with mastery.This film is bound to bore those who look for those clichéd and conventional inspirational fares.But for those who are looking to get rid of those clichéd inspirational dramas,this is worth every look.It's the kind of film that keeps you going.Rich in its performances and film-making,Half Nelson is another classic example of why Hollywood is the best.Independent cinema should be more recognized and it is.Gosling and Epps are a revelation.The chemistry and their individual performances are strikingly authentic and emotional.Mackie is brilliant as well.Fascinating look at life and its tragedies and hopes.Beautifully directed and written,with a different cinematography to aid the film.Its philosophical terms and historical references makes it a wider experience.I really loved its pacing and its authenticity.A really touching and feel good drama that must be experienced,thoughtful and intense.Definitely one of this years best Indie offerings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film of The Year Thus Far. Brilliantly Subtle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there was ever proof that a "Best Picture" candidate didn't need to be an epic and ambitious film, "Half Nelson" is all the proof one needs. Simply put, "Half Nelson" is nothing short of perfect. Ryan Gosling gives the most mature performance I've ever seen him give. Gosling delivers a constantly believable, incredibly complex, wondrously subtle, and utterly breathtaking performance as Dan Dunne, a crack-addicted teacher who likes teaching in unconventional manners. Shareeka Epps is just as superb as one of Gosling's students, whom he befriends. What follows is an authentic and heartbreaking journey that shows how life in the big city can be gritty, hypocritical, and ultimately tragic. There hasn't been a better film so far this year, and unless "The Prestige", "Flags of Our Fathers", "Babel", or some other sleeper arrives in theaters before January, "Half Nelson" will surely be the definitive film of 2006. A masterpiece of subtle proportions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great film, one of the best Indies ever. Ryan Goslings performance is so superb, I give him a nomination right now. He portrays a teacher who although he has charm and great skills he basically is on a DOWNER. The constant drug use is extremely realistic, and crucial to his personality--my wife (a long time teacher) despised him, but RG"s performance is so GREAT you still like him, and I at least, rooted for him. To see such a gifted charming guy ruin his life and maybe some of his students is stuff of high tragedy. The rest of the cast including his Co-star is uniformly superb, cast well, and shot well. Beware, this is not in any sense UPLIFTING, if you are in a bad mood, or emotional it could be too intense for you. The great thing about indie films is they transport you into ordinary human lives, and yet give you Drama worthy of ANY genre.. The ac tors writers and directors make this an intense compelling brilliant and long lasting film about true human emotions, relationships and LIFE itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film almost has a kind of documentary feel to it, with the grittiness of the shots and the time it takes to show how the characters feel about each other and what happens to them.Saw the film last night and had really vivid dreams this morning, after I was up half the night thinking about it and how well-imagined it was. I started lamenting the loss of good American film: this film affected me more than just about any film I've seen in months, and why is that, exactly? What I liked most about the film was that it didn't resort to the easy platitudes of teaching, or drug addiction, or relationships. The film let each of these elements be multifaceted and complex. It dances around a certain line of discomfort, but lets the discomfort stand. I also liked that it -looked- like it was filmed in New York: it looked foreign and familiar at the same time.</fullReview>

The film should be recognized at all award ceremonies covering movies from 2006. I am not able to imagine liking a film more this year.I cannot bring up a negative trait of the film, even if I tried my hardest. Fleck's depiction of drugs and normal people is more accurate than anything I have ever seen. There is no excuse for not seeing "Half Nelson."

Indie films are often overlooked due to the lack of money they have for advertising and publicity, but this one was as good as any Hollywood movie. the acting is superb; the two stars were Shareeka and Ryan gosling. i never knew Ryan gosling could play such a difficult role. i was surprised by how much of the movie is carried out with long silences and head shots. the movie is about its content not its budget or how many things blow up. it is a character driven story where you get to know two very different yet similar people.The relationship that develops through out the movie is touching and inspiring. although this is a more serious movie, it definitely has some hilarious moments( in my opinion). I hope anyone who has heard about this movie doesn't hesitate to see it , because..... well for the reasons i said above .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Ryan Gosling stars as Dan Dunne, a young teacher whose edgy yet brilliant approach to history inspires his inner-city students to think for themselves. But, outside the classroom, Dan's life is spiraling out of control. Wrestling with inner demons and nursing a serious drug habit, Dan finally hits rock bottom - witnessed by one of his troubled students, Drey (Shareeka Epps). With an unlikely friendship built on a shared secret, Dan tries to steer her away from a small-time drug dealer (Anthony Mackie). But no matter which way they turn to survive, their lives will change forever," according to the film's official synopsis."Half Nelson" suffers from too much of the wobbly "hand held" camera technique which, frankly, isn't necessary to make the film look more realistic. Yet, the story, by director Ryan Fleck and partner Anna Boden, and characterizations are good enough to overcome this distraction. The marvelously written screenplay is full of nuances, which serve the main point - showing the interconnecting ways drug addiction can infect the human spirit, when people like those played by Mr. Gosling and Ms. Epps are needed to play much more positive roles in a troubled world.Gosling's "Academy Award" nomination for "Best Actor" is clearly understandable; and, Epps could have easily won some "Best Supporting Actress" consideration. At least, the "Independent Spirit Awards" recognized the memorable pair's delicately played teacher/student roles. Everyone else in the cast is excellent, as well. And, the non-melodramatic ending leaves "Half Nelson" full of hope.******* Half Nelson (3/22/06) Ryan Fleck ~ Ryan Gosling, Shareeka Epps, Anthony Mackie, Monique Gabriela Curnen</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ryan Gosling Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dan (Ryan Gosling) is a drug-addicted high school history teacher. Drey (Shareeka Epps) is one of his students, who can see herself possibly following in her brother's footsteps and working for a local drug dealer. Dan and Drey strike up a friendship.Dan is a smart, fundamentally decent man leading a life of quiet desperation. His ex-gf, Rachel (Tina Holmes), tells him that some people get better, and Dan is adamant in his response. Not him. Change is not for him. To another girl, he explains how he tried rehab, but it doesn't work for him. And yet Dan's desire for change is shown in his lessons to his students. He constantly describes opposites - up and down, left and right - and talks about change. From one breath to your next breath, change has happened. And yet Dan's affliction just provides more and more of the same.The film is all about Ryan Gosling, who gives us a complete portrait of his character. You just can't take your eyes off of this guy. Whether babbling under the influence or talking with real passion to his students or just sitting quietly saying nothing at all, Gosling shows us a man, who has a lot to give, but is held down by his affliction. The out-of-nowhere flashes of humour and the many moments of vulnerability completely endear us to Dan. His friendship with Drey arouses moral instincts in him that brings his self-loathing and helplessness more to the surface. We understand Dan, and our understanding of him is mirrored in the eyes of all the supporting characters, played out by a perfect ensemble cast. So much is conveyed just in the briefest character exchanges. So the film succeeds with strong performances and making sure all the pieces fit together with respect and care. And yet the finished puzzle isn't really as gripping as it should be. Maybe because we've been through this material before, or maybe because this is a film that lives through its many small moments and observations. With tense character-driven material like this, I was sort of expecting more flash and meltdown, but this isn't that sort of film. This is a film, where you can admire the focus, commitment, and quality, but its a slow burn - not a big jolt to the system.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unremitting Study of Lives in the Balance with Genuinely Superb Work by the Leads</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two knockout performances dominate this uncompromising and emotionally visceral indie. Directed and co-written by first-time feature director Ryan Fleck, this 2006 drama pulls no punches and offers no cheap sentiment in the story of two people intractably bonded by their mutually desultory existences - Dan Dunne, a crack-addicted Brooklyn middle school history teacher, and Drey, a 13-year old student in his class burdened by an overworked mother, a brother in prison, and an insinuating drug dealer named Frank. Fleck and co-writer Anna Boden establish Dan's gifts as a teacher almost immediately as the character engages his class with natural ease. It becomes clear that this is not going to be a fish-out-of-water story but a more complex study of a man caught between his passion for teaching and his hopeless need for the next fix.Dan's self-defeating effort to separate the duality in his life is what provides the impetus of the plot, as there are no simple explanations offered for his drug-addled life until we catch a glimpse of his emotionally disconnected family later on. Much like what Vera Farmiga achieved in "Down to the Bone", Ryan Gosling dissects his character with textured precision and conviction. He honestly earns our attention and even our compassion despite the selfishness Dan displays at times. Matching Gosling all the way is novice Shareeka Epps, who plays Drey with almost unnerving steadiness. She affectingly conveys the self-protective insulation her character has against a world too ready to use her.Together Gosling and Epps remarkably achieve an unexpected symbiosis that makes Dan's and Drey's ongoing struggles palpable. The supporting cast is uniformly strong with effective turns by Anthony Mackie, who shows surprising depth in what could have been a stock villain role as Frank, and by Karen Chilton etching the regret and exhaustion in Drey's mother in just a few brief scenes. Even though the film was done on a miniscule budget, it doesn't feel cheap with particularly strong work found in Andrij Parekh's intentionally bleached-out cinematography. The 2007 DVD offers a nice, unassuming commentary track by Fleck and Boden, but the rest of the extras are not very interesting - a gag reel, three understandably deleted scenes and four extended scenes that really don't add much more insight. However, the film itself is exceptional work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bear with it...it truly is brilliant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Half Nelson, to be totally honest, does tend to drag you along because the theme and story definitely aren't gripping. In fact, here's the summary: A drug addict history teacher and a clever young black student develop a strong friendship and end up changing each other's lives. Sound boring? I thought so but the raving about Ryan Gosling and his Oscar nominated performance attracted me and plus I've got a lot of free time in my hands as well. By the way, he was brilliant for an actor of his experience and definitely deserved the nomination....but just the nomination since he really had no chance against Forest Whitaker (The Last King of Scotland). Anyway if you start watching the movie and you think "Damn! This is too slow and the plot isn't going anywhere" don't give up just bear with it till the end and I guarantee you'll feel fully satisfied and that you've just watched a brilliant piece of art. The message is another thing to rave about as well because the movie isn't only trying to tell the viewers that "drugs are bad...especially if you're a teacher" but also you'll note that the main character (Ryan) has no racial distinction. And he feels that Blacks and Whites shouldn't be judged differently and it will probably make anyone who watches it feel the same way....or at least most of us (I really can't imagine a member of the KKK's view of black people alter in the slightest after watching it.) But the message is powerful and beautiful and I felt very good inside after watching it. My point here is that don't only expect an amazing performance but also an amazing movie in general. I'd give it 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Remarkable Variation on the Teacher Saves Student Theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ryan Fleck's writing and directorial debut is sober and even somewhat glum, but it boasts a tremendous and committed performance from Ryan Gosling in the lead role; an understated and sweet performance from the young actress Shareeka Epps in a supporting role; and an intelligent, thoughtful, spare screenplay that avoids falling prey to easy sentiment.Gosling plays Dan Dunne, a young history teacher from a liberal family who himself has liberal ideas and a charismatic way with his students. They like him in a guarded way, despite the fact that he's white and part of the institution that most of them, black kids from an impoverished neighborhood, have been taught to distrust. Dan is filled with the kind of optimism that many of us had coming right out of college, when we cared passionately about our beliefs and believed we could make others care as much about them. However, Dan's promise as a teacher is severely limited by his addiction to crack, which consumes his personal life and turns his lectures into chaotic ramblings. One of his students, a quiet girl named Drey, finds Dan after school hours stoned in the girls' locker room, and an unlikely bond forms between the pair. Something about witnessing this intensely private and human side to her teacher makes Drey able to trust him and open up to him more than she can to anyone else in her immediate circle, which includes a well-intentioned but distracted mom, a brother in prison, and a no-good drug dealer friend of the family, who wants to put Drey to work delivering to customers. Meanwhile, something about the encounter works the same effect on Dan. It's as if being caught in the act removes the burden of secrecy, and he can let his guard down when with Drey. The two begin looking forward to their casual encounters and conversations, and each fills a void in the other's life.This isn't at all creepy or inappropriate. Drey may have a harmless crush on Dan in the way that young students often do on their teachers. Dan, for his part, becomes protective of Drey, and tries to convince her to stay away from the drug scene even as the example he sets conveys the exact opposite. He tenaciously clings to the belief that one man can indeed make a change even as the indifference and hardships of his immediate world tell him otherwise."Half Nelson" paints a grim and harrowing picture of drug addiction and loneliness, and much of it is painfully depressing. But there's a tremendous warmth working under the surface of Fleck's film which prevents it from feeling nihilistic. Dan and Drey are both good people, trying to make their way in a world that doesn't always reward them for simply being good. The conclusion of the film is only mildly uplifting. We have the feeling that Dan has weathered some sort of crisis and has made some realizations about himself and his addiction, but the movie ends before we see what he does with that insight. He may ultimately be o.k., or he may not. What's more important is that Drey will be o.k., and one of the things I liked most about "Half Nelson" was its suggestion that many times the most effective role models are those who show us who we DON'T want to be, rather than those who we want to emulate.Gosling proves himself to be a young actor to watch with his performance here. Not once does he step out of character, and he exhibits a tremendous screen presence. He's able to charm us as much as he is his students. Shareeka Epps has a sweet, warm quality to her. Most of the time she keeps her mouth set and rigid, and conveys the quality of someone who's determined to be disappointed in the world so that the world won't have a chance to disappoint her first. But every once in a while, a character will make her smile, and when she does, her face lights up the screen.This is a fine film and one that lingered in my head. Highly recommended.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unassuming yet fascinating character study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A charismatic elementary school teacher by day, and a self-destructive drug addict by night - right from its premise, Half Nelson makes its mark as one of the most intriguing and fascinating films of the year. While the storyline may seem to draw parallels to other such films of a conflicted mentor helping bright but underprivileged youths realise their true potential (ie: Finding Forrester), Half Nelson surpasses such clichés with its sheer unassuming honesty, leading to a very satisfying end result. The film may attract some negative attention for seeming slow moving and uneventful, and while it is true that the story does lag on occasion, the film is really more of a portrait than a narrative tale. The character of Dan Dunne and his interactions with his students are explored thoroughly by director Ryan Fleck's brilliant minimalist script, which remains wonderfully realistic, thankfully objective and endlessly interesting all the way through. Fleck deserves credit for avoiding passing judgement of Dune in every possible way, but instead merely presenting the character as he is, in a very matter of fact and objective fashion, making the story all the more compelling. Half Nelson doesn't necessarily beat the audience over the head with anti-drug sentiments, but instead merely presents the character as he is, and allows the audience to fill in their own blanks. Half Nelson makes no assumptions and places no blame, simply presenting the situation in a frank and objective fashion, which in itself is already laudable.Fleck may receive criticism for presenting the story from a detached, outsider perspective rather than drawing the audience intrusively into the story, allowing them to feel every moment of the characters' pain and hardships, but it is a bold touch which perfectly compliments the story, rather observing the situations of the characters in a non- judgemental, almost documentary style. The film also boasts simply fantastic cinematography, both capturing the character's drug-addled haze and transforming what could have been a dull and repetitive film to look at into one brilliantly and fascinatingly shot. These sort of quiet creative differences from typical mainstream films and highly innovative and compelling storytelling are what really set Half Nelson apart from other, similar films.Ryan Gosling is proving himself to be one of the most interesting and thoroughly watchable actors of his generation, and Half Nelson is no exception, boasting what is unquestionably his strongest performance to date. Rather than seeming like an elaborate archetype of a drug addict persona, his passionate but self destructive Dan Dunne bristles with sheer realism - this is a real guy we're watching, dealing with genuine problems in a consistently believable fashion. The magnitudes of emotion Gosling portrays simply by staring at the floor or frowning are testament to his incredible skill as a performer. Newcomer Shakeera Epps is also a fascinating watch, overcoming any badly written teenage archetypes to play an equally realistic and compelling student character. Her character's being drawn into Dunne's catastrophic social life is made entirely believable through the dedication and understated charisma of the two actors. Anthony Mackie also provides strong support as a somewhat clichéd but still believable warm hearted drug dealer and street heavy. Altogether, Half Nelson proves to be a consistently entertaining and interesting film, particularly by the incredibly strong lead performances and the tasteful and understated handling of a particularly delicate subject. Though it may lag on occasion, Half Nelson is quietly fascinating and unassumingly brilliant - one of the year's best films, and without question worth watching. -9/10</fullReview>

That's the story in the first hour, which was all I could manage. Sure, they've both got their problems and they interact with each other and their lovers and relatives respectively but not in any very meaningful or interesting way. Plus, it's a bunch of well-worn clichés, albeit done in a somewhat fresh and edgy way. There's a liberal Lefty teacher who 'gets' kids, a warm, funny kid in a dysfunctional black family, drugs are bad for you and your relationships, the school principal is a toughie, sports are about taking part and not winning, black neighbourhoods are scary for white drivers. In practice, the 'rebel' is a sweetie wrapped up in a candy floss film. That goes for the kid, too.</fullReview>

The acting is good by Gosling and the young girl but there is precious little character development or plot so you end up not knowing that much about them really and hence, caring what happened to them. I am a fairly patient person but I found myself fast forwarding scenes where gosling is staring at walls in his apartment or making tea.Even the ending summed up the film, you;d need a degree in psychology to really work out what it all means and I know a lot of people on here will say thats the point and "its open to interpretation" but thats a lot of hogwash.If you want to watch a flick about the effects of drug addiction try requiem for a dream or trainspotting, this will just bore the pants off you.</fullReview>

Though I thought the acting was exceptional, especially Ryan Gosling, the story itself and the characters was something I couldn't get into.Very simply, Ryan Gosling is an inner city junior high school teacher who looks very much like the kind that I would have liked to have had more of back in the day. He's a bright, witty guy who really does relate to his students even though he's white and they're mostly black.One of them discovers he's got a drug habit, Gosling scores from one of the local dealers in her neighborhood. As you can imagine things just aren't the same after that.Though his performance is exceptional and maybe even deserving of the Oscar nomination for Best Actor he got, I just could not get up any sympathy over him. He's upset over the state of things in the good old USA, well too bad, a lot of us are, very few of us turn to drugs as are chosen method of protest.In the end I could not figure out what the point of Half Nelson was. Fans of Ryan Gosling will probably like it though.</fullReview>

I wasn't particularly excited about the idea of student helps teacher instead of vice versa but I gave it a chance. Overall, I didn't have any problem with the performances. I just found the movie to be impossible. The classroom of unbelievably well-behaved middle school students existed only for the writer to make remarkably unsubtle points about opposing forces and change. The central character seemed to handle his addiction as a minor inconvenience. The student's home life was stereotypical. When I reached the point where I didn't care whether or not the student redeemed the teacher because all of the characters were impossible creations, I gave up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Half Nelson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Half Nelson, a hold in which a wrestler, from behind the opponent, passes one arm under the corresponding arm of the opponent and locks the hand on the back of the opponent's neck. The definition of this film corresponds perfectly with the situation that Daniel Dunn, played by Ryan Gosling, is strangled in. Shot in what seems to be inner-city New York, Ryan Gosling portrays a drug addicted junior high History teacher, who gets caught doing drugs by one of his students, Drey, played by Shareeka Epps, and from that point on, "Teach" and Drey continue to build an irregular relationship not knowing both individuals live similar yet contrasting lives. Directed by Ryan Fleck and Oscar nominated for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role, Ryan Gosling, this drama released in 2006 would have not been given the chance for an Academy Award if it wasn't for the hand-held camera shots and the parallel editing.Going into most pictures I set myself up ready for a formalistic type of film, the classic technique over content. However in Half Nelson, ninety-five percent of the movie is filmed in the hand-held camera view which suggests documentary footage in an uncontrolled setting. The movie is not a documentary, though the constant movement of the camera proposes the realistic aspect of the film and the intensity of all the characters. Adding to the intensity are the overused close-up and medium close-up shots, which expels the locale, therefore allows the viewer to focus on the expressions that the actors are producing; by doing this Ryan Gosling was able to get nominated for Best Actor at the Oscars, because his emotions are so clear, and I as the audience was able to recognize who his character was, due to the continuously shot of close- ups.Close-up shots aren't the only aspects of intensification, parallel editing is a favorable way to visualize alternating shots from two sequences that suggest they are taking place at the same time. In Half Nelson parallel editing is used to show both the lives of Daniel Dunn and Drey occurring at the same time during different scenes. A certain scene that shows a great example of this is when Daniel Dunn is having dinner at his parent's house, and at the same time Drey is getting ready to go on a ride to do drug deals with Frank, a pretty much "family" member that watches over Drey and her mother while Drey's brother resides in jail; played by the strong willed actor, Anthony Mackie. Both the scenes come to a conclusion that have Drey escorting drugs to a dark sketchy motel and winds up spotting her teacher inside the room. This technique can also be used to differentiate types of groups with music, like Daniel's family listening to the Toronto band Broken Social Scene, while Drey and Frank listened to Rap music.Half Nelson's style of film did throw me off and I almost thought director Ryan Fleck was being put in submission by the Full Nelson, but in the end the strong Oscar nominated performance by Ryan Gosling and the addition of technique used throughout pulls through as a drama that everyone should see. The film may take time to adjust to but like Drey once said "What do you call cheese that's not yours? Nacho Cheese." It may not be your cheese but it doesn't hurt to get a taste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One to avoid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Half Nelson is about a history teacher in an inner city NY school who is somehow ever so cool because he really engages children and all the other teachers are so hopeless that it can be no surprise that these kids are so disinterested in everything. If only we had more teachers like that. How does he do it ? Well, he makes history really interesting by talking about change, and big ideas clashing, and other hackneyed soundbites all the time but they never seem to learn any facts or events because this would be way too boring. He is also so cool that he has to walk around all day with a really bemused look on his face, you know, this look of the only sane person in a sea of fools. You also need to understand that when he is not heroically helping children, he is a drug addict and gets up to all sorts of things that are usually considered as not good for you. You will wonder how he can sustain this habit and his teaching at the same time, but I guess that this is actually the only part of the film that makes some sense because his lessons never look as if he has done any preparation for them, but that he rather makes them up as he goes along - lots of phoneyism and no substance. Now, he also gets to meet this really street wise black girl who really takes care of him although he offers her nothing much in return and there is no obvious explanation why she seems to like this idiot who is not even particularly nice to her. According to some other reviews of this film, they somehow seem to help each other but this is strange because nothing in their lives is going anywhere. If you like that sort of thing and films without plot, dialog, likable characters or anything of interest to speak of, then this film is for you, otherwise best to avoid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A tough film to get through. Ryan Gosling's high school teacher nose dives - literally - through the film, hoovering up a sordid quantity of hard drugs. The remarkable Shareeka Epps catches him at it and the two wander through the film drawing closer. Their relationship is singularly well-judged; in a movie of spasmodic hedonism there is no suggestion of impropriety between the two.It's very difficult to see the point of the film though. Director Ryan Fleck does a super job of crafting sequences of grey, the causal relationships and relative perspectives in a merry-go-round of aspirant middle class vice. Yet for all the warm humour and laconic misery there's no denouement. Still, at least no-one took a possibly more disastrous decision to append something glib in an attempt to resolve the insoluble. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dan and Drey, the former a High School teacher, the latter a student, two people of different ages and of a different race, two people ambling thru life in search of some semblance of meaning to their respective existence. When Drey stumbles upon Dan's secretive drug problem, it's the start of a friendship that could just shape their respective destinies.A Half Nelson is a hold in the sport of Wrestling that is almost impossible to break free from, and thus we have the basis for this smart and brightly written picture. I myself had avoided this picture for close on two years, I looked at the summaries and presumed that it was yet another preachy life affirming film about a white teacher working in an inner city school and winning over the troubled black kids, how wrong I was. Even tho Half Nelson's plot is heavily reliant on the perils of drugs, and the usual slant of a minor being exposed to narcotics and the worms that peddle the death to people, it's written in such an affectingly intelligent way, it just never comes close to being a cliché driven piece. Both our two main characters here are fully formed and we know enough about their respective lives to understand fully about the redemption yearned for, and crucially, also needed by Dan and Drey. As we enter the final quarter, we the audience are intently observing these two people and their interwoven paths of destiny, filmed in an earthy fly on the wall style, it's with much credit that all involved here have created a moving and believable piece.Ryan Gosling (Dan) continues his surge up the A list of modern day actors, boasting a number of affecting performances on his CV, this is yet another turn to cement his well earned reputation as a leading light of his generation. Playing off him very well is young Shareeka Epps (Drey), a totally engaging performance that hopefully bodes well for a promising career, whilst Anthony Mackie is highly efficient as drug dealer, Frank. With smart and nifty work from director writing team Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden, and a quite excellent soundtrack that fuses Billy Bragg with Broken Social Scene, Half Nelson is a winner on many many levels. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally ... a quiet, honest American film.I know, I know, there are a lot of great American indies that come out every year. But then, there is the trend of indies becoming the new mainstream. Film fest after film fest, award after award. All the time Hollywood thinking 'how can we make money outta this goofy thang' and 'hell, if we can't beat 'em, co-opt 'em'.'Half Nelson' is not nipped and tucked, botoxed, teeth whitened, plucked, waxed, lasered, or air brushed. It presents the best drama going; seemingly 'life as it is': half lifes,and half chances, crack pipes and all. It throws in black vs. white and a sprinkling of politics for good measure. But it doesn't do it with a heavy hand. Violence and gun smoke are absent. So are bi-polar class and racial politics. This is not a typical old Brooklyn streetside state of mind.'Half Nelson' instead tells its story with rare delicacy, honesty, and heart. Of a brilliant teacher and after-hours junkie. A student cum confident, possibly wise beyond her years. And the class room, school corridor, toilet, gym, playground, and neighbourhood they inhabit. The 'bad' teacher. The 'curious' student. The 'good' drug lord. The complications, the frustrations, the mastications of body and mind in the world as it is: one which they don't have all the answers for, and one that they don't fully control.It could all get rather depressing. However, the dreams, kindnesses, and ordinariness of ordinary people in (sometimes extraordinary but) mostly ordinary circumstances, steer a course towards hope. Shedding some light on a grey concrete urban 21st century American world.The performances of Ryan Gosling (Dan, the teacher) and Shareeka Epps (Drey, the student) are insightful and outstanding. As is the direction and vision of Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden.'Half Nelson' gives nothing but its fullest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What do you call cheese that doesn't belong to you?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nacho cheese. Half Nelson is a film that ticks all the requirements for indie movie making; shot largely with hand held cameras in close up, a soundtrack that consists of whining miserablists and a lead character played by a bleary eyed Canadian with a groovy designer beard. At first this makes it somewhat off-putting but stick with it, the film overcoming its stereotypes and providing a moving, low key study of a man consumed by his inner demons. This is largely due to the quality of acting put in, leads Ryan Gosling and Shareeka Epps investing a huge stock of humanity in their subjects. So much so that they even manage to make the slow pace and dream-like atmosphere into a watchable little gem that despite not being as good as some critics would have you believe, is still worth rooting out.Gosling plays teacher Dan Dunne. By day he galvanises his students with his passionate (if somewhat repetitive) history lessons on the American civil rights movement. Handsome, intelligent and entirely capable of wooing the pants off his female co-workers, his outward confidence masks a dark self-loathing which sees him snorting vast quantities of cocaine every night. His isolated bubble of self-destruction however is burst when thirteen year old Drey (Epps) catches him toked up on Bolivian Marching Powder in the school toilets. Instead of running to the faculty though, Drey brings him water and helps him through the comedown, this awkward moment leading to an unlikely friendship between the two.Needless to say then that despite being set in an inner-city high school largely populated by an angry black teenagers, Half Nelson is a far cry from the bombastic likes of 187 or Dangerous Minds. The tone is considerably more subtle and while the plot synopsis might raise the odd eyebrow, Dunne's relationship with Drey is more reminiscent of a big brother looking after his younger sister than anything particularly dubious. Unlike the aforementioned movies, Half Nelson also avoids high melodrama and ends ambiguously, offering no clear cut solutions to Gosling's addiction or indeed, if he intends to stop at all. Consequently, Half Nelson doesn't really feel like a movie but a snapshot of two people's lives at one potentially crucial moment when they overlap.The story admittedly isn't especially interesting in its own right and at times it slows to a crawl, but it's held together by the two leads. Gosling at first seems to have graduated from the Nicholas Cage school of acting by uh...you know, taking a really...hmmm. Long. Time to...to...say anything, but as the film unfolds you notice how impressive his performance is. Every flicker of those sad, sad eyes is carefully timed, each sigh carefully nuanced and by the time the credits roll, there's no question his Oscar nomination was well deserved. Epps on the other hand puts in a 'mature-beyond-her-years' performance of a young girl faced with a wealth of social frustration (her brother is in jail, her uncle is a drug dealer). At times she is furiously independent, at others she expresses an intensely child like vulnerability and it is her accusatory gaze that first opens Dunne's eyes to how far down the line he has travelled.As an acting masterclass then Half Nelson is essential watching. However, it is also a film that shys away from flashy showmanship and doesn't patronise the audience with over the top messages about the evil of drugs. The worst physical affliction Dunne gets is a nose bleed, but the sheer mental toll that his habit has caused is all too evident in his hunched over resignation. It might not be as good as Scorsese's masterpiece, but this is still one of the best portraits of urban male angst since Taxi Driver, only with dialectics and cocaine instead of bullet-riddled pimps and special forces hair cuts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a tricky one. On the one hand you have to praise this film for it's powerful performances and a fresh approach to the teacher-student genre (most just seem like elongated teaching ads). But the film also has problems, it's very hard to watch, due mostly to an overwhelming pessimistic atmosphere and characters.What you've heard about the acting in this film is true. Ryan Gosling is brilliant, and even better is the young Shareeka Epps, who excels. The hand held camera style reinforces the realistic and genuineness Ryan Fleck seems very good at. It deals with serious issues in a genuine way, but that's nothing new for indie cinema.What i found hard about the film were the characters. Gosling's character makes the whole thing less enjoyable: a drugged-up wreck, whose unpredictable and irrational behaviour gives you this constant feel of foreboding. You're not sure whether he'll go too far in the next scene and you're hoping he's not stupid enough to do so, especially in the company of the children. In a way the film is impressive for this reason, it provokes. But it's also irritating, watching someone doing stupid things over and over again isn't fun, and you end up feeling like screaming at gosling to get off his ass and do something, go somewhere, and get a life. I do think there's a certain audience for this type of film, and it's important to appreciate it even if it's not for you.I can't say watching this film was a wholly enjoyable experience, but it was an experience. I don't always watch films to have a good time, and neither should you. It's a tough film, but it's not boring. You'll wish the characters could have been given a bit more spark and optimism, but this isn't that kind of film, and that's the important thing to understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weaknesses in the material and delivery are covered by two strong central performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dan Dunne is a young teacher in an inner-city school who has a novel and relaxed approach to teaching history. Instead of talking facts and dates, Dunne tries to inspire and engage his students. He also smokes crack and does cocaine to try and numb out daily life. One night he gets high in the changing rooms after his team's basketball match and is discovered by student Drey. With this secret between them, Drey is attracted to Dunne as a friend as well as a teacher, since her isolated life sees her lacking friends or role-models. An uneasy and perhaps inappropriate relationship develops between them while independently they face the opportunities to make right and wrong decisions about their own lives.I wanted to like this film much more than I actually did. Cosmetically it appears to want to be the antithesis of the typical high school/inspirational and edgy teacher stuff and the camera movements and slow development suggest that it will be this ? realer, darker, more honest. The intelligence behind the idea is also evident as we see Dunne's talk of opposing forces, dialectics, becoming real within his life in regards his interaction with Drey. This works reasonably well but the material is perhaps too remote from the characters, with little in the way of comment on the lives we have laid in front of us and little in the way of debate between the characters on the issues either. This rather spark wordless bond implies depth and there is some there but the film doesn't help itself in regards the words it does play out in the open.By this I mean Dunne's lessons. I am a liberal and do believe that school should be about more than facts and figures but even I struggled to see what Dunne was achieving in his class. OK, he is a variation on the "different but effective" teacher we see in all this genre but his occasionally semi-coherent babblings and thematic discussions often came across as self-important, self-serving and selfish. I doubt this was the point but that is how it came over to me and it forced me to ask if I really cared about the character. The reaction of the pupils and his ease of access suggests that he is working but the film could have helped this by showing some actual learning going in within this framework/approach. Fleck's direction is good but as a writer with Boden I wanted more in the way of substance, not making it "easier" perhaps but just a touch more accessible.What covered the material failings for me were the performances. Gosling is impressive in the lead role and he is true to the material ? even if that does hurt his character. He doesn't always manage to convince within his skin but he is good. My reservation in praising him might surprise some (after all he was Oscar nominated) but to me it is hard to gush about him when he is alongside a wonderfully restrained and yet emotive performance from Epps. Regardless of age, she is engaging with a performance that perfectly contradicts the outward surliness with the vulnerability etc under the surface. It is hard to dislike her in this and for me she was the hook that kept me interested. Mackie is solid in his role, avoiding easy cliché that could have been his whole role. The whole show is the lead two but smaller turns are good from others as well.Overall then, this is not all that I had hoped it would be. At times it appears intelligent and offering edgy potential but it is difficult to get into and the lack of debate on the characters and their lives does rather make the film hard to get into and leaves it less accessible than I wanted. The performances do a lot to cover the weaknesses and Epps is excellent in particular but don't come to this mistaking it for a mainstream film, because it is not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More like a 1/8 Nelson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another indie style production with all the usual earmarks: slow moving plot, abbreviated dialog, a middle without a beginning and an end, and characters not fully developed enough to care about. Yes, my opinion goes against the tide of most reviewers here but I'm one of those movie lovers who expects a story that takes me along and doesn't prompt me to look at the clock.Like many indie films, Half Nelson has the outline of a good idea for a story, namely how people can fall into the drug world, but it never really goes the distance. We see the middle class white guy (Gosling) hooked with a habit, and we see the young black girl surrounded by a culture that is tampering with her innocence, but we don't ever see the characters struggle with their prospects. They are portrayed as passive as the furniture in a room that will never change. Gosling's Dan Dunne seems simply a man without a plan who has some deep seated, undefined frustration disturbing his life. While this may be a slice of reality, it doesn't make an engrossing film. Grass growing is also part of life, and so are weeds, but not too exciting to watch. The most fascinating aspect of the story is the character of Frank, superbly acted by Anthony Mackie, a local drug dealer who has achieved an atypically moral value system despite his occupation. Frank is a black version of the mafia don, a natural leader with smarts and principles who controls his criminal environment and manages to operate in the real world. I wanted more of his story.While Gosling is a mesmerizing actor, here he took yet another role playing a character dealing with mental turbulence. He likes to swagger with a cigarette dangling from his lip spouting philosophical conundrums and I suppose one can forgive this youthful excess because there's real talent there. However, I hope his Oscar nod doesn't fuel his inclination to go for even more of these roles. It's about time for him to start looking for parts in different genres, to spread his wings and develop more range. He was astonishing in The Notebook, a real departure that proved he has the stuff it takes for a brilliant career. I'd hate to see him get bogged down in these downer roles and become the Harvey Keitel of his generation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am no Pollyanna. I have been a high school teacher in my early years out of college when I was 'finding myself'. And, at that time, my out-of-classroom behaviors at times could have gotten me fired. So, I am not unsympathetic to the issues in this film. However, this film is more about down-and-out addiction than it is about 'dialectics'. That addiction is not a growing pain, it is a lethal disease. And no thirteen year old girl from disadvantaged circumstances is going to come along as a Christ figure to save the day. This is beyond suspension of disbelief. I wish I could say something positive about this movie, other than raise the obvious impression left by Ms. Epps as Drey. I felt is was badly filmed, badly cast and badly written. Long soulful pauses and seedy home decor don't really say anything at all. They are filler. The one sadly realistic element in this story is the expectation by all its dysfunctional and addicted adults that a child like Drey will somehow make things right. But do we really need to be reminded of that in these times? Ryan Gosling's anti-hero was indeed convincing. So much so that I wished I'd never met him by the end of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If students not only wondered, but found out what their teachers were up to when they finished teaching them for the day, I bet you that students would show more respect for teachers. No film has ever opened my eyes to how dense teacher's souls can be, causing me to regret viewing my teachers as simple human beings, and not striving to make personal relationships inside the classroom. Ryan Gosling gives a quietly moving performance playing a young middle-school teacher with a drug problem. His character, Dan Dunne, forms a friendship with one of his students named Drey (Shareeka Epps). The story transcends from a sweet story to a character study on a man who tries to pass through his troubled life to find meaning along the way. Gosling gives a tour de force performance in "Half Nelson." His poignant way of being realistic enough to believe someone like Ryan Gosling could be a teacher transforms our view of a so called "pretty boy" and reminds us we're viewing the flight of a soaring actor full of talent. Writer/Director Ryan Fleck makes it clear he's striving for a redemption story. His characters and shockingly realistic writing have the force to capture the peeks of our hearts, break it in half, and then build it back up. In a subtle fashion, Fleck shows a story of coming out from a shell. There's plenty of moral questions and destiny ideas thrown at us to have us consider the paths of our own lives while we experience an independent film like no other capture our minds and spirits. Thrown students giving presentations to the class, Dan feeling trapped in his life, and a thoroughly effective examination of impoverished city life, "Half Nelson" is both devastating and one of the most unforgettable independent films of our time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gosling Is Magnificent In This Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Half Nelson is a drama film directed by Ryan Fleck, written by Fleck and Anna Boden. The film stars Ryan Gosling, Shareeka Epps and Anthony Mackie. It was scored by Juno Award winning Canadian band Broken Social Scene. Gosling received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for his role in the film.The story concerns an inner city middle-school struggling with addiction forms an unlikely bond with a young student who catches him in a compromising position in director Ryan Fleck's feature-length adaptation of his own award-winning short film Gowanus, Brooklyn. Despite his dedication to the junior-high students who fill his classroom, idealistic teacher Dan Dunne (Ryan Gosling) leads a secret life that the majority of his students will never know. When Dunne's drug-soaked nightlife begins to bleed over into his daytime hours and troubled student Drey (Shareeka Epps) makes a startling discovery, the tenuous bond that forms between the pair soon leads to a warm friendship that could either lead them down a dangerous path or provide the human companionship needed to see things from a fresh perspective and start life anew.Although the subject promises more than the film can deliver, there is compensation in Gosling's convincing, unromanticized portrayal of someone seeking escape from longing and loss that neither he nor the movie can really define for it is indeed amazing as a bewildered, depressed New York schoolteacher who is slipping into dire drug addiction; it's exactly the kind of star turn in a smaller film that Academy voters noticed.It definitely establishes himself as a major talent and one of the finest young actors around.Aside from that,it is a genuinely inspirational film -- a terrifically compelling character study and a tricky exploration of the links (and busted links) between the personal and the political.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sun comes up and the sun goes down. Every time that happens you get a new day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Half Nelson is one of my favorite movies, a more mature version of 'United States of Leland', both starring Ryan Gosling before he really hit celebrity heartthrob status.Gosling plays Daniel Dunn, a middle school teacher in a disenfranchised Brooklyn neighborhood. Throughout the film he struggles with loneliness, crack/cocaine addiction, drinks alcohol on a regular basis and smokes cigarettes. He comes from a seemingly middle class family with married parents but lives alone in a crappy, barren apartment. He's disconnected from the World around him other than one particular student that he develops a friendship with. That student winds up riding her bike after class one day in which Dunn didn't show up to work, to the motel where she delivered him drugs the night before for her brother's drug dealing friend who had he is in jail for throughout the film.Dunn's depression and self destruction are what happens to people with high potential who have no passion, who have no sense of direction, who don't want to create, don't know what to create, or don't know what is worth doing with themselves.Sounds very similar to my predicament now as an almost college graduate with no mapped out option to take. Nothing is over appealing, I don't have a job lined up or a career in my mind. I don't know what to do with myself other than get out of Albany in which a similar situation as Dunn's in "Half Nelson" would be imminent. Even if I get out of Albany, that passion isn't necessarily there. It once was running as I ran so well I got on the Boston College Cross Country and Track team. When that passion receded my first year there I fell into a depression for awhile, and was self destructive. I started smoking weed a lot, started drinking, had low self esteem and was unhappy. I thought transferring schools would get me out of that funk but, it didn't help much. When I came back home work occupied a lot of my time but, I was still miserable and still drank and smoked too much. One night after drinking too much I woke up alone and felt awful. I realized no one really cared much about me, because I didn't care much about myself. So I just started running, trying to get back into shape and I gradually did. While doing that I went into a Navy recruiting office and I started training to be a Navy Seal. I stopped working, stopped going out, stopped basically socializing and just worked out as much as possible. It was working. I had a purpose, a passion and a sense of direction finally. I worked my of butt off and got in better shape than most athletes even do in their entire lives. A year later I left for boot camp and was happy up until the time I was at BUD/S in Coronado and had just lost faith in myself, was getting beat up and injured consistently in training and couldn't go on anymore. I miss the people I got to live with. I was happy in those phases of my life.A similar phase was when I pledged Delta Chi this past semester. I had a purpose to each day beyond the monotony of boring English classes. I had things to do, a routine that brought with it a lot of socializing, some surprises and a sense of purpose and direction.The Myth of Sisyphus is that Sisyphus was punished by the Gods to constantly roll a boulder up a hill and then back down again over and over. Albert Camus ascertained that one must imagine Sisyphus happy because his purpose and direction were set, he had them. It's a basis for existential philosophy and one I also believe in despite the numerous variables life has.So whether the cause of Dunn's horrible state is that of loneliness or that of unfulfilled potential, it doesn't matter because I think I am an easy victim for both, anyone is if you're lazy and self centered enough I suppose.I thought Dunn had passion for teaching, but his loneliness made him crave anything to fill the void. Is it a lack of purpose, direction and passion that makes Dunn and myself unhappy or is it a lack of companionship or are they all linked with one another? Dunn focuses on Dialectics in his teachings, which is a theory on how change works. Dunn has a dualism in his life, the teacher and the drug addict. Both are opposing forces. At the end of the film you are left with a sense of hope in that Dunn will be alright. I hope so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know when you see a movie, get completely moved by it, go on IMDb to submit a review, and get lost in words? Well I'm going through this, because the movie is not really a movie by my definition. It's an experience. It has you thinking about all your choices in life, the mistakes, the sorrow, but also ending up thinking about the light of things. So instead of rambling on about how the movie reacts to you, say, spiritually, how about the aspects of how great the film was itself? The acting. I cannot define the acting instead of calling it.. real. Ryan Gosling always surprises me. First it was Drive, where he played a sympathetic serial killer. His performance was misunderstood, but he did fantastic there. Next was Blue Valentine. It was nothing short of amazing. He played a lost man in a lost relationship in a lost world. But I never would suspect that Gosling would go straight to my favorite actors, because his performance was just mesmerizing. I'm not just going to give him all the credit, the little girl played by Shareeka Epps was probably the best child acting ever. The movie never even went down into the stereotypes of the life (violence, gangs) it was all just.. real. So the acting was some of the best I've seen. The film also tends to deliver some political commentary. The movie focuses on the civil rights movement, which at first was a little strange, but then turned normal. It never went to deep into the topic, but it served as an appetite, driving the film onward. And last, but not least, the overall feeling of the film. The movie is a character study like no other. And the main part of this is because of Ryan Gosling. He knows how to play a character without underplaying it or going over-the-top. And he serves the film a stir of charisma. The film was gritty, dark, and just fantastic. If I called this one my favorite movies of ALL time, would I be considered weird? This is yet another film I don't know whether to recommend or not. The mainstream audience have already bashed the film for being slow and boring, and if that's seriously what you think, okay. But that's what I'm saying, that is nothing as it is. But I was moved by the film like no other. It served so many purposes, giving out great acting and a gritty atmosphere. By the end of the film, you're going to be changed. And if an indie drama (why don't I like calling it that?) provokes you to do so, then it surely deserves being a favorite. And if that's so, then the movie also moooooo!10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Half Nelson" is one of the saddest movies I've ever seen. It's a sharp, insightful look at crack cocaine addiction - the social sickness the drug perpetuates and moral compromises it provokes. In particular, it's an almost elegiac portrayal of an addict and the contradictions of his life. It's a quiet, observant movie that avoids melodrama and the usual addiction movie clichés, yet the cumulative effect is powerful. It has stayed with me.Ryan Gosling plays Dan, a teacher who attempts to teach his African American students more than the curriculum. He's trying to prepare them for the real world, the world of power structures and social inequality. The "machine". Dan admits that, as a white schoolteacher, he's privileged. But he's also a crack-head and straddling two worlds. Dan has given up. He's accepted himself as a hopeless case, a perpetual loser. When things fall apart he doesn't put up a fight. He just packs his bags and moves on. Gosling's performance is a thing of beauty. He acts with his eyes. When Dan more or less summarily dismisses his ex-girlfriend during her impromptu visit at the school, you can see the sadness, the necessary cruelty and his bemused observation of his own behaviour - all in his eyes.One afternoon one of his teen-aged girl students, Drey (Shareeka Epps), catches him smoking crack in a school washroom. Dan has a minor seizure, and she helps him. She sizes up the situation and doesn't blink an eye. Drey lives with her mother, who works as a security guard. The crack scene is all around her. She knows the score. Her brother is in prison and her estranged dad is a drug dealer. Epps gives Drey a quiet, guarded alertness. Drey is mature for her age, yet you can also catch glimpses of the girl that she is, and the fire inside her. She might just be a survivor.Dan and Drey fall into a friendship that raises eyebrows, to be sure, but it's a pairing of equals. Drey brings out Dan's better instincts, and he provides solace and lack of pretence. Dan assumes, quite naturally, the role of a father. He's absolutely livid and catches fire when he finds out that Drey's real dad is using her as a drug runner. He summons the courage to confront him on the street, a very dangerous thing to do in a drug-infested black neighbourhood. It's a welcome surprise in Dan's passive persona."Half Nelson" is an authentic depiction of the world of drugs and addiction. Though made on a small budget, director/ writers Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden reach high and succeed. All the pieces fit together. It's an intimate film of many small pleasures. And it made me feel. Which is good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the finest dramas I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Half Nelson is genuinely one of the best films I have ever seen. The premise sounds attention grabbing, and under another director could have been hammy and tasteless, but Fleck directs with such subtlety, craft and beauty that from the moment the picture starts, there is no chance of you losing interest. Gosling is, as the rest of the cast are, superb. Everyone is giving it their best, yet also playing things cool, there's no overacting here, just a great display of how simple human drama can be so powerfully affecting. I've seen a lot of films where the lack of budget is clear, yet the meagre $700,000 Fleck and his team were given to work with is exacted perfectly. Nothing looks cheap, or botched, just expertly put together. In a period of cinema where millions flock to see shiny robots beat the crap out of each other in shiny buildings with the sun glinting off their shiny mechanical backsides, Half Nelson proves that there is still a great deal of heart in cinema. In the truest sense of the word, a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>humanity at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>there is a lack of humanity nowadays in films, mainly because characters are superficial and do not relate to us in any way. what other films fail to do, half nelson does it perfectly, not only bringing us characters from everyday life, but allowing us to feel and connect with them in a much deeper level than most other films. Ryan Gosling is fantastic in this film once again, and he portrays his character with great power, one of his best performances in my opinion. the fact that we are able to view his character through the eyes of a 12 year old brings more emphasis to an already strong drama, the way the 2 characters are connected emotionally is quite convincing. as the movie evolves we are able to see how complicated and serious the problems that the characters face are, and we can really understand why they are there in the first place, the movie ranges from funny to extremely sad, and does not fail in making you smile or even shed a tear.it is great to see that beyond cheap comedies, and expensive action films, there is still a touch of humanity in some peoples minds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I distrust hyperbole and I question the judgment of folk who shell out easy 10s for their favourite films despite their imperfections. Nothing's perfect. I am not one to do such things. This film, its creators and Mr. Gosling unite cohesively to present, what is likely a common, yet relevant story that depicts the traps and potential pitfalls that could possibly await any one of us.It showcases realistic acting through a linear script that displays how easily human relationships can be complicated by human weakness and fallibility.Gosling is the actor of his generation (this is his best work bar none). The soundtrack is perfect (which includes many tracks from Broken Social Scene's epic LP, You Forgot in People) as it soundtracks the complications in fuzzy, beautiful noise. The cinematography and direction allows us to observe the frailty and redeeming qualities of humanity as a passive voyeur. We are enlightened; we are moved; we are educated by each frame - each expression on Gosling's tortured, yet hopeful face.My only knock on the film is the brief (very brief) historical narrations by Gosling's students. These interludes interrupt the flow of the narrative and temporarily distract the viewer from the reality of the film. However, these scenes are so minor that they do not in any way dampen the overall poignancy of the story.This is my movie. I've watched/obsessed/pored over it numerous times since it has been released and I'll keep coming back to it again and again.Will you? I think you should.I am certain I will never love a film and character progression/collapse as much as I love this one.This is fact. No hyperbole. Honest.</fullReview>

It's Brooklyn, NY, yo. It's eighth grade. Some kids are just asleep in the classroom. Some are interested, but only so far. But there's this one girl who's really sharp and picking up totally on what the teacher is saying about the antiwar movement and Malcolm X. Teacher and student are connecting. Mentor and mentoree going on here big time. Looks like something progressive happening in a big way.But he's a crack addict and she knows it. And she's not even in puberty.The whole genre is turned upside down. Where do they go from here? He knows she knows. She knows he knows she knows. They remain student and teacher.Both have personal lives outside the classroom. We meet the people in their personal lives.This movie plays out in unexpected ways, but in ways that are always plausible. No guns. No serious violence.It's just the people who live in Brooklyn, N.Y., working it out.Ryan Gosling, after this and "Lars and the Real Girl," you the man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stark and riveting, "Half Nelson" proves we don't need 'reality' entertainment from Hollywood: this seems real enough. Junior High history teacher and girls' basketball coach Ryan Gosling crawls into a crack-clouded fog once he gets home; one of his inner-city students knows his secret, yet she is harboring troubles of her own. Gosling is inherently charismatic and intrinsically smart while working from a gut instinct, resulting in a performance that is constantly surprising, always unpredictable; as an actor, he is so focused (and brave) that we don't recoil from him even as his character is turned inside-out, showing us behavior that is hardly pretty. He may be the finest young actor of this new century--there isn't anyone else out there who can touch him. The supporting cast is equally strong, aided by an outstanding screenplay from Anna Boden and director Ryan Fleck, who shies away from both sentimentality and melodramatic sensationalism. "Half Nelson" is so good, critics run the risk of over-praising it. It is mainly a quiet movie, a character study in a lower key, and yet what we absorb from it can last for days. *** from ****</fullReview>

It does offer an unflinching portrait of dependency and nihilism, as well as a glance at the American underclass that never sinks into melodrama; the racial divisions of the United States are likewise shown in a convincing manner, without being overplayed. But the movie could have done with something to provide it with a little bit more spark; the references (supported by old film clips) to the historical events the teacher refers to are not enough for this purpose, and can seem a little heavy-handed. The film certainly has merits; but it is at times in danger of reducing the viewer to a similar state of ennui to that which it portrays.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Half Nelson, Full Impact</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HALF NELSON Written by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck Directed by Ryan FleckA teacher tries to open the minds of a class of inner-city high school students. Plainly put, the premise of HALF NELSON sounds like a movie we've all seen too many times before but this is not that movie. HALF NELSON doesn't soften the hard or smooth over the rough. It opens with Ryan Gosling as Dan Dunne, waking up to his day. He looks exhausted, dirty. As he stumbles around for his pants, he even looks deathly. Mr. Dunne is an 8th grade history teacher and a basketball coach. He is also drug addict who has cut himself off from as much human intimacy as possible. After coaching a losing game and having an awkward conversation with an ex-girlfriend, his two worlds crash into each other in the girls' locker room. When he thinks everyone has left, he lights up his crack pipe in a bathroom stall and falls into the high until he hears footsteps. The stall door opens and he stares blankly, curled up on the toilet, at the face of Drey (Shareeka Epps), one of his history students. He insists he's fine but he isn't fooling either one of them. She helps him off the floor and into his car. By the time he drops her off, an unlikely friendship has begun, a star performance is being built by Gosling and a brilliantly engaging film is well under way.Despite his dependence, Mr. Dunne manages to make it to class fairly often. His students, he claims on more than one occasion, are possibly the only thing in his life that keeps him sane. In the classroom, he has purpose. That purpose, he has decided despite the school principal's protests, is to prepare his students for mental and emotional challenges life will present when they leave high school. Though he is supposed to be teaching the details surrounding the civil rights movement, he prefers to lecture on the philosophy behind how such a change comes about. His approach, albeit unorthodox, is effective. His students are attentive and encouraged to think progressively. Mr. Dunne believes change is brought about when two opposing forces reach a turning point where one force will ultimately overpower the other force. He illustrates this point with a friendly game of arm wrestling. The paradox of a man so intent on inspiring others when he has so little interest in inspiring himself is both fascinatingly twisted and painfully heartbreaking to watch. My heart goes out to Mr. Dunne but all the while, I want to shake him out of his funk.Keeping with the theme of opposing forces, Mr. Dunne's relationship with Drey serves as a mirror to the state his life has reached. Drey is a 13-year-old girl who is growing up mostly on her own as her father has left, her mother is always working and her older brother is in jail. She is in need of a solid adult influence in her life and her choices are between Mr. Dunne, a man who has long ago given up on his future and a neighborhood drug dealer who would like to recruit her as part of his crew. Evidently, she has her own opposing forces to deal with. While she is necessarily more mature than the majority of her peers, she is still a teenager and struggles to know her place, especially in relation to Mr. Dunne. There is clearly an admiration as she hangs off every word of his lectures, possibly even a crush. Still, her most mature awareness, and this can be directly attributed to Epps' stunningly understated performance, is that Mr. Dunne needs her more than she needs him. As he has no friends, he needs an impartial person in his life to remind him about the simple and touching aspects of human interaction. Her beauty grows out of her instinctual impulse to help.A "half nelson" is a wrestling move that, when applied correctly, prohibits the person in the hold from being able to free him or herself from the hold until they submit to defeat to stop the pain. In the case of Dan Dunne, the drug addiction in his life is the perpetrator of that move and he admitted defeat a long time ago, acknowledging at this point in his life that he only takes the drugs to get by these days compared to his earlier days when he took them to forget. I honestly don't know which is worse. HALF NELSON is a transfixing character study, thanks in great part to Gosling's impressive versatility. In many ways, he himself encompasses two opposing forces at the same time but with the hold his drug usage has on his life, it isn't likely he'll reach his turning point any time soon, if at all.</fullReview>

However, I couldn't wait to see them again to figure it all out and fully understand the filmmakers' message, not to mention being drawn in for the 2 hours I invested in the pictures. I remember glancing down at the counter on my DVD player eighteen minutes into this picture and being frustrated that I had an hour and a half to go. It just wasn't engaging... and the unsteady, overused, shaky camera technique made it that much more difficult to watch. Why is it that filmmakers today are trying so hard to copy an age old documentary style of film-making that not even documentary filmmakers use any more.

		<fullReview>As Dan Dunne wearingly slouches on a couch while his parents, completely oblivious to his condition, intoxicatingly prance around their living room, it becomes painfully apparent to us that he is fighting this battle completely by his lonesome. "I used to be so *beeped* up... but I *beepin* cleaned up" Dan later proudly professes to a teacher he's on a date with, as he proceeds to snort a line off his coke-riddled desk.Half Nelson is not so much a film as it is an in-depth character study, and a masterpiece it is in that regard. The story of Dan Dunne, a troubled (to put it mildly) history teacher is a a refreshingly sobering look - the irony - into the human experience. It provides us with little exposition into any of its characters lives but we learn a great deal of their hardship. And so, we too, like Dan, find ourselves adrift and in a state of confusion.Ryan Gosling is seriously good in this role. His portrayal of a nuanced, reticent, struggling man is about as accurate as one can come to expect. The way he delivers certain mannerisms is so spot on and makes his spiral into despair that much more believable. Also great in their roles are Anthony Mackie, as Frank, and Shareeka Epps, as Drey.But the mastery of Half Nelson stems from the power it punches in its raw subtlety. The writing, directing and acting are not presented as some didactic device that sets out to explore a resolution of its characters problems. Rather, this film depicts a true-to-life story that is as poignant as it is matter-of-fact. And perhaps that is why we are left feeling empty come the film's end - because, sometimes, life doesn't have the answers we have come to expect.</fullReview>

Ryan Gosling plays a young teacher loved by his students yet caught in the washroom hooked on dope. Shareeka Epps plays the bright young student who understands Gosling's breakdown and befriends him. He learns that his ex-girlfriend is engaged to be married thus spiralling him deeper into the despairing desire for drugs. Epps is stronger in that although she lacks positive male support in her life, her single mother loves her. Director Ryan Fleck receives a great performance from Gosling that translate as one of the best performances of the year. This teacher has a gift for knowledge and passing it on yet struggles with past pain and an inability to cope. Epps steals the film as his student who excels and becomes a strong leg for Gosling. Anthony Mackie plays the drug dealer whom her brother worked for before being arrested. Collins Pennie plays her reckless older brother whom is caught up in crime and answers for it. Tina Holmes plays Gosling's ex-girlfriend whom turns up. He is unable to deal with this thus descending further into depression. Results in a superb portrait of emotional support joined together as well as proving to be one of the best films of the year. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well intentioned story that doesn't pay off.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ryan Gosling's quietly intense performance in the lead role is the centerpiece of a troubling but watchable 2006 drama called HALF NELSON, a film which sends some troubling mixed messages, some inaccurate information, and, considering the subject matter, never provides the payoff that it should.Gosling plays Dan Dunne, a high school teacher and girls' basketball coach at a Brooklyn high school, who is caught smoking crack in the girls' locker room by one of his students named Dray (Shareeka Epps) and the disturbing directions that this event take the relationship between the two.This is a troubling story on several levels and though I kept watching, found myself squirming for most of the film's running time. I was initially bothered by the fact that after after this event, over 30 minutes of screen time pass before Dan and Dray discuss what happened. Prior to this, Dan acts as if nothing happened and Dray doesn't tell anyone, though the scene where she catches Dan, you can see it in her face that her opinion of the man has seriously altered. She has the power to help the man by reporting what she saw but she doesn't. She actually starts spending more time with him, which is wrong on all kinds of levels and he does nothing to stop it.Another problem with a story that is supposedly about addiction is that we never really see Dan suffer any consequences of his actions. Addiction has consequences and Dan pretty much sails through the running time without any serious consequences. The closest things to consequences the character suffers are a fat lip from a girlfriend and the death of his cat, clearly a result of his neglect.Writer director Ryan Fleck is also not familiar with the effects of smoking crack and snorting cocaine. One of the primary effects of these drugs is paranoia and we see none of this in Dan...he gets high and then likes to get in people's faces instead the isolation that usually occurs with coke addicts. His complete indifference to Dray delivering drugs to his hotel room was also disturbing, which was the just the surface of Dray's issues, but Dan doesn't really attempt to do the right things to help her.The mixed messages and bad behavior glamorized here notwithstanding, Gosling gives a mesmerizing performance that earned him an Oscar nomination and is matched note for note by Epps, who should have received a nomination as well. The shoestring budget on which this indie was clearly shot does add to the realism, but our hero doesn't really change or learn anything and because of this, the film, though watchable, left a bad taste in my mouth.</fullReview>

To the chagrin of his superiors, Dan bucks the outlined curriculum of historical facts in favor of the philosophy of historical events, generally discussing the concept of dialectics. As such, he captures the imagination of his students, at least in the classroom. Outside of the classroom, Dan's life is in shambles. He has a distant but cordial relationship with his family. He uses illicit drugs rampantly. Although his former girlfriend Rachel was able to clean up her drug habit, Dan believes that rehab will not work for him. Due to a combination of these issues, he treats women poorly. Thirteen year old Drey is a student in his class and a player on his basketball team. Drey has her own problems. Her parents are divorced, with her father a virtually non-existent figure in her life and her EMT mother generally absent as she is.On and on. People who love this movie buy into the BS Hollywood version of life which never reflects realty. And Gossling is way miscast. he sounds ignorant and unbelievable as a HS teacher. Plus his acting isn't very good. He's basically a one trick pony who can only play one role and this isn't it.In the end you really have to ask yourself why does Hollywood keep on making these unoriginal movies that have no basis in reality. Over and over again.The plot of this film can be seen in about half a dozen other films over the past 6 years. So does that mean once a year we have to be subjected to this garbage?It's insulting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ryan Fleck's "Half Nelson" stars Ryan Gosling as Dan Dunne, a troubled history teacher. Fond of the communist manifesto, and adept at using Engels' three laws of dialectics to explain history to his students, Dunne's almost a caricature of left-leaning, liberal teachers. The world's out to get you, Dunne explains to his kids, "the man" responsible for systems and institutions designed to keep the masses down. Dunne's students think he's full of hot air.It quickly becomes apparent that Dunne represents a brand of failed, white paternalism. Dunne wants to inspire and "save" his many African American students, but is largely ineffectual. The complex social, historical and systemic forces which make Dunne's mission difficult, if not outright impossible, aren't Fleck's concern. What is Fleck's concern is Dunne's self-perception. Dunne perceives himself as having lost ("One man alone means nothing!"). As being a failure. As being a man on a mission nobody cares about. But while his parents - children of the civil rights era ? and siblings have slipped inexorably from radicalism to conformism, Dunne holds on to dwindling threads of hope; change is possible, he almost believes.As he's becoming increasingly depressed, Dunne turns to drugs. They offer escape, but of course addiction begins to ruin his life. One student, Drey (Shareeka Epps), offers to help Dunne, but he brushes her away. White guys don't need help from 13 year old African American girls. Right? "Half Nelson's" second half watches as Drey herself gets entangled in a web of crime and drugs. It's a web Dunne tries to rescue Drey from, but his efforts are as ineffectual as hers. The film then ends with a pair of sad moments. In the first, Drey finds herself delivering drugs to a rock-bottomed Dunne. Both look at each another with regret, before Fleck hits us with a coda which suggests escape. Whether this escape is but a pipe-dream is left ambiguous. The term "half-nelson", after all, refers to a wrestling grip in which the victim's hand ands neck are pinned down. Make of this metaphor what you will."Half Nelson" is reasonably well directed by Fleck, dodges most "teaching movie" clichés, and features a good performance by the usually comatose Ryan Gosling. Shareeka Epps, beautiful, subtle and raw, steals the show.8/10 ? See "Detatchment" and Laurent Cantet's "The Class".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Character-based movie with very little development</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ryan Goslings character (Dan the history teacher) introduces his class to history by claiming that history is opposites (among other things). And what we get are two opposites that become "friends".Dan: white, middle-aged, teacher, coach, addicted. Drey: Black/African-American, young, pupil, basketball player, clean.Dans premise is that history is created from opposites, whatever the opposite forces may be and regardless of how strong each force is; if the forces are mismatched, the stronger force will prevail quickly and that particular piece of history will be over shortly. In the movie, the history between Dan and Drey unfolds rather slowly, which is great for some, but will leave a lot of people bored. Maybe this is a metaphor for how Dan and Drey are equal in force. Only if one can look beyond the shaky camera work and indulge oneself in the superb acting, will this movie be worthwhile. The plot itself contains emotional peaks and valleys, but they are few and not very engaging. When the movie ends, there is a feeling of - yes, history happened, but it just wasn't that interesting. If you're into character movies like this one, you'll probably like The Master, Snow Angels and The Ice Storm. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, but overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Half Nelson" is a 2006 independent film starring Ryan Gosling as Mr. Dunne, a white school teacher in an inner-city Brooklyn middle school. Mr. Dunne has noble ambitions of being a positive force in the lives of his students but he's bogged down by a crack habit. He strikes up a much-needed friendship with one of his students, a latchkey 13 year-old black girl named Drey, who accidentally discovers his drug problem.Richard Roeper and Kevin Smith's review on At The Movies called "Half Nelson" a masterpiece that everyone should seek out, view and relish; unfortunately it's not even close to being that good.Yes, the acting is great across the board, especially Gosling, but acting itself does not a movie make. What's wrong with this film? For one thing, the story plays out in a dreary monotone its entire length (106 minutes) and ends on an unresolved note. Yet, even this doesn't explain why the film fails to be truly good or great; after all, 2004's "The Woodsman" also plays out in a flat, realistic manner and ends somewhat unresolved, but that film is great. So where does "Half Nelson" go wrong? Although Ryan Gosling is an excellent actor, his character in this film, Mr. Dunne, is lifeless, unlikable, hypocritical and unrepentant; by contrast, Keven Bacon in "The Woodsman" may be lifeless and unlikable, but at least he wasn't hypocritical or unrepentant.By "lifeless and unlikable" I mean that he lacks vibrancy and inspiration, even when he's in his glory teaching his kids about dialectics &amp; history. There's simply no charisma that would compel anyone to want to seek him out, learn from him or befriend him, like, say, Robin Williams' character in "Dead Poets Society." By "hypocritical" I mean the obvious: How much of a positive impact could he possibly have on inner-city youths if he himself is addicted to drugs? This brings to mind the absurd scene where Mr. Dunne confronts a drug dealer who's using Drey as a drug deliverer. Dunne doesn't want Drey to be negatively influenced by a drug dealer but it's okay for her to hang out with a pathetic drug addict like himself (?). The scene ends with Dunne having a drink and "candy" with the drug dealer -- lot of good that confrontation did.By "unrepentant" I mean there's no indication in the story that Dunne desires to or will ultimately choose to detox from his drug habit. He makes the statement that "rehab doesn't work." Okay, that's fine, but do SOMETHING to try to escape your drug problem! There are other problems with the film: - The camera bobbles around too much as if to draw attention to itself ("See, this is a realistic slice-of-life picture!") It smacks of pretension.- The kids in the classroom seem too well-behaved. This is a problem in Anywhere, America, let alone the inner-city.- Despite Mr. Dunne's monotone dreariness, the viewer does desire to see him escape his addiction and fulfill his noble ambitions. We also come to care about Drey -- will she acquire the wisdom to stay away from drugs (dealing or addiction) and prison or will she too become part of the problem? Unfortunately the film leaves everything up in the air. We don't even know if Dunne still has his job at the end.I get the points the film is trying to make -- this is an anti-inspirational teacher/mentor movie. There's no by-the-numbers breakthrough for student or teacher. "Half Nelson" isn't concerned with such things; it's concerned with the the simple achievement of going to work every day and accomplishing something beyond oneself, despite a flawed nature and crippling habit. It's a fine point but it could have been done in a much more compelling way.Don't get me wrong, I don't hate "Half Nelson." I did appreciate quite a few aspects of it, especially Dunne's unlikely friendship with a 13 year-old girl, but the story never rises above its flat dreariness to become anything more than okay.GRADE: C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mesmerizing Character Study!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Half Nelson, a very low-budget movie, happens to be one of the most intense, revealing character dramas of recent years. At first, I didn't like the choppy camera work but then I came to realize it added a more gritty, realistic feeling to the film. It's definitely slow and kind of depressing, but the teacher-student relation will keep you entranced and wondering what is going to happen to these two.Ryan Fleck's film is about a history teacher and basketball coach who has a serious drug habit and he keeps going everyday because of his love of the subject and more importantly, his students. But one day, one of his students, a troubled girl, witnesses his secret and that secret will bring them together along a shared path.Ryan Gosling has been in so many great movies but this one of his best early roles as leading man. He gives one hell of a performance and it shows how this dude can act. Does he play a bad man? I would think not. Is he a good guy with serious flaws? I would say yes. Because of Gosling's intense portrayal, we care about what happens to this guy. Shareeka Epps does very well as the troubled girl and she holds her own against Gosling.Overall, Half Nelson is a beautiful drama about how two similarly depressed people are able to connect even though they don't find much in life. It's a bit depressing but at the same time, it can be a tad uplifting as well. For a very low budget, this film speaks on higher levels and proves you don't need extremely high budgets to make good movies. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, it's been eight years and i still can't believe it. It was like yesterday when i stayed up late,looking for a movie to watch to distract me from my loneliness. Ryan Gosling got my attention with "The notebook", he made this really corny romantic story into something more, he created the character of Noah-the character of the lonely, left behind guy, who tries to find meaning in life, but instead grows a beard and keeps his promise of building a house. I'm sure there are so much more characters like this but this one really got me. And now this beautiful film-"Half Nelson"-the story of a teacher but not your "Dead poets society" teacher, who jumps and excites you, no. The lost teacher who has nothing and no one, and only the children keep him focused. You should be very careful before starting watching this film, because it doesn't have much happening in it. Its just a moment, couple of days from the life of this guy. My favourite scene is when he is dancing with this woman he met in the bar, while "lover's spit"is playing. I think this is one of the most powerful scenes of the century.</fullReview>

What's interesting about it is that is non-judgemental - a junkie teacher would be an obvious target for moral panic but the film merely observes without drawing any conclusions - both leads work very together and Gosling shows even back then just what a superb actor he is - highly recommended...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dan Dunne (Ryan Gosling) teaches history at Brooklyn high school attended mostly by black and Hispanic students. He engages his students inside the classroom. Outside of his classroom, he's a drug addict. His ex Rachel (Tina Holmes) was able to get clean, but not him. Then one day in school, one of his students Drey (Shareeka Epps) catches him in the bathroom. They form a complex relationship.This is another step in Ryan Gosling's acting career. He's perfectly natural as this a complicated character. After 'The Notebook', he could easily devolve into a nothing acting unable to take chances. He's definitely taken a chance here. He doesn't overplay the character. It's a subtle performance, and he's well supported by Shareeka as well as others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm going to be honest for starters, i didn't even manage to watch the full movie, because it was so boring... I recently found out I really like Ryan Gosling, he is a great actor, a really great actor, but not even his amazing performance saved this one. The story is boring and there's nothing new there, we've all seen it before (i'm talking about the teacher/student relationship), i couldn't understand half of the characters because i didn't care about any of them. I saw the first 30 minutes in a row but then i fast forwarded it until the end, and boy was that a useless movie.I'm sorry Ryan but this one was a downer...on to the next one which i hope is better...What a complete waste of time. The 3 stars are only for Ryan, because he always deserves it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ryan Gosling plays a functional addict who's a school teacher and the coach of the girls basketball team. One of his students catches him using and they seem to develop a strange bond from there. I quite enjoyed this and I think Gosling does quite well here as someone juggling his addiction and trying to "live" a normal life, as a school teacher no less. The student is played really well also, being from a broken home with a brother who's in jail for peddling drugs I believe.The characters have a few layers which begin to unravel as the film moves along and I found it really quite interesting, if a little depressing at times. Ryan Gosling also actually plays a role where he isn't just pouting or staring into space. Recommended if you're a fan of him. I quite enjoyed this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film for Ryan Gosling's performance. Gosling has become an actor who is one to watch, making independent films and mining a character who is on the edge, therefore it makes sense to view a film that gave him an Oscar nomination and became the first Canadian actor to be nominated for a best actor Oscar in 60 years. (Its true Academy voters do not like Canadians!)This story of a very good history teacher in Brooklyn whose personal life is out of control because of drug addiction and who befriends a vulnerable student who catches him taking drugs wowed the critics but left me cold. I realise its a low budget, independent film but the film really never grabbed me, the acting is good, Gosling is believable, but the film was a slog to sit through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could bear watching only the first 15 minutes because of the unsteady, shaking camera. I understand that making it appear that a five year old is holding the camera is, in artistic circles, considered an improvement; but this old man just gets irritated and reaches for the remote. Trying to follow the constant jittering image is, to me, akin to staring into a strobe light. It's not comfortable.This technique is followed in practically all televised commercials now and has been determined, I'm sure, to be effective in focusing attention, taking advantage of the natural human tendency to automatically look at movement. And it is effective - for a 10 second advertisement. But how people can stare at a constantly flashing, jumping, jittering, zoomed-in, zoomed-out, poorly framed image is beyond my understanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Educating by Bad Example</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Social science teacher and girl basketball team coach Dan Dunne (Ryan Gosling) lives for educating school youth. However the calling is less pronounced by ulterior motives, albeit he remains an idealist, but by more trivial bodily affairs, as the job brings him focus and resolve to stay in control of his drug use. His former wife left him after cleaning up assured that Dan Dunne does not have enough resolve to do the same. Dunne has limited control of his addiction, making him functional enough to teach, but not enough to be a good role model. Nonetheless, when student Drey (Sharekka Epps) finds her coach high in the women's bathroom, the duo quickly develop an awkward affinity, kin to friendship, with Dan tediously attempting to protect her from bad influence, such as that of her uncle drug dealer Frank (Anthony Mackie).Somewhat of a breakthrough performance for one of the most consistently brilliant American actors, "Half Nelson" is an uneasy and slowly building picture, which I honestly didn't like during my first watch. Ryan Gosling with his increasingly detached character, who slowly slides out of cohesive control of his addiction, however captivated me on second watch, together with a strong portrayal by Sharekka Epps. Set in Brooklyn and a permeating bleakness, Ryan Fleck's debut feature is a harrowing antithesis to your typical "Dangerous Minds" high school teacher fights for betterment of youth, meticulously avoiding its clichés. This is highlighted by a film's climax, where Drey's change and coming-of-age is initiated by observing the extreme downfall of Dan, as he parties high on drugs in the company of prostitutes. Thus the title "Half Nelson", as Dan ultimately uses his drug addiction to teach the ultimate lesson. Even Frank, the supposed schwarz-character is presented as more down-to-earth, not as your inherently evil bad guy set on corrupting youthful minds, instead as a friendly well-intentioned dealer with an alternate priority set. The character of Dan Dunne, a child of ex-political activists, now needs to enhance his world by using crack, else he finds himself lost in a frustrated spiral of falling ideals. Fatigued by losing in life and with his ideals, he only finds the strength to inspire through self-destructing, much in connection with the Hegel dialectic he teaches, which focuses on change only being possible by clashing opposites. Erratic and nuanced, Dan Dunne carries the weight of the context matter, so a complex matter of education through the eyes of fallen idealism.Nonetheless, despite it intellectual prowess, "Half Nelson" all too strongly depends on some implausibilities to form change, whilst the plodding emotionality makes it somewhat sleep inducing, often inspiring me to close my eyes in coherence with Ryan Gosling's dozy drop-offs.</fullReview>

Moreover, little emotion is conveyed which is really crippling for a drama.As for Ryan Gosling, he is always close to perfection in a dramatic, introverted, reserved character, but there is no chemistry between him and Shareeka Epps, who is quite average.Let's also note the good photography and a spot-on intimist direction.</fullReview>

After not hearing anything about it I just read the guide it seemed interesting so I put it on and gave it a watch. This movie actually turned out much better then I thought it would be. Ryan Gosling is a real terrific actor who will no doubt be on Hollywoods A list very soon. The story is original and touching while learning about two people.This movie is about an inner city school teacher who has a crack addiction. One day while smoking up on the school property one of his students catches him the act. This is not surprising to the student though who does not rat him out instead she tries to be his friend and the two form an unlikely friendship.This is a wonderful movie and a two character study. It is a must see of fans for a good drama. If you like lots of gun shots and exsplosions you may want to go else where.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie-script communication mixup? What do you think?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The makers of the movie seem to have misunderstood a part the script I think. The concept of "push and pull" that the teacher uses to explain history is a product of the effects of his speed use. By the way the teacher is acted out in the classroom, he doesn't appear to have a problem at all. It seems that the movie was altered in favor of having an attractive sort of character (passionate desire for the students to understand). Maybe the script as a whole was an alteration of the story for the same above reason. The writer had an idea to have a drug-addict teacher who the student tried to help, and the legitimacy of the history teacher's style was unimportant, disregarded. It did seem like the movie didn't focus at all on the actual success/effect that this (well-meaning) teacher had on his students.Regardless, an enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ryan Gosling made happen what happens only once every so often. Made me look at what I seen before under a new magnifying light. He took me with him and showed me, with the most astonishing clarity, the complexity of a talented man dragged down by a legacy of good intentions and addiction. We're permitted to visit his family once and we understand what he's fighting with without any weapons. He doesn't blame anyone but he's the result of his own DNA and he knows it. His bright moments, the explanation of what History is for instance, is a glimpse into the man he could actually be, fully. The humanity that Ryan Gosling lends to his character on his darker moments it's as chillingly real as it is moving. The chemistry he establishes with the wonderful Shareeka Epps is as powerful as the one he established with me. I want to meet him, I want to meet Dan and while I was thinking that I realize I know him already. He lives next door to me, he's related to me, I was his friend. This is what superb performances do. They re-awake you.</fullReview>

But not only Gosling gave a good performance. Almost everyone did, including Anthony Mackie to certain extent.Half Nelson is a drama film and might I add, a strange one. For some, the message of the film may be ambiguous and the movie itself, boring at certain points. That is never a good point, but especially here, considering it's only an hour and a half long.During the film, a great deal of scenarios would pop in to my head concerning the ending. Well, I have to say, the ending is unpredictable. The best word to describe it, is "solemn".The only reason to why this is not a 10 for me is the screenplay. I consider it to be the only flaw of the film. The problem is that the script is one of the most important parts of a movie.But I must repeat, Ryan Gosling is simply wonderful in this film. So if you are a Ryan Gosling fan, if you like dramas or if you just want to see a really good film, check out Half Nelson.</fullReview>

The film beautifully captures something so surreal like, the further away one is from conventional closeness/togetherness the closer one is to relationships that are broad, ambiguous and endearing..Half Nelson is a beautifully told story of a moment in time.. A teacher who is truly on a beaten path to nowhere and a student about to embark on a long winding road to regret, share a bond they both going to remember in the years to come.The film touches on an education in history without the density of dates and facts but the introspection of events, not necessarily appreciated by the school regulators but definitely for kept the kids engaged.Both Ryan Gosling and Shareeka Epps make it almost palpable and bring this space between alive.The film is certainly worth a watch, I would place in the category of films one enjoys in the privacy of self..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gotta admit I was bored most of the way through this movie. I can see why this movie is praised by some critics. Because of the message and the artistic direction it goes with it's plot. In fact I couldn't figure out what this movie is about or what the main plot was for a while when watching this movie. Now I like watching some artistic flicks and this movie tries to be moving, but I just wasn't really moved by this movie. In fact after 45 min in I was wondering when it would end. The plot revolves around two characters one a high school history teacher who is a drug addict and the other is one of his student. And they both face there own struggles in life and has different reasons and motives of why they connect with each other. Anyways some critics claim this movie is brilliant and I just couldn't see why. The dialogue and everything was just kinda dull, it was sort of original in the direction it went though. With both the teacher and the student struggling through life but that is about it. I like Ryan Gosling as an actor and he put on a good performance, but it just doesn't stand out all that much in this. The movie can be distracting for some audiences because it can be difficult to pinpoint what direction this movie is trying to go and the build up is very slow. This however is a very character driven movie and tries to go in a a realistic depiction of people and the surroundings. To sum it up this movie gives off some messages but it's a film that is far from being entertaining or touches the emotions. If at least the dialogue was engaging I would have enjoyed this movie a bit more but that just wasn't the case either. It really was difficult to get through this and is the last time I will be watching this film.5.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well written low budget film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: 8.5/10Half Nelson follows the story of Dan Dunne, a school teacher, with a drug problem he is trying to get rid of. He forms an unlikely relationship with one of her students, Drey, who one day finds out about her teacher's drug habit. Complications rise as drugs overtake Dan's life and Drey's future is in jeopardy as she gets closer to her brother's drug dealing friend. Half Nelson is a terrific movie. It depicts one of the world's biggest problems today, drugs. Drugs kill people every day, and it also kills the people that love you. Half Nelson shows how hard it is sometimes for someone to overcome their drug habit, or any problems that people have every day. And sometimes, a friend goes a long long way which Half Nelson tells us in this movie. I have no problems with performances in this movie. No one apart from Ryan Gosling and Shareeka Epps stands out. The other actors, however, did a fine job and didn't do any harm to the movie. They helped carry the movie well. This movie focuses on the lives of Dan and Drey anyway so Ryan Gosling and Shareeka Epps are in the spotlight. And they didn't disappoint. Ryan Gosling once again delivered a powerful performance as the troubled school teacher. He is extremely convincing on screen that I find myself caring for his character so much. Shareeka Epps also did a wonderful job as Drey, the quiet and mature school student. Shareeka Epps was brilliant in every scene she was in, whether it was a sad scene where she was crying, and a happy scene where she was laughing and cracking jokes. Ryan Gosling and Shareeka Epps carried this film to perfection. I have no problem with this film. I think it was a well written piece of work. It was a slow film. If you had short attention span, you might lose yourself somewhere in the film. But that was not a problem for me. The story was so intriguing that I was paying attention the whole time. I was not bored. I was not looking at my watch. I was just sitting there, watching the film closely, and let the film show the magic. One small problem though, I wish the ending brings a little closure to the story. It was not that it wasn't the Hollywood cliché that we see so often. It was a good ending but I just hope the filmmaker could give us a little closure, not left us hanging there, wondering, and surprised that the movie was finished. Another 2 minutes wouldn't hurt anybody. Anyway I think it was still a good and realistic ending. All in all, I think Half Nelson is a very well done film. It captivated the theme really well. It kept my attention the whole time. The script was wonderfully written. The acting was superb. The direction was genius. (I heard they filmed this movie hand-held for most of the scenes) I absolutely liked this film. It sent out a good message. It's a good low budget film that I suggest everyone to check out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Half Nelson is a good movie; almost getting there. With "there"; I mean going to the core of the problem; digging into characters, how they interact and change and how unfolding events impact them. Yes some people have this difficulty of fulfilling the responsibilities of adult life; and yes some of these responsibilities are so useless that we all fear that someday we are not going to be able to get out of the bed to go to work.Slipping slowly out of the routine can be easier than we think it is. And yes sometimes a white teacher in an under privilege neighborhood can develop a warm friendship with a teenager despite the odds and they can somehow manage to pull each other from the depths they could sink in. They can help each other to hold on to life; no matter how difficult that seems. At the level of idea; this is just the beginning. The challenge is to portray it in a way that it becomes real and familiar without putting too much words in it. To do this; many different aspects of the film making have to be put together. There should be good acting; there has to be events may be not too big and vital but enough to go deeper in the story, there has to be good narrative. Acting is the most powerful side of this film. No doubt about that. Ryan Gosling gives a good performance; you start with him you finish with him and you do not even realize how slowly he is slipping away. It reminds me of Taxi Driver and the perfect portrayal of a man who is slowly losing grip on his life by De Niro. Ryan Gosling might provide such a performance in the future; if not in this film. However on the other two accounts; the film fails to give a satisfying account. The idea is there; the acting is there but unfortunately; we do not get to explore the depths of the relation between the teacher, nor between the teenager and her brother's friend. There are some things; exchanged looks; momentary sparks, some unfortunate events that take place but the audience do not get to feel what really makes the girl from stopping to hang out with her brother's drug dealing friend. We can all say this is because of her encounter with her teacher and the realization that both of them do not belong in that room; but we have to admit; it just does not put a mark on our hearts and minds. This is like someone giving you a spoon of wonderful ice cream but taking it back just the moment you had the feeling on your tongue...Unaccomplished and unfinished...Though it could have been a perfect example of low budget; everyday life wisdom films...</fullReview>

Their friendship is both convincing and not perceived inappropriate on any level. Miss Epps is more than a match for Gosling, displaying just the right amount of emotional intent without becoming one of those annoying child actresses whose eyes must be the size of saucers to convey sadness. The supporting cast is also excellent, giving the whole story a credibility that makes Gosling's character so utterly believable as the flawed, drug addicted but brilliant teacher trying to survive from one day to the next. I found myself completely absorbed and crying unashamedly at the continued complexities of two individuals trying to navigate a friendship that they know is deemed wrong by most, but right for their own needs. I cannot believe that this gem basically flew under the radar (although acknowledged by some awarding bodies) and highly recommend people to watch this too see what film making is truly about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A genuine drama...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something admirable about a film this sincere, this organic. Without any directorial tricks, or any violent stunts depicted, we as an audience can still feel the tensed, bleak environment that these kids and teachers have to live in. And this genuine quality makes the movie more gripping than any dozens of "Boyz N the Hood" movies ever could. There are times when reality can be more horrific than any fantasy tale or monsters and this film depicts a lot of it, without employing cheap dramatic effects. Ryan Gosling, one of the most talented actors of his generation, is on top of his game here as Dan Dunne, a teacher with a conscience in a modest high school whose personal and professional life spirals down. Young Shareeka Epps plays Drey, one of his students with whom he develops a relationship that goes beyond the traditional bound of teacher-student. Her performance as a hardened kid facing problems of her own is very good, although still rough around the edges. This isn't a "Lean On Me" feel-good story. The obstacles the characters face appear to be insurmountable forces, much like "The Machine" Dunne speaks of to his students. Dunne's teaching of history revolves around opposite forces colliding but we get a sense that in the end, changes must come from within and that's where the movie succeeds. There is no arch villain. Gosling doesn't deliver a Hollywood speech that gets his class all teary and inspired. The poor public school doesn't magically transform into a fairy tale institution. The movie simply seems to allude that while wanting to make a difference in the world on a large scale is a laudable goal, changes do and must come from within first. A movie that deserves a 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film With No Discriminating Superficialities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Half Nelson is reminiscent of a John Cassavetes film. It relies on nothing but subtext and yet is not enigmatic or intricate. It's a film about people and lets them roam astray, surprising even the actors and filmmakers with what they will suddenly do. It's powerfully acted by intense Ryan Gosling, deeply discerning Shareeka Epps, and stern Spike Lee regular Anthony Mackie, it has a low-key, kitchen-sink visual style, everything to create a fresh twenty-first century take on the Cassavetes movie.Gosling's character, who has the most screen time and bears the most probing by the movie, is an idealistic, lenient, open and nonjudgmental person, making that perfect well-loved schoolteacher by nature. But, he is a victim of his own seemingly directionless leniency, abusing a crack habit and living a slob's life. The student who discovers his true colors outside the classroom, played by Epps, who ultimately steers the mast of the story, grows into his good friend, overpowering the hump of impetuous socially accepted judgment upon him and seeing him for the lost soul he is. The film's tension rises when she has to choose between two role models, Gosling and Mackie, who is overconfident in his belief that he is her mentor, yet both of them send mixed signals within the standards of society.This is a wonderful story, especially for one being told in the present American cinema. The film is all about being judgmental. The audience is given the choice to judge Gosling for being a school teacher with a crack habit and we are given the choice to judge the girl for her trust and unethical attachment to him, but despite what anyone thinks, their friendship is more open, honest, and understanding than most socially accepted ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The coolest junkie on screen since Frank Sinatra in "The man with the Golden Arm".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's really few convincing drug addict on screen, and the first achievement of this movie is the perfectly credible play of Ryan Gosling, who avoid exaggeration in order to give a mere human light to his tortured character. For that's what Dan Dunne is, a crack addict, unable to stop from his addiction, stuck in an uncomfortable situation he can't escape. But, as he said, "It's not because you know one little thing about someone, that you know the person. One thing is not the person". And what might be a self-justification to many junkie is partially true for him, because Dan is also a teacher, and a good one.His last link to reality are his students, and particularly one, that prevents him from definitely sinking. When he tries to teach dialectic to a eighth grade classroom of Broocklyn, his ability to move from his dead end situation might come from a black girl, who catches him smoking crack in the toilets of the school. Or not, because herself seems to be in relation with the local dealer, who sure wants to make her work for him.It's with great humanism that this dialectical relationship is told, far from the Holiwoodian cliché you might have seen in melodrama like "Finding Forrester" (not a bad movie, but not one of Van Sant or Connerry's finest). You really have the feeling with this movie that nothing is written in advance, that nothing's really predictable, and that, as in life, the worst can also came from the bad - and not only the best, like in Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Teacher &amp; student's platonic relationship in a daunting world.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I begin, please note that if you have seen Dangerous Minds or practically any other inspirational teacher movies then bin them from your mind. Half Nelson follows on from the concept and turns the whole genre on its head. Follows the life of school teacher and school basketball coach Dunne who wishes to help out young female student Dre.The catch though is that Dunne's life is seriously worse than that of the student he is caring for, he is a "base-head" as another character in the film puts it. Confessed rehab failure, he spends any spare moment taking coke or crack. Dre on the other hand lives in a world which is unrelenting. Mother works all hours, no father and brother is in jail, and the family has to rely on handouts from a charismatic drug dealer.Hard to describe this film without giving too much away. The relationship is never other than Platonic, thankfully, but it is obvious that Dunne is as much in need of emotional help. The film turns really on the idea of teacher helping failingly pupil but really who is and should be helping who? The film is very intriguing and enjoyable movie. The humour is dark at times but still very good, and helps to relieve the tensions. The drug scenes are not too heavy handed either, so not distracting from the main gist of the film. Acting is great but the camera work can give you headaches (its all done hand-held) but don't let that put you off.If you do want something different to the ordinary then this is well worth watching. At the end you will take away from it what you want. I enjoyed it and found it a change to the norm, and I'm sure most will also feel the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disillusioned young male teacher strikes up an unconventional friendship with a student when she discovers his drug addiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw this film when it open to a limited release in Ireland and what blew me away was the exceptional performances by the actors involved. Shakerra Epps defied her tender years by giving a mature, subtle performance as Drey, a young girl looking for a role model after her brother is imprisoned on drug charges. However the males in her life are hardly suitable characters to guide her in life. Anthony Mackie gives a solid and polished performance as the drug dealer who who tries to recruit Drey into his murky business, but it is Ryan Gosling who steals the show. As a history teacher who conveys to his students that change works in society, Dan Dunne's attitude and lifestyle contradicts what he preaches in class. The relationship that develops between Duune and Drey after the the latter discovers her teacher off his game on crack is one of mutual respect. Gosling's performance is mesmerizing. His character is stuck between a rock and a hard place. He tries to steer his student and new-found friend away from the sinister world of drug dealing, but he is in no position to preach as his addiction spirals his life into chaos and damages the relationships in his life. It is really a case of the pot calling the kettle black and hence the movie earns the title Half Nelson. Gosling more than justifies his Acadamey Award Nomination for his performance as the disillusioned, self-loathing Dan Dunne. His roles to date show that he has a tendency to play tortured young men, from The Believer to The United States of Leland, and this film shows once again that he is one of the best actors working.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very heavy, but enjoyable film with skilled acting throughout and a thought provoking and believable look at unusual friendships and substance abuse which avoids clichés. I was dreading were the film was going to go from the outset and it drew me into a darker and darker place until the tension becomes almost unbearable. I found myself having to pause the film from time to time and have a break and relax a bit. It reminded me a little of another film shot in the same location 'Last Exit To Brooklyn' as it had a similar out of control mood.I wish we had some thought provoking and multi-dimensional films like this coming out of the u.k. The only other film which comes to mind which again covers unusual relationships is Shane Meadows's 'This Is England' which I would also recommend if you liked this film. Half Nelson is a heavy film though which leaves you feeling a bit drained so pick the right time to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty fine film with excellent performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it's based a lot of times on real events,the typical subject of a teacher who inspires his students at the same time they inspire him has created a lot of shallow and pathetic films which simulate intellectual profundity when there is only clichés and cheap sentimentalism.Half Nelson has that subject but it's way better than a lot of similar films because we have not got here clichés or cheap sentimentalism...we have a hard story told with realism.Co-screenwriters Ryan Fleck (who is also the director) and Anna Boden could develop a story which is full of levels and meanings and which invites the spectator to take out conclusions.Without cheap sentimentalism,Fleck and Boden bring us a story with unusual complexity and impact.Also this film has excellent performances,from the very deservedly acclaimed Ryan Gosling and the sadly ignored Shareeka Epps who,at her young age,shows more presence than a lot of Hollywood stars.But,I found this fail on this film.There is a moment in which the movie was very slow and a little boring.I think that less solemnity and a more dynamical style would have worked better on that part.The movie is very good,no doubt,but that part took out points to the movie.Anyway,Half Nelson is a pretty fine film with excellent performances and a good level of complexity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Half Nelson tells the story of Dan Dunne (Gosling) a Brooklyn high-school teacher who abandons the rigidity of the high-school curriculum to teach his urbanite pupils in his own unorthodox, yet inspirational way. Yes this may be another film about young, under-privileged urban kids needing inspiration from the white middle-class, with a somewhat rebellious streak in them. Only this time ? he is just as messed up as they are. Dunne has a serious crack problem. Always on the verge of collapsing between his job and his addiction, he accidentally forms a friendly bond with the equally troubled youngster Drey (Epps), a lonely 13-year-old girl, who lacks parental guidance or work ethic. The local drug dealer, whose intention is turning her into a pusher, constantly courts her ? much to the chagrin of both her overworked mother and Dan. It could have been told through a series of inescapable clichés, but Half Nelson manages to retain a deft sense of restrained realism, that intensifies the ambiguous situations of its two central characters. Dan, a liberal with radical ideals, wants to help others, but is constantly caught up in ruining himself. Drey seeks friendship in him, but perhaps becomes a confidant to his inner demons, when she finds out about his crack habit. Whilst the movie doesn't attempt to say anything profound other than middle class values aren't enough, you'd be hard pressed not to find this film utterly compelling. Shareeka Epps is a real talent for her age, but Ryan Gosling is absolutely fantastic, delivering a really burnt-out performance of red-eyed regression.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warm art-house fodder that just misses greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not at all mainstream, more like a portrait slice of inner city life, Half Nelson shows an almost inescapable situation with Ryan Gosling, playing high-school teacher Dan, who is warm and loving to his pupils, idealistic, inspiring, and also a crack-cocaine addict. He teaches history - heavily mixed with practical philosophy and a concentration on civil rights. It's an uncomfortable position for him to be in - and also for the pupils, one of whom discovers his habit and doesn't know what to do about it.13-yr old Drey is a solid kid but knows she's a bit limited when it comes to available role models. Her brother is in prison. Frank, the drug dealer who put him there, has clarity of vision that the other characters lack but no sense of idealism. He feels responsible towards Drey and wants to protect her from Dan (who wants to protect her from Frank). Part of Drey's road to taking responsibility for her own life is to be pulled between these opposites without identifying with either of them. This polarity is mirrored in Dan classroom obsession with dialectic. The drug-addicted teacher's sense of caring towards his pupil is also part of him learning to care about himself - as Drew probably suspects.Half Nelson avoids just about every cliché. What little story development there is confounds any expectations of a Hollywood-style ending. The performances are lifelike, wholesome and unpatronising. Gosling's Oscar-nominated performance will attract those that usually avoid such art-house fare. Some will be blown away, some will want to go back to watching paint dry. Which is a shame, because although Half Nelson has something to say, it is more about acknowledging a heart and mind beneath the stereotypes of Brooklyn lowlife than about plot development.Like the screenplay, cinematography paints a vision rather than meekly supporting a narrative. Dan's apartment is shot in murky, low-key lighting, contrasting his downbeat private life with the bright, sharp colours of his school. When working, he tries to fulfil his idealistic vision of what he should be, but occasionally loses it. During a scene in the gym, a deep focus shot unites him with the youngsters - both those active in the game he is coaching and those on the sidelines. But when the camera suddenly focuses in on Dan alone, leaving the others out of focus, we sense his isolation as he momentarily loses his grip. "The kids keep me focused," he says in a later scene to his friend Rachel.The camera takes us in and out of Dan's life in an almost haphazard way, reminiscent of the photography in Larry Clark's Kids. There is no clear structure in his world - he goes with the flow and keeps up as best he can.While Half Nelson is brilliantly observed, it is questionable whether the premise it offers is sufficient to sustain the whole movie. The slice-of-life attitude, reminiscent of Wayne Wang's Smoke (also shot in Brooklyn), is realistic, but it lacks the transcendent insights that it constantly aspires to draw from Hegelian Dialectic featuring so prominently in the script. The observations on the civil rights movement, while valid, are more schoolboy than schoolteacher level. As Dan's brain becomes too befuddled to tell a joke properly, his philosophical ramblings seem just that - rambling. Half Nelson is a beautiful foray by an independent filmmaker. It so nearly has something important to say instead of fumbling, like its protagonist, in the attempt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>how the American left has failed...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is so captivating about "Half Nelson" is not that it's a story so much as an incredible character study of a school teacher, Mr Dunne played by Ryan Gosling. I can't recall the last time I was so captivated by a performance that seemed so true and so effortless. Throughout the film, I kept thinking: "I know this guy. I've known teachers like him." And there is something all too familiar about the social, political dynamics between the teacher and the school's society". Ty Burr of the Boston Globe said that this is an example of how the American left has failed in this country. The message (if there is any political message) is very subtle and in some ways, not so newsworthy. We've all felt and questioned a sense of hypocrisy from the baby boom generation of the sixties. But the film suggests reasons for this that are far more complex than we can even put into words. I have not even mentioned yet that Mr. Dunne is a crack addict. How did this happen and what is it that drives him to teach these kids in the first place? Mr. Dunne says "my students are what keep me focused". This line could not have sounded more true but we know that in retrospect, it is completely false. I believe it is the foreign and racial environment that is the key to his failings. He has a way of connecting and being hip to his students but he can't really relate to them. We can imagine how tough these kids from poor environments can be but Ryan Fleck does not show us this. In fact, quite the opposite is true and the responsibility is all up to Mr. Dunne. There is a contrast in his relationships with women and we see how easily he is capable of earning respect.I think one of the important questions to ask from watching this film is not so much how Mr. Dunne fails or becomes a crack addict but why he chose the path that he did. There is something ironic about Mr. Dunne's fascination with black history and Drey's drug dealing father who collects racial artifacts that hang on his bookshelf. Does the drive to teach these kids in this specific environment come from something as superficial as nostalgia? Mr. Dunne does not like to go by the book and he is attracted to the theory of dialectics but if he cannot relate to the kids or his relationships in a sincere, down-to-Earth and honest way, then there is not much hope for the future. That is just one take on the film, I'm sure you'll have others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ryan Gosling's excellence in a memorable and brilliant film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dan Dunne wakes up in the morning, drives his car to his work at a public school in a miserable and dangerous neighborhood, teaches valuable lessons to his students of the 8th grade, up until here you might like this guy for what he's doing. In his spare time, he takes drugs, running away from a life that seems to go nowhere, he doesn't see results by teaching History to his students. And up until then you might think that this is a bad guy. But in the end who are us to judge other person? Dan has the same up and down that all of us have, and in a real world just like the one where Dan is, there's no good guys or bad guys, no heroes and no villains but there's always the possibility to change who they are....or don't.In "Half Nelson" Ryan Gosling gives life to this teacher that is not the common role model of a teacher presented in many other films; he's a drug addict, has many faults, but he still has the strength to wake up and teach good things to his students, teaching the power of opposite forces, bringing their everyday life into the lessons, but most of all teaching them the importance of change in their lives. As he says at one point: "And its important to know that there are some changes you can't control and that there are others you can." This lesson sounds as a enormous contradiction pretty much because Dan is trapped (a half nelson thing just like the wrestling hold) in this world and nothing he can do will change his way of viewing the world. He's alone, his only friends are the drug dealers, and some female company while addicted, no everlasting companies, he can't control his addiction (to the point of passing out on the bathroom floor of the school being found by Drey, a student that develops a interest in this man's life) and he firmly believes that one man means nothing; which is very absurd because he fail to realize that he, alone, can change a few things, his students are aware of everything he says and they seem to be great students and example of good people in a place where everything seems to go wrong, there's violence, drugs and things like that. The friendship relationship between Dan and Drey (Shareeka Epps) is a two way road since he's not the most recommended guy to be with this poor child who most of the time is alone (her mother is a policewoman who barely has time for her) or in the company of Frank (Anthony Mackie) a drug dealer, friend of her enprisoned brother, and also a bad company for her. And Dan and Frank has this protective feelings on her, they want to be near her but they can't stand each other well, two opposite forces that have a lot in common, except for one supporting each other and doing more good things to other people than the other.With very few words but saying a lot of things "Half Nelson" proves that human being can change or at least there are things you can and things you cannot, as long as you decide when and what to change. In the film's case, it's Drey presence that might change things in Dan's life yet even in the things that are usual to the teacher. One of my favorite moments in the film is when Drey helps Frank to sell drugs and Dan is the buyer (of course!). The exchange of looks they gave to each other is so meaningful, painful in a way that is difficult not to think of how twisted the world is. She looks at him coldly, waiting for the money; he gives a longing and kind of happy look to her, they don't say a word to each other but just that says everything. And in the next minute you know that she didn't want to do that, sell him the drug.The magic of this film is in the brilliant performances of the cast, most notably the great Ryan Gosling and Shareeka Epps, who are beautiful together, whether in dramatic moments or in humored scenes and funny dialogs. Gosling carries the film all the way, really lives the character and makes us feel some empathy that in the hands of other actor we wouldn't have, he's brilliant, magnetic and amazing in every moment. The lessons given by his character (and by his students in some moments) are among the greatest ever displayed in motion pictures since "Stand and Deliver" and "Dead Poets Society" but without being preachy like these two examples. Other thing that must be praised about this film is the editing, and the hand held cameras that shows us the confusion in Dan's world, everything is so abrupt, things are half said, half done and it works perfectly.Profound, heartbreaking, memorable, but very underrated, Ryan Fleck's "Half Nelson" is a lesson of how good movies can be without spending too much money, yet it can change people's lives. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dan Dunne (Ryan Gosling) is a teacher in an inner city junior high school. While the difficulties that Dan has in the classroom are presented, the focus is on the friendship that develops between him and Drey (Shareeka Epps), one of his African-American students. All performances are pitch perfect.The troubles that Dan has in the classroom (which are really quite mild compared to, say, what Glenn Ford faced in "The Blackboard Jungle") are nothing compared to his personal problems. He is a drug addict whose addiction worsens throughout the film. We are led to believe that Dan's addiction is a response to the fact that the world is too much with him. He wants to make a difference but seems to be overwhelmed by the magnitude of the problems. This film is certainly not in the genre of "inspired teacher finally breaks through to his class." The whole affair would be quite depressing without Dan's connecting with Drey.The pivotal scene where Drey discovers Dan smoking crack in a bathroom stall I found to be fatally flawed. Why would Dan go into a women's locker room to practice his habit? I mean he could at least have gone to the men's locker or an empty classroom or, better yet, gone home. Toward the end Drey delivers drugs to a motel room only to discover that it is Dan who is the buyer and that seems like a screenwriter's trickery. The actors deserved better.The potential difficulties with an older man developing a friendship with a young woman were dealt with only marginally. In one scene Dan's dancing with Drey in a suggestive manner does draw some stares, and Dan ultimately realizes the possible appearance of untoward behavior and breaks it off. But maybe this was one of the messages of the movie, that both Dan and Drey were leading such lonely lives that nobody was close enough to either to have any lurking concerns.Almost every shot was done with a hand-held camera, so if that makes you queasy, be warned.I liked the theme of how friendships, no matter how unconventional, can be mutually beneficial. Also, the idea of a student's being more mature than her teacher and setting an example for him is nice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great movie about an unusual friendship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about friendship, about a special friendship between a 12-year old student and her history teacher. These two characters could be either one of us each one haunted by his own past. They both have something to do with the underworld. A drug dealer has taken the responsibility to take care of the girl without her will but as a favor to her brother and the teacher is a junkie. So they must both survive in this reality and to accomplish that they have to be mean and cruel. So they both want to escape from their past but the sad thing is that they refuse to admit this to each other even when all their secrets are revealed. But mostly they refuse to admit it to themselves and that's probably the reason they can't get out. But it seems that their relationship is a way out of all this, a place where they feel safe, where a friend will stand up for them. In the background the director posts his comments about freedom of speech in America, racism and about how we all know about this injustice yet we do nothing at all to stop it... It's a movie really worth seeing not only because of the terrific performances of the two actors but because I think it will really touch you and make you think?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is the second movie I've seen with Ryan Gosling and he was brilliant! I can certainly understand why he was nominated for an Oscar. What a moving film. I love stories like this one with a flawed hero. I could relate so much to the dire storyline. All the characters, especially Drey, seemed like real people. The acting was not over the top, or stereo typical. I highly recommend this film. Granted it's not a feel good flick of the year but it definitely sends a powerful message. I think that with Indie films you get that relatability that you don't with big Hollywood releases. I see my story told or can relate to the stories told in Indie films way more often than in Blockbusters. The acting and directing in Half Nelson make this film a must see!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great Gosling performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Daniel Dunn is a young man suffering from a severe case of cognitive dissonance. By day, he works as an inner city school teacher and basketball coach, doing his part to help his students break the cycle of poverty and make something of themselves. By night, he's a crack cocaine addict, scouring the bars and back alleys of the neighborhood in search of his next "fix." Somehow, Dunn is able to keep his deep dark secret hidden from the people at the school, until one night, after a game, he is found by one of his players completely strung out in a stall in the girls' locker room. Drey, an inquisitive but level-headed youngster with problems of her own at home, doesn't turn him into the authorities, but rather strikes up a relationship of sorts with this man she admires, a relationship that might possibly hold the key to Dunn's eventual salvation.In his best role - and performance - since "The Believer" in 2001, Ryan Gosling proves yet again why he is one of the truly outstanding actors of his generation. He hits not a single false note, playing a man completely beaten down by a demon he has no idea how to combat (he has apparently gone the detox, recovery-group route before but with no success). Gosling's Oscar-nominated work here is mesmerizing and heartbreaking, as his character goes about leading this strange double existence, turning Dunn into a complex individual who is part Mr. Peepers, part tragic hero. The screenplay by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck follows no set pattern or formula, moving fluidly and seemingly at random as it charts the very strange course Dunn's life is taking. The script carefully avoids having Dunn articulate too clearly his inner thoughts and feelings, leaving his actions and expressions to convey more than his words. This not only provides Gosling with an opportunity to more thoroughly plumb the depths of his character but it makes the character himself more ambiguous and intriguing and thus much harder to read.Gosling is matched by young Shareeka Epps, who proves herself a screen natural in her acting debut as Drey, a girl made wise beyond her years by the circumstances of an absent father, an overworked mother and an older brother serving time in prison. Despite all that, she is somehow still able to see the good in people, and it is that quality that allows her, tentatively at first, then with a bit more confidence, to lend a helping hand to her teacher. Anthony Mackie is also first- rate as a neighborhood drug-dealer whom Dunn, with crushing irony, fears will be a harmful influence on Drey.Despite endless opportunities for feel-good moralizing and holier-than-thou speechifying, the film neither judge its characters nor preaches to its audience. The movie is all about observing behavior and relating a compelling story, then leaving it up to the viewer to figure out how he feels about it all. This is particularly evident in the closing scene of the film, which refuses to tie up all the loose ribbons into a nice, fancy bow, perfectly aware that life is simply too messy and inconclusive for pat endings.As director, Fleck uses a subtle hand-held camera to bring a naturalistic feel to the film, but its movement is steady enough not to call undue attention to itself. It's true that one does begin to wonder just when Dunn is able to complete all the mundane tasks that go along with teaching - the lesson planning, the grading of papers, the attendance at boring faculty meetings - when he is spending most of his evenings in search of the ultimate high, but we'll have to chalk that up to suspension of disbelief and move on from there.Beautifully acted and exquisitely directed, "Half Nelson" is easily one of the best films of 2006.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great subtle movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the surface another indie film about a teacher and his pupils sounds awful but Half Nelson is something different altogether. Put Ryan Gosling in the role of the teacher, give him a bad drug problem add a startling performance from Shareeka Eeps as his pupil and get people like Broken Social Scene and Billy Bragg to do the soundtrack and there is already something special forming. Then there's the shooting, all done on hand held cameras (except 9 stills at the end) all grainy and jumpy like the streets in which its set and finally a brilliant script that not only lets the actors shine out but keeps the films pace just right as it teases us with bits of information and keeps others to itself allowing you to make the judgements you need to get from the movie want you need, there is no filler here, each shot and set and look is there because it has to be. I assume the title comes from the wrestling move that is easy to find yourself in but not so easy to get out of which could be a metaphor for the situations the films characters tend to find themselves in. what could have been over the top and preachy actual doesn't do either and deals with the messages in a very empathetic way and ultimately doesn't force on you any conclusions, its realises that as viewer you are intelligent enough to think for yourself. The film doesn't patronise or play for sympathy it simply tell a moving story very well. Half Nelson has been getting loads of praise and rightly so it is a brilliant film in every way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fresh Look But Not What I Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HALF NELSON is a bit of a conundrum. It has something fresh at its core and a stellar performance from lead actor Ryan Gosling (it earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor last year), but the story is so loose and vague (especially the ending) that it will drive many watchers to distraction.The freshness comes from the fact that this isn't a story about some great white hero coming to a downtrodden, black school in order to lift their educational spirits and thus their chances of breaking out of the drug ring mold so often affiliated with this genre (see THE PRINCIPAL or DANGEROUS MINDS as prime examples). This is the story of a teacher named Dan Dunne (Ryan Gosling) who's drug problems spill out of his personal life and into his professional one. This is noticed one day by one of his students named Drey (Shareeka Epps), a thirteen-year-old who's in Dan's history class and part of the school's girls basketball team, which he coaches.Dan's teaching-life begins to show cracks as he rambles off on inane topics during class and eventually, in a more physical manner, when his nose starts bleeding spontaneously.Drey has issues of her own, trying to deal with a brother who's in prison (for selling drugs), a mother who works so much that she's turned her daughter into a latchkey kid, and the advances of a local drug runner named Frank (Anthony Mackie, FREEDOMLAND), who wants to use Drey as one of his delivery folks. All of these things pull at Drey and we see her struggle to understand why the world around her is so shitty and how someone she's looked up to (her teacher) could be a part of it.Both Dan and Drey try to save each other in their own way, too. Drey by waiting for her teacher after school so that she can distract him from his self-destructive ways, and Dan by confronting Frank and asking him to leave Drey alone.Gosling's performance of a drug-addled and lost soul is spot-on. His win at the Independent Spirit Awards for Best Actor was well deserved, as was his Academy Award nomination. Young Shareeka Epps plays well beside the towering Gosling but wasn't quite up to his level.The big letdown, however, was the loose reins of the story as a whole. We never witness what happens to Gosling's character at the school after a substitute comes to replace him (we might assume that he went into a recovery program or was fired from his job or both, but we don't know; he may also have just quit in order to save his students from his destructive behavior but, again, we just don't know).The ending sequence is interesting if, again, a bit too vague. We're not privy to what becomes of Gosling and Epps' characters. They're left sitting on a sofa staring at the camera, making one believe that either things aren't going to change or that great changes await them. Which it is is anyone's guess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is what movie making should be about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was one of the lucky ones to get a free ticket to a preview of this film prior to its release in AustraliaAs far as I'm concerned, out of the five performances nominated for best actor this year, wonderful though Forrest Whittaker was, Ryan Gosling's performance blows Whittaker's right out of the water. Very hard call between Gosling in this film and Peter O'Toole in Venus in terms of outstanding acting in a difficult and provocative role.Particularly amazing scenes include the moment when Drey, the young student first finds Dan in the female toilets at the school, shaky and on the verge of collapse from drug use.Another is when he attempts to tell Frank, a local dealer, to stay away from Drey.For me the emotional centre of the film comes at the moment when Drey walks in on one of Dan's 'rave' parties and they look at each other for a brief moment as the money changes hands. So much is communicated without the use of a single word.Dan's speech about the dichotomies evident in Western thinking and the East's ability to accept paradox, imperfection and contradiction seems to encapsulate what the movie is trying to say. Nevertheless this film is fearless about leaving all kinds of things unresolved at the end of the story, and it works because the screenplay is excellent.Wish the Americans would make more movies of this kind--provocative, thought provoking stories about real people living real lives will always find an audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Familiar Thoughtfulness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No, not a movie about wrestling. Like 'Sherrybaby', 'Half Nelson' is a familiar film elevated by a standout performance from Ryan Gosling. The young Canadian actor makes this movie about a drug-addicted teacher one with heart and personality, but doesn't always come off as a personable and engaging film. But the honest approach to its subject matter should be applauded.Dan Dunne teaches eighth-grade history class. He teaches at a school in Brooklyn, where gangs and street violence is right around the corner. His innovative way of teaching reaches students better than most, but Dunne is suffering from some demons of his own. When Drey, one of his students, discovers Dunne using drugs in the stall of one of school bathrooms, it sparks the beginning of an understanding relationship. An independent girl who doesn't see much of her hardworking mother, Drey's in danger of falling into the street life. Dunne becomes somewhat of a mentor to her, forming an endearing bond and struggling to keep her away from her drug-dealing cousin Frank.'Half Nelson' works because of its highly talented cast. Ryan Gosling is no stranger to the world of film, having starred in films such as 'Stay', 'The Notebook', and 'Murder by Numbers'. Despite his talent, he's never been given much consideration. 'Nelson' marks his first venture into honest-to-goodness serious film-making. Gosling is brilliant at underplaying his role, portraying the sharp-witted teacher with a dark secret. His performance is awe-inspiring, masterfully portraying a character who is not always easy to sympathize with. Not to be outdone, the young Shareeka Epps delivers an outstanding performance as the student who discovers Gosling's addiction. She'll break your heart, giving the film the biggest dose of emotional depth.'Half Nelson' isn't necessarily a great movie. It's not a story we haven't seen before, and it doesn't always avoid the pitfalls of formula. And while it may be predictable, it's an impressive film that doesn't rely on cheap over dramatics to add systematic depth. From on-the-rise director Ryan Fleck, fine direction and a well-paced story helps 'Nelson' when it could have easily become repetitive and monotonous. Instead, there's a refreshing breath of air to it all. I only wish it was able to work on a higher level, something that could have been more engaging. There's a great film somewhere in 'Nelson' waiting to be told, but I couldn't help but feel that at times it was distant and lacking a certain emotional resonance. Something the film would have benefited greatly from.Is 'Half Nelson' an inspirational story of redemption? Or of the pitfalls of habit? No matter how you look at it, it likely won't effect how you feel about Ryan Gosling. There's little doubt there's a natural and great actor ready to break free, and 'Half Nelson' should serve as a nice vehicle to a promising career. And while I wouldn't call 'Nelson' a great movie apart from its cast, it's a sobering and honest look at a man caught between worlds. See it for Gosling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Half Nelson" (2006): Starring a very effective Ryan Gosling, and talented young actress, Shareeka Epps. Gosling is a middle school teacher, and a girl's basketball coach. Epps is his student and loner, even on his b-ball team. She seems to need him, and he responds by caring for her. Then she makes a discovery about her teacher ? her favorite teacher ? someone almost like a friend. She also has a mother who works double shifts as an EMT, and a "father" who is far from a good influence. She has what she has. THESE are the three adults in her life. THESE are the adults who matter in her life. Exactly WHO IS caught in this "half nelson" grip? This is a low-key, slow-to-reveal, slow-to-change story full of set-backs, little insights, sadness, and glimmers of decency and hope. It is a very fulfilling experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotionally drowned in it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I don't want to argue with anyone who is impersonal enough to hardly be moved by this film and to think it's overrated and to analyse why this indie film triumphs so much. It's always an individual thing when it comes to art. While the film didn't strike the chords in some hearts, it really did in mine.It shows the beauty and power of indie film --- so subtle, so real, so comfy, so touching. It's the story good enough to show the best of every actor's performance; it's the music apt enough to carry me through this emotional trip; it's the cinematography earthy enough to be my eyes; it's the editing ringing enough to leave me in thoughts.I admitted a big shock when I found out Ryan Gosling was exactly the anti-Semitic Jewish who once convulsed my mind in "The Believer" years ago. I couldn't even relate it during the whole watching. And that's when I was really convinced by his acting. What's more...he was so cute while dancing stiffly to "Wanted" in the party.Quoting Dan's theory on history evolution, teacher and student are also in a kind of opposite relationship. It's always soul-stirring and daring to overcome this opposite and develop a winning friendship.I always regard my childhood a little bit peculiarly precious since almost all my really good friends were teachers around twenty-five and the most precious one of them is as much a "big asshole baby" as Dan. I mean, I really shared my feelings and problems with them and they with me. OK, I was never a happy-to-think-of-nothing-else boy in a perfect family. It's been getting better now, but the damage was done...Teaching is always a great work for me. I adore all the good teachers who inspire students. There are "Dead Poets Society", "Hard Ball", "Dangerous Minds", but rarely have I seen a film in which a particular relationship between a teacher and a student was portrayed. This time it got me mesmerized and took me back to those reverberant old days.I was a student living inside the world of a teacher; I am a 23-year-old man willing to be a teacher. I altered my consciousness between the two characters and felt for them. I'm just as happy to see their readiness to change as I was once sorry to be changed by force.Some might say this film supports some real "baseheads" to continue living in pain with no backbone to change, but...let's see the fact: in this harsh society, it takes so much courage and determinations to live in agony. We overlook it. We abuse our patience. We pretend to be fine. I tell myself maybe I should respect my own feelings more by delaying my responses while others are waiting for them. I'm sometimes as polite as a freak...I'm just seriously joking.I wonder what my Dan Dunne is doing right now. He's got no girlfriend at the moment. He sleeps on a cushion on the ground. He's a loser to all the school staff but a hero to all his students.He inspired my life to the greatest extent. He and all those alike deserve a movie to portray their chickenshit life --- like "Half Nelson".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What can one man do?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, one man COULD try teaching dialectics in a middle school history class, while trying to hide his cocaine-snorting habit. And that's what Ryan Gosling's character is doing in Half Nelson (I have no idea what that title is about).My problem with Half Nelson is that it approaches its themes (social injustice, alienating effect of the typical school curriculum and teaching methods, inability of socially-aware individuals to shake the others out of their apathy) too tentatively. It's all so subtle that it makes you wonder whether the movie is actually getting at those issues or it just seems that way. Personally I would have preferred a more head-on approach.What makes the movie worth watching, though is Ryan Gosling. The man makes one of the best roles of the year. It's the sort of turn that will bring him to the attention of every filmmaker who can afford him. Gosling's character is too mature to be a rebel, but young enough to retain the NOSTALGIA of rebellion. He still cannot accept the state of affairs in the world, but at least he finds a way (with the help of cocaine) to accept his life to a satisfying degree. His facial expressions are just fabulous. When he puts one of those deep, cocaine-induced smiles on his face, it's just pure bliss. It makes you feel like laughing and crying at the same time.The movie is filmed with a hand-held camera, with frequent facial close-ups, that give a feeling of authenticity and presence.Not as powerful as I would have preferred, but subtle and naturalistic. A good watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think for this one it's important to look deeper. The story creeps along, so it hard to realize the complexities and the point of slow moving plot. But, eventually it clicks that this is a real slice of life, where the issues are introduced yet not resolved and questions are left and you have to think about it after you watch it. I think Ryan Gosling did a great job with his character. He really conveyed a sense of hopelessness, but also of wanting to affect some sort of change in the social system. The real hero of this movie was Shareeka Epps, who played Drey. She really became her character, the best part was she didn't over act. She just seemed like the strong yet confused young girl that she was playing. The movie was able to stir the pot on a lot of issues including, race relations, drugs, education, family and human relationships in general. I think it is definitely worth seeing even if at parts it seems a bit tedious because it is very true to life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ryan Gosling stars as Dan Dunne, a teacher in New York. He appears to be a good, caring History teacher, but we see early that he has developed a serious dependency on drugs. He starts his day that way, and as the day nears its end, we see him struggling to finish out his day. Dan also coaches the girls' basketball team. Shareeka Epps, small and short, stars as Drey, a girl with a good head on her shoulders, but sort of mixed up with the wrong kind of adult family "friend." She earns some spending money for her mother by helping to make deliveries.After one game, girls' locker room empty, Dan is hiding in a stall when Drey finds him, stoned. It becomes their secret, buy Drey becomes his friend, getting the occasional ride home, and watches as she sees Dan spiraling down deeper. It is a movie, a story, to see if Dan can achieve some sort of redemption. A good movie, if hard to watch at times. Geat acting by the two leads.SPOILERS. One evening Drey is making a delivery, and she sees that the customer is Dan. This is a revelation for her, finally putting a real face to that dirty business, and we believe that she will be getting out of it. We also see that she will help Dan, her friend, climb out of his personal dungeon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a bit hard for me to get into. The plot crept along at a snails pace. I kept waiting for some big breakthrough to happen in the classroom or in the personal lives of the characters, but then it all of a sudden clicked. This film was a real slice of life. People don't change very easily. Some magic thing doesn't align and make everything better. The point is to make people think about there own situations in life. It gives a real look into the world of inner-city living. The point is that it's not great and it really takes a lot to make a change. Reaching even one person is all anyone can hope for. The circumstances that our country has forced upon people do to the socioeconomic system is not something that will be easily broken, but if we can get people to think about it through film at least it is a start. The acting was really good. I think the little girls performance was amazing and very realistic. I think this film is definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film about the struggle to teach America's youth while maintaining some sort of personal life and boundaries, "Half Nelson" is a dark and entertaining tale of a complicated friendship between a white male teacher and a 13 year old African American girl. In parts it paints them in opposite roles. The girl takes care of the teacher. The teacher struggles to teach the inner city kids about their history and what history is in general. With little effort it is able to make a lot of social commentary on drug use, black and white issues and the American school system. The acting is great, and it is refreshing that there is nothing sexual between the teacher and the little girl. Though this movie is a bit depressing, I think it is worth watching.

		<shortDescription>Excellent Character Study of a Man Caught Between his Addiction and an Unlikely Friend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>He's clearly an example teacher -- one that any student would love to have, one who truly understands the concept of what his work is supposed to be and wants his students to excel in their understanding of American History (and in particular, contemporary, landmark events). He has that type of demeanor which ingratiates itself in a pleasing way instead of being the teacher they all fear and secretly loathe. So why does Mr. Dunne (Ryan Gosling) suddenly collapse inwards into this cul-de-sac that is his co-dependence on cocaine? It's hinted that his addiction might have come from his family, an odd assortment comprised of a liberal mother and a racist father. It's also possible that a failed relationship might be the cause. It's also possible that there might be no real reason for this: it just is.What Mr. Dunne does have, however, is a friend, and one that materializes in the most unlikely of ways: a model student named Drey (Shareeka Epps) who feels pity for him when she finds him in the girls bathroom one afternoon, stoned out of his mind yet asking for water and help, and who becomes drawn to him for reasons that are left unclear throughout the entire movie. (There are speculations, from scenes involving Drey applying make up for the first time in front of a mirror as it inter-cuts with Dunne making love to his girlfriend of the moment, that Drey might be a little attracted to Dunne, but at least during its run, HALF NELSON doesn't tread those waters.) Of course, their friendship is the crux of the entire story -- how it develops, how it sidesteps but eventually tackles the issues of his addiction, her defense of him even when others point their finger (not fully aware that their friendship may not be well seen in the community, especially at a time when inappropriate liaisons between teachers and underage students are the controversy of the times). It's this friendship that seems to save Dunne from an unfortunate ending; his life, however, does take a dive into the worst, it seems, but throughout this little movie that photographs an unremarkable event in the lives of two people, it's peppered in the hope that the metaphor of the title will not be a postulate.HALF NELSON is fraught with intense but introspective performances from both its leads, who are on screen most of the time. I loved how in one disturbing scene when Drey walks into Dunne's house and sees him in full drug mode (with other people), all they do is communicate with their eyes... and that is all they need. Understanding on both sides follow. That's acting from the inside.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Searing Performance by Ryan Gosling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gosling plays an inner-city high school teacher who happens to give the majority of his history lessons while fighting a hangover. His secret is safe until one of his students, played by Shareeka Epps, finds him strung out in the girls locker room after a basketball game. What starts off as an awkward situation for both blossoms into a friendship. Both provide the other a sense of comfort as they discuss their personal problems.Ryan Gosling gives a performance that can be considered Edward Norton and Hilary Swank-like. Both actors really gained Hollywood stardom from roles in independent films such as Half Nelson. Much like American-History X and Boys Don't Cry, Half Nelson deals with a somewhat morbid subject matter, in this case its drug addiction. Gosling's character spends a majority of the film slipping in and out of his drug euphoria. You never really know if he is high or coming down. What makes his character so heart-breaking is the realization that his student is an acquaintance of his drug dealer. He fights with the reality that his protection over Drey (Epps) is somewhat hypocritical considering his own drug addiction. Epps herself also deals with the conflict of staying clear of the life that landed her brother in jail but can also see the pros of dealing drugs.Ryan Fleck effectively captures the unique friendship between Gosling and Epps but I must say the camera work was rather poor. The frames are extremely shaky throughout the film and are very distracting especially during closeups of the actors.Overall Half Nelson is a great triumph for Gosling and the young Epps as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Half Nelson Writer/director Ryan Fleck's brilliant portrait of redemption lost with no sense of tomorrow is extraordinarily intimate and equally moving. The film tells the story of Mr. Dan Dunn, a history teacher with a drug addiction that only finds salvation in the day to day meetings with his students. Ryan Gosling plays the multi-layered role and gives forth the best performance of his career so far. His lectures to his class is where Mr. Gosling shines but in the general rambling under the influence is where we find our hearts falling for Gosling's Dan. When his dark secret is exposed to one of his basketball players, Drey played by newcomer Shareeka Epps, much guilt, anguish, and tension starts to build in this dramatic sketch.Drey is a free-thinking young teenager trying to cope with her environment around her. Her brother has been recently incarcerated, her mother works doubles as an E.M.T., and she's been spending an unhealthy amount of time with a small time drug dealer (Anthony Mackie) who is responsible for her brother's jail-time. Epps' quiet yet stark performance is among the best child performances of the year. In her sereneness and curiosity Epps shines and plays equally moving as Gosling.The script is a bit underdeveloped and a little too "indie" for my liking but it does play with a remarkable message to its audience. Ryan Gosling definitely deserves the recognition and the Oscar nomination. This will be a big boost for his career and an even bigger boost for his ego. Shareeka Epps was campaigned in the wrong category which studios love to do and even the switch still didn't work. There was just too much competition for her land a spot in the top five of either category.Catch Half Nelson and enjoy the theme of love, secrecy and redemption sometimes lost but never found.Grade: ***/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HALF NELSON is one of those rare breed of films that takes a unique idea, wraps it in an intelligent script, finds the perfect actors to bring the story to life, and does it all on a minimal budget that goes for the jugular rather than the glitz of promotion. It is a little miracle of a movie.Dan Dunne (Ryan Gosling in a breakout performance) is an idealistic, fervent teacher recently graduated from college with a profound desire to make things different - in education and in the world. He is assigned to a junior high school in the ghetto where he is one of the rare white teachers for a black and Hispanic population: the principal is a hardnosed black lady who has rigid rules about curriculum and tutorial techniques. Dunne teaches his own way, involving his students in understanding rather than memorizing history. He is committed to his ideals but his technique is very student friendly and his class respects his demeanor. Very subtly he draws out the significance of important historical events, allowing the students to embrace the essence of civil rights rather than the rhetoric of the usual classroom approach.Dunne has a problem: he has learned to temper his frustrations and ambitions by escaping into drugs and he uses cocaine to soften his world. The 'crisis' of the story is the juncture when his brightest student Drey (Shareeka Epps in a stunning performance) discovers Dunne's secret when she catches him smoking crack in the very gym where Dunne is coaching an all-girl basketball team. With minimal words and maximal eye contact and tacit understanding Dunne and Drey bond. Drey is lonely: her brother is in prison for dealing drugs, her mother is works double time as a security officer to support them, and her brother's friend Frank (Anthony Mackie) coerces Drey into delivering drugs to his clients. How the bond between Dunne and Drey plays is the message of the film. This is not a physical love relationship but a sensitive fulfillment of needs between two bright people on the cusp of society's flaws.Ryan Fleck directs this film with the most subtle and sensitive technique, allowing us to view the flaws as well as the virtues of his characters. The script written by both Fleck and Anna Boden is creative in the classroom communication and minimal in the interplay outside the classroom, allowing the words to be superseded by eye messages and silence that is deafening. Gosling and Epps are brilliant in their ability to keep their characters credible, never opting for histrionics, always choosing to underplay potentially volatile scenes. The supporting cast is equally fine with the majority of the actors being in their first film and the others are solid professionals from previous quiet films. HALF NELSON is a wholly successful accomplishment, a film whose value will grow through repeated viewings and with history of cinema. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Last years most authentic film's only possible fault could be a slightly imperfect script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A powerfully subtle, deceptively vibrant, intuitive film triumph that deals with a teacher battling his own personal demons while trying to forge a greater relationship with his students. Sounds pretty standard...but it becomes immediately apparent, right from the superb opening scene, that star Ryan Gosling and director Ryan Fleck wish to pour every ounce of creative integrity and truth in the handling of this delicate material. Somehow these two components came together in such an amazing way that Half Nelson ran deeper with, greater resonance then nearly anyone could have hoped for.Everyone has praised Gosling's tour-de-force performance, clearly a career defining role that will see the pretty face known for his romantic lead in The Notebook elevate his stature to supreme A-list command. His raw and sensitive performance is the most dedicated work from a Hollywood male lead I have seen in ages, transcending nearly all of his peer's self conscious delivery to evoke a character so real that one will distinctly feel documentary-like authenticity. Some have criticized the script for failing to illuminate many of the shadows that are blocking our lead character's path, but this is certainly no fault of Gosling's; any ambiguity in the script is masterfully dealt with in a way most evocative of real life, which is exactly the kind of raw urgency the film provides. In less apt hands, Gosling's performance would have felt wooden and staged, but in the subtle genius that pervades most of the tiny details present to make Half Nelson such a believable and gripping film, I am eternally grateful and stunned at the competence of newcomer Fleck, immersing viewers with such an intuitive pacing and incredible sense of realism that the non-plot-oriented character study remains compelling throughout. Rounded out by an impeccable supporting cast, fronted by the impressively mature though believable Shareeka Epps, makes it hard to find any deviations from this tremendously pure film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, what a movie. So real and uplifting. The acting was amazing, the story was told perfectly. Every character was played so well, from the main characters to the teacher in the break room and Drey's brother in jail. What hit me the most was the fact that everyone had their own issues to deal with. No-one is perfect, we all have our own struggles and temptations, but it is the decisions we make to stay away and overcome that make the difference. From the main issues of Dan's lack of desire to change, to Drey falling into the same trap as her brother, every angle of this story was told so well. I can't say more. Truly awe inspiring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique, subtle and fascinating; Gosling is mesmerizing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to describe just what it is about the film that makes it what it is. What's for sure is that for such a small film ? and it is a tiny, tiny film ? it has a LOT to say. But it never says anything out loud; it's all very subtle and quiet but all there. For such a small film, I certainly wasn't expecting it to pack such a big punch ? but it does, and you won't see it coming.Story-wise it's practically null. But film has long since condescended regular storytelling. Half Nelson is a character study of the subtlest degree, as its characters are never exactly studied, but merely portrayed. What I can say with much confidence is that the character of Dan Dunne is easily one of the most in-depth, detailed, convincing and rounded portrayal of a fictional character in any film, particularly one not based on a book or some other previous literary source, where character development is easier as you have more time to do it. Dunne is never introduced or "developed" ? we simply learn who he is throughout the film. And what a fascinating character he is.On the one hand, he clearly has many personal problems ? his ambitions don't take him far, he is a teacher in a middle school in a troublesome neighbourhood, lives in a modest apartment alone, isn't writing a children's book although he tries to, has a wonderful ex-girlfriend who has long moved on and grown up, a brother he is jealous of, and in all, not much of a purpose in life ? which would explain his serious drug problem and occasional dealings with prostitutes. But something in Drey, a young black girl in his class, sparks him. Nobody in his class has it easy, as he is employed in an underprivileged school in a not-so-sharp neighbourhood. But for some reason or other he makes a connection with Drey. It's at once tragic and at the same time utterly inspirational to see how Dunne takes it as his personal responsibility to help this girl, even if this exists for him not only as a charity, but also as his only real reason to continue his life at all.Dunne is an inspirational figure. He teaches his classmates on their level, and it's fun to watch the classroom scenes with him to see his energy and dynamics with them. He's young; he connects with them. But with this film we don't get the usual "inspirational teacher" routine such as in Dead Poet's Society or The Emperor's Club. Dunne is a severely, severely flawed individual, swimming in personal problems and difficulties that make his teaching at times seem almost impossible.Ryan Gosling's performance is mesmerizing. There are no words to describe it. Everything from his speech to his expressions to his little nuances and mannerisms ? how he wipes his lip with his shirt collar or tie, or his constant eye rubbing ? adds to the multiple layers and elements of the character. It is also a haunting portrayal of addiction and also a beautiful portrayal of a human being. Gosling embodies Dunne, in every sense of the word. The performance is not showy because there's nothing to show ? Dunne is just another guy with many problems, who has this little spark in his life to keep him going. There is no doubt in my mind that this is the single best male performance of the year. But Gosling can't take all the credit ? all of his cast-mates, especially the amazing young Shareeka Epps (who plays Drey), do an amazing job.The film-making is also impressively unique. Utilizing long zoom lenses, Ryan Fleck the director keeps almost the entire film shot in intimate close-ups of his characters, rarely ever utilizing medium or long shots. Perhaps this goes to portray the intimacy between the characters, or perhaps it shows their fear of the broader scope and the wide world. Dunne constantly says himself that one man cannot change the world ? but he can change one life, and Dunne chooses to change Drey's life, or at least help and counsel her as best he can. A small and intimate change deserves of such intimate cinematography, and the constantly shifting focus further emphases Dunne's own state of mind.Thematically, the film packs more of a punch than it makes itself out to be, although this element does serve as a background buffer to the dynamics between Dunne and Drey. It is certainly interesting that the middle school curriculum material ? dialectics ? carries an extremely important message that resonates throughout the entire film and serves as a backdrop to the actions and dynamics of its main characters.This is one of the most beautiful, unique, subtle and fascinating films this year. Gosling's performance is the best of the year and deserves awards attention ? I am certainly curious to his recent snub in the Golden Globe nominations. It's a small, small film ? but one with a lot to say without ever being obvious or preachy about it. It deserves to be seen, and it's extremely inspirational.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An under-hyped, well-acted gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alongside Little Miss Sunshine, Half Nelson is arguably THE indie film of 2006, largely because of the amazing central performances.Ryan Fleck's debut feature stars Ryan Gosling (best known for playing a Jewish Nazi in The Believer) as Dan Dunne, a smart, but pretty lonely, man who teaches history to 13-year old kids in Brooklyn. He's a good teacher, and also a quite popular female basketball coach, but he has a dark secret: he's a crack addict. Naturally, one of his students finds out. However, Drey (Shareeka Epps) does not denounce Dan to the authorities. In fact, this incident adds new layers to their relationship.Most of the film rests on Gosling and Epps'shoulders, and both actors do a wonderful job: Gosling, who was justly nominated for an Oscar, further proves he's one of the most talented and versatile young thespians around, portraying a tricky character with off-beat charm and hidden intensity, and his teenage co-star delivers a breakthrough performance that's every bit as astounding as the one the considerably younger Abigail Breslin gave in Little Miss Sunshine. There's also good support from Anthony Mackie (of 8 Mile and She Hate Me fame) as Drey's drug-dealing older brother.Half Nelson is an impressive, almost flawless film, with only a few minor problems emerging in the third act: the scene where Dan has dinner with his estranged parents feels out of place, and while the relationship between Dan and Drey is handled beautifully, there isn't much insight on Mackie's character, an intriguing role that could have been developed better. But, like I said, these are minor flaws that, while taking the movie one step down from perfection, don't prevent Half Nelson from being one of the most gripping films of 2006. Ryan Fleck shows a lot of skill and confidence for a first-time director, and given the result, I would like to see him team up with Gosling again some time in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't had the subtext of a film move me so profoundly in so long. I'm not a huge film buff, I don't sit around analyzing character motives or plots...it's just not my bent - but the subtle grace of this film and Ryan's performance piqued so many inner dialogues for me on so many levels.To be honest, this film makes me almost feel embarrassed that I've been tricked by the movie industry into expecting over the top portrayals of life. Half Nelson is an example of how an honest, subtle depiction can be far more visceral. Ironic that a film about dialectics serves to essentially function as its own critique of the film industry today.Oh and having Broken Social Scene score the film was killer. Excellent all the way around.I seriously hope this film gets attention during awards season.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is nothing short of incredible. Definitely among the 10 best movies I've ever seen. Ever. Directed by newcomer Ryan Fleck, it stars Ryan Gosling as an inner city history teacher as well as girl's basketball coach, and Shareeka Epps as one of his students. The drama of this stellar character study comes primarily from Gosling's character, who struggles with a drug addiction which is discovered by Epps' character.Everything about the movie is spot-on. The cinematography is outstandingly fitting for the subject matter and setting, the sound ? and in many cases, the lack of sound ? artistically shows the interactions of the actors. The performances of the actors are nothing short of Oscar-worthy. In fact, better than that. Gosling's performance is, in Richard Roeper's words, "worthy of a young Marlon Brando..." Even though Gosling already received fame for his work in The Notebook, Half Nelson will be the role to remember, with the performance of a lifetime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Independent films usually fall into two categories. There are those who feel artificial and pretentious, catering to "indie" novelty, and there are those whose honesty, warmth, and charm should appeal to any moviegoer. Half Nelson undoubtedly falls into the latter.In the beginning of Half Nelson, we are introduced to Dan Dunne (Ryan Gosling). He is a middle school history teacher. He is also addicted to crack. One day, after a school basketball game, he decides to get high in the girl's locker room. One of his students, Drey (Shareeka Epps), catches him nearly unconscious lying face down in a stall. She merely says she's sorry for walking in on him before fetching a wet paper towel and swabbing his face. Afterwards he drives her home, and upon leaving the car, says "See you at school". We assume that Drey has been through this before, and we are right. She lives at home with her single mother (Karen Chilton), in a bad neighborhood. Her father's a deadbeat, her brother's in jail, and she has a curious kind of friendship with one of her brother's former friends (Anthony Mackie), who periodically gives the family money. There's not a lot of doubt as to where it comes from.In the hands of a lesser filmmaker, Half Nelson could've felt like a contrived after-school special, where Dan gives an impassioned speech about the dangers of drugs. There's nothing like that here. Dan realizes what he does is wrong, but he's addicted and cannot stop, although he certainly tries. Drey sympathizes with him, but she doesn't feel sorry for him. She's fiercely independent and doesn't let herself get too close.One of the film's many highlights is the acting. Epps gives Drey a sense of innocence but at the same time makes her a product of her experience. Mackie is superb as the neighborhood drug dealer. He makes a perfect rival to Dan, with each of them believing that the other one is a "bad influence" on Drey. "Baseheads don't got no friends", Mackie tells her. Gosling is the true standout, however. Even with mediocre material in films like The United States of Leland and The Notebook, he has proved himself to be one of the finest actors working. If an Oscar nomination doesn't come his way, I just might completely tune out the Academy Awards for the rest of my life.I'm sure there will be some complaints about the film's camera-work, almost all of which is hand-held. But there is a purpose in it. It gives Half Nelson the kind of intimacy it truly requires. It's as if the audience is there beside Dan as he gets high, inhaling as he does. It allows us to connect with the characters as not nearly enough films do. Yes, we need more films like Half Nelson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One thing doesn't make a man?Half Nelson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the end of summer; time to dump all those films that wouldn't hold up as summer blockbusters and gear up for award season. Lucky we have our trusty indie theatres, saving us from the boredom of sitting through paint-by-numbers fare, by offering more festival circuit darlings. This week sees the opening of the much-hailed Half Nelson. While most praise is bestowed upon star Ryan Gosling?justly so?this film is much more than one man. One man does not make a movie, and we are treated to one of the years best here. From the gritty, hand-held camera-work, emotion-wrought close-ups, nuanced acting, and realism to the stresses of life, every facet is utilized to the utmost effectiveness. Credit newcomers Ryan Fleck and his co-writer Anna Boden for crafting a beautiful story about humanity and the strong will for the survival of others overpowering any self-loathing one might weigh himself down with.Gosling is truly a tour-de-force in terms of his multi-faceted character Dan Dunne. He is a man who has gone through the worst of his addition to crack, and been through rehab only to find that he still can't handle life without the crutch. Dunne has decided to live for the moment and in doing so has to periodically wake up to the rest of his life passing him by. As Frank (a great performance from Anthony Mackie as a conflicted drug dealer) says at one point, baseheads don't have friends. Gosling says his addiction is in his control, that the children ground him. Unfortunately he just doesn't see how he pushes those he loves away at every turn. When his secret is revealed to one of his students, there is a revelation. Someone has come into his world that can help him, who knows his problem and can try and steer him back to life. This young girl, however, is on the brink of a downfall herself; seeing her mother work double shifts to stay afloat while being helped by the drug dealer who was the cause for her brother's incarceration. Why not help out and make some fast cash?Shareeka Epps is the young girl who has discovered a kindred spirit in her teacher and coach. Her character Drey sees an intelligent individual, trying to make a difference in the world while also being tied to the underbelly of addiction. The two live parallel lives, both knowing the natural progression of the others' circumstances and trying to stop that path for the other while slowly falling off the cliff themselves. Epps is amazingly real as Drey. She has all the emotions of a Middle Schooler bottled up inside, trying to survive without a older figure steadily in her life. Her innocence and purity, however, does come out when talking with Gosling, as does his. They can open their souls to each other and know they won't be judged. This relationship is why it is so heartwrenching emotionally to watch the climax of the film, when we see that fate takes us to room 50 where all our demons are released.Yes the performances are acted to perfection, but much credit needs to be given to the writers. Gosling and Epps are layered emotionally with careful attention to detail. The film is told in short snippets of life's travels, and each moment peels back a layer that has been buried underneath thick skin. A thirteen-year-old girl should not have the immense weight which Drey has unleashed on herself. The journeys she takes with her teacher, her mother, her brother, and Frank show the world through her eyes, and the bleakness that is so close she doesn't think she can avoid it. As far as Dunne goes, when we see his tries at a relationship culminate in his contempt for those who can't follow his deep philosophical thinking, we see a man in crisis. He has been disillusioned at a young age, as seen in a nicely orchestrated dinner scene with his family. All his needs for equality are very close to heart. He won't teach from a Civil Rights syllabus because that would be short-changing the subject. Dunne wants to bring about change in his students, he wants to show the competing pressures of opposites and make a difference in their lives, as he has not been able to do in his own. The human soul is a complicated force of nature in this way. It seems to never have a problem giving up on itself, as we are all sinners striving for good. However, to give up on those around us that we love cannot be done no matter how much we try. Tension can rise to a boil, but when you see those around you in peril you do your best to wake up and do what you can to help them strive for the better. One never knows the outcome; at any moment everything can once again fall apart. We do know that by trying there is always hope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely not THE WHITE SHADOW</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a pretty remarkable movie in a lot of ways. Having seen the trailer I was worried that it might be nothing more than a bad episode of "The White Shadow" (remember HE GOT GAME, everybody?) It was nothing of the kind. There are neither heroes, nor villains, in this movie. It's almost as if you are watching two families' home movies. Protagonist Dan Dunne's oblique remark to his student Dray --"one thing doesn't make a man" -- could be said of every character in HALF NELSON.I really needn't have worried about HALF NELSON being some kind of formulaic message movie. Ryan Gosling, whether by personal choice or not, has chosen very few roles and all have been in unusual and daring movies. He has so far shown an unusual ability to disappear into a role. He is as passive in HALF NELSON as he was aggressive in THE BELIEVER. And was thoroughly believable in both.Shareeka Epps gives a very stylish and nuanced performance, never going over the top hammy as a lot of kid actors do, but rather using her characters' style of few words to maximum effect in concert with a full palette of facial expressions.The movie can get slow at times but that's to its credit.The political and historical discussions and news footage are always appropriate.Nice job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Half Nelson is Full Gosling.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first feature that I have seen by writer/director Ryan Fleck was Half Nelson, his fifth film to date. Fleck turns in an outstanding fifth film and screenplay, co-written with Anna Boden a long time collaborator of Flecks. When we thought that the Mickey Mouse club had just given us mediocre untalented artists including Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears, and Christina Aguilera, Ryan Gosling appears through the wood works. So much can be said for his performance in this film, that one must see it to experience it, as it is too difficult to explain with words. PLaying the role of a middle school teacher addicted to cocaine and crack, Gosling eats sleeps and breathes the character a life that is unimaginable. He really is one of the great young actors of his generation, and will hopefully live up to this performance with more to come. The gritty style directing is very appropriate and adds to the reality that is Goslings life. Shareeka Epps' performance should also not be overlooked, although it does seem to be less difficult to relay than Goslings'. The film brings a sense of awareness to recovering drug addicts, and exhibits the pain they sustain when faced with a difficult situation. Hopefully an Oscar nod for Gosling, Half Nelson is a great movie for anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a riveting, must-see film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the film yesterday and can't get it out of my mind. The direction and screenplay are lean and to the point and the best I've seen this year. The performances of Ryan Gosling and Shareeka Epps couldn't be better. The newcomer, Epps, gives an extraordinary performance for such a young girl, one that is easily on a par with Anna Paquin's in "The Piano" and Keisha Castle-Hughes' in "The Whale Rider".I was especially drawn to the complexities of real life that were brought into focus by this film. Perhaps it takes a village to raise children but what a burden for the child when she tries to choose a mentor from people each of whom are both caring and harmful. I was reminded of the Maggie Cheung character in "Clean" whose mentor turned out to be a very unexpected person. So it is in "Half Nelson" when our young lady is faced with the situation of a non-responsive father and two highly responsive and competitive men as she seeks a male role model in her life.This is probably a spoiler: When we get to the end of the film we are given an open-ended conclusion. Again, like "Clean" we see the main character in a positive position. We are hopeful this means everything will be fine but we can't forget these two very flawed characters (Gosling and Cheung) are still junkies and even in the best case will always be recovering addicts. The realization is there. The tools they need to be successful are there. I left the theater hoping they will use those tools to turn their lives around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i was hands down impressed with the "average Joe" imagine and the normality vibe give by this project. upon some of the reviews i just want to point out a few things that do not seem to be mentioned enough: -this is very much a political movie; there are 4 occasions ( including my fav. one regarding henry Kissinger's thoughts of how chile's "democracy" is too important to be left at the choosing of its own citizens) where those moment are played somehow in background but at key moments in the advancements of the movie plot.-the comments made by the teacher regarding history are absolutely outstanding from the point of any revolutionary movement.- i have noticed a few comments regarding the scene where the main character "dissmisses" the lady that seems to have a love interest in him with sarcastic words "thank you, i had fun last night". while rude, one must observe the fact that the lady has already made of an opinion of him that he must be a communist( yes, she asked, but in an already "i know" tone) simply because he has books about Che Guevara in Africa. it shows how far apart this two people are in how they deal with human EMOTIONS and how the relations between two souls simply can not exist, never mind progress.- the drug use problems i think is there simply to give the movie a stronger relations to its viewers since the majority of north Americans have had experience with drugs at some POINT in their lives. also shows very indirectly how inefficient the "war on drugs" is.-now this is a teacher that struggles to get kids THINK WHILE they assimilate information. when the principal demands he teaches on human right movement in America, the viewer can clearly see how the minority has became the majority, and how things DO change. yet the historical events in our life go on WITH our each and own contributions but there seems to be no satisfaction and RECOGNITION for individual when those stated goals have been achieved already.-for the young generation there is a music video by "faithless" in co-production with "dj ties to" called "dance for life". i recommend it because the song and video compliments the movie on the subtle parts.-the reason that the movie gets only 9 stars and not 10 is because, at times i found it too slow in progressing the viewers thoughts, or at least the imagination. yes the acting is top notch but there is that vibe i get that the movie is slowed down intentionally to let the viewer chew on one segment at the time. it comes in contradiction with the movie's own premises of a view of a "revolutionary soul" which should always keep a non-stop momentum to it.- the young actress is simply magnificent. she and the teacher are simply having showing an awesome chemistry that transcends any "taboo" "do not talk about it" situations. the ending itself shows the climax of their human relation where everyone finds out exactly where their place is or should be.</fullReview>

However, he finds help from some unsuspecting character, that helps him to overcome his vice. This movie will help to make you understand just how lucky you might be, and how worth life is worth living, no matter how bad it gets, it can always be worse. The acting in this movie is absolutely amazing, even though there aren't any named actors in this, the actors that were selected for this movie, are absolutely wonderful.

The second, was the recent foreign south African film Tsotsi, i don't remember fluke well but i highly recommend Tsotsi, tonight i cried for a third time during half nelson. Subtlety in my opinion if done well can make a movie. As Drey handed the drugs to Dan at the end of the film it was one of the most subtle but powerful scenes i've watched in a long time. Words were not used and words were not needed, I felt what both characters were feeling and as any good movie does, it brought emotion out of me, the viewer. I was reminded of why i want to be a film-maker. I suggest half Nelson to anybody who enjoys a powerful film with a message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A junior high school teacher who also teaches the basketball team has a problem...a drug problem. Dan Dunne's life is a mess; he lives alone in a crummy apartment and is on the short end of an addiction that has a hold on him. After one of his students finds him in a stall of the girl's bathroom high on drugs, they form an unlikely friendship that raises a few eyebrows.Ryan Gosling was the only reason to watch the short lived television show "Breaker High". From there gosling went on to bigger and better things, with supporting roles in both "Remember The Titans" and "Murder By Numbers", he was making a small name for himself. Gosling went under the radar and it was his disturbing turn as a Jewish neo Nazi in "The Believer" that had me thinking that this young actor actually had some acting chops. In the field with other names like Paul Walker, Josh Hartnett and Orlando Bloom, Gosling managed to not be just another pretty face. He become a household name for young females when he and now girlfriend Rachel McAddams both turned in romantic performances in "The Notebook" Now Gosling is under the radar again with "Half Nelson" and receives a much deserved Oscar nomination.Gosling is a talent to watch, as his hones his craft he will no doubt receive the coveted Oscar in the future. In "Half Nelson", Gosling manages to pull off a complex and gripping performance that is honest and brutal. In the hands of any other actor the character of Dan Dune would fall under the clichéd drug addicted and the film itself would fizzle out amidst the hundreds of other films that came out in 2006. Gosling gives a quite and intense performance all throughout, that gives off a small hint of strung out and on the edge, and this man can erupt at any moment. The emotional connection that Gosling has with young newcomer Shareeka Epps drives the film into an uneasy, yet comfortable feeling. The relationship on the surface would seem inappropriate, yet we go along for the ride as if nothing is wrong at all. We feel comfortable with these characters being together. Gosling drives the film with his powerhouse performance and raises the bar for the rest of the cast in the picture.Fleck sees a lot of hand-held camera movements throughout, grounding the film in reality. The story itself takes place on the streets, thus the viewer feels uneasy. There are few steady camera pans and many close-ups and the characters faces. We get a close relationship with these characters; we see them for who they really are. In the scene where Drey sees that the last drug deal is in fact her teacher, we get a close-up of both their faces; we see that Dunne is at the bottom of the barrel. We also get a close-up of Drey, stunned and disappointed with her supposed friend/teacher. Another scene would be when Drey first discovers Dunne's drug problem in the bathroom stall. Embarrassment, shame, loneliness, compassion, and humility are all evident in Gosling's emotion and you need the close-up of his face to capture this emotion and feel how real it is. As Fleck's first big motion picture, you can see his inexperience, but every shortcoming is overshadowed by how good the film is.While the film itself has no real plot or direction, it's story is centred around it's characters and that makes for a gripping character drama. Most character driven films tend to stray from being entertaining into complete boredom. Half Nelson is an exception; it keeps the viewer enthralled and brings them along for the ride that is Dan Dunne. He is spiraling down and ending his road. He has to change his life; the only thing that is keeping him from going completely over the edge is the kids. The ambiguous ending leaves the viewer to make up their own mind as to what Dunne's life ends up being. He shaving his face is his rebirth, a new start; Dunne is trying to get his life back on track, but there will be bumps in the road, which is exactly what Drey meant by the statement that he missed a spot.The film doesn't keep up to the same pace as Gosling, but it isn't too far behind either. Half Nelson is one of those films that is under your nose and you have to look around to actually find it, but when you do you will be thankful. Nelson is a film to watch for its honest performances, not so much its directorial features. Don't let this small gem of a film slip through your fingers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's just a perfect portrayal of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can't say in any way that this film is theoretically perfect from a traditional way of viewing movies. The only reason that it is otherwise perfect in every way is the exact portrayal of the ungraceful part of life, which mostly exists in a non-exciting way. People just live their life without thinking too much about the dreams they used to have, knowing those dreams have already been dead.The plot could have been well complete without the drug-taking part. It seems every director has the tendency of pushing the plot to extremes by adding in permissive content, which is absolutely unnecessary in some cases.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A rookie unconventional history teacher takes on a class of unruly inner city kids who will finally learn the meaning of teacher-student bond and free thinking. Does this sound like a hackneyed enough plot summary for you? No matter how gushing fans and reviewers twist and turn this outline, that remains its plot on paper. It is fortunate then that 'Half Nelson' mostly steers away from the dutiful by-the-numbers approach of underdog victories in the basketball court or an underdog student acing a test, adopting a sweeter less in-your-face indie tone.The title 'Half Nelson' is a wrestling term that involves locking your opponent in an impossible position. This is an apt title, for Dan Dunne (Ryan Gosling) wrestles with a mounting drug addiction and teacher responsibility, pinning lost idealism somewhere in between. He is trapped in a situation he cannot get out of. As a History teacher, he likes to ramble more about the dialectics, complexities, forces and theories of history rather than recapping the facts according to the curriculum. He opposes the policies of the school and its conformist syllabus.This type of racial inspirational drama is prime meat for Hollywood. The non-conformity in the film is so relatable that it makes nod with recognition, not to mention it sells. Certainly, 'Half Nelson' is not a particularly inventive film nor is it a Herculean task to make, but it transcends its genre by cross-over appeal in the drug side of the spectrum. The crux is to make it different and compelling. Dan teaches during the day and compels his batch of cocky black junior high students, then goes home, does a few lines, smokes crack, joints, whatever he can get his hands on. Moving anonymously from failed dates to lonely trips to the bar, he ultimately returns home to sleep on a dingy mattress on the hardwood floor of his apartment.Dan as a character, as you can tell, is challenging role for an actor to inhabit. Between his difficult, idealist and alternative nature, he is utterly self-loathing and descends into narcotization because of it. I cannot quite make up my mind about Ryan Gosling in the film. To be sure, he is a capable actor with a kind of natural bleary-eyed talent, underpinned with strong emotional surges. Perhaps you could make a good case for that the film rests squarely on the shoulders of Gosling, even though but Shareeka Epps as Dan's only friend Drea performs well as a Latchkey kid, not to mention that at times Gosling feels almost too emotionally numb to truly engage you.This is regrettably also true for the whole film. It is numb. The atmosphere is almost eerily calm, accompanied by a mellow indie score, lingering close-ups and generally introspective camera-work. The only thing that jumps out and grabs you are the clipped, fragmentary newsreel footages interjected in the history lessons. I wish I knew their purpose, for now they serve only as bloated non-conformist speeches to support the film's key theme. On the other end of the spectrum, this is by all accounts a well-made little indie gem that serves as a pleasant diversion from the formulaic teacher/mentor/student turns of recent years. It is simply ultimately a bit of a snooze.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Half Nelson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps the curiosity towards Half Nelson, is how Ryan Gosling got nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor, from seemingly out of nowhere. Probably better remembered for his short lived television series Young Hercules, and recently in the straight to DVD movie Stay, he puts up a rather stoned performance (ok, so his character is a junkie) that seemed to want to tug your heartstrings in his weary, isolated outlook of life, yet leaving you feeling rather nonchalant given his substance abuse.To his students, Dan Dunne (Ryan Gosling) is the teacher full of unorthodox ideas, challenging authority and doing things his way. His subject expertise is history, and instead of going the rote way in regurgitating curriculum, he opts for the understanding of rationale behind events, making his classes interactive and interesting. Being a teacher, whether you like it or not, you're a role model, and therefore, a moral compass to your impressionable charges. I have a friend whose other friends are teachers, and he sometimes account their behaviour outside of class, which we are of the opinion that if any parent were to know of their shenanigans, they would immediate withdraw their children from classes.Dan is such an example - a substance abuser, developing a crutch toward vices to sooth his pain of the real world, where he increasingly feels disconnected from. Chancing upon his activity one day in a toilet, is his student Drey (Shareeka Epps), who decides to keep mum about it. And thus, the two of them start to form this unconventional, radical bond between themselves, a friendship which raises eyebrows from certain quarters as well. With this bond, Dan experiences certain moral responsibility developed, and takes it upon himself to not let Drey succumb to any negative influences. On the other hand, Drey looks up to Dan like a surrogate big brother, given that she's atypical of a latch key child.The movie adopted rather different approaches, and diverts from the cliché tried and tested story lines like how dangerous substance abuse is, and basically sheds off a lot of fat by keeping its focus on the two leads. The story coasts along rather slowly, and at times, rather aimlessly. I thought the connection with the theme of discrimination and the dwelling on dialectics and the winds of change, rather weak, though some have lauded it, and I don't see what's the big deal about it.What was awesome though, was one scene where you could feel the pain the characters go through, as one felt helpless and rather shameful to have been exposed in the manner prescribed, and the other, surprised yet unable to do anything else about it, unable to change, and the feeling of guilt akin to delivering poison for a friend's consumption, with another subtle level of letting a mentor down.Peppered with intentionally bad jokes and a reasonable soundtrack, Half Nelson is reasonably engaging, but definitely not great. Don't hold your breaths for Gosling winning the Oscar as well, Forest Whitaker is probably on the final home stretch for The Last King of Scotland.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The great shining hope of US indie film? I think yes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything about this work is refreshing and inspiring. A perfect alternative to the glut of trendy, "quirky" pseudo-indie comedies that are smothering the market. Ryan Gosling's performance is easily the best I've seen this year, absolutely pitch-perfect, and his young co-star is brilliantly anti-cute. What could potentially be a tepid "inspirational" story a la Finding Forrester instead hits a note indescribably more profound and elusive. Although i initially felt like the use of the "interrupting cow" joke was ripping off David Gordon Green's film "Undertow", it ultimately allows for one of the best ending scenes I think I've ever seen. Visually the film was also surprisingly fresh, demonstrating how hand-held camera work can be done right, and achieving an unusually high level of poetic beauty for an American film (in the way the film at times lets some scenes drift into more abstract, purely visual moments). Knowing that Broken Social Scene did the soundtrack was enough to get me to watch this, and the film did not disappoint on that front either. I do find it interesting that now two films have used the Leslie Feist-sang version of "Lover's Spit" for moody love scenes (the other being "Lie with Me", but used much more effectively here).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently saw this movie. Let me tell you, Ryan Gosling is my generations best actor. I think he is fantastic. He inhabits his character.The pace was a tad slow, but I think that they were just showing the monotony of daily life for student and teacher. There was a lot left unsaid and I enjoyed that. You have to work to fill in the blanks. It might frustrate some how there would be a conversation and you think there is going to be more but it cuts to the next day or a new scene start. I loved how it would go in and out of focus. It was a great device to show the feeling of getting high visually.I'm not going to spoil it for anyone but there was one pretty heartbreaking scene that was highlighted with music gorgeously. I loved the music throughout the whole film. Also in that scene the looks on the two leads faces were spot on. I couldn't believe how amazing the two of them were together throughout the movie. I would be interested to know how, if they had any, rehearsals went. Did they spend time together to develop a rapport? Because they had a great chemistry between the two of them.Shereeka Epps is a very smart actress. She seems wise for her young age. I hope that she continues with her acting career. I can't wait to get it on DVD. I highly recommend seeing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. A year and a half late, but I finally got around to seeing this searing Ryan Gosling performance. Director Ryan Fleck co-wrote the down and dirty script with Anna Boden and all parents should hope their kids' teachers have a bit more on the ball than Gosling's character.The drug use and bleakness of the story would be too heavy for many, but the story is well structured and delivered. Matching Gosling's performance scene for scene is the remarkable Shareeka Epps. Striving to overcome all obstacles, but not strong beyond belief, young Ms. Epps is the center of the film and proves to be the ultimate redeemer.Don't sit down to watch this expecting a pick-me-up, but it is nice film-making and sterling acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to like this film, I really did. I sat through the opening minutes slightly perturbed by what I was watching, but as I enjoy Ryan Gosling's acting style, I decided to soldier on. ... Then came the scene in the girl's toilets.**spoilers below**Upon discovering her teacher high on crack and lying on the floor of the girl's bathroom, we're expected to believe that Drey, (a 13yr old black student), would without any qualms or motive, drop to her knees and then start mopping at his brow. This is completely ludicrous. This is also the moment where the film lost me.The theme of Drey having no personality or motive, whilst adopting the role of carer to her crack-head teacher, is continued throughout the film; it's also solidified in the end scene where she goes to her teacher's drug den, brings him home and then cleans him up!Half Nelson's portrayal of a young black girl living in NYC is so ridiculous, it's insulting. Why does she even want in on her teacher's life? Some have surmised that she has a crush on him, others say she's looking for a father figure; well I say she's a mere prop to his angst-ridden life musings.I agree with the reviewer from NYC, this film is an ode to the Mammy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, a movie must either entertain or educate and in the best of times, do both. Half Nelson slightly touches on educating but fails miserably in entertaining. The film, about a drug user who could still function as a respected teacher, included some of the most drawn out uninspiring dialog I've had the displeasure of listening to. Don't get me wrong, the acting is bang on but I kept asking myself "who cares?" I recently watched a movie called "Before Sunset" (all dialog). But the difference between this film and Half Nelson is that the dialog in Before Sunset was engaging. You felt empathetic towards the characters. In Half Nelson, the characters did not elicit empathy and in not doing so, I kept asking myself "who cares?".I'd recommend this film to watch Ryan Goslin's performance as an Academy Award nominee but be warned - it'll be a tough hour and a half to get through.</fullReview>

Dan has some nice ideas about how to teach his students, and he develops a friendship with the most interesting character in the film, Drey, one of Dan's students, a strong, bright girl who has an overworked mum, and a coke dealer friend. Drey admires Dan, and forgives his appalling, anti-social, selfish behaviour, which is very good of her, because, after about 20 minutes of Dan I was sick of him carrying on like a self-indulgent baby. I wanted to see much more of Drey, and how she coped with her life. Not Dan, because it was obvious, after a few scenes that he had no idea how to cope with life, and he kept stuffing up other people's lives. In one of the non-Dan dominated scenes in the film, Dan confronts Drey's friend, a coke dealer, and has the gall to suggest that the coke dealer should stay away from Drey, and it's obvious that the coke dealer has far more respect for Drey and for life in general than the tedious, drug addled Dan. So much of the story is focused on Dan.. scene after scene of him behaving disgustingly. Why? Let's make more films about the Dreys of this world and fewer about the Dans.</fullReview>

Perhaps I am desensitized by the world I know exists in the lives of those with addictions. Maybe my opinion of this film is influenced by my direct experience of living certain elements of the protagonist's life at certain stages of my own life and, while I realize everyone has their own path of experience, the facets of fiction that are pervasive in the protagonist's actions and experiences are too blatant to ignore. Subsequently it is now completely unacceptable for me to believe in the notion of a kinder, gentler drug dealer and a generally responsible crack-addicted teacher.

		<fullReview>OK, we all know that this is about an idealistic progressive high school teacher who is trying to hide his street drug addiction from students, coworkers, and family, and that one girl finds out his secret and befriends him. That's the summary given about this movie.I just walked in the door from seeing this thing, and I cannot tell you one more thing than that. It's about a teacher who does drugs and hangs out with a young inner-city girl. Well, what happens in the movie, though? He just keeps doing drugs, teaching, and hanging out with this girl. That's it. Nothing else happens. Now before you accuse me of requiring an off-the-shelf plot in order to appreciate a movie (not that any lovers of this fare would be up to that observation), I am not a fan of plot-heavy films. I prefer strong and evocative images, emotions, and moments, to plot or story. BUT, I also need something to HAPPEN in a movie, and nothing does in this one. This movie is supposed to get by on the cuteness of the main character, and nothing more. Heck, if you want a struggling loner who's all screwed up, see Taxi Driver. Now there's a movie, and I'm not even a fan of De Niro. Forget the violence, just appreciate the scenes where he reaches out to the Peter Boyle character, or his journal entry voice overs.Now, if you read the critics, both professional and amateur, it's the absolute second coming of cinema. Nothing has ever been made that comes close to this movie. Ryan Gosling's acting is so...so...well riveting! I mean, like, he was so believable! And it makes you think about drugs, and people who do drugs and don't want others to find out! Apparently Gosling, as the main character, 's acting was superb. I guess it comes down to taste. To me, you could go to any Starbucks and find someone to shuffle around like a metrosexual zombie as did Gosling in this flick. He's really a waif-metrosexual hybrid. That must be what does it for all those who are wheezing over this movie. Double-whammy, as it were. Oh, and he's cool because he has a bunch of vinyl records. For my money, a better movie about a guy with vinyl is Ghost World, with Steve Buscemi.Two major bright spots in this movie are Shareeka Epps, as his adolescent confidant, and Anthony Mackie as the drug dealer who looks out for Epps. Epps has this sternness about her that takes control of every conversation she is in. It works well in this context. Mackie's performance is very crisp and invigorating. You'll find yourself looking forward to seeing him toward the end of this movie, if you free yourself from the spell of amazement you experience from the main character, that is. This is another Blair Witch Project. It totally hit the sweet spot of the public in the right way at the right time, without having any substance or merit. So, my hat is off to these film makers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recognised the title, I recognised the leading star's name, I knew that he was also nominated an Oscar, and I knew it was an independent film, I didn't really know the premise of the film, only that I did really want to try it. Basically Dan Dunne (Oscar nominated Ryan Gosling) teaches eighth-grade history at an inner-city Brooklyn school, in class he seems a very good man who cares for his students and teaches well, but his private life is plagued by his crack cocaine drug addiction. His world is slowly changing with the help of one of his students, 13-year-old student Drey (Shareeka Epps), who he forms an unlikely friendship with. I don't see all the plot of the story, only that Dan and Drey have a good friendship, and she understands his drug addiction, they may have their one or two fallouts or whatever, but they make up, but I wouldn't know if the addiction stops or not. Also starring Anthony Mackie as Frank, Monique Gabriela Curnen as Isabel, Karen Chilton as Karen, Tina Holmes as Rachel, Collins Pennie as Mike, Deborah Rush as Jo Dunne, Jay O. Sanders as Russ Dunne and Nicole Vicius as Cindy. Gosling certainly deserved an Oscar nomination, there is no way he could have won against Forest Whitaker for Last King of Scotland, and even though it has the obvious independent feel, it is worth a look. It won the Philadelphia Film Festival Jury Award for Best Director, and it was nominated the Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize Dramatic for the director. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Putting the viewer through the grinder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Half Nelson is, to my mind, a very good film, but it certainly puts you through the grinder. The relentless use of drugs, and the personal chaos this causes Dan Dunne, is wonderfully evoked by the camera work, with the focus going in and out, shaking etc. Whilst watching this I really began to feel the mayhem in this man's head.As Dunne, Ryan Gosling turns in a performance that few have rivalled in recent years. His naturalism and ability to convince as this drugged addled good man trying to make sense of his life is heart-wrenching to watch. The surprise for me in this film is the performance of Shareeka Epps as the 13 year old Drey, who, like Dunne, is trying to make something out of her young existence. The young actress is superb, handling themes which some seasoned adult pros would have found difficult. Praise must go to Ryan Fleck, the director, for getting such good performances out of these two, and the cast as a whole.Like I said, not an easy view, but well worth it to see a side of a teacher's life rarely committed to the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Observational drama rather than an engaging one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from two reasonably strong performances from Ryan Gosling and Shareeka Epps, Ryan Fleck's 'Half Nelson' is a plodding film with a few decent moments. Gosling's drug-addled Mr. Dunne befriends young Drey (Epps) after she discovers his secret behaviour. He becomes the protective teacher of her as she ventures into the wrong path, but he also struggles with his own internal problems that affects his behaviour. There are nice historical references in the classroom, as well as touching racial politics but overall this film tranquilly goes through the motions and left this viewer unsatisfied. The whole opposing forces within the machine aspect was a decent theme in relation to the student/teacher dynamic, but 'Half Nelson' rarely ascends in dramatic tension- partly due to the hand-held camera-work that made me like I was watching glimpses of characters.Ryan Gosling probably deserved his Oscar nomination, and he is definitely an actor to look out for. I did feel he looked a little young for the role. Overall, 'Half Nelson' is an interesting, but a slow plodding film that never really takes the viewer anywhere. As an expose on lower-class culture and racial politics within the school machine, it fares well, but never excels as an overall story. The low-budget feel is present, and it works to present the environment and gives an observational vibe but is never quite fully engaging.*** out of *****!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this movie was like standing in line for a bad amusement park ride, you are hooked with anticipation and when you are finished you are severely let down by the anti-climactic result.Gosling is a really great actor and so is the young Epps but neither of them can instill excitement in this slow moving film. It hooked me in and every time Gosling picked up another drug I silently cursed him and hoped for change. Thats what i was expecting, an ending with some type of resolve. The end sequence is as conclusive as an overture. We do not know if Gosling is changed and if Epps will ever be like her other classmates. With about 10 minutes left of the movie i expected some climax, some rise of action, some coming to terms. I saw nothing but Gosling sitting on a couch telling a bad knock knock joke.The relationship between Gosling and Epps, was getting to the stage of creepy halfway through the movie after he grinded with her at a dance. It just complicated things further. At the end of the movie i was so confused and let down i logged into my account in order to warn people that if they want to see Half-Nelson (strange title for self infliction) they should be prepared for an hour and 40 minutes of confusion and boredom. But again, great job Gosling and Epps, amazing acting</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I found it rather dull.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had heard a lot about this movie, so was pleased to see it available at Blockbuster. Judging by the number of copies still on the shelves, few others apparently knew anything about it (not so with "The Departed."). The jacket of the DVD described the main character as "brilliant" and "inspiring". Now I realize believing what is noted on DVD cases is naive, but based on what I had read about this film, I thought the description might be a bit more accurate. Well, if this was supposed to be a brilliant teacher, I'd hate to see a bad one. The students appeared completely bored with the unconventional lessons. Perhaps the writers of the film thought they were breaking new ground, but I didn't. Also, the movie moves very slowly, with very little happening that is very interesting. Watching someone contemplate life for a couple of hours is akin to watching paint dry. And I completely missed the point of the confrontation between the Dan and Frankie characters. Well, I understood the reason behind the confrontation, but the dialog didn't make sense. It certainly wasn't a bad movie, and the performances of the kids in particular were stellar, but there have been much better movies about drug use (Requiem for a Dream and Trainspotting to name two). There are basically three kinds of movies you pick up at the video store: those that exceed your expected, those that meet your expectations, and those that fall short of your expectations. For me, "Half Nelson" was the latter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Half-Nelson is an independent film about the struggles of being a inner-city middle school teacher who is addicted to drugs. Ryan Gosling, yes the guy who is in the notebook, gives a very good performance in this gritty dark drama. Ryan Gosling's co-star Shareeka Epps gives a incredible performance in her cinema debut. The plot has a lot of highs but even lower lows. Good soundtrack. Only negative thing i can say about the film is that some of the camera angles were a tad shaky, i know they were trying to go for gritty, but maybe a little too extreme. Overall 9 out of 10 and i encourage everyone to see it, especially aspiring teachers like myself. Go watch a flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies I have seen in a long time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was played out very well. My husband and I went and saw it yesterday in Overton Square, Memphis TN... and are still talking about it today. This movie was a taste of reality and what really happens to a lot of people that "think" they can handle doing a drug, but really it is just a matter of time before the drug takes everything from you. The teacher that was doing drugs that portrayed that kind of person. The movie brought in his ex-girlfriend to show that she was on drugs with him, but chose a different route. She chose to get help and she wasn't going to let him take her down with him because he wasn't willing to get the help he needed. It showed the innocence of children that don't know anything about drugs and how curious they can be. For the little girl to see her teacher doing drugs one day and see him teaching and carrying on the next confused her into believing it was "o.k." to do drugs. If my teacher, the person I look up to, is doing it then maybe I should try it. I give this movie a 10. Great Movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blessed perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of a man trying to do good and being so overwhelmed by feelings of futility, all he can do is numb himself. The story of an adolescent girl who's seen way to much in her 12 years to hold any beliefs, anymore...but still almost sort of hopes. The story of how maybe they might be able to help each other...and maybe they can't because the world is stacked against them.This film is heartbreaking and bracing in a way that only fine storytelling can be. You get pitch perfect acting by Ryan Gosling, Shareeka Epps and Anthony Mackie that is so real, you forget they're acting. Supple camera-work by Andrij Parekh (the confrontation between Dan and Frank over Drey is elegant). Beautiful unobtrusive editing by Anna Boden (who co-wrote the script). A music score that fits without being obvious, obnoxious or saccharine. A subtle, deep, honest script, where nobody's perfectly good or bad but just human (co-written by Ryan Fleck). And Fleck's directing? Let's put it this way -- there was a moment near the end I saw coming. Anyone who knows anything about storytelling knows this moment is coming. Ryan Fleck doesn't even try to hide the fact that it's coming. But when it comes, you are so caught up in the characters and the situation, you're praying that moment doesn't come...and Fleck plays on that prayer. Uses it to emphasize the devastation it brings. I actually realized I was holding my breath through the whole thing just hoping and hurting and worrying and fearing and knowing...and shaking from the wish that it wouldn't be so. And then there it was. And it was handled with such gentle simplicity, I just sat there, numb.This film also holds a drug message that isn't a message but still gets the message across. A political commentary on the state of not only the reality of day to day life for many black families living a bare existence and faced with impossible choices, but also a stunning example of the flat out moral bankruptcy and hypocrisy of "No Child Left Behind." But neither is an in-your-face "THIS IS WRONG" polemic; everything is just...there for you to take what you will from it.Ryan Gosling and Shareeka Epps deserve Oscars for their work. Period. I'm hoping the Academy will honor this film all over the place, but I know that's also something that's probably not going to happen. It's not a "studio" film, nor is it handled by one of the so-called "Indies" that aren't really Indies, anymore. But one can still hope...and that at the end is the real message of "Half Nelson." Even when your life lies in ruins around you, you can still hope. And that is what makes this movie blessed perfection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw it last night. Somebody mentioned the direction wasn't great, OK there's that, but it was the fact that it was only the second act of a story that threw the audience I watched it with. With no beginning and no end its hard to really care. I gave it some thought and feel a score of 6 is appropriate. Decent acting, but a too many stone faces, characters were introduced that, being the second act and not having a first or third, should have been cut altogether. Gosling got fired, I didn't care because he didn't seem to care, he didn't want the job. OK, well what did he want? A shave? His family were prejudiced, not racist, but prejudiced or ill informed. His mother tells him (he's a girls basketball coach) to not forget to wash the basketballs, why, because he might get aids? His dad says something worse, but, how does this come into play? (It doesn't, but if there are black people and white people in a movie there has to be some racial issue included)6/10</fullReview>

Two lost souls needing each other is one thing, but this is way beyond that. How many of you would want your daughter in a relationship like this!!!

The movie had such a fine inconclusive conclusion that I applauded at the end. When is the last time you applauded at a film's ending.

		<shortDescription>contrived nonsense with a great performance by Ryan Gosling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Half Nelson is far from great. But it has a terrific performance by the very charismatic Ryan Gosling that make it worth a look.Gosling plays a beloved teacher who is a total jerk who deserves to be fired. His most glaring offense is that he is a crack cocaine addict. He also beds a co-teacher then coldly kicks her out of his apartment and then shows up at 2 in the morning , drunk and attempts to rape her (lucky for him, the poor woman punches him and doesn't call the police) He is supposed to be teaching (mostly) African American kids 8th grade history. However, all he seems to be teaching is watered down Marxism 101 (the dialectic)and a litany of the worst offenses the American government has ever committed (the Chilean Allende coup and the Attica riots are two events the kids learn really well). I guess, all the history stuff like the Declaration of Independence,The Civil War-that's for rich white folks.His specialty is blame America first. But that is the unpleasant main character and Gosling does a great job portraying him. The audience likes and sympathizes with him. The movie itself is contrived nonsense. The plot gets into gear when Gosling makes a boneheaded and totally unbelievable decision to smoke crack in the girls locker room. Of course he has an apartment of his own and he could have easily gotten high in the privacy of his home- but the movie needs a plot, so he gets high at school. And then he gets caught by a student, who is a bright girl who happens to like him a lot. He had become a quasi father figure to her and the rest of the movie is mostly about her utter disappointment in him as his addiction gets worse and worse. The story is extremely depressing and I couldn't wait for it to end. Near the end of the movie, we are introduced to his family and I suppose we are supposed to see how he became who he is. It doesn't work. The parents are aging radicals, who drink a bit. Mom seems nice and she plays a song from Marlo Thomas's record from the 70's -Free to be You and Me about how it is okay to cry. I didn't get the point. Gosling's character certainly is no wuss ( he stands up to drug dealers)and he seems like he is in touch with his feelings... being okay with crying doesn't seem to be an issue....He is an addict. That's his issue!! His Dad makes a lame ,mildly racist joke about Ebonics. So does this mean Gosling is rebelling against Dad by teaching Black kids? Well maybe if Dad was Archie Bunker. But Dad is sort of pathetic and says to his son, "I love you" So none of this scene makes sense and you know the movie is in trouble when it introduces important characters in the last 15 minutes.See this movie for Ryan Gosling. He deserves to be a big star. But that is the only reason to see Half Nelson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pedophilia Theme Ignored?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes I loved Ryan Gosling's performance. And the rest of the cast, particularly Ms. Epps, were also excellent. I enjoyed the pacing, cinematography, sets and script. However...........Why were situations repeatedly set up where as 13-year-old girl was left with a HIGHLY unstable unfamiliar male adult, ALONE????? Why was this never questioned by anyone other than her brother's drug-dealing friend, and then, only half-heartedly? Why did the filmmakers feel it was OK to set up such situations?At the screening tonight, the two filmmakers were present. I asked them about this, and they simply ridiculed me. I certainly accept that friendships can exist between people of various ages, races, etc. HOWEVER...when one embarks on the rocky road of attempting to depict a barely-pubescent/adult friendship, one must exercise extreme care. Pedophilia is nothing less than complete devastation in the life of its victim. Pedophiles typically target isolated children, those lacking parental supervision and protection. They create false bonds, and often present themselves as the child's benefactor. Mr. Gosling's character (Dan) does all of this. Yet never once does the child (or anyone else) really question his behavior. No, she is in fact enamored.It occurred to me that I could even envision a pedophile SHOWING this film to a targeted victim as part of the "grooming" process. "See, it's fine to come to my apartment. This girl did it, she didn't mind."Very frustrating when significant issues are simply ignored by filmmakers in the interest of making money. This and other issues (including the white- savior theme) made it difficult for me to relax and simply enjoy Mr. Gosling's excellent performance</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ryan Gosling is Excellent but Confusing Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My friend Helen and me have been reviewing films recently on here, and we always get a little confused with story lines that don't make sense- and this one was no exception. Helen is 55, I'm 47. We also knit and small talk during a screening, as this helps us balance our ideas. Half Nelson is about a inner city school teacher, Ryan Gosling, who also is addicted to drugs. He teaches history to junior high students. One of his female students, Shareeka Epps, catches him in the bathroom getting high. She doesn't snitch on him- because she is in fact, fond of him. Epps lives at home with her single mother but is smarter then you would think, and more mature for a girl of barely 13 years old. She seems to take a liking to older men. She is secretly seeing a thug named Frank, played by Anthony Mackie. Mackie is a drug dealer who lets Epps ride in his truck while he takes her out to lunch. You can already tell he's had sex with with, despite her being under age. He also wants her to start selling for him. She's a cool read though. In fact, from a distance Epps looks like a boy. She doesn't have a pretty face, and she likes sucking on blow pop candies- an indication of what else she likes to do. Helen and me began to get confused around the half hour mark, like we usually do- and our knitting turned into a full blown sewing session. Gosling's motivation makes no sense. If he's a drug addict, why is he teaching? Who's this random woman who keeps showing up at his apartment and claims something happened to her mother. Why is the principal getting mad at him for not opening a folder on civil rights? He's the teacher, let him teach his way. He should have gone to the union to have the Principal fired for disrupting his class to scold him like he was a student himself. Epps character is even more foggy. Why is she into dating older men? That's illegal and not a wise move. Why are most of the kids in the school black and why would Gosling put himself in danger by working in the ghetto? Not to sound racist, just didn't make a lick of sense. Helen added that back in her day, an interracial relationship like the one Epps and Gosling share would be considered illegal and be held up in the courts. We glanced at the television from time to time but the story got less and less understandable. Basically this is about a young black girl's lust for dating grown men who have a bad boy side. FINAL GRADE: C for Confusing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, one thing's for sure, you probably won't find a more depressing movie this year than Ryan Fleck's Half Neslon. That's not really a compliment, nor is it an insult. It's just the truth. Half Nelson is not your typical ghetto high school movie like Lean on Me or Dangerous Minds, nope, it's way darker than that. First off, it doesn't come close to cliché, but in so doing, pretty much all the characters aren't likable. This is a film about sleazy people living sleazy lives with probably no chance of redemption. The point of the film? Nothing, really. Just to showcase something we hardly ever see in movies anymore -- realistic characters.Half Nelson is like this year's 'Capote'. It's a good film built around an astonishing performance. Ryan Gosling lights up the screen with his ambitious and amazingly realistic portrayal of a crack-addict high school teacher. Gosling, an actor I would have ranked as a 'not much better than average' actor has pulled a 'Heath Ledger', and completely impressed me and pretty much every film critic there is. He completely nails the role, all the facial expressions, hand gestures, modulations -- it's one of the best portrayals of a drug addict I've ever seen in a movie, and I've seen a hell of a lot of movies. Gosling without a doubt delivers the finest screen performance of the year so far, and is a shoe-in for a Best Leading Actor Oscar come next January.The other actors in the film are solid but completely over-shadowed by Gosling. The closest in quality to Gosling's riveting portrayal would have to be young Sharekka Epps as the High School girl wise beyond her years who befriends Gosling after witnessing him smoking crack in the locker room. Their bond is a very interesting and inventive one, kind of a like a father-daughter relationship if Gosling's character wasn't as screwed up. Gosling and Epps on-screen chemistry is fabulous, and one of the things to actually like about the film. Anthony Mackie is solid in his role as a local drug dealer, and Karen Chilton is good as well as Shareka Epps' character's caring but over-worked mother.Half Nelson is a slow moving film, which is unfortunate seeing as though it's only about an hour and half. With each passing minute the film grows more depressing and grim, to the point of where you don't even want to be in the theater. The screenplay is well written, but it lacks a sense of likability in the characters I felt the film needed more of. Ryan Fleck provides commendable direction, even if his out-of-focus shots when Gosling is getting high, grow old after a while.In conclusion, I recommend this film only to those who can handle or would like to handle it. Half Nelson is a pessimistic journey into reality most people would rather not sit through. To sum it up, it's a good film featuring an outstanding leading performance. Grade: B (screened at Harkins Camelview 5, Scottsdale, Arizona, 10/01/06)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Acting Performance of the last 15 years or so</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If a film works, its emotional impact can be unmeasurable. Everyone will react differently, but it is when there is a consensus about its quality and power that heads will turn, and its resonance can't be denied. With Ryan Gosling's masterful turn as its anchor, "Half Nelson" rises above many of today's contemporary releases. It will be a long time before another performance can match the amazing range of emotions and its intensity. A few come to mind, with two by Hilary Swank, some superb work by Charlize Theron, and of course, top notch work by Meryl Streep. However, Gosling has reached emotional highs and lows rarely seen in movies conceived by Hollywood nowadays. His turn as the lonely, desperate, addicted teacher surpasses previous turns by actors who have used make up and over-dramatic approaches to convey the despair. A few years ago, "Requiem for a Dream" managed to portray the hell of drug addiction, but it had some amazing cinematic direction to punch it up. This time this film succeeds because there is some very subtle interaction among its principals, from Gosling and his supporting lady to the way he has managed to capture the essence of a man who is ready to jump into hell, and yet clings to hope because of its connection to the students he teaches.Gosling doesn't overact in any of his scenes, yet the way he looks at his co-stars and the camera carries lacerating ferocity. Here is a caged human who has lost his way and is suffering. He has an idea of what he needs to survive and wants to prevents others from falling along with him. Still he knows he's not perfect and might cause more harm than good in his campaign to save others. We watch him walk the tightrope and because his character somehow earns our pity and sympathy, we recoil in horror as he is ready to damn his existence."Half Nelson" is a rare film to come out in 2006, and it gives hope to cinema. It makes us hope that there will be more like it in the following months. It's the complete opposite of mindless and moronic entertainment that celebrates nothing but plain disregard for human intelligence and laughs at us with disrespect. There are several social themes that are rarely discussed in this film that are rarely discussed in other movies. "Akeela and The Bee" made an attempt to show us how precarious the existence of its protagonist is. Anything can go wrong at any moment, and as fine as that movie is, the people in "Half Nelson" are fully exposed in the midst of the hell they live in. They're hardened because they understand their surroundings, and they still dare to dream, fully knowing it might never happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gosling is absolutely tremendous, but the film is nowhere near as good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Half Nelson is a performance-based film. Anyone who heard anything remotely about it knew that Ryan Gosling gave one hell of a performance. It was so great, that even the Academy honoured him with a surprise Oscar nomination for his work. But the problem that plagues performance-based films is that the performance is just about the only thing worth watching the movie for. Charlize Theron was astonishing in Monster, but the movie was otherwise forgettable. Jamie Foxx was spot-on in Ray, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman's turn in Capote were both well recognized, but the movies just did not come anywhere near close to matching the intensity or the strength of those two performances. It is with a great amount of disappointment that I add Half Nelson to this group.Dan Dunne (Gosling) is a history teacher at an inner city elementary school. You can see his dedication to his under-privileged students right from the start. He is friendly, down-to-earth, and even coaches the girl's basketball team. Only thing is, Dan is addicted to drugs, and they are dictating his life. By chance, one of the girls he coaches, Drey (relative newcomer Shareeka Epps), catches him smoking marijuana in the girl's change-room after one game. He needs some help, so she helps him out. From there, they only continue to build a stronger relationship, despite the effects that the drug-business is having on both of them.As people already proclaimed through the streets, Gosling is absolutely riveting in his performance. This guy is a washout, who is consistently tired and always beating himself up. He is hopeless, and helpless in his situation, and Gosling is pitch perfect bringing this anxiety and imperfection to the screen. This is a broken and depressed young man, whose many wounds are visible to anyone watching. Even when he is just sitting doing nothing, Gosling's body language is speaking multitudes of words to the audience. He wants them to know how much of a loser this guy is, and he wants them to see just how disastrous an effect drugs are having on him. Never once do we see Gosling performing, we see him deeply immersed within his character. His pain and agony is our pain and agony, and you just cannot look away when he is on screen. He commands the screen, and proves his worth as a dramatic actor right from the first frame.Epps is also very good as Drey, who is caught between wanting to be a friend to this drug addicted waste and wanting to make something more of herself than what her family has. She is crushed and lonely, and even with Dan's drug problems, finds solstice in spending time with him. Epps, although much older than her character, is wonderful playing off of Gosling. She knows her character, and emotes quite excellently. Although she is not addicted, the audience feels her pain too. Late in the film, when her character is at her most vulnerable state, she practically steals the screen from Gosling. All she does is let a tear stream down her face, and right away, she hooks us in. She is an absolute sensation here, and really makes me wonder why she lost out on an Oscar-nom for her work here. Epps has many fine years ahead of her if she stays on with work like this.The supporting cast is adequate, even with some of their smaller roles. Anthony Mackie playing Frank, a friend of Drey's family is the most prominent of the cast, but really does not hold a candle to Gosling or Epps. His acting comes off as shallow and amateur compared to those two, and only because he just does not have anywhere near as much conviction for his role as they do.But while the acting runs from adequate to above and beyond excellent, the story really falters. It works for the first little bit, but as the film progresses and the characters really begin to open up, it just becomes boring. A lot of the Frank material felt like it was added just to pace out the rest of the film, and feels superfluous overall. Scenes where Dan is out partying or doing drugs are all needed, but in many cases, feel a lot like they overstayed their welcome. I can see what the filmmakers are going for in including them, but they just drag the movie right down. I could not keep my eyes off of Gosling, but as the plot became more convoluted, I found it increasingly harder to pay attention to anything that was going on other than Gosling's acting. The film feels cheap, and reeks of being almost consideration for an after-school special (although during the fastly edited scenes, it does feel much more expensive and much less boring).Another bad thing is how some of the plot elements just roll around, and never really become anything other than useless background information. We hear about an ex-girlfriend who may or may not have driven Dan to drugs in the first place. But she is quickly disposed of mere moments after being shown. Drey's father is never around, but we can barely tell that she has a father in the first place. I know that Dan is supposed to be somewhat of a surrogate father to her, but if her mother is going to argue about how much time her husband (or ex-husband as it was never mentioned) spends with Drey, then why not show the guy too? The film just opens up a series of questions that while not being totally metaphysical, still end up just going unanswered.On the whole, Half Nelson really speaks of a great performance and an absolutely tremendous performance, and not much else. Yes, it may falter and be boring, but seeing Gosling's intensity makes the film more than a worthwhile watch.7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A failing teacher is befriended by a student who knows his secret</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A white junior high history teacher and one of his black students forge an unlikely bond in this ironic drama set in Brooklyn. The teacher, Dan Dunne (Ryan Gosling), is covering the Civil Rights Movement as we enter into this story, approaching the subject within the framework of Hegelian dialectics. (What! An actual idea in an American film! Amazing!) Dunne doesn't talk down to his students. The respect is a two way street. His engaging delivery, laced with old video footage of key events in the 60s, is obviously compelling for his charges: mostly black kids, who behave themselves with remarkable decorum. We get the very clear sense that this fellow is a good teacher who cares about his subject and the kids.Dunne is also a crack-head. Cocaine and alcohol are his best friends away from school, where he is nearly non-functional, and, as the film moves along, his tenuous grip on himself gradually gives way in the classroom and on the basketball court, where he coaches the girls team. Increasingly erratic and slovenly, he gets caught one day smoking crack in the girls restroom by Drey (Shareeka Epps), one of his students, who thereafter gradually assumes a role, more-or-less, of companion and caretaker for Dunne. At the end, unable to continue teaching for the time being, and with his professional future presumably in doubt, Dunne nonetheless is able to share a light, perhaps redemptive moment with Drey.How you feel about this movie probably will depend on which of two interpretations you choose in order to comprehend its vague narrative arc (the two views are not mutually exclusive). The liberal PC slant is that an idealistic Dunne, raised by ex-hippies, has become demoralized by the adverse course of events - in the nation and in his own family - since the 60s. He turns to drugs to dispel his resultant malaise. Based on this view, Dunne is a noble man brought low by the flawed ways of the world.Much as I wanted to buy into this view, I could not escape the more powerful pull of another perspective, namely, that Dunne's drug abuse - the roots of which, we learn, went back several years to a time when, presumably, he was still an effective person ? has caused him to deteriorate, to become more and more incompetent in the classroom and in life. Dunne has become a screwed up shell of what, presumably, he once was. As with many addicts, his disillusionment is in part the depressive consequence of his drugging and also a face-saving excuse for it.Irrespective of which view prevails for you, the splendid acting of Gosling and Shareeka Epps stands out. Gosling is able to express outrage, sheepishness, ineptitude, disappointment, fatalistic self regard and charm in a remarkably nuanced turn. He's an emotional midget whose level of maturity does not quite measure up to Drey's.Miss Epps is captivating. She brings prodigial control to her performance, especially in what the critic Stanley Kauffmann calls "facial acting." Time and again, when you least expect it, her sober, inscrutable poker face will suddenly ease into a subtle smile, as if to reassure whoever is in her presence that, bad as things can be, there's always hope for something lighter, if not better. My grade: 7/10 (B) (Seen on 09/06/06)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pointless.If you liked Ironweed, Leaving Las Vegas, Candy, and Trainspotting, you'll love this pointless downer.The lesson of this movie seems to be that it's all hopeless. Drug addiction will prevail and drug running will out.If you're hoping that everything will turn out alright or something at least will improve, give this one a miss. This is one of those movies you get to the end of and feel like you're left hanging. "And the point of that wasssssssssss?"It's just a downer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ryan Gosling deserves his Oscar Nomination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ryan Gosling is the star of this film of a dedicated teacher who uses drugs. I do not think he will get the Oscar this year, BUT I am willing to wager he will get one eventually. His performance is that great. Shareeka Epps a little 13 yr old is equally superb as a student who is befriended by our hero. In fact all the performances are first rate.We have seen many dedicated teacher films,using a co-drug theme is definitely a today happening. I generally steer away from drug related films.I only saw this because of Ryan's Oscar bid. This was a cheaply made film, in the past this would have been shorter &amp; on the lower half of a double bill. It really is a B movie.See this mainly for RYAN GOSLINGS SUPERB PERFORMANCE..rating *** out of 4 82 points out of 100 IMDb 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good, but not Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had some pretty impressive reviews. I read "greatest movie this year" and other things in reviews and I admit, that did create some interest. HOWEVER, what really drew me to the film was Ryan Gosling, whom I feel is the best young actor working right now. He has been brilliant in off-beat films and off-beat roles so far in his young career. Gosling is very good in this film, as I expected. Moreover, the little girl playing his troubled student is very good. However, the story does move a tad slow and there is not a lot of help coming from other actors here. I'm not sure that the story reveals any great twists or incredible nuances, it was just a kind of interesting and subdued story. I felt the scenes of him in the classroom were a bit of a stretch. I seriously doubt any Junior High School class would be that patient with a teacher like Gosling who spoke in such abstract and convoluted ideas, however, I will overlook that. Good enough film and in such a weak era of film-making, maybe it is great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The characters in this film certainly could be real. I don't doubt there are teachers who have addictions and students trying to solve that teacher. I don't doubt interoffice sex and romance. It happens. But what I do doubt is the film itself.Much is said about the acting performance. However, the only thing I could get out of it was a teacher who needed saving. Constantly getting high, letting his student on his secret and hoping she doesn't tell. Nothing really changes throughout the film.Even the romantic interest, who displays some affection for the teacher, is turned away. Saying "yeah it was fun" about the sex in a sarcastic way is the same way I feel about much of the movie.The story is not very well and its the weakest point. If it had real characters without simplistic solutions, it would be good. Instead, its sub par. "C-"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspirational and well-acted, but comes off slightly cold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Half Nelson is such a small movie, that it was hard to find. Luckily, I got a hold of a copy and was able to watch it. I had very high expectations for this film because it seemed similar to Akeelah and the Bee which I loved, and I hoped this could meet the bar that set. And with a 91% RT Rating, where could I go wrong. Half Nelson has been building a lot of buzz this year because of its performance by this budding young Canadian actor, Ryan Gosling. I am a fan of Gosling, I thought he was fantastic in The Notebook and he was great in that little Canadian show Breaker High back in the day. Now was I disappointed with Nelson? Yes, you could say I was somewhat disappointed. I mean if you look at it's 91% score, which these days is quite rare to see(well not for small films like these), while Half Nelson is a good and very inspirational movie, I couldn't help but feel it came off clichéd, and not in the great way Akeelah and the Bee did. They both have very similar inspirational stories that strive for us to do better, in that way it works here, but it was lacking a lot of the heart Akeelah had, as well as the great acting for the child actors. Where it did succeed is in a better break out performance. Ryan Gosling pulls it ALL OUT in this film, I have to say he was quite fantastic, and he really made you feel for the character. Originally I didn't know much of the plot, but it does deal with a lot of drugs in it, which makes you feel more compelled to the characters. The drugs however may hit or miss with the audience, as their use is pretty hefty. As compelling as the characters are though and how much you care for them, I felt they were actually quite cold, they came off very fake, hard to care for 100%. I liked how through it, it tells the story of both troubled people, and how just one person can make a difference in your life, that one person you can make you laugh, that one person who just lets you be the real you, that one person can make your life so much different, and I think this expressed that really well. Ultimately in Half Nelson you have a generic story like Akeelah, but it doesn't convey the spirit or the great amount of heart that movie did, it conveys only half. But we do get incredible performances from an extremely talented cast, and a great future actor, Mr. Ryan Gosling. Is it inspirational, hell yes. Does it have convincing and very well and heartfelt performances, damn right it does. But does it come off cold and sometimes impersonal? Yes. Bottom Line: Inspirational and well acted, but comes off slightly cold.By Jordan Appugliesi, written for http://www.boxofficefanatic.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mistakes shakiness for edginess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lets get the good out of the way first. Yes - Ryan Gosling is good. Yes- Epps isn't bad either. Yes - potential good storyline. Yes- a score by Broken Social Scene is cool. Now that that is done. This movie does the mortal sin of indie films. Namely tries to be too edgy for its own good. What I mean by this is that performances aside, the style of this film is terrible. The director refusing to use a steady cam and instead have the camera go in and out of focus and shake in every *%^T$#&amp; scene is just....bad. It is not edgy and new. It is laziness looking for an excuse. Distracting and annoying too. Would it have taken away from the movie to have the camera focused and stay still when focussing on an unmoving object? Probably not. The second mortal sin of indy making is a story that goes nowhere. Yes. It went nowhere. Sorry to say that the hundred or whatever amount of minute achieves nothing. Now I love movies like Broken Flowers and Lost in Translation, but this movie shows days in a life of characters that could be interchanged with any days. In other words, whats happens seems to be of little importance. What is the point? Is it some existential meaning that there is no meaning or is it just so indy its cool? Probably the second one. So if a movie where absolutely nothing happens, and where you gets migraines easily by watching a camera being operated by an epileptic ADD 5 year old, this is the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Below average...bordering on bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is one thing to see a "below average" film. It is another thing when that "below average" film receives insanely high props. And that is what made "Half Nelson" so incredibly frustrating for me to see. It's barely playing around here, but I really wanted to see it, so I went far out of my way.I thought I'd be the only one on IMDb to dislike this movie, but I feel more emboldened seeing some of what others have said, particularly the comment from the woman who noted she was a black teacher in NYC. I too, found the film completely unrealistic. I also found it clichéd and predictable. How many films/TV shows have I seen where the white, liberal teacher goes into the inner city to educate poor blacks? Anyone? OK...so this one is an unlikable, self-centered drug addict. Big deal.I'll give my props to Epps and Mackie for their acting, but not to Gosling.Oh yeah...it had a pretty good "Knock-knock" joke in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was completely pointless. It had no moral, no climax, no resolution, no anything. It was well acted, and I found myself interested in what would happen to the characters, only nothing does. They are really no different then they are at the start. All the classroom scenes are the same, it's like he takes 5 classes to make a simple point. Opposites, and how they push against each other to create change, is the supposed metaphor for this picture, except there is no pushing tension, and as far as I can tell nothing changes. I take that back the only thing that changes is that the teacher is unable to effect the girls life in a profound enough manner as to prevent her from becoming a drug dealer, oh wait he DIDN'T change her life. I think this movie is somehow meant to disturb us, like it's so hard to come to grips with the idea that all drug addicts aren't all black, and from the ghetto and broken homes. This movie is suppose to open you eyes to the truth that middle class white people can end up on drugs. WOW I never knew that was possible. The teacher and the girl had a good dynamic, but again there is now real suspense or tension to their relationship, there are slight hints that maybe people think the relationship is wrong, but nothing comes of it or the relationship. Every time you think something is going to get serious and the climax will come, the plot manages to just keep going in this straight boring line. I was like OK, here go when he confronted the drug dealer about the girl, but then the drug dealer, who is clearly a nice guy, offers him a drink. Probably the worst thing to me about this movie is how it seems to have a very liberal view on drugs. There is only one scene where the drugs he takes seems to have a negative impact on his life, when he goes to the other teachers house and almost rapes her, other than that the worst that happens is he talks about brainy topics to the dumb sluts he picks up at the bar. Then after all the non-suspense the movie just ends out of nowhere, probably the worst end to a movie I have ever seen. I only give this movie 2 stars because like I said, I do think the acting was pretty good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>after reading the reviews, i was eager to see this film, so i was quite disappointed when i had to walk out. after 45 minutes, mostly spent looking at my knees and peeking up occasionally, the nausea and headache became too great.i understand that only about 30% of film-goers get seasick from hand-held cameras, but, hey, i suppose the other 70% will get a different impression of the film. some movies use a hand-held camera to follow a running character or to show the view out of a moving car. this film uses a shaky camera to watch a man sitting on a couch.in addition the audio was rather difficult to understand in places, so when i was looking at my knees, i could not understand all the dialogue. sorry! i hear it's a good film if you're able to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ryan Gosling, the twenty-five-year-old Canadian-born actor remembered for the Mickey Mouse Club, Murder by Numbers, and The Notebook, gave such a memorable performance as the Jewish Nazi skinhead in Henry Bean's The Believer that it was a pity a technicality kept him from getting an Oscar nomination for it. By reputation Gosling is one of America's young actors most willing to delve deeply into a role and thoroughly commit to it, and The Believer amply proves that. But some of his performances and choices since have aroused doubt about his depth, his range, and his wisdom in choosing roles. Perhaps one of his drawbacks is his unprepossessing appearance. As a junior high teacher in a ghetto school in his new film, Ryan Fleck's Half Nelson, Gosling looks like a reedy student himself and his bland expression and his small, too-close-together eyes hardly hint at the torment that might result from living a double life as upright politically committed history teacher and off-duty full-time cokehead. What are the demons that drove him to such an addiction? All we can see are the weakness and laziness that keep him in it. When not addressing the class he can barely stay awake, so you wonder how he landed the additional job of girls' basketball coach. Gosling may have gotten into the theme of dialectic that he emphasizes in his classes enough to be able to improvise his teaching sessions, but they're mostly so simple they're embarrassing. The role is problematic. As an addict, Dan Dunne, his character, is shut down emotionally. Under those circumstances how do you convey the presence of masked feelings? There is more to Gosling and to Dunne than meets the eye here, but the movie is a disappointment.The other actors can't support Gosling or his character either. None of the ghetto people or scenes presented in this movie -- regardless of how authentic the sets or actors -- comes across as real. Frank (Antony Mackie) is a handsome drug dealer who looks after Drey (Shareeka Epps), one of Dunne's students and a member of his basketball team whom he makes friends with after she discovers him doing crack in the girls' restroom. Mackie's Frank is too charismatic for a dealer in the hood. Drey (Shareeka Epps), a non-actress, has fresh moments, but her relationship with her teacher (Gosling) never takes off as it should because their scenes are as underwritten as the classroom sequences are pretentious. The competition between Frank and Dan to be Drey's mentor seems fatuous. Drey's brother is in jail because of working for Frank, so Frank is responsible for Drey? Dan is Drey's cokehead teacher, so he can be a role model for her? How does all that work? Late in the movie inter-cutting between a gathering at Frank's house and an alcoholic evening for Dan at his parents', though obvious, introduces some complexity. But for the most part one can only wonder where the film is going, and the conclusion has to be it's setting up a situation, but has no where to go with it. Dan's dull bleary expression every time he enters the classroom looks real enough, but you wonder how he can convince the class that he's a good teacher. He is painfully sincere, but he hardly convinces us. The dinner with the parents show they are old lefties who were antiwar activists in the Sixties. But they don't know anything about Dan, and they're in a wine haze themselves. These scenes need to be carried further to carry emotional weight. There are imbued political messages in the movie. First come the important little history lessons (Attica, the CIA overthrow of Allende, Brown vs. Board of Education) delivered periodically by Dan's students that concern race and class and America's transnational political machinery. Then there's Dan's exchange with a Latina teacher he likes (Monique Curnen) about Marx and Hitler. And there's Drey's discovery of Frank's collection of humiliating blackface figurines. All these are moments that provide commentary on the relationship Dan and Drey are trying to establish, which may somehow be about to save Dan at the film's end. But director Fleck is too timid to push these points into a real shape, and what Half Nelson gives us remains only a situation, not a statement. Jittery camera-work and improvisation don't help much. Gosling may have gotten an interesting role again this time; this is not only a well-meaning movie but a pretty smart one, with its political awareness and its avoidance of classroom drama clichés. But outside the environs of Sundance mere savvy and unconventionality will only get you so far, and however well he prepared, Gosling doesn't inhabit the role of Dan and bring us to the edge of our seats the way he did with the role of Danny Balint in The Believer.</fullReview>
