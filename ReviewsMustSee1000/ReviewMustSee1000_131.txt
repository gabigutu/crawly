		<shortDescription>Powerhouse performance by Donnie Yen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Yen is a long time favorite of mine, although this is mainly due to his martial arts skills and screen presence rather than his acting skills. In Ip Man (or Ye Wen, as they were shouting in the seats next to mine) he delivers a truly solid performance on the acting side, carrying the burden of a nation on his shoulders with gravitas, at least that's what he conveyed to the audience at the cinema. They were actually applauding at times. Then again, moviegoers might be more absorbed over here on a regular basis. I digress.I'm not going to delve deeper into plot details. The basic stuff is already outlined above, and I also feel the historical accuracy of certain events depicted can be debated. That's a bit of a moot point, though, since most people will watch this for the action scenes. Nobody will be disappointed. Donnie kicks twelve kinds of ass in this movie, and it is all accompanied by some of the meanest sound design I've ever heard. Every one of his rapid punches can be felt as he pummels the poor bastards in his way with the Ip Man-style of martial arts (imdb won't let me spell out the name for some reason). The final bout is epic,but for me it was one scene about halfway through that got my heart beating faster. It involves Donnie, ten Japanese karate practitioners and some of the most furious fighting I've ever seen on screen. You can really sense the anger of his character in this scene. Great stuff.The film moves forward at a brisk pace and contains a surprisingly large amount of fight scenes. It totally lacks the vintage over-the-top-aesthetics of Donnie Yen's films of the 80's and 90's, but for some people that's a good thing. I personally think this is his finest performance to date. Highly recommended for fans of martial arts cinema!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Wing Chun, Ip Man."-- Donnie Yen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No wonder Ip Chun (Ip Man's son, consultant to this movie) was so pleased-- from the twinkle in his eyes to the lifting of his feet, Donnie Yen inhabits this movie like he is possessed by Ip Man. And as Ip Man himself explains early in the movie: "the key is the person."Revolving around the central (true) event of Ip Man rejecting the Japanese's "request" to train their soldiers when they occupied China and eventually sparring with them, this is essentially a genre movie built around the martial arts set-piece (Wing Chun vs Karate, see the trailer) "exploding" mid-way through.And what a movie they have built up around their central show-piece! Taking on the common martial arts/Kung Fu Movie theme of "what can one martial artist do against a turbulent world/time?" (one of the movie's promotional tag-lines), the story "hook" is not whether Ip Man will win-- but rather when he will be forced to fight and what would happen when he does. And the notable level of acting, scripting, production, etc. --highlighting not only Ip Man but also the plight of his family, friends and townsmen-- really ramps up the drama and "heart" for audiences who might not care for the genre. One evidence for this is how "Ip Man" garnered 12 nominations for the 2009 HK Film Awards in both the acting/directing and technical categories-- though it really stands out as a killer Kung-Fu Film, and consequently won for Best Action Director and Best Film.In short, "Ip Man" is quite a good ("mainstream") movie-- but a great martial arts/Kung Fu (not "action", as Donnie Yen points out during interviews) movie. And some telling numbers explain why:There are around 12 fights or so (depending on how you count them) evenly spaced throughout the film, with Donnie Yen in almost half of them-- with 3 or so weapon fights (not counting guns) and 5 or so group fights (anything with more than 2 people)-- which is why this is a martial arts movie, and not an "action" movie (no explosions, chases, shoot-outs, etc.). The shortest fight takes about 10 seconds and his longest runs around 2 minutes-- which gels with Donnie Yen's belief that real people fight to win and don't "pose, talk, fight, run, and... pose, talk, fight, run and...". Together with the miscellaneous violence (guns, etc.), the audience is virtually given an "adrenaline shot" every 5 minutes or so to give audiences something to laugh, cry or even cheer about.Of course, it also inspired in me a new-found respect for Wing Chun (Ip Man's school of martial arts)-- as well as action director Sammo Hung's "tight" choreography and camera-work (in China/HK, action directors control the camera as well as direct the actors). The close-to-mid range shots make it easier to "catch" the stunt doubles... but just like everything else in the movie-- blink and you'll miss it!For much like Wing Chun, everything in this movie get to the point quickly-- so that at over 100 minutes, the movie feels much too short.... But thank you, Wilson Yip (the director), for respecting the audience and not belaboring the "message"-- for a movie that is basically a war/ nationalist melodrama, it manages to unfold as elegantly as Ip Man's character (&amp; Donnie Yen's acting).But for those who care about the "downside": this movie is only loosely "based on" Ip Man's life-- in that the earlier parts is a dramatization of various accounts, the middle section is highly exaggerated (1-to-1 vs many-to-1 sparring), and the end is completely fictional (read: lead to an end-fight). And as a "World War II side-story" about a simple people in a small place (Foshan, China), there are only a few lines of text and transitional scenes depicting the Japanese invasion/occupation of Foshan (the director didn't have the budget to show how Foshan lost 3/4 of its population)-- though it manages to be quite effective, especially for those already familiar with the history. But those craving more creativity, complexity or completeness in this movie will be disappointed-- especially by the rather haphazard way the movie "wraps up" Ip Man's life at the end (when it wasn't certain whether/how a sequel would be made).Whatever the quibble, "Ip Man" heralds a break-though in realism for "grounded" martial arts/ Wushu movies; the way "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" heralded a break-through in surrealism for "floating" martial arts/Wuxia movies. It is clearly made for fans of Wing Chun and Kung Fu Movies-- and it makes no apologies for that (thank goodness for no "foreign" investors-- though it means that this movie is unlikely to get foreign distribution).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Ip Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I shall now proclaim unabashedly that I absolutely love this movie! It's been some time since we last saw a biopic on one of the Chinese's martial arts folk heroes, with Jet Li's Fearless being the last memorable one to hit the big screen. While Li lays claim to three of such roles in the iconic Wong Fei Hung (in the Tsui Hark movies), Fong Sai Yuk and Huo Yuan Jia in Fearless, after which he felt he had to hang up his martial arts roles because he thought that he had communicated all that he wanted about martial arts through these films. And thank goodness for Donnie Yen still being around to pick up from where the genre left off, and presenting a memorable role which he truly owned, with Ip Man being the first cinematic rendition of the Wing Chun martial arts grandmaster.In this bio-pic, Ip Man, one of the earliest Wing Chun martial arts exponents credited to have propagated its popularity, gets portrayed as the best of the best in 1930s Fo Shan, China, where the bustling city has its own Martial Arts Street where countless of martial arts schools have set up shop to fuel the craze of kung fu training. With each new school, the master will pay their respects to Ip Man and to challenge him to a duel. Ip Man, an aristocrat who spends most of his quality time developing and perfecting his brand of martial arts, will take them on behind closed doors, so as not to damage his opponents' reputation nor embarrass them in public. His humility is his virtue, and his style is never violent or aggressive, which often gets assumed and mistaken for being effeminate, since Wing Chun after all was founded by a woman.The bulk of the story gets set in the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war, and it's not all fight and no story. Witth this historical setting, at times it does seem that there is an air of familiarity with the type of stories told, with how the Japanese Imperial Army had made life really miserable for the Chinese, and how the Chinese being fragmented in spirit, fail to unite during dire straits. More often than note, martial arts become a unifying force, and this aspect of the narrative might seem to be a walk in the usual territory. But with its array of charismatic supporting cast with the likes of Simon Yam as Ip Man's best friend and industrialist Quan, and Lam Ka Tung as a cop turned translator, there are little nicely put sub plots which seek to expand the air of respect that Ip Man commands amongst his community. The story by Edmond Wong did not demonize all the villains, often adding a dash of empathy and sympathy to the likes of the Japanese General Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi), a highly skilled exponent from the North called Zhao (Fan Siu Wong) as well as Lam's translator character who is deemed as a traitor for being in the service of the Japanese. Ip Man the family man also gets put under the spotlight, where his passion could sometimes leave him neglecting his wife and kid, and through the course of the story this focus often leaves one quite exasperated for his family's safety as he puts his countrymen above self and family when going up against the oppressive Japanese forces.So what's the verdict on the action? Action junkies won't have to wait too long before watching Ip Man in action, and to Sammo Hung and Tony Leung Siu Hung's credit, they have intricately designed some of the most varied martial arts sequences in the movie, such as private fights in his home, a factory m?lée, a Japanese dojo battle as seen in the trailer, (which I know has actually sent some positive vibes amongst moviegoers, mouth agape at that incredible scene of Yen continuously beating down a karateka) being somewhat of a throwback and reminiscent of Bruce Lee in Fists of Fury, and a ringside duel amongst others. And it's not just Ip Man who gets in on the action, but specialized martial arts moves designed for the various practitioners as well. It's so difficult to name any particular one as a personal favorite, though I must add that you definitely won't feel short changed by the time the inevitable final battle comes rolling along and gets delivered with aplomb.I'm no Wing Chun practitioner, but Donnie Yen has this marvelous calm and zen like approach with his Ip Man taking out his opponents quite effectively with the minimal of moves. Like Huo Yuan Jia, he doesn't deliver the killing blows to friendly opponents, but rather simulates the various hit points, which actually calls for some astonishing control of strength and precision. This approach will change of course as the opponents become anything but friendly. And unlike the usual martial arts stance of crouching low, here we see him standing tall and striking with such precision and efficiency, it's like poetry in motion with some astounding closed quarter combat utilizing plenty of upper limb strength. With Wong Kar-wai at one point also declaring interest in making a Ip Man movie, I thought that this effort will be hard to beat, just like how Tsui Hark has crafted some of the more definitive movies in modern times about Wong Fei Hung and Jet Li benefiting from a major career boost, I'd say Ip Man just about cements Yen's reputation as a martial arts leading man, which I guess the cinematic world these days severely lacks. This has to go down in my books as one of my favorite movies of the year, and I'm already setting some money aside to get the best available edition of the DVD when it gets released. Highly recommended, so make a beeline for the box office now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Energetic &amp; brilliant HK action drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Donnie Yen's best acting piece for awhile now, and he still delivers the action sequences brilliantly. At 44 years of age, he looks so energetic, confident and charismatic. I believe the combination of Yen, Sammo Hung and Wilson Yip is the right choice for this particular film and fighting style. Wing Chun is best depicted without the flamboyant ballet of acrobatics often seen in other wushu films.The movie doesn't dwell on historical accuracy, but rather use that settings to set the mood, deliver the message and simply tells you the life journey of a Grandmaster in an fun and entertaining way.I remember that Richard Attenborough said (regarding Gandhi) that there was no way a director/movie maker could encompass and depict a person's life journey in only a 2 or 3-hour movie. But rather one should aim to emulate the spirit of that person, and the message/lesson of his story. I think this movie does that, with a quality production that raised the bar for period drama.My rating is missing 1 point because I feel that there were plot devices that had been done-to-death before in other movies like: Fists of Fury, Fearless, Kill Bill, etc. However, Yip Man simply turns the notch to a higher sound-beating level.Don't miss this on the big screen!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best martial art films of this decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent direction, photography and set design enliven this account of Wing Chun instructor Yip Man's life before he moved to Hong Kong. Every Wing Chun instructor today tries to make a lineage connection to Yip Man to legitimize their teaching so he is a very important figure in Kung Fu. Donnie Yen portrays the master with intense reserve and is possibly the best acting in his career. It surprised me for sure.The story line of this film is invented as historical accounts show Yip Man to have been a police officer in the time frame this film covers, not staying at home and only practicing kung fu as depicted here. Also the film claims that he refused to teach anybody but that is also not true. He left for Hong Kong a few years after WW2 not in the middle of it as this film presents. The plot with the Japanese army seems invented although they did ask him to teach the troops which he refused. However the film muddies up the historical record, that is not to say it isn't a great film. Sammo Hung's choreography is exceptional and a throwback to his great kung fu films of the early 1980's. The martial arts are done with great respect to traditional styles although some wire work is used to assist the actors with the difficult acrobatic moves. No flying across the room in this film. Although the ending is a little abrupt, this is one kung fu film that can be recommended to people who don't like these films. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Yuen finally gets the spotlight he always deserves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ip Man has quenched our thirst of a real good martial art movie where we don't just watch man kicking asses but where we can appreciate the man's moral and virtues.The movie flows well, from the view of the kungfu street of Fo Shan, to the introduction of Ip Man, and so on. Scene by scene are there in a well done play, and when someone had to display martial art act, they don't just throw bunch of minions out from nowhere to have him beating them all over. I think the scenario is well written.Fight choreography is great. Different approach from what we usually see, people doing flashy flying kicks and sorts; since it is about wing chun, feet hardly ever leave the ground but it doesn't decrease the beauty and flashiness of the fights.People may complain about bits that might not fit the real condition of those era. Well, I think producers have to make sure they made entertaining movies, not documentaries.Last words, Donnie Yuen has always been a good martial art actor, he just never get the spotlight. And finally as Ip Man he gets to stand on where he deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ip Man is very touching and full of mildness,considering it's an action movie. Wisedom, courage, elegance, humour...all the mixed elements you surely will feel from Ip man and they will definitely move you. All actors have done a great job. I believe this is the best movie that Zhen Zidan has ever contributed. This time he is not only a warrior, but also a wise, gentle, and conscientious man, a good husband. People clapped hands and weeped from time to time. I have watched it for two times,and longing for the third time when the DVD is coming. You know, Ip Man did not ballyhoo before it is shown, but it undoubtedly becomes a huge dark horse. It is really worthy of watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best martial-arts movie since "Enter the Dragon". Donnie Yen is on top form and may be the next Bruce Lee of our generation...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget "Flashpoint". "Ip Man" shows Donnie Yen at his brutal best. Telling the story of Yip Man, the man believed to have popularized the martial art of Wing Chun, before and mostly during the Sino-Japanese war.Yen caught my attention after seeing him in "SPL". Then in "Flashpoint", I was stunned by his moves, and thought he was the next Jet Li. Well, after this I think he may very well be the next Bruce Lee. I mean it! Not only injecting humanity and superb characterization, Yen also demonstrates his brutality when it comes to fighting. And boy, it does not get more brutal than this! Seriously, Yen's fists move like machine gun bullets. And he makes sure that his opponents are down for the count... at their expense, and our enjoyment. Definitely Yen at his bruising best.Other actors worth mentioning, Simon Yam and Hiroyuki Ikeuchi as Ip Man's business partner/friend and the Japanese General respectively. The former portrays Ip Man's comrade with heart, while the latter performs with steely resolve and honor. This is a film that is not just made with action, but a good story as well.The fight scenes here are arguably Yen's best so far, and the best in over a decade. People are getting beaten, martial arts duels are taking place, and blood is spilled. This is not an action movie, it's a kung fu movie. And it shows. Legendary kung fu star Sammo Hung brilliantly choreographs the fight scenes to perfection, and it looks like he's not going to slow down any time soon. The direction by Wilson Yip is slick and gripping as always, and he also gives the film a nice sepia tone to give feeling to the film.In short, great. This is a must-see for kung fu film fans to get their adrenal glands pumping. It's one of the best kung fu films of the decade. See it if you have the chance.Overall: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Martial of Virtuosity - A Review of Ip Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ip Man (1893-1972) is the expert in the Wushu fighting style of Wing Chun, and is the master of the famous Bruce Lee. As there has never been any previous film record of Ip Man, this film produced by Raymond Wong and directed by Wilson Yip will be the very first.The movie opens and dates back to 1935 Foshan, with the city bustling with activities and various schools of martial arts are seen busy with the practice of their craft. In the people's mind however there would be only one martial artist who is the best. He however would have no interest in opening a school to teach his art. He is Ip Man, played by Hong Kong action star Donnie Yen.Our introduction to Ip Man began on the day when Master Liu (Chen Zhi-Hui) visits Ip Man at his residence when the latter is having dinner with his wife and son. Being the typical martial arts enthusiast that Master Liu is, he declined to leave when advised by Ip Man to come back at another time, choosing instead to stay and wait until Ip Man have finished his dinner. He is eager to test his skills against Master Ip Man. The mood here is not of hostility but of a light hearted and humorous fashion. Ip Man even invited Master Liu to sit and have dinner with his family when he spots him restlessly waiting by the living room. We see here the humble and modest character of the protagonist.When the sparring finally got underway, it ended as swiftly as Ip Man's strokes suggest. Because in three strokes and a set of quick fists, he had Master Liu at his peril, well defeated yet without injury, as this was all but a friendly exchange in the spirit of martial arts. The essence of Ip Man's fighting style, Wing Chun, is characterized by its tall narrow stance with effectiveness demonstrated through speed and power. It reminds of the time when Bruce Lee had to slow his punches down during filming, as they were just too fast for the cameras back then to capture.In the world of martial arts, with all its attractiveness, it also brings with it the competitive nature of those who practice them. With competitiveness taken the wrong way, things can go awfully wrong when all one wants to achieve is to have the other beaten so as to prove who the superior fighter is. A thug in Kam Shan-chau (Fan Sui-Wong) later arrives and challenges the various schools, defeating their masters ruthlessly, until he came face to face with Ip Man. Kam lost to Ip Man with a lesson he ought to have learn, only that he did not and left Foshan with only disgrace in his mind. The people celebrate as they hail Ip Man the savior who brought glory to Foshan by sending the thug away.The fight ends but the story have only just began, and with it a change of mood from lightness to heavy because war has broken. The Japanese have seized Foshan.What follows will be Ip Man's struggles and challenges as he has to make ends meet for his family in the dreadful time of adversity. It is here we see the true character of Ip Man, who has captured the hearts of the people of Foshan and their respect. This is most notable among his friends in Chow Ching-chuen (Simon Yam), his son Chow Kong-yiu (Calvin Cheng), and Crazy Lam (Xing Yu).To mistake this film, as one of just good versus evil is easy because in a movie that has a hero, there must be a villain. There are a few characters here befitting of the role. We have the Japanese general, Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi). We have the aforementioned thug, Kam Shan-chau. We also have police officer turned interpreter, Li Chiu (Lam Ka-tung) who appears to be a traitor. The film here however should not to be seen as a fight against evil but rather of the depiction of humanistic values that Ip Man himself would possess.There are many meaningful messages encrypted in the various plots and subplots in this wonderful film that really is about virtues more than anything else. As producer Raymond Wong would suggest on why the production team had chosen to make this film, it is that of really making a kung fu movie that is authentic and real, moving away from past attempts at glorifying and stylizing violence on screen. The intention is to make a film that would reflect the spirit of Chinese kung fu, and what better than to portray it through the virtuous character of Master Ip Man.I would have like to compare this film to Fearless aka Huo Yuan Jia (2006), starring Jet Li, which strings from a similar root, but at the very core, the approach is different. While Fearless is written in a more dramatic nature, with a more compelling story and edited with a creative dimension, Ip Man is honest and direct because that is who our protagonist is.What stood out for me in Ip Man is when he ponders in introspection about what use his training and expertise in Wing Chun all his years would come to. It would appear that there is destiny waiting to be fulfilled. And he would also influence those around him with what he has and even lead those who have been wrong to do right despite the pressure of circumstances, because to the very basis, it is the right thing to do in humanity.History means nothing if its lessons are not learned.The film also stars the stunning Xiong Dai Lin as Cheung Wing-sing, Ip Man's wife, and I must also not forget to mention that the acclaimed Sammo Hung directs the action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a choice of watching The Spirit or Ip Man. It is a tough decision and after a long while, I finally makes the choice of watching Ip Man. The director of Dragon Tiger Gate makes his comeback with his usual star, Donnie Yen. As expected, the martial arts fighting scenes are amazing. This director is amazing, he knows how to direct realistic martial arts fighting features in Dragon Tiger Gate. This guy can create, I can say, some of best martial arts movies.The story: It tells about Ip Man's life, the soon-to-be master of the famous Bruce Lee. I can't say much about the plot but the fighting and the music are great. The Japanese soon attacks China which affects Ip Man and his family. Soon, he goes for a fight, organised by the Japanese, which can earn him rice. The Japanese General is impressed by his ability which leads to the final battle of all. It is fast paced with amazing fights in between and humour.Overall: If you are a martial arts movie fan, this is definitely stunning and not to be missed. If you get entertained by any form of action and want to know the facts of Bruce Lee's master, this should also not be missed. Another good martial arts movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice martial arts but a bit too obvious propaganda behind it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even without knowing too much about the historical Yip Man who was Bruce Lee's master, it's quite evident that we see Donnie Yen more in the role of a conventional Chinese hero here than in the one of a historical person. At the very beginning he is introduced as the noble saver of the honor of the city who is neither interested in money nor profit. Why should he - he owns the largest crib in town. But how he can afford it is a bit nebulous, if the only thing he really masters is Wing Chun. A powerful fighting style which he refuses to teach anybody by the way. So where does the money come from? We'll never know. Anyway it's no wonder that later when the Japanese army invades China and everybody suffers from hunger and desperation, he prefers to work in a coal mine than in his friend's wool factory which he, involuntary, owns to 10%.The circle closes with him as the altruistic saver of the Chinese people's honor and the honor of Chinese fighting skills which are much better than the Japanese ones, of course. This integrity is drawn through the hole movie and leads to a very boring character and a pretty black and white good guys/bad guys scheme. Our hero never really has to struggle with himself and most of the time Donnie Yen looks like he doesn't know what to do with himself. Except for the fighting sequences which are well edited and pleasingly violent.Well, the Japanese are stupidly and exaggerated portrayed as ruthless killers and omnipresent threat, but still Ip Man contains some really nice martial arts sequences and Sing-Pui O did solid work as cinematographer. If you've liked the fighting styles of Ong Bak and Unleashed, go for it, but don't expect too see the story of Bruce Lee's master. This one borrows just his name and turns it into a</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IP MAN is one of those patriotic - jingoistic even - films about historical Chinese defeats which create a fictional tournament in which an underdog Chinese can symbolically defeat foreigners using martial arts, thereby restoring Chinese honour. This time it's Ip Man, the trainer of Bruce Lee, who takes on northern bandits and the invading Japanese in 1930s China. The story is predictable but that's the norm for martial arts flicks. What sinks this one is just how perfect Ip Man is. He's so great that even though the fights feature admirable technique by Donnie Yen, they're drama free because the outcome is never in doubt. Similarly, nothing shakes the man, leading to the glorious moment when he announces to his wife, who is dying of starvation after the Japanese stole their house, that he will get a job -- did this not occur to him earlier? To add insult to injury, it ends with a text crawl which tries to claim that the Japanese defeat in 1945 was due to the Chinese (because Ip Man inspired them) which is as shameless as it is ahistorical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extraordinary martial-art film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start with the martial art aspect. The Wing Chun style is not the best material for popular action movies. Its characteristic is motion efficiency: lighting fast movements and direct strikes, an approach that inspired Bruce Lee in the creation of his own style. While deadly effective, Wing Chun is not very exciting to watch. Furthermore, its kicks are low profile (both literally and figuratively), not the flying kicks that have become almost mandatory for today's popular kung-fu flicks. "Ip Man"'s portrayal of this martial art style is quite authentic, granting a certain creative liberty for cinematic effects, understandably. Immensely satisfying for someone whose has some experience (albeit modest) with this style, such as this IMDb user, this movie may not satisfy those who are used to the usual Jet Li, Wu Jing (or indeed Donnie Yen) stuff."Ip Man", however, is much more than an action movie. Like "Fearless" (2006), it is the biopic of a great martial art master. Interestingly (and this parallel has just occurred to me as I write), its riches-to-rags plot line has some similarity to "Cinderella Man" (2005). But it has a loftier backdrop ? survival with pride, compassion and dignity under the atrocities of Japan's occupation of Southern China during WW II.The action scenes can be grouped into three segments which also serve to outline the story. The first group occurs during a time when Master Ip, bathing in affluence, leads a low-profile life with his family (lovely wife and little boy), basically doing nothing other than perfecting the love of his life, the Wing Chun style martial art. The fights, fuelled by challengers (both local and outsiders), take place behind closed doors in his plush house so that the invariably beaten challengers are not embarrassed. The second arena is the factory of a life-long friend (Simon Yam), when he trains the workers to defend themselves against bullies, and later gets involved himself in helping them to beat off harassing goons. By this time, he has been reduced to abject poverty (house and possession confiscated by the occupying Japanese), working as a coal miner. The last group of fights is set at the barracks of a Japanese general who, being a martial art fanatic, offers sacks of rice to lure coal miners who are ex-martial-art experts to duels with his people and himself. As expected, the climatic final duel is between Master Ip and this general.Unlike in many other good-against-evil movies, "Ip Man" does not succumb to handing out one-dimensional villains. Policeman-turned-interpreter Li Chiu's (Lam Ka Tung) agonized scream that he is not a traitor but just an interpreter struggling to survive does get a degree of sympathy. A bullying goon's outburst that he does not want to go hungry virtually echoes Scarlet O'Hara. Even the Japanese general is portrayed more as a martial arts fanatic than a blood-thirty villain.In "Ip Man" is a Donnie Yen that you have never seen before and it is not surprising that many consider this to be Yen's best cinematic performance to-date. From the quietly confident, gentle man who wants to avoid trouble, to the impoverished husband-and-father finding himself suddenly quite useless but rising to the occasion, to the fighter enraged by the senseless death of his martial art friends ? Yen is right on pitch. In an interview ("bc Magazine" of Hong Kong), 85-year-old Ip Chun, who is Master Ip's little son in the movie, asserts that Yen's performance finds the essence of his father. Yen's portrayal of Master Ip is indeed a source of pride to Wing Chun students all over the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly great story and movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been a huge fan of martial art movies, mostly because they rarely combine the good story with good fighting. I did however like "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" back when it came despite it's aerial theme and fairytale ways, because it told a great story in a good way true to it's universe."Ip Man" is a great story with the more realistic and human fights, and serves as a counter to "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon". The one common thing is both tell their story with heart and delivers a cinematic experience you'll remember.Highly recommended and a must watch movie in my book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the very few martial arts movies that i like, because it's all seriousness from the word go. It has very nice and entertaining storyline....with unbelievable fight scenes, when i say unbelievable i don't mean impossible i mean they were totally awesome....AND they chose the perfect actor to play the role of "Master Yip Man". Ther is one minor problem that i have with the film though. And that is the way that the filmmakers portrayed karate, if anyone ever watched "Fist of Legend", you will see that karate was payed adequate respect. Although Jet Li who used the wushu style throughout the film (Fist Of Legend) beat the hell out of the karatekas in the film there were two masters in the film that proved that karate can be a very very formidable weapon in the right hands....in "Yip Man" karate was pretty much trampled upon (which is a total fallacy in my humble opinion) and the last boss was a total weakling...Master Yip Man ate him for breakfast, Lunch and Dinner</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Donnie Yen has been one of the most underrated martial arts actors. Now that Jet Li has announced his retirement from film-making, I believe that the time is ripe for Donnie to take Hollywood by storm as the next martial arts icon.His powerful performance in Ip Man has established himself as a credible actor in addition to being a superb martial artist. From the early wobbly performance in Drunken Tai Chi (Siuu Taai Gik) to his confident acting in Hero, Donnie's acting prowess has slowly but steadily been honed to international caliber.Time to step up Donnie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rousing, historical, uprising story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a weird notion in the UK that says that teenagers learning history in school would rather learn about how people died due to poverty in some minor British cities in the 1800s than anything outside of Europe for the past 2000 years. I personally find Asian history far more interesting than anything the UK has ever done. Perhaps Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors have somewhat skewed my view on the matter but compared to the utterly dull events of Britain's sparse history, Asia just seems far more interesting to me. This film's true story seems somewhat to be proof of this idea.Ip Man sounds like a superhero name but alas he is but a man. Despite this, he really may as well have fighting superpowers. He is a master of the martial art Wing Chun and no human in his town of Fo Shan can beat him in a fight. During the subjugation of his town by the Japanese in World War II he struggles to get even a bag of rice. Fighting also occurs.First and foremost, the fights in this film are some of the most impressive in terms of filmmaking and straight up martial arts that I have ever seen. Dust is flying about after hits and when fighters get knocked down, they seemingly defyphysics and push themselves back onto their feet. Not only are the actors impressive but also the way the fights are shot is incredible. The film uses speed- ups and slow downs masterfully (slowing down time is an important thing with Donnie Yen because he could likely unleash 15-20 punches in a second ? which he does many times). It strikes a perfect balance between being too slow to be exciting and too fast, making it overwhelming and confusing. On a slightly unrelated note, much like the Raid films, I would like to disclaim some of the brutal shots in this film. If you don't want to see a guy's leg get utterly snapped, you may want to brace yourself during the fight scenes.At the end of the first act of the film, there is a violent shift from a pretty light- hearted mood to a much darker tone. While the grimmer of the two atmospheres is fantastic and tense throughout, the difference is far too stark between the two and moreover, the first section very much overstays its welcome. All the fights (while excellent) in this section seemed purely expositional. The start in no way prepares you for what is coming next. While this may be seen as smart storytelling for maximum audience response, you are somewhat left realising that the film instantly went from the people of Fo Shan chanting 'Master Ip' to a man getting shot in the face at point blank range by Japanese soldier. While the misstep of the tone of the first act seems minor after seeing the spectacle of the film's latter sequences, it does exist and did certainly detract from the film overall.I mentioned earlier that the darker section of the film was rife with tension and atmosphere and it is what sets the film apart from other films in the martial arts genre. These films are often either entirely comic (anything Jackie Chan has done) or entirely visceral (either of the Raid films). This film on the other hand takes both of the approaches and slams them together. While the seams stitching the two styles together are hugely apparent, the film is made better by both being present. The part of the story during the Second World War totally conveys the horror that really occurred in true history. The setting is dank and the comparison between shots of downtown Fo Shan before and after the switch is incredible (and the production value of this single street is vastly detailed and has clearly been laboured on for countless hours ? which I am certainly impressed by). The use of colour is a huge shift in the film as well making the Japanese soldiers the only characters wearing anything other than shades of grey and I love smart use of colour in films. The second and third acts are incredible visually and conceptually.Ip Man is a meticulously produced film about the eponymous master of martial arts. The fights within the film are incredible from both choreography and cinematography standpoints. The first section is unexpectedly upbeat but the latter half more than makes up for it. It is undoubtedly one of my favourite martial arts films, which is a difficult position to get to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I decided to review this film now, after seeing this movie for the third time. It's a lot for me because I watch to many things to have the time for multiple viewings. I enjoyed this movie a lot. I must say, at first I wasn't expecting a lot from this. It was one of the first martial arts movie i've seen along with a couple of Jackie Chan movies.Donnie Yen was one of the reason I wasn't sure to like this movie, his face seems like he had no emotions at all so I was thinking : how can a guy like this could do good acting. Let me say that he earned my respect with this movie, I was completely wrong. He fits perfectly for this role.This movie is not only for martial arts fans but also contains historical events between Chinese and Japanese. There's a lot of good fights accompanying a really good story.Now that I have seen a lot of martial arts movies, this one's still my favorite followed by the second one. I hope that the third one will be great too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was inspired to watch this movie by all the positive reviews it has received, and the high rating here on IMDb. I was expecting something epic beautiful and captivating. I was however disappointed.The problem with this movie is that it is a martial arts movie that tries to be 'Gone with the wind'. However martial arts has no place in a serious drama about the cruelty of the Japanese occupation of China, and human tragedy is probably too angsty a backdrop for a movie that seeks to entertain you by kicking people in the groin. The genres are fairly incompatible, so they can only be held together by a story that is so contrived and stupid that you might as well just fast-forward through it to the next fight scene.In this film the universe seems to revolve around martial arts. Everyone cares way too much about it. Even though it has zero practical applications, and they all have more pressing concerns like war and famine.As a martial arts movie it holds up quite well. The first 20 mins has some of the best fight scenes I've ever seen in any movie. The cinematography is also excellent. It is really just the awkward, nonsensical wartime narrative that makes it blow.As a historical wartime drama, it is obviously just shallow and silly, not to mention overly long and boring. Movies like Full Metal Jacket, Schindler's list, Empire of the sun etc... explore this subject properly. Ip Man really only scratches the surface, and I kind of wish it didn't bother.I would give this film a 6 because that is a realistic representation of how much I enjoyed it. It was okay, but I doubt I would watch it again or recommend it to anyone (apart from the first 20 mins which are unquestionably awesome). I'm tempted to give more because it is quite epic, and has that rich epic quality too it. But 7 is probably too high, for all it's qualities, it is just not that interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting as well as exciting Kung Fu movie with violent combats , thrills ,and inevitable ending showdown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This luxurious Kung Fu film was marvelously filmed with good production design , colorful cinematography , spectacular combats and breathtaking scenes . The flick displays lots of violence , action filled , thrills and fierce fights . This exciting film deals with the celebrated Kung Fu master of Bruce Lee . A semi-biographical account of Yip Man , the first martial arts master to teach the Chinese martial art of Wing Chun ; though not mentioned in the film Grandmaster Yip Man was actually employed as a police officer during the Japanese invasion . Although it's the first film centering around Yip Man, the idea of doing a Yip Man biopic have been conceived for as long as 30 years . Dramatizes the life of Yip Man (1893-1972) in the mid to late 1930s . Foshun is a big city with many martial arts schools . Yip, who practices Wing Chun, is a famous local master . When a rough band comes to the prosperous town , they decide challenge Yip and then he kicks them out . After that , in 1937 Japan invades China and Chinese people suffer the continual racist harassment by the Japanese military . Japanese celebrate hard combats and IP accepts the challenge of a fighter General . The General proceeds to mercilessly crush each of them with a brutal yet efficient barrage of his martial art mastery , showing barely any of the restraint he exhibited in previous engagements . At the end takes place the match between Ip and the General , it is held in public in Foshan's square .This moving Chop-Socky displays action-packed , thrills , fast-paced and wild fighting images . It is an action-filled and violent film , being filmed in Hong Kong . The picture is full of tumultuous sequences with frenetic action , surprises , fierce combats and groundbreaking struggles . The rousing fights with deadly use of fists , feet and palms , along with such weapons as swords and sticks . Fights , attacks and exciting combats very well staged by expert Sammo Hung , the result is a strong entry for action buffs Amid the glamour and grandeur of the scenarios is developed an intrigue between Chinese-Japanese confrontation . Groundbreaking combats between IP Man and a lot of Japonese soldiers ; furthermore , an overwhelming final duel between Yip Man and a General . Classic as well as impressive Chop-Socky in which wild fighting scenes provide an overwhelming view of Donnie Yen's skills. Donnie Yen was actually slated to play Yip Man in the supposed first biopic that was about to go into production in 1997 . The film would've also featured Stephen Chow playing an adult Bruce Lee . However, only one day of shooting took place before the project was canceled . Actors made their owns stunts ; some of the players got injured and to had to be hospitalized during the shooting , as Hiroyuki Ikeuchi , who played the Japanese general , suffered a mild concussion during filming, after being struck four times during a fight scene.The motion picture was stunningly directed by Wilson Yip . It is followed by two sequels such as ¨IP Man 2¨ (2010) by Wilson Yip with Donnie Yen as Yip Man , Xiaoming Huang , Wong Shun-Leung , Sammo Hung Kam-Bo , Lynn Hung , Simon Yan and ¨IP Man 3¨ (2013) with Anthony Wong Chau-Sang as Ip Man, Gillian Chung , Jordan Chan and Eric Tsang .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Holy Grail" Spoiler -- Maybe best fight scene in martial arts films..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I realize I am out on a limb here. But I think I am onto something. First, let me say I have seen 99.9% of all martial arts films released in the west in the last 50 years, including entries from Japan, Thailand and Korea. Also in my youth I used to go into Chinatown in Montreal and watch direct imports from Hong Kong, no subtitles. So, credentials on the table, and already facing many disapproving glances from other martial arts cinephiles, I want to respectfully draw your attention to a scene about 3/4 the way through where the corrupt local officials decide to make their beef with the Ip Man character "personal" and go after his family. Let's pause for second. First this is a biopic and as I have said in my other reviews on IMDb, usually (but not always) for a biopic the rules are a bit different, and the story is a little more constrained. (In fact, for this sequels to this excellent film, they threw the rule book out the window, with attendant consequences, all bad, but I digress, I am not reviewing those films here.) Second, the casting. Some have complained that Donnie is too old for this kind of role but after spending so many years (decades) with Jet and Jackie, I think he is a breath of fresh air and clearly his skills in the Wing Chun style are authentic. Now to the fight scene. It is short, which puts me in double jeopardy because I have not only dared to pick a fight scene I think is a standout, but I have picked a scene which is short. In the scene, the character Ip Man, who TO THIS POINT IN THE FILM has been a model of restraint, reacts with true emotion when his family (his wife) is manhandled. He goes after those doing the attacking and his hands move so fast that for a moment it appears his opponents have been caught in a threshing machine. The reason I dare to compare this to other great scenes (such as for example the marvellous early, sequential, fight scenes in Ong Bak, also candidates for the greatest fight scenes of all time) is the emotional setup. In these kinds of films you rarely see emotion when the Masters fight. Here Donnie allows his character to show passion as he turns the bad guys to hamburger, and for that reason, I think this film, already iconic, should get special mention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome choreography, intense scenes and a great story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Wilson Yip (Killzone, Flashpoint) This movie is a "portrayal" of the famous Wing Chun master Yip Man, credited as being the guy that taught Bruce Lee kung fu. The movie starts of a bit slow, and seems a bit awkward imo. The dialogue didn't really work on me, and I didn't quite feel the comedy or drama the dialogue was supposed to invoke. However, troublemakers enter the city and the fighting shall begin. When that part began, the movie immediately started to grow on me. The fighting is very well choreographed, and the stunts are really amazing. I am very interested in martial arts and fighting, and thus many movies loses me when I have to see a 300 pound muscular guy supposedly gets knocked out for 10 minutes by 1 jab from e.g. Jackie Chan or choked out by Angelina Jolie. However, in this movie the fight scenes are so amazing that I easily accept that a knee to the body can send a guy a flying across the room. The fighting is of course unrealistic (though not extremely so), but they somehow make it seem legit in this movie, and you actually start believing for the duration of the movie that Ip Man is capable of this stuff. As for the cast, Donnie Yen is the one that stands out. He is a really great choice for Ip Man, with a very calm and intelligent charisma, and he shows in this movie that he is capable of being a diverse actor. The other actors did a fine job as well, most notably his wife (Lynn Hung) and General Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi), considering their acting experience. The cinematography, soundtrack, costumes and art direction are all well done. They got some fairly experienced people for that, but not anyone "really" famous (except for the movie buffs perhaps), most notably Kenji Kawai and Kenneth Mak. My main critique lies in the fact that this movie markets itself as a historical portrait, while this is clearly not so. Apart from the fight scenes that has probably never gone down in reality, we also have the portrayal of the Japanese. While they definitely did invade China and committed some atrocities there, I somehow doubt they had karate tournaments with Japanese vs Chinese. The movie also claims that the city population was reduced from 300k to 72k, which I somehow doubt, but I am unable to find any source that either disprove or confirms that statement. But since the movie is from China I guess a non-biased portrayal of the Japanese invasion is too much to ask. But the thing that bugged me the most was the final part of the movie, which show a fight scene with following events that I am 100% positive has never happened, but the movie actually try to claim that it did (obviously I can't explain the scene to you without spoiling). So all in all a great movie. The plot meets the required amount of relevancy that is needed to keep you interested, but what really stands out is the fight scenes which is what lift this movie to great heights, and what I assume has secured it a place on the IMDb top 250 list. I greatly enjoyed the movie, but the fact that the movie tries to sell itself as being a historic portrayal really bugs me the wrong way and drags it down a point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must See Martial Arts movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw IP Man in the IMDb top 500, I thought I will have a look at it &amp; am I glad I did! It is one of the most memorable martial arts movies I have seen. If reading subtitles annoys you, then you may not get motivated to watch IP Man, but if you can get passed that, this is a fantastic movie. It tells the story of IP Man (Yip Man), a Chinese Martial Art Grandmaster who teaches Wing Chum. It is based on the life of Yip Man (1893-1972) whom taught many students throughout his life, several of which became martial arts teachers in their own right. His most famous student was Bruce Lee. This movie has lots of action, from martial arts training to big fight scenes, interwoven with drama that makes you really feel for IP Man. It has a great storyline supplemented with top notch acting. Donnie Yen does an excellent job in his role as IP Man, and in my opinion this is one of his best performances. IP Man 2 is also very good but lacking in story compared to the original. I would rate the original, IP Man as being the better out of them. This is truly a must see for any action/martial art fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ip Man is one of the most refreshing martial arts films in a long time. It doesn't succumb to the usual clichés the genre is known for. But what makes it better than most martial arts movies these days? Let's find out!The first thing I want to talk about is the title character himself, Ip Man played by Donnie Yen. I was surprised how devoid of clichés his character was and how well-written he was. He isn't some sort of fearsome warrior but a man who has a skill but no purpose to it. He's extremely gifted in Wing Chun but he doesn't teach it or use it for anything, he just continuously practices it for no reason. But later on, when his friend's factory gets attacked by a gang, he decides to teach the entire factory Wing Chun and ends up saving them from another attack. This is his moment of growth, he finds an actual purpose to live and that's really the message of this movie. It's about using whatever skills you have to make the world a better place and not just sit back and do nothing. It's a great message because they never just flat out say it like a lot of films do.The second thing I want to talk about is the excellent fight choreography. Sammo Hung has often been declared as the greatest action choreography of all-time and while I'm not completely sure of that, he definitely does an excellent job with this film. The first fight in this film is rather light, quick, and short but it works because this scene is simply meant to establish Ip Man's martial arts skills. I am glad that he chose to keep it nice and short for the first fight so we are still hungry for more. The second fight with Ip Man is a lot more intense with the music pounding and stuff breaking, it's great. The third fight with Ip Man is probably the most brutal out of all them all with the way Ip Man repeatedly pounding on their faces and twisting their limbs but it's appropriate because Ip Man is heavily enraged so it isn't just violence for the sake of violence. The fourth fight with Ip Man is somewhere in between the first fight and the third fight. He doesn't go all out like he did in the fourth fight but he doesn't go easy like in the first fight either, he just uses quick, simple self- defense techniques, nothing fancy. The fifth and final fight is probably the most difficult fight for Ip Man in this movie. He actually starts out with a little bit of a problem but ultimately defeats in a brutal manner. All in all, the fight scenes in this movie were great!Some other things I want to touch upon is the acting, shooting, and sound design. While Donnie Yen isn't exactly reinventing himself as an actor, he carries the film well and makes the audience care for him because of his charm and charisma. Everyone else is great too but the one performance that stands out is Gordan Lam. He plays a cowardly guy who has a good heart but isn't brave enough to stand up for himself. He could have just been a stereotypical douchebag if he was played by the wrong actor, but Lam adds a level of nuance that's needed in this film. The cinematography looks great, it draws a sharp contrast between the happier, more peaceful days of Foshan and the darker, more violent time in Foshan. Lastly, the sound design adds a lot of intensity to this film. It has a loud booming sound when there's a fight scene and a level of peace and quietness in the talking scenes. It kinda reminds me of the Christopher Nolan Batman movies.Overall, this is a great film and I highly recommend it to both martial arts fans and historical drama fans. I'm gonna give it a 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Movie "Ip Man" is full of great content. One of my favorite parts of this movie is the movie being action packed. Not only was the movie full of action it also had an excellent story line that made every fight scene meaningful. Finally the movies actors were well trained and were exactly how in action movies should be well known with the part, trained in the martial art, and have the correct personality.Additionally the action scenes were well throughout the whole movie from the first fight scene to the last. Donnie yen spent a large amount of time preparing to fight in the martial art called Wing Chun. Virtuous Sammo Hung was the one who came up with the choreography used in not just this movie but also is world renown for his choreography and acting skills. Director Wilson Yip is also a veteran director with experience.Furthermore the storyline had an awe inspiring effect to it make the viewer really feel for those during the Japanese Chinese war. This movie consists of a grandmaster bringing his country together to revolt against a Japanese general. Ip mans storyline is actually based off of the life of Master Ip in Foshan.Although this movie was amazing it should be more based off of Master Ip's life instead of the movie being loosely based off of his life maybe a little more based of of his life instead. even though it was loosely based it was still wonderful. I am extremely thankful for this amazing film.Finally the actors made the movie even more easier to watch. Donnie Yen is a great example he spent a large amount of his time preparing for the film. He made himself familiar with the type of environment that Master Ip was in. Donnie Yen also made sure he knew the martial art Wing Chun from inside out. In conclusion you should watch this movie it is great and full of great action pictures. The acting was well thought out. The action film was well choreographed and was full of action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bona Fide Martial Arts Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ip Man is a Hong Kong semi-biographical martial arts film very loosely based on the life of Yip Man, a grand master of the martial art Wing Chun and master of Bruce Lee. It focuses on events in Ip's life that supposedly took place in the city of Foshan during the Sino-Japanese War. It stars Donnie Yen in the title role together with Simon Yam, Lynn Hung, Lam Ka-tung, Xing Yu and Hiroyuki Ikeuchi to play key supporting roles.was directed by Wilson Yip.Behind every great man there lies a teacher, and this was certainly true of Bruce Lee, who claimed as his mentor a martial arts expert named Ip Man. A genius of Wushu, Ip Man grew up in a China nearly ripped to pieces by racial hatred, nationalistic strife, and warfare. He rose like a phoenix above these ashes, however, courtesy of his participation in matches against various Wushu masters and kung fu warriors and ultimately training martial arts icons such as Lee.Wilson Yip has crafted a gripping, rousing, beautifully structured yarn, built around a calm but charismatic star performance by Donnie Yen and magnificent action sequences choreographed by the legendary Sammo Hung.At once beholden to the established conventions of the genre and delightfully subversive of them, it is one of the most exciting and refreshingly character-driven martial arts films in years.It is not only is it one of the most entertaining and exciting movies out of Hong Kong for many years but it is a bona fide martial arts classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>¨There are no men who fear their wives. Only men who respect them.¨I'm no martial art expert, but Yip Man has to be one of the coolest martial art films I've seen in a long time. I loved this movie completely. I began watching it very late and decided I would only watch the beginning to see what all the buzz was about, but there was no way I could stop watching and I was hooked from the beginning. Donnie Yen is a true star and he was outstanding in every fight scene. He felt like the Yoda of martial arts, keeping his cool, always giving smart advice and using as little violence as possible, but at the same time he seemed untouchable. He's not like most characters in martial arts, but rather more of a young Mister Miyagi who's wise beyond his years and never looks for trouble despite knowing he can defeat anyone in a heartbeat. He is completely against violence and uses martial arts for his personal well being. This film was directed by Wilson Yip and is supposed to be based on the biography of Yip Man, the first master to teach the art of Wing Chun (a Chinese martial art). Yip Man is known as the man responsible for teaching Bruce Lee, the greatest martial art superstar. There is no doubt that Bruce Lee made this art popular all over the world through his movies. I don't know how authentic the biography is, but I don't care because I was entertained by this film which was written by Edmond Wong. The script was interesting and he made me care for the characters in this film. The fight scenes were beautifully choreographed, but the story also worked to perfection. It wasn't all about the fighting, there was some depth to Yip Man and Donnie Yen played him extremely well. The story takes place during 1935 in a small Chinese town named Foshan. This town is known for having a martial art class in every corner. There are all sorts of martial art styles and masters, but everyone knows that the best martial artist in town is Yip Man (Donnie Yen). Despite being the best, Yip Man isn't interested in becoming a master; he lives a simple life in his rich estate along with his wife, Zhang Yong (Lynn Hung), and his young son. Every master in town wants to prove their talent by facing Ip Man in a friendly duel, but no one stands a chance against him. Everything seems to be going well for the town of Foshan until their country is attacked by Japan and soon the Imperial Japanese army invades their town. Yip Man's estate is confiscated by Japan and him and his family are left with nothing. They barely have enough food to survive so Yip Man decides to accept any job in order to get more food. The Japanese General, Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi), begins staging martial art fights between Chinese and Japanese fighters promising rice if they defeat them. Miura himself is an excellent fighter and in one fight he kills Yip Man's friend. Yip Man who was against participating in this sort of event goes to a fight to try to find out what has happened to his friend. There he discovers that he can defy the Japanese army with his martial art skills.Yip Man is a great biographical story although it probably isn't 100% accurate. Donnie Yen plays the character so smooth and wise that he looks virtually invincible and untouchable. The fighting scenes are also excellently choreographed and there are some great action scenes. Donnie Yen is really talented and he just might be the next martial art movie star. He's not only a great fighter, but he can also act as well. This film is so much more than an action packed movie; it has some interesting drama and a great storyline as well. This film has gotten great reviews, but I wonder what the Japanese think of it because they were poorly depicted and it is part of their history that they would probably want to forget. I loved the mood of this film and consider it to be one of my favorite martial art films. That is how much I liked it, and in my humble opinion it is a masterpiece. I look forward to seeing Donnie Yen in more films and catching up with my martial art films.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Legendary Film about A Martial Arts Legend.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film deserves a 10/10 rating for it's realistic portrayal of the Japanese occupation of China. The mood and setting is exactly as it was during the 1930's in Foshan. Yip Man is seen in his home with his wife and son when patriarch of the Liu Fist Sect comes to visit him seeking a challenge. He says to Yip man that whatever the outcome of the contest between them, it would be a secret as to who won. Yip Man replies that he was just having lunch and asks his guest if he had dined. His guest replies no and so Yip Man invites him to lunch, after which they begin.Yip Man takes his opponent apart and exposes his errors in defence. In the end the grateful master acknowledges his defeat to the highly skilled Yip Man. However unknown to them both someone has seen the match and blabs the result to the townsfolk.Ip's reputation is further enhanced when he defeats an aggressive, rude, highly skilled Northern Chinese martial arts master, Jin Shanzhao, thus upholding the regional pride of fellow Southern stylists and others in Foshan.The Japanese invasion in 1937 adversely affects the life of everyone in Foshan. Ip's house is claimed by the Japanese and used as their Foshan headquarters. Ip and his family lose their wealth and are forced to move into a decrepit house. Desperate to support his family, Ip accepts work as a coolie at a coal mine.The Japanese General Miura, who is a Karate master, establishes an arena where Chinese martial artists compete with his military trainees. The Chinese earn a bag of rice for every match they win. Li Zhao, a former police officer and Ip's acquaintance, is now working as a translator for the Japanese and is making the offer to the martial artists working as coolies. Ip at first declines to participate in the matches. However, when his friend Lin goes missing, he agrees to take part in order to investigate. He is enraged when he sees a fellow Foshan master (Master Liu) mercilessly executed for picking up a bag of rice from a prior victory after giving up in a second match against three karatekas. He also comes to understand that Lin was killed in an earlier fight. Barely able to contain his rage, Ip demands a match with ten Karatekas at once. Despite having not practiced Wing Chun since the invasion began (in order to conserve what little food his family had to survive), he proceeds to mercilessly crush each of them with a brutal yet efficient barrage of his martial art mastery, showing barely any of the restraint he exhibited in previous engagements. His skill arouses the interest of Miura, who seeks to learn more about Ip and see him fight again.Ip visits his friend Chow Ching-chuen, who owns and runs a cotton mill in Foshan. Chow tells Ip that a highway robbery gang led by Jin Shanzhao is harassing his workers and extorting money from them. Ip trains the workers in Wing Chun for self defence. Meanwhile, Miura grows impatient when Ip does not return to the arena and sends men to find Ip. These men harass Ip's family, and Ip incapacitates them. Ip and his family then go into hiding at Li Zhao's house. Meanwhile, the robbers return to the cotton mill to demand money. The workers fight back using the techniques that Ip taught them. Just then, Ip appears and defeats Jin Shanzhao, warning him never to harass the workers again.The Japanese soldiers eventually find Ip at the cotton mill. Miura tells Ip that his life will be spared if agrees to instruct the Japanese soldiers in martial arts. Ip refuses and challenges Miura to a match, which Miura accepts, both because of his love for martial arts and because refusing the challenge would be a humiliation to the Japanese. The match between Ip and Miura is held in public in Foshan's square. At first, the two fighters seem equally matched, but Miura becomes overwhelmed and is unable to fend off Ip's attacks as he effortlessly uses him as a Wooden Dummy, inflicting a severe beating on him and clearly winning.As the beaten general lies down after his defeat, Ip looks over to the crowd and hears the Chinese cheering him; within the crowd, he spots his wife and child with Chow. Just then, Miura's deputy Sato shoots Ip. This sparks a scuffle between the Chinese audience and the Japanese soldiers. During the scuffle, Li Zhao kills Sato with Sato's own gun. Ip is taken away amidst the chaos. It is revealed that he survives and escapes to Hong Kong with his family. There, Ip establishes a Wing Chun school, where his students come to include Bruce Lee.Donnie Yen is superb in his portrayal as Ip Man. The rest of the cast puts in superb performances. Sammo Hung directs the excellent fight choreography. All in all director Wilson Yip does a great job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great action bio from Donnie Yen and company</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Yen stars as the Ip Man. A well off man who spent his life studying martial arts and perfecting his technique to the point he was unbeatable. Often sparring with the heads of the local dojos behind closed doors he tried to learn as much as he could. Covering a brief period before the Japanese invasion of China in the first third of the film, the majority of the film deals with what happened after the invasion and how the man who "can't do anything" found he could.I have no idea how much of this is gospel truth, but whats on screen is very good. The film has great performance by Yen as the Ip Man, who conveys a great deal of our hero's humanity and sense of honor in the non-action scenes and really letting loose in the action sequences. Yen's quiet demeanor nicely covers his unstoppable ability. Even having seen Yen in numerous other films, I still found his battles utterly amazing (Thank you Sammo Hung). If you love action you really need to see this.I really liked this film. If there is a problem with the film I found some of the Japanese sequences a tad cliché (Bad Japanese monsters). Its not bad, but in a film that seems to strive to be more than a typical martial arts film, I found it kind of disappointing.Then again when the end came I was moved, so I guess it doesn't matter.If you want to see a really good action bio, see this film.7.5 out of 10.(I may change the rating down the road when I find a DVD that translates the on screen text (there's a good deal of it) which passed before my eyes only in Chinese.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a Chinese, I really can't believe this movie is on the top 250 list! This is one of the most superficial movies I have ever seen. The nationalism dialog and the detract of Japanese and the unrealistic display of Kung Fu is almost a joke. I voted for 1 not only because it's a bad movie, but also for a protest. I cant this one can have a higher score of the real masterpieces of Chinese movie. This is UNBELIEVABLE! For those who interested in Chinese movie, I recommend Zhang Yimou's 'Lifetimes Living', Kaige Chen's 'Farewell My Concubine' and Jiang Wen's 'Devils on the Doorstep'. These are all masterpieces, revealing the real mental attitude of Chinese people and the historical appearance of Chinese society. For those who interested in Kung Fu movie, Jackie Chan is better, Bruce Lee is always good. All in all, FORGET THIS ONE!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Yen great dignity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In FoShan, southern China, Master Liu challenges Ip Man (Donnie Yen) and gets beaten. Ip Man promises to keep it private but loudmouthed Yuan tells everyone. Jin from the north challenges every master in FoShan. He wins in every match except for Ip Man. In 1937, war starts between Japan and China. Ip Man loses everything. Japanese General Miura has organized fight tournaments. Yuan's older brother Lin is killed. Ip Man fights to avenge his death. Meanwhile, Jin leads his bandits including Yuan. They steal from Ip Man's friend Zhou Qingquan.The start is well-done kung fu movie and a good solid story. Donnie Yen has great dignity. The movie is essentially extended into two parts. The war scrambles everybody and everything. The second part is also good. It introduces whole new villains. I would have preferred having two separate movies. The fight action is fun, and energetic. This is a solid kung fu action movie.</fullReview>

The fight scenes were great, but the best part of each movie was the individual themes that teaches a moral lesson. All of Ip Man's sequels were fun to watch and to learn the meaningful themes at the end.I do not care if people hated this movie or gave horrible comments on it. I also do not care if people loved it or gave wonderful comments on it. It's my sincere opinion to say that this movie is WORTH WATCHING IN A LIFETIME (whether you like it or not), I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Highs: Incredibly thrilling. I went to see Ip Man with high expectations, with it being Donnie Yen and Sammo Hung and all, and I was blown away by the fantastic choreography, the thrilling speed and skill shown by the fighters, and the superbly portrayed antagonist and protagonist. Lows: It is a bit of a propaganda film, but it's Chinese and takes place in WW2. We have all sorts of acclaimed propaganda films in America too, like Saving Private Ryan, Zero Dark Thirty, etc. There's zero issues with the portrayal of Japan in this case, since it's a war film.Verdict: Go see it. It's an R-rated movie, but a tame one at that.Some scenes might be a bit hard to stomach though, because the violence does get a bit gruesome (bones breaking, pools of blood, etc.) but nowhere near many other R-films I have watched.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never heard about "Ip Man" before, so I didn't have any expectations what so ever. Initially I thought it would be yet another generic, martial arts movie about some protagonist fighting to regain his honor, that for some reason have been lost. Well, was I in for a surprise. The Chinese city of Foshan was widely known for its many martial arts schools, all lead by Masters of their own specific branch of Kung-Fu. One day a band of southerners come into Foshan to establish a school of their own, and to build a reputation for themselves their leader Jin sets out to beat each and every Master in town. But when faced by Master Ip, the invaders are forced to leave the city, they are no match for Master Ip and his mighty Whig Chun Kung-Fu. Years before the outbreak of the second world war, Japanese troops invade parts of china, the city of Foshan is subjected to genocide and starvation, and Master Ip is forces to live a cumbersome existence with his wife and young child. To support his family, Master Ip is forced to work at the coal-mines, but one day Japanese troops show up, searching for anybody who is willing to fight for food, in the arena against Japanese martial artist. The Japanese general Muira soon realizes what great skills Master Ip possesses, and wants him to train his soldiers. When Master Ip refuses to follow the Japanese command, he is now forced to escape the occupied city, but not before facing off against general Muira himself.I was genuinely surprised by this movie. The fighting was beautiful and art-like, and never "over the top". The story line had much more to it, and definitely more than I expected for a martial arts film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ip Man can easily say that it is the greatest true Kung Fu movie ever. It feels as if you are watching some sort of machine take down every opponent in a brutal fashion. It has got some Mortal Kombat vibes about it, but even so, that makes it all the more fun. It's also history based, even though I am rusty on my Japanese-Chinese invasion knowledge, it felt as if it bought some authenticity and realism into the film.Ip Man may be a film you put off, but if you get the chance to watch it, you will defiantly savor the good taste it leaves in your mouth.

		<shortDescription>Impressive storyline and stunning fight scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a biopic about Ip Man, the most influential master of the Wing Chun martial art. This is one of the few martial arts movies where I was actually impressed by the storyline. It's not the first time a World War II setting was used for a martial arts movie, since the Jet Li movies "Fist of Legend" and "Born to Defend" were also set during World War II. However, the plots in those movies were essentially the same old revenge story lines, which Ip Man most certainly is not. This movie is rather about a martial artist just trying to scrape a living in a time of war and poverty, like how "The Cinderella Man" was about a boxer trying to make a living during the Great Depression.On top of the very good storyline, the fight scenes are also very impressive, so much so that it inspired me to start taking Wing Chun classes again (I went once before but didn't return until last week). The weird thing is that I found out that our local Wing Chun sifu (master) had trained under Ip Man's son and was one of the choreographers for the movie. It turns out that was the main reason why a lot of his other students joined his classes, although I had no idea about this myself.As for the performances, Donnie Yen is clearly the star of the show. It's nice to see him finally getting such a major role, which he has performed brilliantly, not only in the incredible fight scenes but also in his subtle portrayal of Ip Man's struggles. The supporting cast also gave memorable performances, particularly Lynn Hung as his wife Yong Cheng, Lam Ka-Tung as Inspector Li Zhao, Xing Yu as Lin, Siu-Wong as Jin Shan Zhao, and Hiroyuki Ikeuchi as General Miura.My only criticisms against this movie is that the last one-third of the movie was largely fictionalized, the final showdown itself felt a bit anti-climatic in comparison to the more exciting earlier fight scenes, and the finale came off as somewhat melodramatic. Other than that, this film is a must-see for all martial arts movie fans.8/10</fullReview>

I guess if you have the uncanny ability to turn your brain off and get a chubby over the fight scenes, this "film" would appeal to you. But that's all it is, fight after fight loosely stringed together by a paper thin plot. Everyones motivation for fighting seems to be because they want to be " number one." It looks like crap, the acting is super crap (incredibly over the top), and it's poorly written, if written at all. As my friend said, "films" like these are more kin to porn than anything else, it's not so much what it's about that matters. If you like this movie, please be honest as to why, you like it cause the juvenile in you gets a hard on when you see someone being bad ass. please don't try to pass this off on me as art, or true film, because it's not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best martial arts movie of all time?!?!?!?!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cover boasts "Best martial arts movie of all time. Hands down!" With an 8.1 IMDb rating and an engaging, plausible-sounding, story line of martial arts'-based resistance to 1930s Japanese imperialism, I figure this film is certainly worth a try. Especially since I have long practiced, respected and enjoyed martial arts, and the film claims to be based on the true story.But how does any being of normal intelligence even sit through this movie, let alone sign on to IMDb and rate it a 8, 9 or 10??? Dimwitted, implausible story; and dimwitted, implausible characters. If in fact this film were representative of any martial arts code or practtioner behavior, that would be the end of martial arts. Every protagonist in the film is dead set on maiming or murdering each other -- and themselves! If in fact this film is even close to among the best martial arts movies now or ever, "martial arts" must be the most scum-ridden, unctuous backwater of film making that has ever existed -- a "genre" (if we can call it that) which makes XXX features high literature by comparison.It's certainly the last such movie I'll ever watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ip Man is a heavily fictionalised biopic of the founder of Wing Chun style of Kung Fu and someone who went on to become a mentor to Bruce Lee.Ip man is a wealthy family man in 1930s China and a reluctant teacher who we see initially combat with his fellow martial art masters from rival schools who want to see for themselves how they are in comparison.When a rival bully from the north turns up and beats up all the kung fu masters in the town, it is left to Ip man to defend the town's honour as he humiliates the upstart who wants to start his own rival martial arts school.Once the Japanese invade China, Ip man descends into poverty especially when his wife becomes ill. He gets a labouring job and finds out that other kung fu masters are getting involved in duels with the Japanese platoon for an extra bag of rice. Ip man angrily takes on 10 Japanese soldiers and beats them up when he finds out that one of the kung fu masters was shot dead by one of the soldiers.This display puts him in a collision course with General Miura, the Japanese's top exponent of karate and the man who organises the combat bouts with the Chinese kung fu masters and wants to prove himself against Ip man.The film is certainly well made with good production values and art direction. The martial arts does not have the over the top choreography and wire work of many other recent Chinese or Hong Kong films.There are some references to the Bruce Lee action films such as teaching the factory workers to fight in order to defend themselves against the same bully who beat up all the other kung fu masters.The film is certainly restrained and lacks the histrionics of other martial art films, even General Miura is portrayed as more honourable than the other Japanese officers.However it is not a true story. The real Ip man was an opium addict and plagued with money problems.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Goofy Kung Fu Movie with Plenty of Substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ip Man follows a man, called Ip Man, who becomes a prodigy of kung fu and lives life. And that's about it. Looking back on this movie anything that resembles an actual plot doesn't start until the third act, and I'd be better off not spoiling it. It's interesting actually how this movie progresses. The first act is a goofy kung fu movie. It introduced the audience to the characters in a fun way, and really manages to make you care about and like them. The second act is a goofy kung fu movie with a cheesy romance. Considering how light-hearted the movie has been up until this point, it really doesn't feel out of place. It offers up a handful of laughs and more development of the characters and their relationships. The third act is more of a dark but still goofy kung fu movie. The tone transitions almost seamlessly, and the fights become less fun to watch and more intense thanks to what is now threatening the characters. It still manages to pull off a few goofy moments in the fights, but overall it's pretty serious. Yet somehow it still doesn't feel out of place. Nothing about this movie does, really. The fights are, as expected, amazing. The choreography is fantastic, and all of them are loads of fun to watch. While some of them were a little forced at times, it was always a pleasure to see these guys duke it out. My only real complaint would probably be with the characters, but even then they weren't bad by any standard. I still cared about them and liked them, but they just didn't stand out a whole lotOverall Ip Man is great. Each act offers something new to the movie, yet nothing feels out of place, and all the fights are fantastic. While the characters aren't developed incredibly well, everything else is. In the end I would recommend this movie.</fullReview>

Yip Man would go on to influence millions through the spread of Wing Chun and his early teaching of influential martial arts star and icon Bruce Lee. The story is set in Foshan and is seen as a hub for Chinese martial arts.Yip Man is a respected martial arts master but doesn't have a school or teach. He runs off a group of rowdy Northern Chinese stylists though. Yip Man is a wealthy man but reduced to poverty by the occupation of the Japanese Army. He ends up working in a coal mine and only fights against Japanese opponents when he realizes that some of his neighbors have been taking fights against Imperial Japanese Army trainees for an extra rice ration.It's extremely patriotic, almost to the detriment of the film itself. The Japanese are virtually faceless, depicted mainly as bullies, war mongers, and instigators while 1994's Fist of Legend, a very similar film, does the Japanese some credit by showing them with more honor.Still some incredible fight scenes by the venerable Donnie Yen, who at was then 44-45 makes guys like a prime Van Damme or Seagal look pedestrian by comparison, witnessed in a brutal match with Yip Man against 10 karate practitioners. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fantastic martial arts movie, good-to-OK drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must have had a different experience than a large number of people who have seen Ip Man, since I came to the film about eight years after its release in China, and three years after I saw a very different film about the Ip (or Yip) Man, Wong Kar Wai's The Grandmaster. That film has some of the same characters, and its unavoidable to not have some of the same beats in the story (that Yip Man is already a master martial artist, and also a father and husband, but his life is turned upside down with the invasion of Japanese forces in the late 30's), but the style is far away from this film.Where Wong is someone totally interested in visual effects - how rain will fall on characters, how movement goes from slow motion to quicker motion and how to change things like shutter speeds with the camera - Wilson Yip (any relation to the real guy I wonder) is out to just make an entertaining, mainstream movie that is very much for Chinese audiences. Where one film is more of a mood pieces, albeit with some intense action, this is all about telling one part of the Ip Man's story, and it's all the better for it.I also knew actually that this film wouldn't really be able to cover all of the events since its now over three movies (sequels in 2010 and 2015). These events are all about Ip Man's time as a teacher of his own form of martial arts - which he tries to say, in his usual humble way, is not too different from other martial artists, though of course it's the teacher and students who learn from him who are of a higher order - and those Japanese invasion events.The strongest part story-wise is that it took a direction I wasn't so much expecting; in the first half hour, when things are relatively OK for Yip Man (played with confidence and a great way into this naturally heroic person by Donnie Yen), he seems almost *too* perfect in a way. It's like, can a guy be any more of a full-blown leader and good-hearted and kind but firm and un-shakable human being? Here's a guy who's only fault is, maybe once or twice, he doesn't look at his kids drawings, or he might, maybe, break a chair or something when a challenger comes calling for a fight.But when Ip Man and his family are put out on the street and, like everyone else in their Fu Shan village, are starving and just trying to get by the day to day, he's no longer a teacher but another survivor, and, as a greater conflict, is up against the repressive Japanese military who want to see him fight. How this happens are parts of the story I'll leave for you to find out, but suffice it to say it's one of those tales where a hero is established early on, then taken down a peg due to exterior circumstances (the fall of a village, of a people, oppression and so on), and he has to rise back up to meet the challenge set to him.Now some of this drama is acted with just enough conviction to get by, no more no less, and yet that's not exactly the reason to see the movie. I appreciated that the filmmakers kept things period-correct and used the real-life, tumultuous history in keeping with the protagonist and his adversaries (maybe my favorite character is the Chinese interpreter who Yip Man thinks for a while as a traitor, but the guy is just trying to get by like everyone else and pays dearly for just being near the Japanese for too long). The reason to see the movie is for the martial arts, and it's damn impressive; Sammo Hung does the choreography here, and he stages fights so that there is an ecstatic flow to things - it's not a rush into one thing or another, pieces build and we see a continuity with how Yip Man defends himself and/or fights his opponents. And when Yip Man gets angry in a fight (or just a little more aggressive) watch out because Yen definitely brings it.It may not be some masterpiece or anything, and it may rely a little too much (especially near the end) as a piece for its Chinese audiences to lap up more than for a worldwide one (and of course the Bruce Lee trivia is put in there because how can it not be), it's a highly entertaining spectacle that has light moments that work and dramatic parts that are never unsatisfying. It's loaded with well-shot action and if you like kung-fu/martial arts its basically a must-see, maybe only a notch below the likes of 36th Chamber of Shaolin or Five Fingers of Death in terms of the 'Holy S***' aspect of the choreography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtle Donnie Yen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>He was quite subtle in his way of portraying Ip Man, the now famous Wing Chun Grandmaster. He even had the skills to portray him convincingly when it came to Martial Arts. Wing Chun is a hard style to master, it takes a long time to master it. But under Ip Chun's training Donnie Yen was able to be skilled enough to make us look in awe at his dexterity, speed and efficiency. I found his acting to be as good as his martial skills. Combined with Sammo Hung's choreography it made for one of the most memorable fights to be put on film. Sammo Hung is by no means Jackie Chan when it comes to choreography, but it was still extravagant and awe inspiring. Even jaw-dropping at some points. I often found Sammo Hung's choreography to be more elegant than Jackie Chan's.But anyway, it is one those typical Chinese movies where a grandmaster is praised, there is Chinese patriotism, most foreigners are brutes and oppressive of the Chinese, stealing their livelihood. Quite typical of big budget Chinese movies, it has been seen many times. Especially in the mid and late 2000's. I often find it annoying, usually leading to I give the movie a low or average rating. But I found 'Ip Man' to be above-average, mostly to do with Donnie Yen and and Sammo Hung's choreography. I didn't find the plot or story that interesting, I was simply interested in the fights and it didn't disappoint. A similar movie would be 'Fearless'. Legendary grandmaster, oppressive foreigners, Chinese patriotism and some Taoism. Although their main themes are different, where the main character of 'Fearless' starts as arrogant and become humble, Ip Man is a rock who stays the same from start to finish. But both movies encourage humility and benevolence. Just delivered differently. Also 'Fearless' is more high flying whereas 'Ip Man' is more "down-to-earth".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A semi-biographical account of Yip Man (Donnie Yen), the first martial arts master to teach the Chinese martial art of Wing Chun.Outside of martial arts fans, the name "Ip Man" may not mean much to Americans. In fact, the title sounds silly, as though this was a superhero alongside Batman and Superman. But perhaps this is a sign that the film's time has come: more people, including Americans, ought to know about this martial arts legend, the man who trained Bruce Lee.Derek Elley of Variety Magazine wrote in his review, "Yen, who's taking on real star charisma in middle age, is aces as Ip, with a simple dignity that exactly mirrors the movie's own and a gracefulness in combat that's very different from his trademark whiplash style." Elley is exactly right. Donnie Yen is really making a name for himself with the "Ip Man" films and is now a very marketable entity. Few martial arts stars today can claim similar status.</fullReview>

But when the Japanese occupy his hometown of Foshan during the Sino-Japan war (1937), Ip, like the rest of the locals, is forced into hard labor and brutal sparring matches for the enemy's amusement. His incredible skills catch the eye of the Japanese Colonel, Mr. Miura, who wants Ip to teach Wing Chun to his soldiers. When Ip refuses, he faces the most intense challenge to both his training and his honor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ip Man delivers the goods</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not expecting anything too special from "Ip Man" (2008). After watching countless martial arts movies with Steven Seagal and JCVD, I was convinced that this genre could not offer anything new except a worn out formula plot and some special effects-generated martial arts sequences. After all, Steven Seagal movies are not creating the same kind of buzz that they did when "Under Siege" was in theatres.Yet what a difference good acting, a fine script, and a great soundtrack makes. Donnie Yen (who plays the martial arts master Ip Man) is not only very good at martial arts, but he is also a brilliant actor. Yen delivers a completely believable performance as the martial arts master who loves his family and lives his life according to Confucian principles, but then becomes so enraged by Japan's wartime atrocities in the late 1930s that he takes revenge against the Japanese. In addition, Yen is joined by other actors who are just as talented, such as Hiroyuki Ikeuchi as the malevolent Japanese general Miura (who grudgingly admires Ip Man) and Tenma Shibuya as his sadistic, cowardly sidekick Colonel Sato (who, in my opinion, is an even nastier villain than the general).The plot in many ways resembles past martial arts movies, but also contains several fresh elements. To begin, "Ip Man" focuses considerable attention on human nature, including Ip Man's close relationship with his family and friends. As a result, the characters in "Ip Man" come across as multidimensional and authentic human beings rather than as cardboard personalities. We even end up caring for the characters in "Ip Man," which is why we understand Ip Man's feelings of rage against the Japanese (for killing a few of his friends). This movie also features a big fight right at the end. I have big fights before in the Rocky movies, the Karate Kid trilogy, and the Bloodsport films, but this one is more exciting than all them. I think part of the reason why is because this movie achieves the rare effect of making us understand why the big fight at the end matters so much to Ip Man and his arch nemesis General Miura. Lastly "Ip Man," in addition to being great entertainment, is also a nationalist picture and arguably anti-Japanese. The first scenes with the Japanese are deliberately manipulative. The Japanese soldiers' faces are not shown as they shoot down unarmed Chinese civilians. Yet crucially the faces of the victims are in full view. Scenes like these are designed to make the audience sympathize with the Chinese, while viewing the Japanese soldiers as less than human. Another scene with strong nationalist connotations shows Ip Man telling General Miura defiantly, "I'm just a Chinese man." A loud drum beat is heard in the background to emphasize this reply as simultaneously an act of defiance and national affirmation. Yet although Chinese nationalism and anti-Japanese bias are fully exploited here, these elements do not undercut the film. Only right at the end, when the narrator's words are beamed on the screen, does the nationalist propaganda truly get silly -- though fortunately those sequences are in the last two minutes of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Yip Man" (2008) is a mix of biopic and martial arts movie. It has some drama, but nothing really deep or unforgettable. It has cool fighting scenes, great art direction, nice acting. The movie looks beautifully, the set decorations are very good. The story, based on the life of real Yip Man, master of Bruce Lee, is involving and sometimes touching, although i believe it was all like this in real life, i do believe it's based on many real events, but certainly they haven't fight like this in that time or place.Overall, "Yip Man" is enjoyable cross of biopic set in WW2 times, with some greatly choreographed fight scenes, great art direction, nice acting. It's a big predictable at times, but nevertheless i was involved during whole movie.</fullReview>

If you belong to a different group, like myself, who have never met with quality movie of this kind, then this movie you must see, because you will change your mind and will make you fall in love with him. The story follows Ip Man, the kung fu master, who is said to be the best fighter in the city of Foshan, which is known for Kung Fu schools. Yet despite the good reputation and excellent skills, Ip Man does not want to open a school, but gladly accepts private challenges of other teachers. In the background the movie's Japanese cruelty towards China in World War II. We can see how difficult life led during the occupation, and how they treated them. The best part of the movie are the fight. They are well done. They are fast, interesting and breathtaking. No part of the film is not boring. I enjoyed every minute, and passed me very quickly. Great movie which I recommend to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A martial arts movie you can take serious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When rating a "10" for a movie there needs to be some careful consideration before haphazardly telling everyone "Oh man! That movie was TEN!" Quickly rating every movie you see as a 10 diminishes its value. A 10 means it is a movie that should be original or has an original take on a story, good cinematography, directing, casting, storyline, editing, music, etc. It should be a movie that makes you think/reflect or perhaps learn more about the depicted topic or story. Overall an excellent combinations of parts that come together to produce an amazing whole. It is actually a rare thing in Hollywood.In the category of martial arts movies there is no shortage of bad cheesy forgettable (or memorable for the wrong reasons) over-the-top flicks that quickly fade into history. IP Man actually breaks away from the norm. This is a martial arts movie that can be taken serious. There are no Chinese people running on top of trees or obviously hooked up to wires. It is loosely a biographical story on the life of Yip Man (who later trained renowned Bruce Lee). It takes place in a real world setting of China in 1930's during the Japanese occupation prior to the break out of WWII. IMDb sums up the plot nicely with, "In 1935 in Foshan, south China, there are martial arts schools on every street corner. Ip Man is the undisputed martial arts champion, yet he has not devoted himself to teaching. Despite this, it seems that all the kung fu masters of the city are eager to fight him to improve their reputation. Written by Riccardo Amadori" Added to that the Japanese invade causing a depression upon the town. Yip's grand estate is taken from him and he, his wife and child must move to more humble means. During this time, he along with many other towns' people are driven to slave labor in order to survive. The head Japanese commandant, Colonel Sato, has competitions amongst the Chinese and the Japanese. If the Chinese win they get a bag of rice. Yip initially refuses to fight; however a bad incident in one of the challenges causes Yip to get angry and request to fight. He then takes on 10 Japanese and of course beats them all. Since the commandant considers himself to be the best he is intrigued by Yip's win and from then on wishes to challenge him. Yip continues to refuse, but is eventually captured, which leads up to the climax of Yip vs. Sato. This was a really well executed ending. The choreography was amazing and I found my heart racing fast during this epic scene where Yip totally schools this Japanese colonel. This is definitely a scene that is worth repeating and for watching the whole movie to see.The actor, Donnie Yen, does a superb job of playing the title character. The character is not running around with his shirt off to show muscles or acting cocky in hopes to start a fight. He is an unassuming kind modest man that at first you would not think to be a grand master of Wing Chun. Donnie Yen's own skill shines through the character.Though the movie is entirely in Chinese and must be read with subtitles, you quickly forget that you are reading it since the story, choreography, action, and cinematography is that good. Within the genre of martial arts movies, this has to be one of my personal favorite. I have watched it several times and have recommended it to many people who like martial arts movies or even if they don't, they may like it for the history and biographical sense and get to see some great actions scenes in between. I give this movie a 9.5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Makes Someone a True Grandmaster!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set during the early and late 1930s, 'Ip Man' is based on the eponymous Wing Chun master. It revolves around the life of Ip Man and his significance during the Sino-Japanese War. But more importantly, it deals with a man of honour who never forgets the importance of humility. For me, it is also about control, for that is what is most important when you want to channelize your strengths in the right direction.The movie has given the proper amount of attention where it's due. All the main elements have been duly emphasized and highlighted; the characterization, the superb fight scenes and the impactful dialogues married with eclectic musical score.I'm not an expert on Chinese movies and actors, but I don't know if anyone could do more justice to the role than Donnie Yen. And even if there is, I'm still more than satisfied with his portrayal of the protagonist.What I really loved is the contrasting characteristics of Ip Man and its impressive portrayal. For a person who is as proficient in martial arts as Ip Man, the master is as modest as anyone can be. Especially for a person who is hailed as the best of all masters in the region of Foshan, a hub of Southern Chinese martial arts clubs. We get to see this at the start of the movie when he defeats one Master Liu after the latter asks him for a practice session. After the duel, Master Ip Man promises to keep the result of the fight a secret but unfortunately a kid named Yuan who witnesses the fight, ruins it for Master Liu.As the story moves forward, we see how the leader of an out-of-towners group manages to challenge and beat all the masters of Foshan. All but one. When this person challenges Ip Man, we get to see the other side of him more clearly. From a calm, modest presence he transforms into a focused, determined and aggressive individual when in a duel, very much evident from his expression and approach. Let me take my sweet time to praise the absolutely amazing action! The fight scenes throughout the movie are very well crafted. An amazing amount of detailing has been done and we can see the huge amount of effort put in to perfect them, from the point of view of filming and getting them right by the actors. All I could think of is: Light Fast Blows!After the victory, he is all the more famous and respect for him among the people of Foshan has increased manyfold. But the pleasant atmosphere of Foshan soon changes as the inevitable happens. As Japan invades China, all hell breaks loose. The Japanese oppression has reached all corners of Foshan. No stone is left unturned. Ip Man loses his home and has to struggle for existence. A man who never worked a job in his life is compelled to do so for his family. While searching for a job he meets Chow Ching-chuen, an old friend whom he had lent some money to set up a cotton mill. Chow takes him to the mill and since he can't repay him, he considers Ip Man as a shareholder in his business, an idea he is reluctant to. When he asks him to join him for lunch, Ip Man makes an excuse that he is 'not free' and has to go back. When Chow's son asks him," Why didn't you ask uncle Ip to stay?", he replies (because)," He doesn't like to owe people favours." We see how Ip Man fights the odds and defends honour. Not just for him, but for his fellow Chinese brothers and sisters. He trains the mill workers to defend them from robbers, the same group of out-of-towners we saw previously. How the art of Wing Chun is important to him and for the Chinese spirit. We see how he emerges as the champion of hearts and the flag bearer of the Chinese freedom struggle from Foshan.This is a movie about honour and valour. It is about a one-man-army?who raises one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yip Man is without a doubt one of the most entertaining martial arts films I've ever seen. However, the immense level of entertainment is not the only great thing about this film. The cinematography of the film was one thing I took great notice to. It's beautiful, elegant, and worthy of being compared to the cinematography of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", "Hero", and "House of Flying Daggers".The film is pumped with great emotion and has the ability to infuriate and provoke emotion out of audiences, a quality that good dramas are glorified for. Yip Man is a film incorporating several classical techniques of film-making, one of them being the direct way of storytelling and the wonderful use of revenge as a theme - perhaps, the latter is not an aspect attributed directly to cinema, but is often used wonderfully in movies, too. The performances given by the actors are also appreciable.I found the scenes where the Chinese people communicated without hesitation despite one side speaking Cantonese and the other Mandarin to be quite amusing. I considered the seamless transitions to be a clever inside joke intended to pass unnoticed to general foreign audiences. Perhaps, it was a device to convey who was the foreigner in the situation, nonetheless, it was delightful.Yip Man is a great martial arts film. I recommend viewing it to anyone fond of martial arts cinema, or Hong-Kong cinema, or action movies in general. It is wildly entertaining and has a great story behind it, too.</fullReview>

Ip Man's personality is rather simple and often avoid troubles as possible. He has shown his moral values towards his friends and family which seems to promote the Chinese culture of respecting the elders and so forth.And to let the world know what is Wing Chun. Like the film, Ip Man do not accept disciples because he is afraid if people misuse his martial arts for the sake of getting into trouble and having fights which could damage his family name, master name and also reputation.This is a beautiful biopic film that one must watch!

		<fullReview>I have seen and enjoyed many, many martial arts film. However, I am not blind to the problems that have often plagued the genre. For every exceptional film (such as most of the Shaw Brothers films or the better films of Sonny Chiba) there are the god-awful ones--movies that are embarrassingly bad. In these bad films, you see horrible martial arts where blows barely come near their opponents or kicks that look like my grandmother was fighting! Heck, I even remember one film with gorillas doing kung fu--and they obviously were two guys wearing VERY cheap Halloween costumes! Because of the many bad films, it's a pleasure to see "Ip Man"--a film where the fighting is the most realistic you'll ever see. There is no 'wire fu' here--just fast and amazingly talented people making it look authentic.The film covers only a portion of Master Ip Man's life--mostly the 1930s--both before and during the Japanese occupation of his homeland. I read that MUCH liberty was taken with his life in the film--and I doubt if the guy really did half the things they show the actor (Donny Yen) playing him did! But, it is constantly entertaining and even uplifting. I am very sure that in China this film must have been a great source of pride--seeing Ip Man standing up to the murderous Japanese occupiers. A simply terrific film--and I challenge you to find one better! Because it is so good, I couldn't help but give this one a well-earned 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had very mixed feelings here. The visuals of Yip Man are very beautiful. The use of faded colours to make the film look aged has become really popular. The choreography of the various fight scenes are complex, fast, very fun to watch. I also love the epic music which is a kind of fusion of a classical orchestral score with elements of traditional Chinese music.This would all make Yip Man a good picture if it wasn't for the plot. Even without reading up on the real Yip Man's biography it's fairly easy to spot that some elements of the film are just bogus. This goes especially the second half's climatic centre piece: fierce competitions between Japanese and Chinese martial artists fighting for a bag of rice. On one side the Chinese are shown as dignified and brave despite their suffering with Yip Man's character standing out almost like a Messiah. The Japanese, on the other hand, are shown as worse than stereotypical. They are positively demonic. Their characters are almost ridiculously evil so that the film can end in the equivalent of a patriotic fanfare blast.After the very atmospheric first half I found this a bit disappointing. Several years and sequels later I wonder if the real Yip Man has finished turning over in his grave yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Greatest Martial Arts Film Of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martial arts in cinema generally have this tendency to go way over-the-top in its depiction. Some find that overly exaggerated action ridiculously fun while for others, it's plainly stupid. However, there are also a few examples out there that have captured this combat style in a very grounded manner while managing to stay within the laws of physics. And Ip Man is definitely one of those flicks.Ip Man is a semi-biographical account of the legendary Chinese martial artist Yip Man who popularised the Wing Chun fighting style but is best known around the world as the teacher of yet another Kung-fu legend, Bruce Lee. Set before &amp; during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the plot covers the change brought in the peaceful life of the grandmaster &amp; everyone around him in the city of Foshan after the Japanese invasion.Brilliantly directed by Wilson Yip, Ip Man is a highly character-driven story that's filled with some of the most amazing martial arts sequences ever put on the film canvas. It takes its action seriously, keeps it realistic to a considerable extent but also manages to mix a bit of humour in it, especially in the first half. One action scene definitely stands out &amp; you'll know which one I'm talking about once you've seen it yourself.The script may not be an entirely authentic account of the grandmaster's life but the artistic license taken for dramatic effect never really deviates from what it's all about. Camera-work is expertly carried out, Editing provides a frenzy pace to the whole narrative, background score is beautifully composed &amp; Donnie Yen is absolutely impeccable in the iconic role of Yip Man. In fact, of all the actors who've played that role before or after, he's the best at it.On an overall scale, Ip Man is one highly explosive, incredibly thrilling, wildly entertaining &amp; immensely satisfying cinema that's great enough to be ranked amongst the finest examples of its genre. It is wonderfully balanced in all departments of filmmaking, benefits hugely from Donnie Yen's committed performance &amp; features regular moments of action that don't end up making a complete joke of its sacred combat style. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not necessary a fan of kung fu movies . There is something about them that turns me off. So , I had my reservations about watching this movie. I'm happy that I was wrong. I had a good time . Fans of kung fu movies probably will be in heaven . Yet I recommend this movie to everyone who don't likes kung fu movies ? give it a try . You might be pleasantly surprised."Ip man" is based on real life story , yet I don't know how much of what I've seen is a product of imagination and how much of truth is here. In the end it doesn't really matter. I was afraid that "Ip man" will have a strong Chinese propaganda in it . Thankfully the movie is told in a universal way , so every viewer from around the world will be able to relate to the story.The fights look fantastic. The music is very epic at times . The acting is good. "Ip man" is an interesting mix of kung fu movie and war drama. There are good portions of humor and they are well placed ( the fight in the house) . The drama is also affecting . The main hero is mild mannered man , who uses violence only when necessary . He's a very sympathetic character."Ip man" is not necessarily my cup of tea , but it's a good movie. Watch it ? you won't regret it. After all this is a movie about a guy who was mentor of Bruce Lee. I give it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>well, at first i have to say that, this is my first review on IMDb.comIP MAN is a great movie from view of my thought. It is enjoyable from first to last. before watching it i thought it would be a boring one but, The story makes me wrong.you love action, you love drama. You should watch this. really, the more you go through the story, the more you like it.I like this movie for the great biography of Yip man. Sometimes You may have huge power to do anything you want but, you can never change someone's mind.those, who likes extreme action and use of deadly weapon, this is not a movie for them but, I think most of the people will like this film.English loving people may get bore for the foreign language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a friend of the movies like this, I have to say I enjoyed the movie very much. The tension and the fighting scenes in the movie are joy to watch. The war gives the movie it's own special look and nice difference to other martial art movies. Also the historical storytelling makes the movie feel more realistic and makes it easier to feel stronger reactions towards the Chinese. The downside of the film is the way Yip Man is made to be like a superhuman. At no part of the movie it is not hard to guess how the fights end up. Of course the praised hero of the movie cannot lose, can he? It can be seen that Wilson Yip have watched more than few Hollywood movies because some of the scenes have exactly this Hollywood hype feeling. Especially towards to an end. On the other hand this is how the best way to make sure the movie will become a hit and an audience magnet. Yip Man is a wonderful film to watch for the amusement. It might not give out deep thoughts but it works as a feature film to watch together with your friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>practically i didn't expect so much from this movie but after the watch i changed my opinions. the screenplay and the direction was good.making a biography with a good message in a simple way takes a lot of editing which has been done accurately and carefully up to the point and presenting the content of importance is appreciated. the war scenes and the visual effects have done it convincingly.the concept of a humble hero is very catchy . lack of replays or slow motions in the actions scenes, where the speed of martial arts is convincingly visible makes the movie more interesting after all its the biography of Bruce lee's master.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Martial Arts movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never heard about this movie before I watched it. It seemed to me, after watching the movie, that it has been made to uphold the sanctity of something so close to Chinese culture - the martial arts. The movie is poetic, with its main focus on the martial arts, though it carries historical events in the backdrop.The fighting sequences of the movie have been masterfully portrayed (the best I have ever scene) and Donnie Yen does complete justice to the role. The movie runs on simple themes of good vs evil, courage vs cowardice, cultural pride etc, drawn beautifully using cinematic art and technology. It moves you and leaves an indelible mark on your heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a fan of the action movies on martial arts made in the Far East. Neither am i derisive of the genre. This movie is verily the one that amazed me.It is one of the umpteen movies that has a storyline based on the ancient art of martial arts and yet has a simple plot based on real events.The movie portrays the life of Yip Man, the pioneer of the Chinese martial art of Wing Chun. The movie does have a fair amount of jaw-dropping fight scenes in which the opponents, whatever be their number, are annihilated by a noncommittal, deft moving, ambidextrous Yip Man. He salvages the pride of Fo Shan when the local patriarchs are defeated by outsiders. Yip Man lives a disciplined life in affluence until the Japanese invade China. He "fights" for survival and carries on his good deeds despite the struggle. He later proves to the Japanese that Wing Chun, which is Confucian in spirit is far better than the Japanese Kung Fu. The movie also has a wonderful background score by Kenji Kawai.A movie worth the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Easily one of my top 10 movies of all time. Though the movie is not entirely historically accurate, it certainly gives some insight on the Chinese perspective of the Japanese invasion and a little bit of Yip Man's life. Even though there is violence between the two nations, what is interesting is the exchange of martial arts and certainly a wonderful display of martial prowess. Being a Wing Chun Kung Fu practitioner, I find that Donnie Yen's training by Ip Chun is far more than adequate, leaning towards mastery. In the movie, Yen displays many advanced Wing Chun techniques, further inspiring me to continue my own training. It is an honor to train under the long/direct lineage of Wing Chun practitioners, such as Grand-master William Cheung and Sifu Eric Oram. It is somewhat discouraging, being also a karate practitioner, to see some codes of conduct being broken, though the movie displays a great level of discipline from most of the karate-do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ip man is the biography of Bruce Lee's martial arts master Yip Man. It begins in Foshan in the 1930s. He is a rich man of leisure obsessed with the Wing Chun fighting style and trains endlessly, causing resentment from his wife and karate competitors. In 1937 the Japanes take over and confiscate Yip Man's house and all his belongings. He is forced to labor in a mine and hears of matches with rewards of rice for the hungry winners. After a friend disappears, he demands a fight against ten men and defeats all of them.Ip Man beats all comers and eventually must fight a Japanese general and this leads to a Rocky like finish at an outdoor stage. The scene is well choreographed and realistic. The acting is excellent, so I can highly recommend this action thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now i feel ***Adrenaline rush***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i heard about the movie i knew only that it was some kind of action film and i had not seen action for a long time so i thought to give it a try. Most of the action movies fall in the scripts and characters. But Ip man is a remarkable achievement in story and obviously in action in which Chinese never find a hole. The action sequences seemed very genuine and most of the boys are fond of actions so needless to discuss about the action in the film. The most amazing feeling that i got was when in the credits part they told that it was based on the master of BRUCE LEE. The whole time i was having a feeling that this was definitely a film on some person and was considering it a normal but after knowing that he was the master of Bruce lee , the film got more respect.It analyzes the character of IP Man very nicely as to what i thought but some of the historical inaccuracies do were present which do make feel somewhat lower about the film. IP MAn was shown properly as a compassionate person of very high ideals who continued to live on his principles. He did what he could have done for his family. his family was also not neglected in any sense from the movie and did show for an appropriate time what his relationship was with his wife and son. Most of the movies crumbles at this at some time or the other. If they show family in the starting than they do not actually go in the depth of them. It is simple either show it properly or do not entirely rather than leaving a illegitimate plot. Ip Man succeeds in all the areas that the director intended to show.A must watch for people for a craziness for action that can make them feel alive again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You can't keep a good Ip Man down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Wilson Yip (Kill Zone, Flash Point), this is a rather fanciful biopic of Ip Man (played by Donnie Yen), the celebrated progenitor of Wing Chun who would eventually become sifu to the world's greatest martial arts star, Bruce Lee. Charting the events in his life that occurred before and during the Sino-Japanese war, the film sees the once prosperous martial artist and his family reduced to penniless, homeless beggars following the invasion of their home town of Foshan. However, when Japanese general Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi) challenges Ip Man to a fight, he gets a chance to fight for his honour, avenge his dead countrymen, and open a catering size can of whoop-ass on his oppressors!Ip Man is an extremely rose-tinted movie, as one might expect from a Chinese production about a national hero standing up against the tyranny of Japan, but despite its glaring nationalism and an economy with the facts, the film proves to be both a gripping drama and, of course, a bad-ass kung fu flick, with scene after scene of incredible bone-crunching mayhem. The hard-hitting close-quarter combat is brilliantly choreographed by Sammo Hung and flawlessly performed by Yen and his co-stars, and although I've never been a fan of wire-work in a non-fantasy martial arts film (even less so in films based on historical fact), the occasional use of it here detracts very little from the overall effectiveness of the action scenes.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Martial Arts Master becomes a Teacher and Upholds the Dignity of his Culture...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here in the States, as in many other places, if you have knowledge that enables you to hurt someone efficiently while you yourself remain relatively unharmed, you are considered someone who really knows something. Compared with growing crops or domesticating animals for the dinner table, or designing clothes or building appropriate shelters that can withstand the challenge of the elements, the ability to hurt or maim others seems to have dubious value. However, there have been cases in History where this ability has come in handy against mad dogs, wild animals and the crazed in their campaign to victimize others.Truth be told, fighting for its own sake has always bored me, as there are other subjects and activities that more easily bring joy to the user and even generate experiences and products that others can easily enjoy. Hunting I understand, as you have to have something to eat, and self preservation against armed interlopers needs no explanation. Contest is built into the warp and woof of this universe, and I once read somewhere that Life is essentially a war between spirit and matter. A sobering thought that few would take umbrage with.The reason I like 'IP MAN' so much is because I feel it is a more accurate reflection of the true oriental mind. The exposition of the film has an almost Edenic quality to it as a martial arts master comes to visit another. Ip Man receives his guest with warm courtesy and civility. He offers his guest tea and something to eat even though it is obvious that his visitor has come to test his martial arts skills against him and would like to get on with it. There is no anger or rancor in either man. The visitor finds the tea quite good and nods to Ip Man's wife when he is offered a sweet. I believe Ip Man's son darts in and out from time to time. At this point, Ip Man and his friend are like two college professors enjoying each other's company. Outside a kite is floating in the breeze until it eventually gets caught in a tree.When the light repast is finished, the chairs are removed to the far sides of the room and the masters bow to each other. The time has come to compare techniques and review their understanding. The sparring lasts for a few minutes and the masters are careful not to break the furniture. It is obvious at this point that Ip Man holds the ascendancy, but at no point do we feel he is out to take the other man's dignity. When the sparring is done, both cheerfully bow and the visiting master exclaims that he has learned a lot. One has the impression that he will hasten to take what he has learned and share it with his students as he runs his own school.So much for the visiting martial arts master seeking counsel from a recognized expert. While they were sparring, a young man climbed into the tree to get his kite back and witnessed the entire affair. He can't wait to run back and tell his friends how Ip Man 'wiped the floor' with their master!This beginning scene hooked me on the movie. The idea that there could be a civilization where people could share ideas and knowledge without inferring 'superior' or 'inferior' status in a demeaning way was a tantalizing point plot. I could imagine Ip Man visiting the martial arts school master one day to share a new technique he had just discovered and being similarly enlightened by his friend's growing body of knowledge.Anyway, excuse this digression into Shangri-La. This opening scene makes this a different martial arts movie all together for me. It is less about martial prowess and its honor and glory and gives a substantial nod to the values of family and community. The scene where Ip Man teaches a group of factory workers techniques so that they can defend themselves from the extortion of a gang of martial artists is a revelation in and of itself. It reminds one that in many cases,the martial arts is the product of a people of smaller physical stature who wanted to end victimizing conflicts quickly and to the result of overcoming possible oppressions.Director Wilson Yip has a gem on his hands that compares favorably to the 'ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA' Trilogy and is a quantum leap beyond the revenge aesthetic of 'THE Chinese CONNECTION' or 'FIST OF FURY'! Donnie Yen's Ip Man reminds me of some of the teachers I have studied under. They could be cheerful and yet firm and were not somebody you wanted to mess around with.I think this film brings one a step further into the Soul of the Martial Arts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Historical Epic Delivers Grand Fight Scenes, But Lacks a Second Gear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A beautiful, if redundant, Chinese martial arts epic set at the onset of the second Sino-Japanese war. The eponymous focal figure Ip Man, drawn straight out of the history books, is the peaceful model of restraint and self-control. His easy smile, passive existence and unmatched skills make him very easy to pull for, especially when a trying second act pushes him past the breaking point, but the flick's deep reverence for his legacy strips away any chances at suspense or tension. Though gorgeously choreographed and filmed, the major fight scenes are universally one-sided, with Ip himself rarely absorbing more than a few glancing blows on his way to flashily disarming and dispensing each opponent. Even his last foe, a towering Japanese army general who effortlessly conquers three of Ip's peers at once, leaves behind little more than a cloud of dust and a disappointed, unspoken "is that it?" when he quietly takes a knee. Undoubtedly a feast for the eyes, the road it walks is too straight and narrow to be considered anything more substantial.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great action, simple story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd heard a lot about Ip Man before finally watching it, and I think I was a bit biased by expectations though I tried to watch it objectively. I can understand why the movie was as popular as it was. It's a tale of a real-life hero and features incredible martial arts choreography. Wing Chun, a seemingly defense-oriented style of kungfu, is amazing to behold, and surprisingly, I don't recall ever seeing it on screen before this movie. The movie's two action choreographers - one of whom is Sammo Hung - took home the awards in that category in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The story, unfortunately, I found a bit too simple and bordering on hokey. Ip Man kicks butt, rallies the Chinese people, the end. I would've like to see some kind of background on him. He just simply exists and is a rich kungfu master with a wife and kid, or rather with a family that can be used against him to force him to fight. There's really not much else to his family. Or to him, for that matter. Donnie Yen seems perfect for the role. He looks like a perfectly charming, non-threatening fellow, until you get him to fight and then you're on the floor with your nose bleeding the next second. He's also capable of looking as though in profound thought, even when there's nothing much to think about. Watching brilliant kungfu thrills me as much as the next guy but I'd prefer to watch it either in an all-out action movie with a throwaway plot or as a masterpiece of direction with an engaging story to boot. Ip Man is the latter with a story that doesn't work for me, sadly. As such, I'm not too enthused about catching its sequel or unofficial prequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donny Yen in his defining role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie won the prestigious Hong Kong academy award of 2009. Donny Yen was nominated for the award as the leading actor, and so has Wilson Yip as its director.The year is 1935, in the Chinese town of Fo Shan, there are many martial arts schools. Owner of one of the school master Liu (Chen Zhihui) challenges Ip Man (Donny Yen) to a match. Liu was no match for Ip, but asks him to keep things quiet. Ip assures Liu that no one will hear about it. But Yuan (Wong You-nam) who was climbing a tree to recover his kite was watching the match and spreads the word. Ashamed and furious Liu directs his anger towards Ip, but it soon becomes apparent that it was Yuan who spread the word. One day a martial artist named Jin (Fan Siu-wong) shows up and starts defeating all the school masters. He hears about Ip Man and challenges him. Ip is not interested but Jin tries to humiliate him. Ip's wife tells Ip to accept the challenge but don't break anything. Jin turns out to be no match for Ip either. After defeating Jin, Ip becomes somewhat of a home town celebrity, but dark clouds of war was forming. In 1938 the Japanese invaded Fo Shan, Ip's home was taken away from him, and he now had to make a meager living as a worker. Japanese soldiers shows up at Ip's work. They were recruiting sparring partners for Japanese soldiers. If they win, a bag of rice will be awarded. Ip's friend Lin (Xing Yu) volunteers. At the karate dojo, master Liu has defeated the Japanese soldier, and was returning with a bag of rice. General Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi) steps in and offers three vs one combat to show his skills. Lin and two other challenges, but they are no match for Miura. Lin persists on fighting, and gets killed by Miura. Following day, noticing that Lin is missing, Ip goes to the karate dojo. There he witnesses master Liu challenging three Japanese soldiers, and getting defeated. After he's lost, Liu is shot in the head and killed. Miura is furious that Sato (Shibuya Tenma) shot Liu and orders him not to use guns in the dojo ever again. Ip witnessing the murder, and sensing that Lin has been killed there also, challenges 10 Japanese and defeats them. Miura impressed asks Ip to come back again, and asks his name. Ip replies that he's not coming back, and he's just a Chinese man. But Li (Lam Ka-tung) who was interpreting, tells Miura that he will be back and his name is Yo Mon (Ip Man in Japanese).In the mean time, Jin who was defeated by Ip has turned into a bandit. Yuan has joined him also. Now they are terrorizing Ip's close friend Chow's (Simon Yam) factory. Chow asks Ip to teach kung fu to the workers for protection. Ip obliges, and the factory workers are now being trained in Wing Chun. Jin shows up to the factory again with his bandits, but this time he's met with workers trained in kung fu. Amongst them he sees Ip Man. He challenges Ip again, but loses. Japanese are now looking for Ip and Li is ordered to find him. They show up at the factory and offers him a position as an instructor. Ip refuses, but Li interprets to Miura that Ip is considering the offer, and wishes to challenge him. Miura accepts the challenge, and date is set for their match.The movie is almost tailor made for Donny Yen to star in. He even looks a bit like Ip Man himself. His martial art skills really shines in this movie. Portraying a calm and powerful master is spot on for his personality. This movie is made by seasoned staff, and the quality shows. Sammo Hung is the fight sequence choreographer. One honorable mention goes to the movie's producer Ramond Wong. He's been producing entertaining movies in Hong Kong for over a quarter century. This is his crowning achievement as well. While this movie was made in Chinese Hong Kong, and negative propaganda about communist China was omitted in the story, it was the Cultural Revolution and the Red Army that confiscated all of Ip Man's property in China, and forced him to relocate to Hong Kong in 1949.This is one of the best martial art movie to come out of Asia, and is recommended for viewing by action movie, and Asian movie fans alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a martial arts film with an emphasis on kick ass action scenes....but boy is it enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My colleague of mine recommended this film to me and no offence to him, but I was thinking 'hmmmm well I don't know if I really trust his judgement since he probably just likes all action no story'. But he kept telling me about it so I was like 'ok I'll check it out'.And boy am I glad I did. This has a story that also dwelves around history with the Chinese occupation of Japan. But at the heart of the story, the real message is to always remain true to yourself regardless of your circumstances. Donnie Yen playes a martial arts respected master in his community, known as Master Ip. He has a wife and a son and often has tons of challengers who come to fight with him.Sounds boring? Well it definitely isn't. Ip Man may at first look like a cheesy martial arts flick and while it has some of these elements, the character of Ipman is so likable and charismatic played wonderfully by Donnie Yen that you can't help but just respect him like he is some sort of noble wiseman. And the martial arts scenes are choreographed with such precision and excitement that you really just root for Ip man the whole way through.There is also a political message in regards to the occupation of China from the Japanese - the film I wouldn't say doesn't necessarily take sides, though obviously Ip man is the character you feel for and is Chinese so it didn't really bother me - it is based on events after all.All I can say is that I was blown away and the film kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through especially at the end. Ip Man is just a guy who values peace and dignity - he never once boasts or shows off - you just want him as your own master so you can learn some valuable lessons from him.While Crouching Tiger is still my favourite martial arts film, Ip Man is a masterpiece in its genre as well. And why am I even comparing them? They are two different movies in different styles. Just go out and see it - you won't regret it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, this is a MUST-SEE for any martial arts film lovers. The fight choreography is innovative and superbly executed. Sammo Hung choreographed and Donnie Yen performed. It really doesn't get much better than that. The fighting style was elegant yet realistic. Even if you know some of the moves must have been done with wire-work, it still doesn't take away from the sense of realism they try to give there. Acting was on par. Anyone familiar with Yen's previous world would find his turn as the soft-spoken master Ip a pleasant surprise. This role seems to fit him perfectly. I enjoyed the bits about Ip's family life in the beginning of the film.However, labeling this as "biopic" is a big misnomer for this film. All the events were too obviously dramatized. And my main issue with this movie is the story itself. It isn't much of anything new. It's quite a contrive plot line and became way too nationalistic (in a very trite, Hollywood way) at the end. Just overlook the weak and facile story line and you'll find a SUPERBLY entertaining movie. Besides, the action alone energized the genre and more than compensated for any defect. As a fan of this genre, I am compelled to give it a high score!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting the usual Hollywood Chinese martial arts movie, and boy was i mistaken! This movie had a great storyline and even better action scenes. It was a roller coaster of emotions, at times i had to hold back the tears. The action wasn't the usual cheesy fight scenes, the moves were unique and much more believable. The only reason why i didn't give it 10/10 was that some of the movie sets were pretty cheesy as you could tell that it was just the front wall of buildings and nothing behind them. However, because of storyline and acting i had to give it 9 to give it justice.This is a great movie if you have a spare 2 hours, besides it never felt like it was dragging on, was always so into the movie i never realised time flew by so fast. A definite must watch for any Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon fan!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This martial arts film tells the story of the life of Ip Man, the Chinese martial arts master who was an inspiration to, amongst others, Bruce Lee. A beautifully made film with some really excellent martial arts on show. The film concentrates on the years up to and including the Japanese occupation of China in the late 1930's.Ip Man is a master of the art of Wing Chun, a form of Kung Fu that was not generally accepted at the time. He practiced constantly and occasionally had duels with other masters. His wife disapproved of this and thinks he should spend more time with his son. He was quite well off and did not find it necessary to work for a living, but he is well respected for his talent amongst the townsfolk. When the Japanese invade they are thrown out of their comfortable home and forced to live in poverty. Having sold most of their possessions, Ip Man decides he must find a job. He works at a yard tipping coal and many of his friends find themselves there too. A Japanese General, Miura, is a fan of martial arts and wants to see if any of the Chinese masters can beat his Japanese trained fighters. Some volunteer to fight, including a friend of Ip Man. When his friend doesn't come back, Ip Man volunteers the next time. He defeats ten opponents and the General is impressed and he challenges Ip Man to a duel. Will he accept? Well, I'll leave you hanging there so as not to give away too much.I love the way this film is shot, beautifully colourful at the beginning and then very muted and grey once the Japanese arrive in the scene. Great performances all round, particularly from Donnie Yen as Ip Man and Simon Yam as Zhou Qing Quan. Although it's quite hard to judge a performance in a foreign language.The fighting scenes are all spectacular. Beautifully choreographed and expertly performed. I did find the plot a little contrived, but quite easy to follow and I even found a few glimmers of humour here and there. Over all, a pretty good watch that's great to look at with some excellent fight scenes, oh, and the music isn't too bad either? Recommended.My Score: 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ip Man is an excellent martial arts film that combines some of the best fight scenes on film with a great story that's involving, occasionally amusing, stirring, powerful, and true.&nbsp;The movie is split into two parts: the beginning, where we're introduced to Ip Man, his family, his city, and his style of martial arts, and the second half, which chronicles the struggles and hardship of the characters after the Japanese invasion of World War 2. The tone of both halves is very different, but they both work equally well. And there are lots of fantastic fight sequences in both, though those in the second half are for far higher stakes than those in the first.&nbsp;Great acting, beautiful sets, and perfectly suited music accompany the strong story and fight choreography. It's no exaggeration to say that it's really hard to find fault in this movie. If you're at all interested in martial arts or this period in China's history, see Ip Man as soon as possible.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not used to give movies a 10 rating often, but this is certainly going to be in my collection. This is a story of a saint in a time. Ip man was a true warrior in every sense as depicted. Martial arts was born only as defense and not to destroy any thing. In this movie we see many aspects of Ip man. He is humble, honest and fearless.When things not right he was ready to die for the honor of his country, now a days these saints are no more. I recommend this movie to be watched by everyone specially as a lesson to be given to children more than just telling them any moral story. Donnie Yen has metamorphosed the role of his life time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The little brother of Jet Li's masterpiece "Fearless"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a beautiful martial arts movie with stunning fight scenes that also features some historic drama elements and a slightly philosophical touch which creates a rather addicting potpourri. It's portrait of Chinese culture, pride and rebellion during the Japanese occupation and is starring an authentic and brave main hero and a couple of interesting characters like his proud wife, a brutal bandit who wants to become a martial arts legend or a traitor and translator who works with the Japanese and has some important inner struggles.Nevertheless, this movie is slightly overrated if you have seen the very similar but more emotional and profound "Fearless" by and with Jet Li a couple of years ago. Ip Man lacks of a profound story, aesthetic details and human passion that the other movie included. It's still an entertaining flick but has not many surprises, intense scenes or parts that may truly trouble you emotionally. You will basically watch this flick for its historic elements and its fight scenes while the acting and the story are rather mediocre after all.That's why this movie is not as brilliant as its reputation. If you're a fan of Asian martial arts movies, you shouldn't expect anything groundbreaking as there are many better classic and modern flicks of the genre. On the other side, for an occidental viewer, this is still an exotic movie that may grab your attention and that is at least worth a loan at your local shop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I thoroughly enjoyed watching Ip Man!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILER ALERT** Ip Man is a movie that was released in 2008, and has received 12 wins and 10 nominations on different film festivals and film awards. It was directed by Wilson Yip, who is also the man behind the films The White Dragon, Dragon Tiger gate, Flash point, Bio Zombie, and many more. The film stars Donnie Yen who is Ip Man, and other famous movie stars like Simon Yam, Lynn Hung, Hiroyuki Ikeuchi, Gordon Lam Ka-tung, and Fan Siu- Wong. The film is set in Fo Shan, China, in the 1930s, when martial arts was very popular in the area. The movie is very much about martial arts, and we see a lot of fights throughout the movie that illustrates why it is called an art form.It is a semi-biographical film, which means that it to some degree dramatizes the life of an actual person, in this case Ip Man (in reality Yip Man, who was the famous Bruce Lee's teacher, amongst others). It also has a lot of action, which obviously makes it an action movie also. There are also some parts of the movie are humoristic, but there is not enough humor in it to call it a comedy ? by far. The story builds up already from the beginning, when we see Ip Man fighting with Master Liu. It makes us know that this movie is going to be about a lot of fighting, and showing off martial art. The story always build up to some climaxes, like when Ip Man is fighting against ten people in the Japanese house; when the robbers come back to fight at the cotton mill the final time; and of course the "point of no return", when Ip Man wins the fight against the Japanese general.I felt that the music in the movie was varied. Some parts had typical Chinese music, while some had more of a western feel to it, like when Ip Man and Master Liu ate dinner in the beginning of the movie. There was one time in the movie where I felt that the sound editing was a bit off, and that was when Ip Man was fighting with a feather duster against Master Jin who had a sword, and the sound when they were fighting was the sound of metal-against-metal, although Ip Man's "weapon" was made of tree. But the audio editing the rest of the movie was really good, and I particularly liked the one time when Ip Man was fighting against Jin and Yuan at the cotton mill, and he hit Jin in the ear with a stick, and there was a sharp screech, like I was hit in the ear myself.I believe the movie also brings up morals throughout the story, and I think that there was one moral specifically stood out; the importance of being loyal to your family and country. One example is when Ip Man learns that the former Chinese police officer, Li Zhao, is now an interpreter and works for the Japanese. Ip Man smacks him in the face, because he is angry and disappointed that Li Zhao has betrayed his country, and refers to that he was watched his fellow countrymen get beaten to death in the fighting matches arranged by the Japanese general, and is on their side. I think this moral is also emphasized when Ip Man talks to Yuan after the fight at the cotton mill, and says "You are robbing the Chinese" and later "Everyone needs to find their own path", expressing that he is disappointed that he has chosen to go against his own people. And again the moral is highlighted at the end of the movie when the text tells that "Ip Man refused to be subjugated by the Japanese army, and used his fists to call forth the unity of the Chinese people." It shows that Ip Man would never betray his country, and would do whatever it takes to keep it united.Through all the things that happen in the movie, Ip Man always makes sure that his family is safe, and away from harm, for example when he makes his family move, because the Japanese might come back and get them. Family comes always first for Ip Man!I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. It offers good quality action scenes, with a lot of fighting that is not "over the top". It also follows a defined storyline, and builds up to several highlights. The movie also follow two different stories, the one with the robbers that is attacking the people working at the cotton mill, and the one with the Japanese army that has invaded China, which makes the movie varied and never boring. I can sincerely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys watching martial arts, or wants to watch an action movie. This movie will not let you down!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ip Man review (Contains spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ip Man (2008) Directed by Wilson Yip Mandarin Films Distribution Co.Ltd.Ip Man is in outstanding contribution to the Hong Kong martial arts genre. The film displays the amazing skills and finesse of Chinese martial arts during the 1930's and encapsulates a nations struggle against the oppression and occupation by the Japanese Imperial army. The importance of martial arts is highlighted throughout the film and is used as a beacon of unity and hope bringing the people together to fight back against the barbaric Japanese army.Ip Man was released on December 8th 2008 and is based on the life of the famous Wing Chun grandmaster Ip Man. The film begins with Ip Man as a successful and wealthy master of the martial art Wing Chun living in the southern Chinese city of Fo Shan famous for its martial arts schools and the story follows Ip Man from the early 1930's and the beginning of the second Sino- Japanese war up until the unconditional surrender of the Imperial Japanese army, August 15th, 1945. The film is loosely based on the life of Ip Man and the events that occurred before, during and after the invasion of the Japanese Imperial Army. The film is broken down into two parts, Ip man and his life before the invasion and his life after the invasion. The first part of the film offers an insight into the life of Ip Man, a local hero and famous Wing Chun Master living in a large residence with servants. Ip Mans Wing Chun is unbeatable and the first part of the film shows many a challenger being beaten with little effort. Ip man makes a special effort to not inflict too much pain and keep the challengers dignity intact. Ip man does not wish to hurt others and spends most of his time defending himself in each challenge. The values and beliefs of the Chinese people are an important part of the film and it shines through in the personality of the main Character, Ip man. He is a humble, modest, courteous and a respectful man never wanting anything from anyone and willing to help those that are in need. He treats each challenger with respect and courtesy never wishing to shame him by defeating him in front of others.The second part of the film offers a darker and more serious side. This part of the film is divided by a montage of death and destruction as the Japanese army invades China. The film shifts from showing us a wealthy, happy, joyful Ip man to a poor Ip man living in poverty struggling to provide for his family during the Japanese occupation. Ip man must pick up work to ensure the survival of his wife and son and ends up working in a coal mine with other martial arts students and teachers. It is here that he is introduced to a martial arts tournament hosted by the Japanese general Miura. At first Ip Man rejects the offer to fight for rice but once his friend is killed in the tournament by the General he becomes enraged and takes on ten Japanese soldiers at once. The Ip man that was before the occupation is no more and a different Ip man steps on to the fighting floor. A harden, angry Ip man quickly destroys the 10 Japanese soldiers with extreme force. The film ends with a showdown between the Japanese General Miura and Ip man surrounded by both Japanese soldiers and Chinese civilians. Ip man defeats the general soundly and is then shot in the shoulder by Miura's second in command Sato. Ip Man escapes to Hong Kong and in 1967 starts up the Wing Chun Athletic Association, and teaches one of the most famous kung fu legends of all time Bruce Lee.The film is an amazing display of Chinese martial arts talent. The fight scenes are incredible and offer a realistic feel unlike many Hong Kong martial arts films of the past. Ip Man offers the viewer a mix of well-choreographed martial arts fight scenes with a very distinct Chinese flavor with a western style action comedy that so many Hollywood films are famous for. The mix of Western and Chinese influences can be seen throughout the movie in not only the obvious places such as clothing, dialogue and action sequences but also in the portrayal of the characters themselves. The character of Ip man resembled your typical Hollywood action star, tough yet fair, funny yet serious. Throughout the film the viewer is treated to the delights of Chinese kung fu and the cheeky comedic humor of Hollywood films. Overall the film was a great martial arts film, not your typical over the top Chinese kung fu movie but a cautious mix of western and Chinese flavor. The fight scenes were outstanding and a must watch for not only martial arts film buffs but also all those that enjoy action, comedy films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film review of Yip Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the study week, I have re-watched a Chinese movie called Yip Man again. I think it is a film really worth watching and here is my film review about this movie.Yip Man is a Chinese film released at the summer of 2008. The leading actor is Donnie Yen who acts a Chinese Kung Fu master of Wing Chun. The film was directed by Wilson Yip and action director is Sammo Hung. The combination of these three people helps Yip Man to win the Hong Kong Film Awards Best Film in 2009. Yip Man is a Kung Fu movie which uses the history of Sino-Japanese war as background, and utilizes the changes of people's lives before and after the war as main line of the story. The story happens at Foshan in 1930, Yip Man, played by Hong Kong action star Donnie Yen is a martial master who only plays his art at home. Since one day, Master Liu comes to challenge him. He defeats the Master Liu without injury finally which make him famous in the Foshan. But the Sino-Japanese war begins, the Chinese people suffering bullying from the Japanese, including the Yip Man, the life of fellow of Guangzhou martial arts become harder and harder, a lot of martial arts become mine workers and many of them has become the slaves for Japanese martial arts training. The Chinese people have no the dignity and life in that case, the Yip Man has to come forward and defeat ten Japanese Samurais and three Japanese soldiers to defend the Chinese martial arts and his wife. Finally, he defeat the Japanese General in the contest to call on the Chinese people to unite to resist foreign invaders. This film is a Semi-Biography film. This film is based on a true story that shows audiences the real life of a Chinese martial art master. Yip Man is a real man in the real life, he was born in the year of 1893, and he learns Kung Fu from famous Master Chen at seven. When he grows up, Yip man creates special martial art which is called Wing Chun. During the Sino-Japanese war, he has to go to Hong Kong to teach Wing Chun, and then he has many apprentices, including the Kung Fu superstar Bruce Lee. This film introduced a part of Yip Man's early life. There are some real people or story about Yip Man in the film. For instance, Zhou Qingquan, the boss of yarn factory, he was real friend of Yip Man, and after Yip Man won the competition, Zhou Qingquan helped Yip Man move to Hong Kong. What's more, after Foshan was occupied by Japanese army, Yip Man becomes poor from rich because Japanese army took up his property. This movie is not only a semi-biography movie&#xff0c;but also is a Chinese Kung Fu action movie. The action director of this film is Sammo Hung, his design for these action scenes reflect in the change of rhythm directly. The comprehensive use various means including change of the camera position, use of speed camera and the selection of action points which make the Kung Fu scenes of this film to be the model of action film scenes. Coupled with strong specific actors, the 12 fight scenes throughout the film is very exciting and some of them have each style.For instance, at the opening, when Yip Man and Boxing Master Liu learn from each other in Yip Man's home, the space for moving and dodging is limited, and there is no danger of life and death. Therefore, Hung tends to focus on the details. Many false martial arts haven't point out, and there are only a little direct front performances, he emphasizes more on the characteristics of Wing Chun that shaking more than a dozen fists within the few seconds. I think the settlement of Hung make those fight scenes very interesting which can bring deep feelings to the audiences. The music of Yip Man makes a particular ambiance of the background in order to achieve visual and aural impression. The famous Japanese musician Kenji Kawai is the composer of this film. The background music he dubbing in the film is well received. The background music base on require of performance to change their structure at any moment. The music style of this film often changes by specifically activity and environment, thus, can increase the expressive force. In addition, the music of this film also makes a connection with scene, characters and words. Then, the music highlights the characters and plots. For example, at the first half of movie, the director uses soft music to reflect the lightness atmosphere. Then, the atmosphere become heavy combined with different music style. In a word, Yip Man is a excellent Kung Fu movie. This film has shown not only the spirit of Yip Man of martial arts as a master but also the real life of the Master. There is no doubt for this movie to be a highly recommended masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ip Man (2008)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Daddy daddy, mummy said if you don't attack soon all the things in the house will get broken".This is the story of a Chinese martial arts expert, before and during the second Sino-Jananese war.The movie starts by following the easy, rich and carefree life of a Chinese City in the years immediately before the war. Their time is spent between mock fighting and drinking tea with their friends on one side and their wives and children who don't really approve of this lifestyle, on the other. The tone is light - even humorous at times - and the only concern anyone has is saving face. The drama is subdued, the cinematography is beautiful, full of color and grace, everything is clean and pretty (with a few notable exceptions) and the music is fast, alert and used sparingly, punctuating fights and hilarious moments, mostly.But then the war begins. The tone changes, the atmosphere becomes much darker, and the story shifts dramatically. The good days are long forgotten and the light comedy changes to a dead serious war drama. The sets and the settings change, the lighting too, the music becomes graver and over the top on occasion, but that is fine, because the drama is over the top, also. The fighting becomes a life and death mater and the limited, careful and thoughtful use of power, strength and skill changes to a brutal demonstration of superiority, with terrible results.The actors do a great job and I was really impressed with their work. The fighting is top notch, even if there are not that many fight scenes. There isn't much of a story and there is little dialog of any importance, but words are sometimes unnecessary. There are some obvious propaganda influences and the bad guys are portrayed somewhat stereotypically, but that does not impede the story, too much.Ip Man. A very well executed drama, featuring excellent martial arts. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up watching Bruce Lee movies, so to see something representing his master's work was a real treat. This is an exceptional martial arts film I think Master IP and Bruce Lee would be proud of. I also just watched IP Man 2 and feel these may be the best martial arts films ever made. The acting is 2nd to none! It's one thing to be drawn into the action and feel like you're going to start throwing punches while you're watching, that's easy. It's a completely different thing to connect emotionally with the characters in the movie and what they are going through. I never felt that before (or even expected it) from a martial arts film.I will be on the look out now for more of this story!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are two kinds of movies: Those that leave you doing what you were doing before you watched it, and those that change the way you see yourself and the world around you. This is an example of the latter.From start to finish you are engaged whole-heartedly in the film. The action is simply some of the best around; scenes aren't chopped together in an incoherent mess. They are fluid, relevant, and dynamic. The symbolism is also pretty amazing throughout some of the fight scenes. This movie is also somewhat of a tear-jerker. You will find yourself at the edge of your seat throughout a great deal of it, particularly the end (which I won't mention here.) I can honestly say that I felt for every character in this film (which a few exceptions, naturally) and it was produced beautifully. All in all, you must see this movie, it may literally change your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Martial Arts Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very surprised how good this movie was as I randomly picked it from DVD rentals. Normally one does not believe the critics testimonials or taglines, but in this case, they were accurate. Ip Man is probably the best modern martial arts movie ever and surpasses Enter the Dragon (Bruce Lee), Legend of Drunken Master (Jackie Chan), Fist of Legend (Jet Li), etc. Why? Most martial arts movies are rated on their action. Not overall filmmaking. And I do mention modern (meaning taking place in the last 150-200 years)...not classic wushu movies (e.g., House of Flying Daggers).The film is about Ip Man, the founder of Wing Chun, who is a reluctant teacher but proud family man. The action soars when he is challenged by visiting martial artists or rival schools. Some movies are rags-to-riches but this film witnesses a hero born in affluence but drawn into poverty by war and misfortune. The drama soars when he labors hard under Japanese rule in order to feed his family. Or when he trains the factory workers to resist bullying gangs. It shows the human side of a martial artist who is humbled through a difficult war but protects his family and friends.The action is nearly as vibrant as Bruce Lee's or Jackie Chan's best. But this film surpasses them in cinematography, directing, acting and drama. The newer Hong Kong films, admittedly are better visual quality than the older films which were cheaply made. Donnie Yen brilliantly achieves the zen of acting in serious drama with his passion and calm something which Jackie Chan always seriously wanted to achieve despite his amazing comedic skills. Jet Li is a solid actor and Bruce Lee, although we respect him as a legend, wasn't a great actor. Instead Donnie Yen portrays Ip Man passionately as a family man with silent pride and inner strength.For action and Wing Chun, I'm no real expert but I've seen enough to know and I would rate the choreographed fight scenes as very good although maybe not as exciting as some other films. The most interesting fight scene was in the house with a rival teacher when Yen has to make a promise to his wife. Lightly but masterfully done. Having Sammo Hung helping out in the stunts and choreography is always an asset.Wilson Yip does a terrific job of directing if not at times a bit melodramatic but passionately done. Sing-Pui O does brilliant cinematography with subtle filter (more tastefully done than the blue of Underworld); Kenneth Mak recreates a beautiful artistic feel much like a traditional wushu film (e.g., Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon). Kenji Kawai produces a wonderful soundtrack and Ka-Fai Cheung edits smoothly.Sadly it doesn't hit a heart in the west as it gather awards for best picture, action choreography and actor from the east. Most traditional awards (e.g, Academy Awards, BAFTA) don't know how to judge this type of film and competing in technical achievement or visual effects or choreography doesn't quite fit the western type (e.g., imagine comparing choreography of a musical like Chicago).As for the overall feel, it hits that wonderful, soaring note when you cheer for the underdog or the unstated hero. It's easy to stand up and cheer for this film, which is several times better than Rocky or Rudy. Several people criticized the film for historical accuracy but really, since when are movies that accurate? It's the storyline that grabs us. Real history sometimes is a bit boring. This film isn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Score 3.5/5 The good old Chinese martial movies seems to have fade away from the movie scene of Hollywood lately. But the sparks still remain here and there and once in a while action movie which comes out. Mostly originated from China they seldom rocks the world unless an American studio does the production work."Ip Man" (Pronounced as Yip Maan) is one of those seldom martial art movie which gained international popularity back in 2008.Based on a true story and actual character of master Yip the story takes place in the second world war era. In a city where martial arts is a way of life and reputed for talented masters Yip resides with his wife and kids noble and rich from family heritage. While proving his Kung Fu talents in humble way Yip is respect throughout the land. Soon the life of Yip and many drastically change once the Japanese empire strikes on Chinese soil and Yip's city also falls victim and turn hell. Yip and his family goes though many hardships yet Yip ambitiously lives a respected life until trouble comes and know on his shoulder.Martial art movies are always centered upon fights. Duels , challenges and rival gangs which are all natural elements. In Ip Man the story goes a little further and discuss about family, respect, courage and honor as well. The limits which one can go in order to take care of his loved ones in the mid of tougher situations is what Ip Man is mostly about. And the movie cleverly shows what true martial artist is all about than throwing punches all over the town for no reason.Embedded craft fully with stunning and thumping martial art sequences Ip Man delivers a full load of action for the action movie lover. Even there is a bit of humor here and there. Sometimes following the subtitles can be a pain (The movie is in Chinese. No translation is available) but that's really not a barrier to enjoy it.Read more reviews www.flickshout.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good drama, not just martial arts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came across this film On Demand. I was intrigued because the film was supposed to be about the mentor/tutor of Bruce Lee and, even though I know next to nothing about martial arts apart from what the average American has seen in mainstream movies, everyone's familiar with Bruce Lee so I decided to give it a chance. I'm glad I did as the film turned out to be a very fine drama. To me, the martial arts seemed secondary to the more important story concerning the title character's efforts to survive in Japanese-occupied China.Unlike most martial arts films, this one actually had a linear plot, believable dialog, good acting, character development, and realistic fight scenes. Although one of the thugs portrayed in the film comes dangerously close to being buffoonish, for the most part the villains-- the Japanese soldiers-- are realistically drawn as ruthless occupiers, with only one coming across as sadistic. The fight scenes seemed more grounded in reality, without all the flying around on wires or gravity-defying twists and turns. Seeing the proud former Kung Fu masters reduced to sparring (sometimes to the death)in a darkly-lit room against the karate-trained Japanese soldiers for a bag of rice to feed themselves and their families was far more dramatic and emotionally engaging than watching some hero battle a cartoonish villain in a mythical dungeon or fortress.I've never seen Donnie Yen in another film, so I can't compare this performance to others. One other reviewer mentioned that Yen hasn't achieved the status of Jackie Chan and Jet Li because of his looks. I'm not exactly sure how to interpret that, except to say that in my opinion the tall, elegantly handsome Yen has a far more aristocratic bearing than the typical martial arts action superstar. One could imagine him playing the title character in The Last Emperor.But for all its strengths, the film does have weaknesses. Unfortunately, the title character is almost too perfect to believe, and we are not provided enough background information to get some sense of where he came from and what molded him. The ending of the film is also too abrupt. Although I now know that there's a Part II, this film should have gone a little further in depicting Ip Man's transition from wounded man on the run from the Japanese to legendary martial arts master and tutor to such disciples as Bruce Lee. But, overall, a real find.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The stuff of legend(s): Ip, Ip hurray!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bruce Lee was the progenitor of postmodern martial art," writes Davis Miller in THE TAO OF BRUCE LEE (a book I just happened across recently at the local library). Lee boxed in his younger days (photos and diary entries exist, one of the latter ending with "I won, but got blacked eye"), and later sparred using headgear and body armor to further develop his own personally tailored approach to martial arts. Yip Man, it's been said, sowed the seeds of Bruce Lee's Evolutionary approach to martial arts. IP MAN delves into none of this, although Bruce Lee's name is clearly an integral part of the ad campaign. Be that as it may, IP MAN is a solid action movie (as one might well expect, with Samo Hung doing the fight choreography), though I must confess I'm not a big fan (nor have I ever been) of wirework or cgi. (One of the distinctions between most of what Bruce Lee put on film and everything else was his insistence on BELIEVABLE martial arts. And, just for the record: the greatest fighter in the world isn't the guy who can tackle you and elbow you or choke you out by mounting you from behind: the greatest fighter in the world is the one fast enough of hand and foot to get in and gouge out your eyes before you can stop it. That said, a movie about the originator of wing chun- a woman- might be in order.) It's because of the wirework and cgi (not to mention the "speeded up" action so long so much a part of these movies) that I give IP MAN a 9 out of a possible 10.</fullReview>

Inner Peace, the power to dissolve conflict quickly, the strength to defend the powerless, and the practice to anticipate the weakness of the opponent's next move, are all integral parts of the format. Master Yip Man will not rest easily if the talent and skill of the founding priests and Master are not told to those ears that search for the truth. The movie is GREAT in exciting the Master's cause of Triumph over Operession. We must all pay respect to those who follow the Master's ways.</fullReview>

From a dramatic point of view its touching deeply thanks to ( a good written script , a stunning performance by Donnie Yen and remarkable soundtracks ) . This movie talks about a legendary grandmaster who there are many people don't know him , they may know his pupil; legend Bruce Lee . Donnie Yen was marvelous on all levels in fights and in his portrait of personal life of Ip Man . Donnie Yen at one of his finest performances and may be its his best yet . I love to see Jackie Chan and Jet Li but Donnie has something special among them . He has that special serious charisma . I saw Donnie Yen first time in the cop thriller 'SPL' and he got my attention since then . This movie shows us how great Chinese Wing Chun martial art is fused with individual's spirit . You will learn so many great things from this remarkable movie and your time will not be wasted watching it . Thanks Donnie Yen , for me you are a legend too .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just go get it - you won't be disappointed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being in the U.S., I had never heard of this movie, but checking today for something worthwhile to rent from Redbox.com, I kept seeing this movie in the inventory.I couldn't figure it out - it was titled "Ip Man" but had a Chinese guy striking a martial arts pose on the DVD cover. Let me tell you - this movie has the most unfortunate coincidence that this historical character's real name probably most naturally conjures up in an English-speaking person's mind a techno sci-fi storyline about "I.P. Man."Good thing I was curious enough about this "Ip Man" to search it out on IMDb here, be pleasantly surprised about its (current) 8.2/10 rating, and read all of the glowing reviews.And all of the posted reviews here are correct - the fight scenes are varied and incredible, the storyline (although historically debatable in its entirety as filmed) is well-scripted for rousing drama, some humor, deference to traditional Confucian values about family, community, and country, and of course, amazing martial arts action.From the very opening title frames, you can tell that this is not another one of your grade-B or C poorly-dubbed and shot chop-socky imports. The opening credits sequence is very classy and high quality in style, typeface, and accompanied by a driving, urgent, drum-based orchestral score that goes on to play a continuing emotionally rousing major role throughout the rest of the movie.The first scenes in the movie itself are reassuring in their set design and decoration, the lighting, the cinematography, camera movement, costuming, and acting. You get the immediate impression that this is a high quality dramatic movie, and not just another quickly slapped-together excuse to string a lot of over-the-top martial arts scenes and slapstick comedy together with the barest of plot lines.Be forewarned though since this is a native Chinese language film, if you don't speak the language, you're better off watching it with the original Chinese audio on and just reading the English subtitles. Turning the English audio dubbing on is very distracting because the vernacular slang they use just doesn't fit the more serious nature of the period and place (c'mon, do you really expect to call a young child "Kiddo" in a higher class family in 1930s China?).One tip - on the rental DVD, in Set Up, choose the "English - Full Feature" option for Subtitles. Apparently, if you just choose the plain "English" subtitles option, it only gives English translations of things seen in Chinese in the movie but not the actors' actual dialogue, which obviously will be of very little use to the non-Chinese speaker.True, there are a few minor fake-y bits here and there with a fighter stretching the realm of believability with a slightly-long jump or other acrobatic move, but nothing that will distract you from believing in the true artfulness and complexity of the execution of the wonderfully choreographed fight scenes. (You will find yourself going back again and again after the movie to replay the major fight scenes to just take in the artistic athleticism in those shots. Talk about how Ip Man uses opponents as human speed bags in a couple of pivotal fights!)A few observations about the Extras that were on my rental DVD: (1)The director, the actors, the fight choreographer, everybody that was interviewed was just so unfailingly polite and complimentary of each other in that culturally Asian way; just kind of nice, although it bordered on the almost saccharine if they weren't so sincere about it; (2) When you watch the few deleted scenes that are included, you will agree that the director and/or editor made the right decisions because the movie and storyline played much better without them; (3)You will be somewhat surprised by how "tame" some of the actors who play some of the macho characters in the movie seem to be in real life; (4)And you will be quite surprised which actors had what level of martial arts experience coming into this film; you won't believe it based on what you see in the movie, especially with the amount of time they had to learn to get to that level of expertiseAt the bottom of the DVD box, there is a tagline of "Mentor of Iconic Legend Bruce Lee." I predict that once this movie gets a wider audience through word-of-mouth and uniformly high ratings on here and other movie review sites, people will get to know who Ip Man really is, and he will no loner have to rely on his later historical connection to Bruce Lee to cement his rightful place in the martial arts superstars firmament. (In this movie, you get to see some of the dress and fighting moves that Bruce used in his iconic breakout movie, "Enter the Dragon." Maybe he was honoring Ip Man his teacher in that way?)Bottom-line: If you like martial arts action movies, this is a no-brainer. If you like quality historical docu-dramas with rousing true life underdog patriotic heroes, get it. It packs an even larger emotional wallop if you're ethnic Chinese and know about the atrocities the Japanese committed against the Chinese people before WWII. And if your wife can stand a little blood and some violent martial arts (but nowhere near the blood, guts, and gore of typical R-rated movies these days), then she will probably like it too - the fighting scenes are appropriately driven by the drama, and Ip Man always sees fighting as the last resort. Plus the story is full-bodied involving the importance of family as well as doing the right and honorable thing as an individual.10/10</fullReview>

Sorry if I was too excessive but if you watching another Kungfu movie and you compare it with this one, you will know what i mean.anyway this movie is a real story about Chinese Kungfu master named Ip Ching.Chinese people must be proud of their nation's long story, and their art what we call Kungfu.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yip Man - Best Martial Art Film In Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a martial arts movie fan for years. Every since I was in High School and my friend invited me to check out his Tai-Kwon-Do class, I was fascinated with Asia style martial arts. I eventually joined my friend's class and went as far as Blue Belt before heading off to college and leaving the class. I've seen just about all the best martial arts movies; from Drunken Master 2 to Once Upon a Time In China. Even the classics like 7 Blows of the Dragon and 5 Deadly Venoms. I've seen them all. I have my favorites like Fist of Legend, Wing Chun, The Prodigal Son and Tai Chi Master 1 &amp; 2. What I loved about Yip Man was the well written story the accompanied the great action. Yip Man tells the story of Ip Man who was the first Wing-Chun Master to teach Westerners this style. He was Bruce Lee's first Master. His teachings popularized martial arts in American and started a chain reaction on various martial arts schools throughout America.The movie is a biopic of Ip Man's life in Fo Shan China where he lived and taught his style. Fo Shan in 1930 was know for it's martial arts schools and one could be found on just about every corner. Yip Man did not have students, but would occasional be challenged by other masters interested in learning from him. Yip Man would fight them behind closed door, so if they lose, they would not be disrespected or humiliated by their peers or students. This was Yip Man way and he was well respected throughout Fo Shan.What turn things around in Fo Shan was the Sino Japanese war that appeared in Fo Shan. The Japanese Imperial army took over Fo Shan and even took Yip Man's home away from him. They treated the Chinese people with no respect and had them working for less then minimal wages. At this time Yip Man is barely able to feed his family and takes up work shoveling coal. All of Fo Shan people were at the mercy of the Japanese army. The armies' Generatl Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi) would have Li Zhao (Lam Ka Tung), who was the translator and liaison between the Japanese and Chinese, find fighters to battle Japanese soldiers for rice. If the Chinese fighter won, he would get a bag of rice for every man he defeated. It's safe to say that Yip Man himself eventually gets his turn, but not very willingly.The fights in this film are sensational. With Sammo Hung and Tony Leung Siu Hung overseeing all the action, you know it has to be great. Some of the best action is when Jin Shan Zhao (Siu-Wong Fan) comes to Fo Shan to open his own martial arts school. He challenges all the masters to make sure he's the best in Fo Shan. The action, technique and martial arts skill are intense. Nothing is held back. Donnie Yen's Yip Man is awesome. A humbled man who enjoys the quiet life, yet loves to train and practice the Wing Chun style. His Wing Chun style is fast, soft and mainly a defensive style. The Wing Chun style was created by a woman. Even Yip Man's stance and how he holds his hands represents a woman's posture. It's not hard or stiff like Karate or Tae-Kwon-Do. When Yip Man fights some of his opponents he spends the 1st few minutes simply defending, blocking and diverting the oncoming blows. When he strikes however, it's lightning fast and direct. It's wonderful to watch.This is a must have film. I just finished watching Yip Man 2 on DVD, which is almost as good as this film. The story isn't as well written and character development isn't as strong, but Sammo Hung is in it this time. He's great as usual. Still worth seeing though. In any case Yip Man should be seen by every martial arts fan. It's definitely in my Top 10 along with Drunken Master 2, Fist of Legend, Once Upon A Time In China &amp; Tai Chi Master. Do not hesitate to get this film. Overall I rate this movie 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action Filled Dramatization of Legendary Yip Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Ip Man" is quite simply one of the best modern martial arts films made. Not unlike Jet Li's terrific Fearless, "Ip Man" delves into modern history for its subject matter. This time to deliver the story of Ip Man from 1930s China, a peaceful Chinese gentleman in the town of Foshan during Japanese occupation. There is a considerable amount of dramatic invention in the movie "Ip Man," but that is what we are recommending it as ? a movie ? not an actual biography of Yip Man (who was a policeman and soldier).Ip Man is a well known in the town as being a master of Wing Chun kung-fu. He lives a somewhat solitary existence with his wife and son desiring mostly to practice his martial art. He refuses students and (most) challenges. The one challenge exception is due to an arrogant master that travels to Ip Man's home and insults him and his kung-fu until he agrees to fight.The eventual Japanese occupation is brutal to these rural Chinese townsmen. Eventually even the wealthy Ip Man is forced out of his home and into a day labor camp where he sees the continual abuse of his countrymen. Ever a practitioner of non-violence, Ip Man struggles to find other ways that he can help the people who so greatly look up to the great master.Starvation becomes prevalent and rumor begin to spread that the Japanese Colonel Miura is giving rice as a reward to Chinese who fight his Karate trained soldiers and win. Ip Man is disinterested in this offer until a friend disappears after agreeing to a fight in an attempt to obtain rice. Curious as to his friends disappearance, Ip Man goes to one of the fights and observes how the Chinese are treated as less than dogs or vermin and suffer great humiliation for little rice. For the first time Ip Man begins to lose his cool and his national pride is stoked. He guesses his friend is dead in addition to his people being treated as sub-human inferiors. He accepts a challenge and then demands to fight ten Japanese.Anyone familiar with Yen and nationalistic Chinese films knows that something very kick ass is about to happen. And it does. And the movie changes gears.After his victory, Ip Man refuses the reward rice and stalks off, point made. Colonel Miura, intrigued by the Wing Chun master and confident in his own Karate skills, spends a good amount of the rest of the movie trying to track down Ip Man and his family. He wants to put down Ip Man's pride and crush who is a symbol to the people of Foshan. Ip Man is then provoked to fight for his family, for his friends, and eventually in a match against Colonel Miura.Each element of "Ip Man" works as both a traditional nationalistic kung-fu movie and as a modern example of its kind. The fight choreography is mostly tight, face paced, and realistic with only one or two scenes where there is obvious wire work. Donnie Yen and the choreography team are so good that there are moments that make one's spine tingle in appreciation of badassery.But who can blame the filmmakers? Not only are they making a heavily dramatized film about a National Icon, but they are telling the story of man much like Wong Fei Hung and Huo Yuanjia (heroes of the Jet Li films "Once Upon a Time in China" and "Fearless" respectively) who has transcended historical boundaries and become a folk hero. Additionally, Ip Man later became well known as the master and trainer of the iconic Bruce Lee. It would have been difficult at best for the filmmakers to treat Ip Man's story in a staunch biographical affair.See "Ip Man." And then look forward to Ip Man 2: Legend of the Gandmaster. As dramatized as "Ip Man" was to skew it towards action, I expect nothing less than Ip Man and a young Bruce Lee working together at kicking ass during some point in the next film. The thought brings shivers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Action Scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I am sure this movie is less than accurate in fighting style and historical events, Ip Man (2008) has fantastic action, effects, and lots of heart (not just bloody knuckles).Some argue the historical events never happened. The same comments can be made about several "biographical" movies made about Bruce Less, or other celebrities and historical figures. At the least this film sparks the imagination, and leaves you wanting more. More action, more story.Others have argued that the fighting style is not incredibly accurate. In that case, this might not be the best film to take lessons from, however, the average viewer will be far less critical.Before this movie I did not know who Ip Man was. I did follow up watching this film with researching the true Man through various means.If you appreciate realistic martial art films with a slight flair of incredible, then this is a film for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Martial Arts Film With Breathtaking Action Yet Effectively Dramatic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a biographical film following the real life story of Ip Man, who was a legendary martial arts master of the Wing Chun form, and eventual mentor to the equally legendary Bruce Lee. The story follows the story of Ip Man from a well-respected rich businessman who excelled in martial arts. Their prosperous village of Fo-Shan was occupied by Japanese troops in the late 1930s. Ip Man lost his fortune and had to work for meager wages with the rest of his townspeople. The highest Japanese officer in their area was arranging violent Japanese vs. Chinese martial arts tournaments for his perverse sense of entertainment, and Ip Man's skills caught his attention. Can Ip Man's formidable skills serve to rally the Chinese cause in the midst of their current sorry state of wartime persecution? Director Wilson Yip, along with action director Sammo Hung and choreographer Leung Siu-hung, have created a seamless series of breathtakingly memorable action sequences of awesome martial arts prowess, neatly integrated into this dramatic story of personal and national pride. In the center of all this is the fantastic portrayal of lead actor Donnie Yen. His humility and generosity as a family man and friend is counterbalanced with his graceful yet deadly skills as a martial artist. Mr. Yen effectively captures this unique spirit for all of us to cheer for and admire. This is indeed a must see for all fans of Chinese martial arts movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not quite an accurate depiction of Japanese Martial Arts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fantastic movie, I have always enjoyed Hong Kong Films.Great adaptation of a story, however not quite an accurate depiction of Japanese Martial Arts.The film contained Japanese Soldiers fighting in a style of fighting (Okinawan Karate) which was not that common in Japan at that time.Karate was slowly being introduced in Japan as early as 1910 however it did not gain any official status or recognition by the Dai Nippon Butoku-Kai until 1935.From this point it began to be taught on a more wide footing in Universities and Dojo's along side Kendo, Jujitsu, Judo and Aikido (all true Japanese martial arts).It is It is a shame to see cultural and historical bias as well as damaged pride interfere with what could have ultimately been a more accurate time piece and portrayal of a true Kung Fu Master.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donnie Yen - Underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just gone through my second viewing of this film, and the time flew just as quickly as it did the first time I watched it.Ip Man is a fantastic film, with a generous mixture of action, comedy, sentiment, great acting and a simple but gripping story. In a book I read a few years ago, Donnie Yen was quoted to be not as famous as the likes of Jet Li and Jackie Chan because of his look. But, judging by this film, he has a good and posture on screen much domineering than the both of them. Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of Jet and Jackie, but Ip Man has set him on the way, and I hope it brings him bigger success.The fighting scenes in Ip Man is brutal, fast, very fluid, and actually beautiful to watch. They are also very realistic, in particular the battle against the 10 Japanese guys and the boss. The acting from all cast were also very strong. I in particular enjoyed watching Ka Tum Lam. You could really feel his pain at watching his comrades getting killed by the Japanese, and his suffering whilst getting beaten upon like a dog, you just really wanted him to escape. I was quite surprised that he was a survivor all the way until the end.I think this film would do wonders worldwide, but it doesn't look like it is getting out of Asia, and that's a great disappointment, not just for HK film and Donnie Yen, but also for the Western audience, particularly when films - especially the action genre - these past years have been poor.Donnie Yen is getting some healthy exposure, and he still looks very young for his age. Let's just hope he gets some better recognition, and we could have another martial arts legend (he already is in Asia) the world over! You'd be a fool to miss Ip Man... Especially if you have seen all four legendary Bruce Lee films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wing Chun Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By now most of you have read reviews for this movie, well this is another one to add to the pot. Everyone pretty much knows the story of Grandmaster Yip Man, so I'll hit on the movie itself. Donnie Yen stars as Ip (Yip) Man. He is a very humble man who knows he is good at his art, but tries to stay away from the limelight. Every challenge presented to him ends with painful upset on their behalf. Later in the film the Japanese invades Foushan and uses Ip Mans' house as the headquarters. After a very painful hardship Ip Man battles the General in a final battle that is just outstanding. I think the story in this film was more put together than Fok Yun Gaps' was in Fearless (Jet Li).I have to truly say I have not seen Wing Chun executed in a movie this good since Prodigal Son. Sammos' choreography knows no bounds. The only thing that could have made this movie unearthly is if Ip Man would have had a light duel with Wong Fei Hung. Although he was only mentioned in the film, the scene would have been great. If you liked the Wing Chun execution in this film then try some others like Prodigal Son, Wing Chun, Warriors Two, and Descendant of Wing Chun.This is a must see for anyone that is into good action and story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not the Kung Fu I am looking for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not huge into martial arts movies, I just tend to enjoy them when I watch them. In other words, I don't regularly go seeking these movies out, but if I hear of a good one I will definitely watch it.I love Bruce Lee and Enter the Dragon, I also enjoy his rougher Hong Kong work with the terrible dubbing. I really like Sonny Chiba. I grew up on Van Damme and a ton of low budget western martial arts flicks from the 80s and 90s (many distributed by Cannon Films). Road House is a guilty pleasure of mine. I find Jackie Chan movies amusing and I thought Jet Li rescued Lethal Weapon 4 from being a terrible movie. I really like Scott Adkins and his work in the Undisputed films. I became a huge fan of Tony Jaa after seeing him in Ong Bak (one of my favorite kung fu flicks) and The Protector, and The Raid: Redemption is easily one of the best action films I have seen in a decade.I have to admit that I'm not a big fan of the whole wire-fu genre unless it has some sort of mystical or science fiction element, and even then I am wary of it. Ip Man has wire work (though it is toned down), slow motion, and is over choreographed. Each fight is like an elegant dance, I understand the appeal of this to some people, but it's not for me. I like my martial arts films to have more grounded and brutal combat, not a ballet of fists and kicks. So right off the bat this was not my type of martial arts movie. I know there are others like me, so this review is for them.The story certainly won't save this movie if you don't favor this type of action. It's a familiar tale of helpless Chinese civilians learning how to defend themselves against an oppressor, in this movie that oppressor is the Imperial Japanese Army circa WW2. Ip Man is supposed to be based on a real life person who defied the Japanese occupation and trained people to fight, he is presented in this movie as an Asian Beowulf - a hero with heavily exaggerated physical abilities. There's a distinct nationalistic tone to the movie and an odd insinuation at the end that the Japanese may have surrendered because of IP Man's Chinese resistance instead of two massive American bombs leveling two of their cities (most historical films would have said the "The Japanese surrendered to General MacArthur and the allied forces in 1945, but this film being from the propaganda machine that is China simply says Japan surrendered in 1945 and never specified to whom). Some quick facts about the real Ip Man:- He worked as a cop before and after the Japanese invasion. Not shown in this movie.- IP Man was an enemy of the Chinese Communist party and fled to Hong Kong. For obvious reasons, this is not mentioned in the film.This movie is a propaganda piece, no question about it, but I did not rate it down for that reason, I just feel it should be mentioned.This is the only Donnie Yen movie I have watched, but I don't see the appeal of him as an action star. His facial expressions and mannerisms are bland and his fights in this movie are so ridiculously one sided that it makes Steven Seagal look humble. Add in the wire work, and I just don't see the appeal of him compared to what I saw in Ong Bak or The Raid.One word thundered in my head after I finished watching this movie: overrated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never would have guest that this movie would be so good . had seen many Chinese movies especially in the past month and i can gladly say this is my favorite .Though I never was a real fun of the Chinese cinema , i occasionally had good times with the usual too much blood the too much violence the too many "flying" scenes and the "legendary" fights especially when they are followed by good placed and interesting historical facts . This movie YIP MAN shows that all the usual effects are not necessary for a good movie , though it has awesome fighting scenes , it also shows a deeper philosophy of what Kung-Fu really is. Great ideas , philosophies of the Chinese culture are shared all over this movie . For those interested in pure action this movie will not disappoint you at all , for those interested in historical facts i would say this movie is more accurate and closer to the real facts than any other Chinese movie . interesting biography interesting story very good movie!</fullReview>

I won't go deep into plot details, the synopsis is enough to read before seeing this movie anyways.I'm not a kung-fuholic, I consider myself as a fan and I have done my part of checking out the most notable kung-fu movies but I have never seen one like Yip Man. The fights are so perfectly executed which is rarely seen. The movie itself is kind of a sad story as the plot progresses and this is a perfect excuse of checking it out with your girlfriend, she will like it ( mine did ).Everyone and I mean everyone who likes kung-fu/martial arts movies should see it ! The fight with Ip Man beating up 10 karate dudes will make you rewind and watch again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Y)ip Man is a guy you might not know of, although if you are into Martial Arts, you should know who he is/was. It's not that important for the movie that you do, the information will be revealed for all at the end of the movie, when you hear/read about the real life Ip Man. Considering his impact on the Martial Arts scene, I guess he couldn't have been portrayed by anyone else then Donnie Yen (at this particular time that is).Still the movie leaves you with a feeling that there could have been more and what do you know? There is a second movie coming (although I'm not sure when that is supposed to be playing time line wise). Maybe when the second movie is released, it will make this one look a bit better too. We'll see. A good movie, a great performance, but we have to wait for a few other goodies as it seems.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why You Should Watch This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One single scene, about halfway through the movie, is so violent, full of revenge, and just... awesome, that I was literally about to jump out of my chair. I've seen lots of fighting movies, but very few fight scenes even come close to creating such an emotional response as this one did. You'll know what I'm talking about if you see the movie. But be prepared for some really brutal violence, if you like that kind of thing.It's a bit of a slow-paced movie, but that's just the price you pay for a good story, which this movie definitely has. It's a very serious movie. Gives you a bit of Chinese vs Japanese history. Apparently it is based on a true story. But if nothing else, watch it for the fighting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit that I haven't been charmed by a kung fu film ever since Bruce Lee. Or should I say by action movie? This is the first film to be equal to the movies once made by the practical father of the action movie - Bruce Lee. It is sooo good that Chinese movies are not being dubbed any more. There, you can see the "native" film scene that any film school in the world can hardly match. I have seen this film couple of times and I couldn't find anything bad about it. If you want to make film of this kind - this is the perfect example. I guess its not a big deal to find an actor that is going to look like Yip Man among one billion Chinese, but still - except resemblance on look - what an actor Grandmaster Donnie Yen is!!! And director Wilson Yip!!! His camera is like the window that mediates between film and reality - when watching this film, it looks like you are there!!! Afer Kurosawa and Bruce Lee, this is the name you should remember, if you ask me. And of course, must see!!!</fullReview>

The music was also quite nice but I did feel like the way a lot of it was put together (the editing I guess) was a little artificial. Not bad and probably way above Hollywood's average but still, not the style of a passionate director or group of filmmakers. Just the usual kinds of shots put together the usual kind of way. I was probably just more conscious of this because I wasn't concentrating so much on the dialogue (which most movies rely far too heavily on if you ask me).The fighting parts did seem pretty awesome overall but that doesn't make a whole movie. A few memorable shots. Drama parts also good but didn't know what was happening. Why an 8 then? I guess I'm not that impressed because I have these ideas of a totally new kind of film-making in the future. Much more intense and well-thought through than today's movies. Way better music. Much edgier and braver scripts. Ip Man just doesn't seem like a powerful, unique movie. It's just good in most areas. With some exciting fight scenes. The sets did stand out though.I don't know what to say really. This is a good movie. Nothing bad about it for the most part. It just doesn't quite have a unique feel of it's own. But it does have Donnie Yen playing a pretty cool character. But that's kind of juvenile isn't it? For a "serious" movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without question, one of the best, if not the best, kung fu biographies ever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grandmaster Ip man is simply a superb and inspirational biographical movie about the father of modern Chinese martial arts.Shot in a modern style but embodying all the virtues of The Good Chinese Hero of Confuciansim this is a really marvelous and very good watch.The film is made by the exceptional performance of Donnie Yen as grandmaster Ip. Yes, the fighting skills are exceptional - though this is in places more explicit that many earlier fantasy kung fu movies and younger viewers should be made aware of this - but more than this Yen gives the role a true and very deep and abiding sense of stillness, dignity, and gravitas.From its beginnings, which are much lighter in tone, to the Japanese occupation, which are not, (And the Japanese here are best thought of as Nazis) the story intrigues and moves along with a wonderful sense of pace - nothing is rushed but a real sense of build-up exists.This is a masterful blend of Western styles of cinema - it is exceptionally well-lit and shot with superb grading on the film - and Eastern love of the hero story. The fight scenes are all exceptional with a real sense of mastery and vision - without resorting to either too much slapstick or out and out violence. In places the moves are simplicity personified and all the more stunning as a result.If martial arts are your thing you will absolutely love this - but if drama rather than action is also your thing - then I guarantee you will walk out a foot taller.Moving, exciting, and inspirational - an exceptional movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grandmaster Yip Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually i try to avoid movies that have Donnie Yen in them mainly because of the bad stories, plots and acting. However i must digress that his movies contain spectacular fighting scenes well worth watching on it's own.Once again, apart from SPL(Killzone) - Donnie Yen has returned to a martial arts movie with a lot of heart and soul behind it with great characters and a lot of depth. The story and plot is good and the acting is pretty reasonable. The fighting scenes are once again excellent as he demonstrates the Wing Chun fighting style as both fierce, gentle and philosophical.A lot of people including your friends will encourage you to watch this movie saying it is probably one of the best Chinese movies out there. It's true and their encouragement is not without a foundation. This movie is brilliant and although it does not accurately depict Grandmaster Yip Man's life, it is very much well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fearless meets Fist of Legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wilson Yip and Donnie Yen are a golden duo for Hong Kong cinema. The turn of the millennium wasn't easy for Hong Kong action flicks and for a long time there wasn't much out there to strengthen the believe in a hopeful feature. But when SPL hit the screens things took a turn for the better and Yip and Yen turned into the hottest HK action duo almost overnight.Ip Man marks a change of scenery for Yip and Yen. Rather than set up their film in modern day society they flip back in time a good hundred years or so. Yip Man is China's main representative of the Wing Chun style and a true hero of the people, standing up against the Japanese when they invade China. If you're somewhat familiar with HK cinema two titles will probably pop up into your mind immediately. And if you're wondering why the film isn't called Yip Man then, it is because Wong Kar-Wai is holding that title for his own bio-epic about the man.The film plays like a mix between Fearless (Li's latest big martial arts epos) and Fist Of Legend (one of Li's most notorious films), which should give you a pretty good idea of what to expect. The storyline and fighting style is close to that of Fist Of Legend, the setting and focus on the hero is very similar to Fearless. Together they make for a compelling film while just a little lacking in the action department.Donnie Yen is made to play a role like this, especially in the beginning of the film when he remains untouchable. His Wing Chun style is strong, fast, controlled and to the point. He likes to toy with his opponents but never gives the impression of not being in control of the fight. There are some cool moves to showcase too but it is simply not as impressive as other styles. Yen might hit harder and faster but the choreography feels less like ballet. In the end, it all comes down to personal taste of course.The film looks very detailed and a lot of attention was paid to the props and setting. It looks pretty expensive and probably was, on the other hand, it feels less energetic than Yip's previous films. Not that the film calls for an in-your-face approach, but it would've been nice to get some more landmark shots in there and even though the action is well translated to the big screen, it could've used a little more oomph.There's also some humor to be found in the film and for a change it is pretty subtle for HK standards. There's a little scene with Ip Man's kid coming in on a tricycle to pass a message from his wife that caught me quite off guard. It's little extra touches like these that liven up the film a bit. The proceedings of the film are pretty typical beyond that and those who are expecting some exciting twists and turns should probably lower their expectations. Ip Man is a typical martial arts hero type film.The acting is all around strong for a film like this. Yen knows how to make a role like this work and a special mention goes out to Simon Yam who seems to be getting better and better at picking out his films. Add to that a solid final battle and as an action fanatic you can't really go wrong with a film like Ip Man.It is not as exciting and grand as similar films, but Ip Man turned out to be an extremely solid entry in the ever growing list of Yip and Yen collaborations. If you liked Fearless, you will probably like this one too. Which one you like best is probably dependent on what martial arts styles you prefer. 4.0*/5.0*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great martial arts film show casing Wing Chun in high detail</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot claim to be any sort of serious historian when it comes to Yip Man's life, but all evidence leads me to believe the story of his life in the new biopic from China, "Ip Man", is largely fabricated or romanticized. Never the less, the end result is an entertaining film with some serious Wing Chun fight scenes, a martial art that gets far too little screen time considering the copious amount of martial arts films that are produced. This is significant to me, since I study Wing Chun in a lineage that comes directly from Yip Man.This film is sort of in the style of biopic similar to Jet Li's "Fearless", a movie about a Chinese folk hero, Huo Yuanjia. I think it is more important for a film like this to be entertaining than it is for it to be historically accurate, and "Ip Man" does succeed in this regard. My main point of criticism, particularly in regards to "Ip Man", is how events are twisted in a way to rally national pride in China. It always reminds me of a sort of Mel Gibson type of thing to do, and puts me off a little. "Ip Man" is not as obnoxious in this regard as Zhang Yimou's "Hero" or "Curse of the Golden Flower", however. Those movies seem to have a message of obedience. You know, "Trust your ruler even though they do terrible things to you sometimes. In the end, they know what's best for you". In the case of "Ip Man", the title character is plunged into the middle of the Japanese-Chinese conflicts of World war II, probably playing a much larger roll than he did in real life, and they show him as a sort of folk hero along the lines of Huo Yuanjie or Wong Fei Hong.Never the less, the film flows well. All of these elements make enough dramatic tension between the excellent combat sequences to keep the movie engaging. Some of the plot twists are extremely predictable, which doesn't interfere too much. This is a martial arts movie, after all. There is probably a bit too much dramatic tension, particularly towards the end of the film, with epic music pushing the mood of the movie, along with various camera effects. Besides, turning Yip Man into a legendary folk hero does make for an interesting dramatic character.I couldn't complain about Donnie Yen's overall performance. His acting job was good enough to be convincing. His martial arts performance was visually striking. The choreographer, who I understand to be Sammo Hung, did a great job making Yip Man seem like an untouchable bad ass. In a lot of recent movies, particularly Jet Li films, a lot of the martial arts sequences show big, long, epic combat scenes where the hero narrowly overcomes and triumphs. In this movie, Donnie Yen gets to simply brutalize his opponents. I mean, he seriously comes out with the chain punches. This is not done without being poignant, but they definitely make a point of showing Yip Man as being somewhat untouchable and peerless. It seemed more Clint Eastwood than Jet Li, which I totally dig.My other concern was whether this would be a sort of "Brucesploitation" film, since among Yip Man's other notable accomplishments, he was the teacher of Bruce Lee. It would seem natural to want to capitalize on this given Lee's popularity. Fortunately, there wasn't too much "Brucesploitation" going on, but it did seem there was a bit. There is one combat scene where Yip Man is facing off ten Japanese karate guys. The sequences are filmed in a very strikingly similar way to a famous scene in "Fist Of Fury", where Lee dispatches a whole dojo of Japanese karate students after they dishonored Lee's kung fu school. There is also a combat sequence in a factory that is strikingly similar to a scene in "The Big Boss" where Lee fights in an ice factory, protecting the workers. However, my guess is that these are nods of respect or tribute rather than exploitation, so seem harmless. There was some mention in the end titles of Lee, but the copy I watched did not have that translated, so I am not sure what was even mentioned.All that said, if you enjoy martial arts movies, this is definitely a good film. I have my share of complaints, particularly in the department of historical accuracy. However, the overall production is top notch, and the martial arts performances are a nice change of pace. I'd recommend giving it a look if you are any sort of fan of martial arts movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interesting to see this to be the highest rated martial arts movie on IMDb, which I assume is on the strength of Donnie Yen's performance and the film's overall high production values. Sadly both are wasted on a simplistic good-vs-evil script, which has more in common with Rocky IV than my mental image of Yip Man's life. The film strikes a similar sour note with me as did Zhang Yimou's Hero, instrumentalizing great film making to rouse nationalistic emotions. If this were a B movie i'd thoroughly enjoy it, but as a high budget blockbuster I'll hold it to higher standards. Ultimately this is a disservice to Yip Man's legacy as well. Watch this for the martial arts, which are great, but for a more subtle depiction of Japan's occupation of China, look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wing Chun master Ip Man lives in Foshan province and he takes on the Japanese in this first film about the man who taught Bruce Lee</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is not often that a film benefits from having not just one legend, but two associated with it. Ip Man has two. Starring the legendary Donnie Yen in what is quite possibly his best role ever and featuring choreography by the legendary Sammo Hung. (Who when asked how he was going to work with Yen to direct the action scenes, Hung replied matter-of-factly, "With my mouth.") *Wikipedia* Both men are well-known for their fight choreography with Sammo nudging Donnie out by sheer number of years that he's been practising his craft.Directed with past Yen collaborator Wilson Yip, Ip Man is the "true story" of Yip Man grandmaster of Wing Chun and master of film legend Bruce Lee. Touted as being semi-biographical, the film is pretty liberal with the "truth" as things of this nature tend to be. While the rudimentary facts may be correct a lot of things were added to make the film more entertaining.Despite this frugality with the real facts, the film is a powerful one. The recreation of Foshan in Shanghai looks so authentic you feel as if the film company had really gone back in time to shoot the scenes.Some complaints were raised about Ip Man's house being incorrect and that he never shovelled coal during the occupation and the facts of his move to Hong Kong are misleading. But as the film The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance says, "print the legend." Or in this case, make it up.Yen is stunning as the placid, peace-loving martial artist who won't give lessons and spars with the local masters privately in order to save them the public embarrassment of being beaten.At one point, he has to take on a usurper from outside the town. This ruffian fights his way through all the Foshan martial art instructors until only Ip Man is left. Going to his home, the outsider brings what looks like the members of every school in the town to watch him beat Ip Man.Everyone in Foshan knows that Ip Man will be victorious and he is.Everything changes in 1937 when the Japanese invade China and this is where majority of the drama and tension come into the film.The fight scenes are exciting, original, and furious. The Wing Chun style is breathtaking to watch and the other martial arts battles are impressive as well.The entire cadre of actors in the film sold their characters and I spotted quite a few familiar faces in it.My only complaint was that in some instances parts of the story were a bit "over the top" so that it almost felt like a "kitchen sink" drama instead of a biopic. But theatricality aside the film looks, overall, fantastic and I got caught up with the characters and the "true" story completely.A real 5 out of 5 stars for a film that had me munching my popcorn furiously throughout. I'm now going to "watch' my way through the rest of the films in this four film series.Even if you don't love martial arts films the story of Yip Man could turn you into a fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb in every way. A triumph.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is, simply, one of the three or four best kung fu films I've ever seen, a back-to-basics classic with a realistic setting, a powerful story and a series of superbly-choreographed fight scenes that place an accent on technical skill, and possess a heartening reverence for visual clarity. There are no mystifying close-ups of unidentifiable feet, and the film benefits from both a negligible amount of wire-work and a complete absence of juvenile comedy, placing it in a bracket almost by itself. It's also rooted in a stunning evocation of time and place, complete with poignant, beautiful bleached-out cinematography that calls to mind old sepia photos.Donnie Yen starred in Yuen Woo-Ping's groundbreaking Iron Monkey (perhaps the first film to properly spotlight the stylistic preoccupations that would find a worldwide audience through The Matrix and Crouching Tiger), and had supporting parts opposite Jet Li in the jaw-dropping Once Upon a Time in China II and Zhang Yimou's disappointing Hero. But, unlike Li, he hasn't had it all his own way. As Yen searched for worthy starring vehicles, so fans had to suffer dreck like New Big Boss, a film which boasts the unique distinction of having a story so mystifyingly convoluted that it makes The Tree of Life look like Under Siege. When Yen ventured abroad, it was to appear as the villain in Shanghai Knights, and then to choreograph the action scenes in Stormbreaker. The poor bastard.Ip Man, happily, is the perfect vehicle for his talents, casting him as the eponymous aristocrat, a quiet, noble family man who is forced to give up his home, his lifestyle and his beloved Wing Chun martial arts after the Japanese invade in 1937. After a fun, fight-heavy opening, we follow Ip Man and his compatriots through all manner of physical, moral and spiritual degradation, a process of dehumanisation that reaches a symbolic pinnacle when the martial arts masters are offered rice to prostitute their talents in front of the military brass. Ip Man doesn't want the rice, not at that cost, but he would quite like to fight 10 Japanese guys at once, train a factory-full of workers to stick up for themselves, and face down the general in front of the whole town.It's a story of great heart, masterfully-conceived and perfectly-paced, with numerous punch-the-air(/punch-the-baddie) moments, the dramatic entrances from Yen's near-mythic hero - fists clenched in fury - set-up with such intelligence and emotion that, when he appears, the spirits soar. Each fight scene serves a purpose within the narrative, and every one is viscerally, intensely exciting, Yip and his action director, Sammo Hung, respecting Yen's artistry to such a degree that he's frequently shown in full-length shot, cuts only made to better showcase his skill or to transmit the pure power inherent in those twisting hands and flitting feet.Agreeably, Yen's hero is also one of the most sensitive and progressive in action movie history. He uses a style of fighting devised by a woman, refuses to fight until given permission by his missus, and dismisses the taunts of a thuggish brute who's just turned up in his house by saying that there is nothing wrong with a man who "respects his wife". Take that, '70s Clint, you chauvinist wally. The thuggish brute, incidentally, is Siu-Wong Fan, who I saw in the terrible Supercop 2 just the other day (see below). There he was a pleasant, slim, slightly vacant young man with big eyes, who turned out to be fairly handy in a scrap. Let's just say that he's eaten several few pies and a lot of creatine since then. And grown a little beard.Ip Man is an exhilarating experience, one of those films that uplifts you through its sheer brilliance and makes you ask: "Why can't ALL movies be this good?" I never thought I'd type these words, but it's like Fist of Legend. Only better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Ip Man" (2008)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yip Wai-shun's 2008 historical martial arts action-drama "Ip Man" is one of the most rollicking, rocking, socking martial arts films in years. It also has the distinction of being one of the few martial arts movies to be based on a true story. In this case, it's Wing Chun Grandmaster Yip Man (1893-1972), who once instructed a teenage Bruce Lee in Wing Chun (and we all know where Lee went afterward). The film basically tells a self-contained story set before and during the Second Sino-Japanese War in Fo Shan, China, with Ip Man (Donnie Yen, in a perfectly balanced dramatic action performance) helping to restore Chinese pride and nationalism in the wake of oppression by the invading Imperial Japanese Army. It all culminates in a vicious public - and symbolic - bout against General Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi), the commanding officer in charge of the Japanese military forces in Fo Shan. While "Ip Man" pulls no punches (no pun intended) in detailing the brutal oppression the Japanese inflicted upon the Chinese, "Ip Man" goes a step further in not showing a one-sided portrait of the Japanese (like so many other films have done in the past). The Japanese are indeed shown to be the brutal aggressors that they were doing that time, it also plainly shows that General Miura is at least a man of honor. The film's action sequences (choreographed by Sammo Hung) are fast and vicious, with star Donnie Yen's (a veteran of countless martial arts vehicles) excellent fighting skills at front and center. I can't wait for "Ip Man 2."8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the most enjoyable martial arts themed movie that I have seen for a long time since Kung Fu Hustle. Although Ip Man is not comedic it does have some lighter moments especially early on (love the ass whoopin scene and the bit where his baby son comes in on the tricycle mid fight). Before that I would need to go all the way back to Bruce Lee to find a movie as good as this Ip Man is better than most movies of this genre because not only is it brilliantly acted and made, but it is something more and loosely tells the story of Yip Man, creator of the Wing Chun school of martial arts (and one of Bruce Lee's teachers), and his life during World War II and the Japanese occupation of China Admittedly I would not like to be Japanese and watching this movie, but if you leave your politics and nationality at the door and just enjoy Ip Man as a good martial arts movie you will really enjoy this A very special nod to the soundtrack which is brilliant. The fight scenes are very loud generally but the sound design is first rate, every main impact sounds fresh and different and there are some very nice double impacts and weapons sounds which really add crunch to the fight scenes Very impressive!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only great for the martial arts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems like these days true classical style martial arts films are far and few between. Ip Man is one of these modern day rarities that chronicles the life of Ip Man, the founder of the Chinese martial arts style Wing-Chun. It's a dramatization of the Japanese takeover of Man's city of fo Shen and it tells the story of how Man used martial arts to hold his own against the Japanese and give the Chinese people the strength and courage to stand up to the Japanese oppression that had befallen the city. Quite the epic tale for someone with such a strange name.If you like martial arts films you should really enjoy Ip Man. I'm not a huge fan of them, but I can appreciate the art because it is films like this that really do display it as that, an art. The fight scenes in this movie, as anyone could guess, are the highlight of the film and that's not just because the rest of the film is slightly lacking. The martial arts action in this film is awesome. There are some great fight scenes with mind blowing choreography. They are uniquely directed and showcased beautifully. We see and hear every move and every hit and it's quite the experience to watch. Watching this film doesn't make me doubt for a second that Ip Man was one of the greatest Chinese martial artists who ever lived. Of course, the film isn't exactly designed to make you think otherwise.If you want anything juicier than great fight scenes then you won't really find it in Ip Man. I give the story plenty of credit as it does the world of martial arts justice as well as tell a historically relevant story. However, if you're looking for any emotional backing you will find none. There's room for some and the story has the potential to well up great emotion in its audience, but it falls flat on that front. This is due to a mediocre script and one dimensional characters that don't invest you in what is going on. The story itself is thankfully interesting enough, but it doesn't deliver in dialogue or characters.Of course, what we want most out of Ip Man is what we get, and that is beautifully choreographed martial arts action. The film is packed with that from beginning to end, so to say that this is a bad film because of a few problems it has connecting to the audience would be a lie. It's not a great film, but it's a very fun watch and well worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unusually Gentle Martial Arts Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a rare genre movie with seemingly realistic fighting scenes with elegant, efficient short moves, and no inhuman acrobatics. From the very first moment you realize that this movie doesn't center on it's genre, it has many fighting scenes, but it's not focused on the sensation. And that is a fresh approach that makes it memorable.Additionally you have believable, sympathetic actors, not completely one-dimensional enemies (ok, one and a half dimensional), a bit of humor, simple but effective dialogs, heartwarming atmosphere and a perfect cinematography. Donnie Yen plays this man very calm and serious, with a good little sense for Chinese humor.The movie is made with a caring sympathy for people and the Chinese way of life, it takes its time to show us a society on a village level with no big conflicts before the Japanese invasion. That is the reason why I can't give it a higher rating, even if I would - Yip Man's life and the life of his family and his neighbors is a bit too happy, not complete believable, it seems to be washed or beautified, so that western watchers can enjoy it. I could even suspect that it's fantasy, If I want - which I don't, because it's a fictional movie on a Hollywood level, not a biopic, although Yip Man is a historical person. At least I don't forget that before the Japanese occupation China was at civil war (from 1930 on), so life there shouldn't have been that easy.Yip Man himself seems to be rich, he owns a big house and doesn't need to work. For such a man, he is surprisingly unpretentious, which may come from the influence of the philosophy-driven martial arts he loves.There are some clichés which can't be avoided looking back in history of the Japanese/Chinese war, but at least to show the Japanese General as a man of honor (in opposite to his lower staff) seems to be halfway realistic (If a real general would be mounted as governor of such a small town is another question).Anyone who sees a propagandistic approach should read some statistics and proved stories about the time of Japanese occupation, before judging. I think, the way the Japanese are depicted here is rather softened. Japanese saw Chinese as lower people, not as humans on the same level. They were in some ways not far from German ideas of that time.A little setback is the ending, which comes too fast and unexpected, after the movie took so much time (in a good way) to invite us into its world. I would have been also interested to learn about the General's fate. At least 10 or 15 minutes watching Yip Man recovering, maybe watching the General committing Sepukku, would not have harmed the chance for a sequel, and everyone would have seen the credits more satisfied, and would be more sure that this is the best Martial Art's movies ever.Still, one of the best - when not the best - movies in this genre I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ip Man is a loose biopic of Grandmaster Ip Man, founder of the Wing Chung branch of martial arts and mentor to Bruce Lee. The film is set in the 1930s and focuses on Ip Man's early life in Foshan, China, where he is a wealthy man and part of upper class society. Upon the Japanese invasion in 1937, Ip Man, like most other inhabitants of Foshan, is driven from his home and forced to live a meagre existence under Japanese rule. The film documents Ip Man's struggle to provide for his family and his quest to protect Chinese honour in the face of atrocities committed by the occupying Japanese forces.The film is well paced and I, for one, was gripped throughout. Donnie Yen, in the role of Ip Man, gives a great performance and is a powerful presence on screen. The supporting cast are also very good, particularly the two Japanese antagonists who provide a real sense of danger to the people of Foshan. The film also features some spectacular production design which really brings to life the 1930s Chinese setting. The contrast in living conditions before and after the Japanese invasion is lovingly rendered on screen and adds to the authenticity of the film.As this is at heart an action film, the fight scenes are particularly important and it is no surprise that they are beautifully choreographed and demonstrate some outstanding skill from the lead actors. The film manages to display enough violence to give the fight scenes authenticity but manages to avoid descending into a display of gratuitous violence at the expense of plot development.At the heart of the film is an interesting theme of the modern vs the ancient. The skillful, hand to hand combat, which is at the heart of the martial arts demonstrated in the film is, in several scenes, contrasted to the more mechanical use of modern weaponry. This is an interesting juxtaposition which raises the question of whether the technological advancements which have created modern weapons, has resulted in a loss of honour in our humanity.Sure, the film is not without its flaws. The dialogue is clunky places (although I suspect that has something to do with the English translation) and there are some glaring plot holes which you could drive a Japanese tank through. In one scene, Ip Man teaches the entire workforce of a local factory how to defend themselves from local bandits and, whilst entertaining, it is a stretch of imagination too far.The story also lacks the ring of truth, and after some brief research into the real Ip Man, it becomes clear that this is a highly fictionalised account of the man, with the focus very much on the creation of a good story rather than historical accuracy. The film is also a heavily biased representation of the Sino-Japanese war, presenting the Chinese as honourable people and the Japanese as a savage race, reliant on their weaponry.These are, however, relatively minor complaints in a film which is hugely entertaining and a fine example to Hollywood of how to make a traditional blockbuster which is reliant on acting, direction and choreography instead of special effects. It may not be fine art but, as Saturday night entertainment, this is an excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film review of Yip man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IP man was directed by Wilson Yip in 2008, and the story was based on real person who was a expert of martial arts. A main character, IP man was one master of Southern Chinese traditional martial arts in 1930's. He had a great skill and always spending time to training. In addition, there were many masters of martial arts around him thus they were good friends and competitors as well. After that, it was happened the war between China and Japan and IP man and Chinese people lost their everything. One day, Japanese soldiers ask them to struggle as practicing martial arts with them and Chinese people accepted it because they can receive food as reward for their type winning. All of them were lost and one master who is IP man's friend was killed by a soldier because of disobeys of Japanese soldier. IP man finished all of Japanese soldiers by his martial arts and then he became a hero among Chinese. Top of Japanese soldier likes his style of martial arts and he asked him to join the group of Japanese but he disagrees with his request. Finally, they decided to fight to recognise which is stronger between Chinese martial arts or Karate in front of all of Chinese people and Japanese soldiers.The main point of IP man is that the main character of IP man actually existed. In addition, the genre is action movie with including historical own martial arts. The background of the film was in Southern China and IP man was a master who did not have his training students and room even he was professional about his martial arts. China has many types of traditional martial arts and the martial arts which IP man was training, was one of famous martial arts. The story is carrying on his basic story. I do not know IP man and Japanese soldier fight in front of many people as last scene but audience may be overwhelmed with emotion when they watch it because they can get feeling if they know IP man was existed in the past. Normally, action movies are complete fiction but IP man is mixing non-fiction and fiction thus it provides to audience to be more realistic and fantasy. Also, it is unique compared with ordinary action films because of mixing. Chinese martial arts have long history and we cannot distinguish but we can see the style of Chinese martial arts by action and it will make us to be more exciting and audience may concentrate their attention on the film scenes. Therefore, audience will know more about IP man and the history of Chinese martial arts because of movie with action.Secondly, IP man shows Chinese culture identity to audience such as traditional culture, background and customs. The main scenes were action with IP man and his martial arts was traditional Chinese martial arts thus I think his politeness was basically in traditional culture and his acting which he try to fight with someone, was particular behaviour compared to other martial arts so audience can notice what Chinese martial arts is by IP man. The background of IP man was historical Chinese views so there are only Chinese traditional buildings and landscapes and also they were wearing traditional Chinese clothes. It shows audience Chinese culture identity. The film was also appeared Japanese people with Chinese and two of them has own martial arts and I believe that this point is effective to audience to watch it. IP man used his Chinese martial arts and Japanese soldier used Karate which is Japanese traditional martial arts. Their martial arts clothes were different and the acting of martial arts was also unlike. Through the scene, I think the director wanted to show audience how Chinese and Japanese martial arts are different and it is good chance to show audience about Chinese traditional martial arts. According to the story, the film could show Chinese culture identity as well.In conclusion, IP man was released in 2008 and the story of the film was located in the China-Japan war and included to Chinese traditional martial arts. Through the movie, audience could find what hero is and how were different between Chinese martial arts and Karate by their actions. I think the movie was effective to audience because it is a chance to show historical Chinese culture and also we can find history between China and Japan. I could recognise and notice about the side of Chinese, Chinese customs and Chinese society when I watched it as foreign audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kung Fu reborn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was never a fan of Kung Fu and Bruce Lee - Jackie Chan kinds of entertainment. What's more, the very concept of a martial arts action movie was seen as pathetically shallow and dim witted. A cheap and flashy form of entertainment for kids... Well, that's how things were before I saw "Ip Man". I do still think that most of hit-smash-thud movies are junk, however, "Ip Man" showed a truly different side to it all.I got acquainted with Yip Man quite unexpectedly, without much hope and expectations. It was a TV premiere on a boring night, and although I seldom watch at the magic box, somehow the move hit me. And man did it hit... First, the thing which left a deepest impression was the historical background. Certainly, the story is loosely based on Yip Man's life, but still, the feeling of reality and real life where "Ip Man" takes place is far better than any of the Mortal Combatish trashy fantasies. China suffered a lot in the first half of the 20th century and destiny of almost every Chinese was affected at some point, just as Man's was. Second, the Wing Chun itself was portrayed not only in a flashy visual splendor, but a twist of art and philosophy in a certain way. Naturally, none of this wouldn't have been possible without the brilliant skills of Donnie Yen and other protagonists who showed the essence of fighting, not only as a physical display of might, but a true struggle between beliefs and understandings.I short - a good frame, very decent photography, historically based story, personal drama, touching music and a brilliant display of martial arts earn "Ip Man" 10 points on my behalf.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are so many martial arts films out there with Donnie Yen in it I never know if I've seen a film with him in it or not. But Ip Man does stand out from the others. I enjoyed the character's relationship with his wife, which I thought gave an interesting side to him. And most of the fights were cool. The whole film had a classy look to it that seemed real. I'm a little sick of the Chinese beating up on Japanese storyline, but I guess it's true to the era which the film is set in. And I thought the final fight was really disappointing. The Japanese general was built up to be such a fantastic fighter but in the end he just seemed lame. But all in all it was an enjoyable film. Gonna watch Ip Man 2 now. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blows Fearless out of the water</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Donnie Yen headlines this excellent biopic of Ip Man, a real-life historical figure who taught Bruce Lee wing chun and overcame Japanese oppression on the eve of WW2. Straight away I was reminded of the Jet Li film FEARLESS, another biopic about a real-life martial artist, but from the first fight scene I knew that IP MAN was going to be better: the wirework isn't as obvious and there are none of the cheesy CGI effects that spoiled some of the fights in the Li film.In actual fact, this turns out to be a brilliant piece of filmmaking that ranks as one of the best kung fu flicks I've seen in many years. It kicks off in typical fashion, with a fight master forced to battle a couple of up-themselves rivals, but then the story gets serious as the Japanese army arrives. As the enemy devise a tournament competition in which Chinese fighters take on Japanese soldiers, I realised I was watching a great, edge-of-your-seat film in which the story is just as good as the action sequences. And what action! It comes thick and fast, is never repetitive, and utilises Sammo Hung as action choreographer; is it just me, or is Hung getting better and better as time goes on? Here he delivers all kinds of brutal battles, from the bloody tournament bouts to a full-scale warehouse brawl and plenty of other decent stand-offs.Donnie Yen underplays his leading role while at the same time getting across a measure of the man's gravitas and dignity ? no hissy fits or show-off moments here, just a quiet dedication to his cause. Simon Yam appears in a minor role, but he doesn't make much of an impact and nor does he need to: this is a film all about the leading figure and the historical backdrop in which his story unfolds. Brilliant action and a brilliant storyline equals a classic movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good martial arts movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not an epic. So don't expect something like "Hero". It's not a complex tale so don't expect "Curse of the Golden Flower". What it is is a very good biopic of Ip Man, arguably the best Wing Chun martial artist of his time. He is portrayed by Donnie Yen, a real life martial artist. His background in the sport along with the masterful choreography by Sammo Hung gives the fight scenes a lot of realism and a lot of style. Wires are used but kept to a minimum unlike the "wire-fu" epics that have over-saturated the market. the contrast between Ip Man's style of Wu Shu and the northerners is subtle but still there. Ip Man's moves are definitely more graceful than the brute force of the northerners. The Japanese viewers may not like the film as it focuses the second half of the film on the atrocities committed by them during World War 2. So obviously, even the soldiers being depicted as "honorable" (such as General Miura) are still capable of despicable acts of violence and cruelty.Ip Man is a period piece and even the film itself has a dated quality about it. The acting is superb with some exceptions. Simon Yam is almost un-recognizable as the factory owner. He was great. But Donnie Yen's stoic face and lack of range sometimes were weaknesses. the actress playing his wife wasn't given much to work with and hence she doesn't have much to show. Many of the Japanese characters were caricatures. But overall it's a very entertaining martial arts movie that has some heart, some story and a lot of realistically choreographed fight scenes. Kudos to Sammo Hung for designing those and Donnie Yen for executing so brilliantly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>highly entertaining with great performance from lead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ip Man starts off as a light, rather humorous movie about martial arts expert Mast Ip, wonderfully played by Donnie Yen with quiet grace and a twinkling eye, who spends his time wowing the town with his amazing (and beautifully choreographed) fights.About a third of the way through there is a marked shift in tone as the Japanese invade China and subjugate everyone, with martial arts masters forced to work in factories and perform in tournaments with the Japanese in exchange for bags of rice to feed their starving children.The darkened mood seems a little odd but works pretty well, and Ip continues to battle for good in some very cool fights. But to me there is a certain disconnect in the earnestness of the movie's hatred of the Japanese (who are portrayed pretty much the way American movies portray Nazis) versus the flashy combat.The story itself is apparently based on a real martial arts teacher but doesn't portray anything that actually happened to him, making it the same sort of nonsensical biopic you get in the U.S. But it is a lot of fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good HK kung fu movie. However, I was really surprised when at the end of the film, a text legend came on screen reading:"April 15, 1945. Emperor Hirohito unconditionally surrendered. CHINA WON THE WAR..."Really? Nationalism is all well and good, but let's be serious; that's like claiming France won in the European Theatre. I'm not saying that neither the French nor the Chinese fought valiantly against the Axis, I'm just saying that I'm pretty sure that those two fully-occupied countries were bailed out by Russia, the British Commonwealth countries and the US. Or maybe that's just propaganda. At any rate, it was a good film, I just thought I'd comment on how ridiculous that revisionist history is. I figured a HK flick wouldn't be affected by that stuff, but perhaps Beijing is more influential in HK films than I thought...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yip Man is a practitioner of Wing Chun and carries himself with great dignity, he spends his days perfecting his art as he beats down challengers with great skill. But then the Japanese arrive during the Sino-Japanese war and Yip Man is forced to become a common labourer, but here he encounters a Japanese general who yearns to fight someone just as great as him, enter Yip Man.Let me first of all say that every fight scene is incredible, it is beautiful to watch, its elegant and fast, but at the same time is eye boggling and exhilarating. The storyline is perhaps in my view the most powerful part of this movie, it is wonderful interwoven and the fight scenes are simply a bonus.Donnie Yen is the main talking point, he is utterly spell binding as the legend that is Yip Man, he physically cannot be out best in today's Hong Kong cinema and honestly, put some of the greats to shame as he lays waste to his opponents.Utterly spellbinding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a great story of one of the most popular Kung fu masters of all time. Ip man. A fighter, teacher who posses a skill unlike any other man on earth. His ability to use his style of Kung Fu led to fame in small increments which his fellow neighbours lavished upon his name. Yet at the time of world war two, his abilities would be put to the test when the Japanese occupied his town with a headquarters in his own house. Thrust to the streets like a common criminal, Ip man finds work to keep his son and his wife above water. Yet in the back ground, is the Japanese soldiers who were trying to display their own brand of boxing, making themselves look more superior. In the midst of this chaos, a friend of Ip's was killed in a local tournament for which the Japanese used to display their skills. Hearing about his death, Ip man then decides to put and end to the tyranny and take on the general himself. With support from his neighbours, Ip man goes into the ring, and gives the audience a display of strength, skill, and complete finesse for which Ip man is known for. He also is the same teacher, who taught the legendary Bruce Lee when he was just a nine year old punk to adult hood. Ip man was to become the ultimate teacher master of his style, and his school with quite possibly, the most effective Kung Fu on the planet. This is a great story of his life, with the tragedies that loomed around every corner, he never looked down or away from a challenge. Excellent cast, and music to fit the times of the most horrible wars that plagued the earth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fight sequences was entertaining to watch from beginning to end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't even know who Ip Man was, but after finding out he was Bruce Lee's master I decided to check this movie out. It's was a pretty good martial arts flick with some pretty good fighting sequences. The scene that really stood out the most though is when Ip Man fights 10 black belts at once, although the other fight scenes didn't really stand out much to me. Maybe cause I seen to many kung fu flicks but it was still pretty entertaining to watch. The story isn't amazing or anything but it's passable, just basically about Ip Man fighting his challengers who are also pretty good martial artists and soon ends up fighting japs that wants and does occupy china. I liked how the story moved evenly paced and watching Donnie Yen(Ip Man) fight using wing chun was really cool for the most part. Although a lot of the stuff that happens is fictional in this movie, it's a movie that is still worth checking out especially for kung fu and wing chun fans.7.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hidden Gem - Think Fearless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie came out of nowhere and swung for the fences! At first I wasn't interested in a movie called IP Man, wondering what it was about, in the IT world IP stands for Internet Protocol. Then a friend of mine on Facebook raved about it and I had to see the movie.The movie was spectacular, a must see. Everything you want in a great movie exists here, excellent fight scenes, character development, anger, passion, it is truly exceptional. The movie has a similar feel to Fearless, so if you enjoyed that flick, this one should rock your world as well. There are a few slower points in the movie as it builds steam, but everything is worth it, especially the 10 man fight! I was on the edge of my seat, and wondered if I could buy a wooden dummy and put it in my home!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wing Chun is really fast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is based on a true story about Yip Man. He was the first to teach the art of Wing Chun that was first introduced by a woman. This is way all the other martial art masters at this time made fun of him. But he proved that it was just as strong and takes a lot of focus making the people around him respect it more. Some still wanted to challenge him though because they believe this art was fake. During this time Yip Man was rich, but the Japanese invaded China and took over his house and money. Being poor, he shows that the love of a family and the love of his art could get him by and one day, make him famous. In fact Yip Man actually helped train Bruce Lee. There are many great actors in this film, but I will mention a few that stick out. The star who plays Yip Man is Donnie Yen, who really shows how fast Wing Chun can be. He has a small rival in the film who is Fan Siu-Wong. He believed his style was stronger than Wing Chun. The last person I will touch base on is Hiroyuki Ikeuchi who played the Japanese general who thinks that Japanese Kung Fu is better than Chinese Kung Fu. Throughout the film you will see many different fighting styles played by great martial artist actors who appear in various US and international films. The film has an OK and touching story. The only problem is at times the story seemed in pieces. This was because they did not want to make the film super long and concentrated more on the fight scenes. But the fight scenes were a pleasure to watch and you can tell they were well planned out. Even though the story is in pieces, you see by the end what the whole picture is about and realize that Yip Man was a great man in Chinese history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the front of the DVD and title of the movie I though it was a comedy. A picture of a Kung Fu master with a big bamboo stick in a deserted town with a lot of katana's in the ground. That sounds a little weird, right? So me and a friend decided to watch this movie.It's an amazing movie. The karate in this movie is good-looking with all the realistic, but also very impressive moves. The acting is pretty good. This movie has its own style and I enjoyed it a lot. Don't watch a few minutes and turn it off because you didn't like the first minutes, give it time.You maybe don't like Kung Fu movies but I didn't either until now when the movie convince me :) And the ending is amazing, not that "american happy ending" you see all the time when a lot of people clap their hands and everybody is happy bla bla bla. Sure it ends happy, but not that OVERWHELMING.Give the movie a chance. You will enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ip Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film was about a martial arts master of wing chun, Ip-man, who defeated a Japanese martial arts general in combat. The plot was set during the Second Sino-Japanese War in Foshan, China, when military weaponry was rising and martial arts remains a shadow. The storyline is like this. In the beginning before the war hits Foshan, Ip-man always had his friend telling him to train his son. He refused because he thought it was unnecessary as it was a time of peace. He practiced wing chun everyday and those good times didn't last long. When the war finally hits them, Foshan became a place of impoverty. Everyone was out of jobs and food was scarce. Ip-man had to stop practicing wing chun and managed to get a job hauling coal because the boss liked martial arts masters. The Japanese men came and took one of his friends to fight in a tournament. The reward for defeating each man in the tournament is a bag of rice. Sadly, his friend got killed, and then Ip-man joined the tournament to invoke vengeance for his fellow countrymen and country. After he defeated the men, the general wanted him to come back again to fight. In the finale, Ip-man defeated the general and opened up a school for wing chun in Hong Kong after the war. The actor for Ip-man was Donnie Yen and I believed he did a fairly good job. His skills in wing chun was realistic and fast. The way he talked was coherent and calm. The dialogue was in cantonese and this was apt for the plot because it was set in Foshan, China. The music was original and was well matched to the mood in the scenes. For example, after Ip-man defeated the general, there was the music of victory playing. The camera movement created much excitement that nearly knocked me off my feet because the martial arts moves were so quick and enticing. The sound created drama and emotion because when Ip-man's moves made contact with the enemies, there were loud cacophonic sounds that indicated bones being cracked and broken.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great martial arts film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about the legendary Chinese martial arts master, Ip Man, whose followers include the world famous Bruce Lee."Ip Man" is of such high quality that I find it hard to believe. Everything from sets, cinematography, scene composition and lighting are all professional Hollywood standard. It feels like watching a Hollywood production, but even better because "Ip Man" successfully brings the vibrant Chinese culture alive.The Kung Fu moves are fiercely real, I feel so sorry for the stunt guys when I see their face twist, their limbs bent at impossible angles and their noses get squashed.As for the plot, the initial half basically contains all sorts of excuses to fight. The second half is intensely emotional, especially for a person of Chinese descent, as it exposes historical wounds. The plot is one intense fight after another, but still contains enough emotional elements to keep non action fans interested.I am pleasantly surprised by "Ip Man". It is certainly the best Hong Kong film for years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Talk about an overrated film, this is it. It's not even as good as it's sequel. It has a higher rating than even Drunken Master 2, and that's one of the best ever filmed. I believe the reason is the people rating it have not seen many films of this type. If they had they would realize this is a very average martial arts film. Yen has done way better films. When people tell me how great this film was I ask what other films with Yen they have seen. None they answer. In fact the only Jackie Chan film one guy saw was The Tuxedo, and not one Jet Li film. People say Yen is the new Bruce Lee, but they are about 20 years off. Maybe in the 90's I would have believed that. Jacky Wu seems to be king now. So it's no wonder this film has such a high rating. Most of the people rating it haven't seen the better films by any one. So they have no foundation to judge upon.</fullReview>

Shortcut: if you like kung fu movies in general, u will like this one. that is were the high rate (8+ now) comes from. If you like "good quality" movies (drama, acting, storyline) in general, this is not recommended. Acting is stiff, development of story is too predictable.

		<fullReview>This movie is not historically accurate at all, it's more like a fairytale based on a historical character.Moreover, we are treated to the boring, same-old-same-old wushu acrobatics with some rapid punching and other "short" techniques thrown in to make it feel more like Wing Chun. But there's still ridiculous kicks and flying bad guys everywhere... yawn. The freaky wounds suffered by the baddies are interesting, but so over the top.Since the Chinese like to portray the Japanese as the ultimate evil (granted, history provides some reason for that), we get a boring depiction of Japanese as evil bastards, predictably combined with a even more boring and overly simplistic representation of Japanese karate.If you can't get enough of the typical Chinese MA movies, AND you've seen the classics from way back, then by all means have a look at this. The fighting choreography in itself is entertaining, and the cinematography is not bad at all.But this movie adds very little to the genre, while in potential it could have been so much more.</fullReview>

Much like a Bruce Lee movie, the plot is really just a method of introducing a number of action/fight sequences, culminating in the Ip Man's confrontation with invading Japanese forces in China's WW II experience. The fight choreography is fast and entertaining, and the movie's villains and heroes cast in stark black and white terms. For all its limitations, Ip Man manages to hold one's attention, providing there is no viewer antipathy for martial arts violence. At times the violence is quite intense, which will probably get it an R rating when it becomes available in the U.S.</fullReview>

But compare with The Warlord is still far.Donnie just try so hard for his acting skill in this movie.We all knew that Donnie Yen is good at fight but in acting he is not a good actor.In this movie he try to concentrate to act so he gave the action director position to Sammo Hung and Liang Xiao Xiong. This time they both not disappointed us. The Wing Chun style looks real and beautiful, the best fight was Ip man challenged 10 Japaneses in Dojo, this is the best from Donnie yen.May be Ip Man is the best movie for him, but compare with Jet Li he still need to do more.we all know that Jet Li is the most popular martial artist in the world for now since Bruce Lee,and Jet Li just won the best actor for his role In 'The warlord' from HK movie award., he proved he can act. Donnie Yen is not bad at fight but for his acting is not too good. He knew it.So he just keep doing hard, Wilson Yip is a talented director.Donnie +Wilson is a good couple. So Ip Man is the best so far for Donnie but we expect more? If you are a martial movie fan, so watch it?7/10</fullReview>

Once again. Ip man had real flaws and went through real problems from rich to wealthy, to poor to dying of drug addiction. what made this man fall that far? is what a movie in his honor should be like. the fact that they let the Ip family be involve was a huge mistake. because i am sure they were against showing Ip man as a real human being. the family was more concern of saving face rather then truly immortalizing this great man.as a practitioner of Wing Chun i am truly disappointed at this world release film but i do have hope, because i know there is another movie of Ip man on the works this one will be directed by the awesome director of "in the mood for love" and starring the only good actor in Hong Kong T. Leung.i hope that this will be a true depiction of Ip Man.as for this 2008 movie, its nothing but a stupid Kung Fu movie with a bad script and plotNuff said</fullReview>
