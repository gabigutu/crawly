		<fullReview>While I have stood idly by and read others comments on so many movies, I feel compelled to say something about this one. Truly a work of art, and it's an injustice that it is not more well known for I stumbled across this movie by chance and had heard nothing of it. This is far better than anything at the theaters now a days and was so well done in every aspect of it. A must see movie for anyone who gets a chance, like an escape away from the usual routine we are accustomed to.From the beginning this movie will grab your attention. From the subtle effects that are done just right, to the acting from all parties of the cast. A very wholesome experience. Perhaps the rest of the film industry could take a lesson or two and make a decent movie like this and not waste millions of dollars on the junk they crank out on a daily basis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ink is not your typical indie film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit, for the first 20 minutes or so of the film I did not enjoy it, and was thinking to myself, "oh, this is going to be one of those movies that no one understands with gaping plot holes and a messed up timeline that is nearly impossible to follow." It quickly turned around. The film is absolutely outstanding for an independent production, with solid acting from the whole cast, BEAUTIFUL cinematography, a good script, and excellent music. The only thing that really bothered me were a few sections of dialogue that seemed to spell out the plot a little too much, and they felt a little out of place. Though it is very difficult to explain the plot, everything makes sense when you see it.Ink is a unique film that has a very professional feel for just a $250,000 project. It feels almost like a hybrid of The Matrix, What Dreams May Come, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. I sincerely hope that you have a chance to see Ink, and hopefully it gets a proper theatrical release. It deserves it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Winans Shows Indies How To Do It Right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a gem. A very ambitious project for such a low budget, it has a large cast, many locations and very effective visual effects. More importantly, it has an interesting and inventive story line, memorable characters inhabited by capable performances and a great pace to the editing. It takes us on a surreal journey back and forth between our world, and that of the title character, Ink. Ink is a neophyte Incubus, part of a race of beings that bring us bad dreams and are invisible to humans. When a Storyteller (part of the race of people who bring us good dreams) encounters Ink trying take the last step to becoming a full-fledged Incubus by kidnapping a little girl, a great battle ensues. We are carried between realities, through time and along a great ride that I know I won't soon forget.There are a few relevant twists that I wont mention here, which unfold effectively along the way. They never seem forced to me, but act as a slow realization. This is one of the things that was most impressive about the film: It was made by a confident and capable director who lets the story reveal itself as it should, trusting the audience to make the necessary connections. A rare trait among independent filmmakers who are either too obtuse and obscure in the delivery of their art, or who err on the other side, dumbing down their story to ensure the audience "gets it". Winans does neither and lets you feel a part of the process with his confidence in your abilities as the viewer. The ending is satisfying without being overplayed, and there was enough going on through out making me want to see it again to look for more.It's not a perfect film, but my quibbles are as much my personal taste as anything else. And those critiques are too small to mention here.Ink has proved to me what can be done on a low-budget and with limited resources when you have a great script and take the time to do it right. I don't know what the budget was, but I'm pretty sure it was ridiculously small for the type of production value Winans delivers. He wrings good performances from the unknown cast through out. And while none were quite Oscar-worthy to me, the large cast blends well together and a few performances are really good. More importantly, none are that red flag you almost always see in an indie film. You know the one. It reminds you that this is being made by a low budget cast and crew somewhere. The action sequences are very effective, interestingly shot and edited without looking like they are the focus of the film. Ink looks, sounds and feel like what we all hope for when going to see an indie: a "real" movie.Folks, you are going to be hearing about this one. I guarantee it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humanistic, existential, social comment in a cinematographic gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is billed as a sci-fi flick about the struggle of good and evil. Don't believe it. It is not, it so much more. Who are you? who were you? Where did the two diverge? Can the thread ever be rejoined? This is a psychological, existential, social commentary, that is a cinematographic masterpiece.Internal struggles, external struggles, is there redemption to be had, how much does one pay for a mistake, how do you come to terms with actions that cause guilt and shame.... Is that chain of events we call life reversible, or inertial and determined until the end? How so?The political slam on capitalism and the analogy of drug addiction to that of power and greed are clearly contrast to true values of family and self worth. They are viewed through an old but effectively employed psychoanalytic lens. But hey are shown not told and you are the witness. This movie could serve as a model for treatment well beyond Freud's limited treatment modalities.Existential issues of life, purpose, death and a hereafter, the quicksand of limbo land, they are all intricately woven in a drama of distorted time imagery, fresh vibrant music, and photography that is gripping, innovative, and alive while allegorical and metaphoric. The acting is superb, the cinematography is as good as anything West of Thomas Imbach and the music is so fresh and coherent that it is often the thread that holds seemingly disparate pieces uncomfortably in place until they are resolved. This is a brilliant film in all regards. See it. It is billed as sci-fi but is as human and humanistic as anything you will see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first started watching this movie I felt that it was going in the typical direction - horror/ fantasy/ gory/ supernatural formula. How wrong I was. It is a movie that has such depth and a life lesson that all of us will learn, or are learning, or have already learned, and that is don't lose your way in this wondrous journey of life and miss out on what are the most important things. It is so easy to get laden down with the burden of day to day survival that we lose sight of what we should hold most precious; love, honesty and forgiveness. This movie, at my time in life, touched me so personally. I cried tears of regret and sadness at missed opportunities and wasted time. I recommend this movie most highly and commend the film makers/ storytellers who created this excellent experience!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>10/10 for pure ambition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a far from perfect movie. The acting was shaky at times, and the cinematography sometimes was overwhelming. This was low-budget, and the flaws that come from those restrictions were clearly evident.However, I'm 100% sure that if this movie had the budget of even a "mainstream" indie, it wouldn't be half the movie that it is. Despite its occasional flaws, I have to give this 10 of 10, simply for the pure ambition of the filmmakers. Ink is challenging stuff.This is a difficult, but meaningful and thought provoking story which requires complete attention. It's not enough to watch it casually, as it'll be completely missed. It's slow starting, but give it a chance and the film is inescapable and deeply affecting.I've seen enough movies of all sorts that I genuinely appreciate when a filmmaker shows me something entirely new and different. Ink delivers, in spades.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Remarkable Indie that defies categorization</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A bold, rich and very remarkable film. This is art, not entertainment. Story: This little movie defies easy categorization; there is nothing quite like it that I am aware of. For students of literature, you will find connection to the work of Dante -- in particular, The Inferno -- and other works that portray a human being losing his/her soul, for that is what this movie is about. There are philosophers (Rudolf Steiner) who believe that the world is literally divided into overlapping, parallel worlds populated by forces of dark and light (not good and evil) where each side works continuously to influence human beings leaning in one direction or the other -- the demon lying upon us as we sleep, feeding us nightmares; the angel gently stroking our forehead, comforting us as we face our deepest fears. This is an epic and continual battle in which the darkness in the world comes from those of us who have committed treasonous acts against our own humanity and suffer, in proportion, consequences for having done so. In film, I would group this with movies like Renee Missel's Resurrection or Blatty's totally brilliant Ninth Configuration. But bear in mind that you are watching an INDIE, which means limited money to make the film. Therefore, production values suffer at times: there are weak special effects, low budget costuming, limits to cinematography, etc. These should be easy to overlook given the scope and depth of this work. Jamin Winans has crafted a minor masterpiece. The ensemble acting is uniformly superb, but Mr. Kelly carries this film with a deeply felt and gifted performance. Though the story may be difficult to follow because of its unique and complex subject matter; in fact, it is tight as a drum with virtually every shot and edit building on those that preceded it, but it will take a second viewing to discover this. The direction is very fine: the film absolutely has a look and feel expressive of its content. The use of off-color green was effective and quietly disturbing, as was the black ink-like flow covering the protagonist at specific moments throughout the film. At a time when our entire culture is in danger of losing it's soul, when so many are seeking insight into something deeper and truer, this film could not be more appropriate. INK is what Independent films are supposed to be: intelligent, deep, inspired, rich, genuine, quirky, imperfect expressions that Hollywood could never make or would simply ruin because of commercial pressures. Mr. Winans -- thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Fantastic Indie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I regret that I watched a pirated download of this movie. It was fantastic, and it truly deserves my money. However, that said, I don't know how else I would have found out about this absolute gem of independent film-making if it wasn't for seeing it on a list of downloads and feeling curious. My ONLY quarrel with Ink is the quality of the visuals themselves. I understand the desire to create a dreamlike, otherworldly atmosphere; but blowing out all the whites and softening the image can only be tolerated for so long. In some ways it makes the movie look cheap, which couldn't be more misleading. I think it's best to go into Ink curious. I didn't really know what the film was about when I began watching it other than it dealt with the idea of parallel worlds (and I think one review equated it with The Matrix some how); but it was a pleasure to let the film unfold in front of me, never knowing exactly where it was going and letting all of the puzzle pieces eventually drop perfectly into place. Although sometimes the costuming leaves something to be desired, the actors wear them confidently and never let you feel like you're being swindled. That said, the acting was top notch. Especially from lead Chris Kelly. Keeping everything I just said in mind, I would like to reiterate that Ink is an INDIE. Those looking for a big-budget thrill-ride will be slightly disappointed. But it is a remarkable indie. It doesn't let it's budget get in the way of a great story, startlingly impressive special effects (car crash scene is top-notch), visionary directing, and chameleon acting. This IS indie film-making. And it's the furthest thing from that soft-spined 'mumblecore' that lovers of independent film have been forced to sleep through for the past decade. I can't wait to see what's next from Jamin Winans. In the meantime I'm going to track down a copy of Ink all legal-like to add to my collection. In fact, if you're reading this post and are interested in watching it, try to find it legally - only because it's worth the purchase and it lets investors see audiences appreciate intelligent independent film-making. It's well worth the purchase.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>let me start with what i don't like; the blind guy and how his eyes cross taped. the idea is interesting but the tape was so shiny new, it wasn't fitting with the enigmatic/dreamy atmosphere. i mean, it was like, they just bought a black electronics tape from the next hardware store and applied on actor's face just in two seconds and patted him from his back and sent to set or something... i don't know. and ink's nose, i keep watching the movie my eyes on it... when it is going to fall? anyway, i loved this movie so much, i'm going to ignore these "little things", yes. besides, incubus folk and their headset was freaking superb. fighting scenes and the music was so in rhyme, it doesn't felt any violent, it felt like art, like, forces of universe in action, the evil and the good, yin and yang. and as an indie film, this make a good blend of happy children's fantasy and dark science fiction. some butterfly effect, some the crow, some pan's labyrinth and even some x-men... if you are not a freaking perfectionist, you will love this movie, it's full of little beautiful fresh ideas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the great pleasure of seeing 'Ink' today at the Starz Film Center in Denver. I had only heard of the movie a few days ago after some internet exploring. From the moment it starts, the film grabs you as you try to figure out what exactly is going on. This goes on for the first half before coming all together during the second half. The story was absolutely heart-touching and I really felt for the characters in the movie. The cinematography was unlike anything I've ever seen before, seeming like a dream the whole time your watching it. Everything about this film was unique and creative - things I would've never imagined. It is hard to describe my experience without giving anything away, but everything about this movie was magnificent - considering it's a small, independent film. It was filmed entirely in my state of Colorado, putting me right into the action as I recognize the locations they are.After the showing, two actors (the man who plays Jacob and the little girl, Quinn) were there answering questions along with one of the producers. This was especially exciting as I learned some very interesting things about the movie. For instance, none of the dialogue was actually recorded with the video. It was all add-libbed during post-production - amazing considering you couldn't tell at all during the film.If you want to see a movie with great production value and a great story that isn't in mainstream Hollywood, go see this movie. It's ten times better then some good Hollywood movies I've seen recently.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Stunning Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never felt luckier to live in Denver. Ink, filmed in Denver, had one of its first screenings tonight and despite going in with no particular expectations, I was completely floored. Nothing about the film indicates that it is a lower-budget, independent film, except perhaps its freedom to pursue such a surprising and ambitious concept.Though it was in production at the same time as these films, it strikes me as mixing the best parts of Pan's Labyrinth and Nightwatch. However, these two excellent films in their own right simply do not match up in my mind. Ink is visually and aurally stunning. The blurring the lines of reality present an allegorical tale that is emotionally gripping and philosophically challenging.I'm not easily taken to high praise, but I really think this may be THE movie to see in 2009. I just hope people get the chance to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are you serious? Not sci-fi. Not any genre. Not good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was appalling to watch. The moment that I started to see the cheesy effects and overexposed shots, I started to suspect I was in for a disappointing evening.The plot is almost entirely incoherent until the end, which would not be problematic, except that the only reason the audience is left in the dark is to hide the poor storytelling. The dialogue throughout the film is banal at the best of times and absolutely revolting during the rest--which is to say, most of the film. Furthermore, the characters are all either one-dimensional or archetypes that have been recycled too many times and in better films.To say that the acting is subpar, would require a Ghandi-like generosity of spirit that I simply do not have. The "pathfinder" character is played by someone who attended the Dane Cook School of Acting. The only actor/actress with any real talent is the little girl. The rest of the cast displays as much subtlety as a Thomas Hardy novel.Many of the shots during the film--especially the main character's flashbacks--play like a Zales commercial. They are saccharine enough to cause early-onset diabetes. This is worsened by being combined with poorly choreographed fight sequences and unimaginative special effects. (Dark City from which Ink stole the portrayal of the incubus had far superior special effect over ten years ago.) The pacing of the film is unnecessarily slow. I would liken the experience to traveling 5 mph in a beat up Ford Pinto through a ghost town that has been lit on fire.In summary, I would rather give myself a root canal with rusty coat hanger than have to watch this again.Many people like this film......they are wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ink is a nicely done low-budget indie film with an interesting visual style. It's not a masterpiece, but it's really quite well done, despite some fairly weak acting (in some places it's downright cringe-worthy.) The dialog ranges from clever to humdrum, but I've heard worse in blockbusters from big studios, who don't have the excuse of a low budget and limited resources. The story is simple, but told in a non-linear fashion that I found interesting but never baffling. Nothing in the movie seemed arbitrary or random. It was obviously a labor of love, and I for one am willing to overlook the flaws and appreciate this film as a sincere and energetic effort by a director with potential.</fullReview>

Shot on the cheap on what appears to be in a digital format the film more often then not seems to have better ideas then the ability to execute them. The whole thing is okay, but far from anything special. Its not something that I need ever see again and makes me wonder what all of the fuss (what little there is) seems to be about.</fullReview>

I watch the B movies looking for those rare gems, and I can tell you without a doubt that this is not one of them. In fact, it speaks volumes that I couldn't sit through very much of this flick, maybe 10 minutes is all I could endure. I was fooled by the rating this movie got, and the description sounded good too. I don't understand why films like this even get made much less receive ratings usually reserved for Hollywood blockbusters. I think that the demographic of movie watchers that go for this kind of dribble are also the sort more likely to write reviews, so it ends up being a lopsided thing. Well I'm here to balance the scales and tell people who actually enjoy well acted, well written, and well directed movies not to bother with this pile of rubbish. I've seen better amateur Youtube videos by people with handy-cams. If all a film needs for you to fall in love with it is a child, then you'll love this one, but if you expect substance, you won't find it here.</fullReview>

Much has been made of its low budget "$250,000) and self production. To me it works for this film. The film is coupled with a beautiful composition which is featured through out the film but mainly featured in a scene called "Johns walk" which is a paramount moment towards the movie's pinnacle moments. Fight scenes and music score are brilliantly put together, and the plot is cleverly confusing to start with but easy enough to follow at the given moments.

It may be that this is meant to be esoteric and I'm just too dim to accept it as a construct , but I think it's fundamentally challenging the audience to care despite itself and I just didn't. The basic premise is good , if only they had executed it better , and made it watchable rather then risible.Avoid at all costs , if you want weird quality film making watch City of Lost Children instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie had a mesmerizing, almost entrancing, effect on me, maybe because I am not too eclectic on technicalities such as acting critique or editorial competence ... I can only evaluate the film for its holistic effect as an end viewer.As a whole, I felt, it worked in delivering its message; leveraging on heavy symbolism and elements of fantasy. The one issue I do have is that in the end its philosophy had a stark black vs white world view (you are either good or bad, and if you begin to submit to "bad" thoughts you turn ugly and recruit yourself into darkness). It is a very simplistic message reminiscent of a religious mindset and foundations.However, I chose not to interpret its symbolism as supernatural but rather a representation of the thought patterns of the protagonist's inner instincts and tendencies being represented as anthropomorphic forces that battle each other. Nonetheless that was stretching it, since the movie does portray the interaction between a physical and a supernatural world, as well as elements of fate and divine intervention in presenting us with new opportunities to reevaluate our choices.Overall, I value and respect this movie as a sociological artifact of the Christian mindset.</fullReview>

Shades of 'The Fisher King' came to me over the waves of this.I can fault 'Ink' - some things I think are a little too drawn out, and one or two things I would have done differently. But this is not my film.As an indy effort it's just fantastic to see this kind of work stand up, fully professional, fully polished, and tower above similar attempts by big commercial studios... I think Ink dwarfs a lot of them.And for those wanting to know what this film is about...?It's been told before: in Samurai tales, in epic fantasies, in dark gritty stories of drunkards and ruffians finally finding...It's beautifully shot, and never 'clunks' - though, as I say above, I think it does draw some scenes and story components out a little too - and put a tear in the corner of my eye, aye.The evil is wonderfully portrayed, scary, and the good is battle-weary and working hard - there is no holier-than-thou, no sermons on the mount, no pontification.And that's about all I can say! I really did, diddly, did like this film Ink.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Indie film, a few flaws, spoilers below</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked it overall. The mythology was good for me, the storytellers versus the incubi and the wanderers were vaguely relevant. An interesting way to talk about the world of souls and say that they work in our dreams.The low budget effects were excellent, 10 out of 10 stars for technical work. Amazingly appropriate for the situation, parts going back together after being broken because after all, this is is just a dream. Simple and perfect. as usual the voice track is too quiet for my old ears. I have to turn up the volume to the point where music and effects are too loud so I can understand the dialog. Common problem in many films.The business talk was intentionally mundane, a little too "yada-yada" maybe.The reveal was poignant for me because I didn't see it coming. I do sometimes but not in this film and that could be because the middle dragged for me and I didn't pay attention. The march to the Assembly was vaguely important but it appeared that compassion for the storyteller was the motivator behind Ink's change of heart. Since he had lost his memory, I guess that makes sense but even in the real world, Dad only visited his daughter because he was in the hospital. There wasn't enough transition in his thinking to explain if this was simple curiosity, convenience or the Scrooge-redemption moment I think was intended.Love the effects and mythology, a little slow in the middle, poignant reveal, worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard about Ink after having been recommended the Soundtrack so naturally I was interested in seeing the film.I was a little apprehensive on hearing it was an indie film, and was being compared to such films as Donnie Darko, which I loved, but they are often extremely trying and rarely do they get it completely right!But I'm happy to say it wasn't like that at all. The film, for me at least was not difficult to understand (if you pay attention!)It's a very heart-warming story about a little girl and her daddy, and having become a father to a little girl myself in the last year, the tale will always have a place in my heart.My one minor complaint was the acting was a little hammy at times, but take nothing away from this film, and I'm really looking forward to what Mr Winans does next.See it you wont be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>more than a movie, it is a trip in yourself. dark and bright, moralistic and smart. it is a splendid embroidery and a memorable film. a splendid surprise because it is a fantasy about basic things of life. and the manner to cut entire story, piece by piece, level by level, it is special. it can be a fairy tale or a religious film. scene of spectacular fight scenes or only a picture about impact between worlds. reflection of reality. but, for me, it is an inspired occasion to remember to viewer who is himself. in a powerful, profound, amazing manner. at first sigh, it is a film like many others. in fact, it is just a precious experience. maybe not a masterpiece in common sense but a master work because out of artistic value remains the trace of a message for every day. a form of wake-up and translation of existence in wise convincing speech.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most underrated movies I've watched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off... The movie is unique. I must say, that when I stated watching the movie, I didn't know what to expect. The story leads us in to a world not yet seen as depicted in the movie. So it took me quite a while to figure out what the movie is all about. Sure, you know you have the good and the bad guys, but the deeper meaning of it all... It was the one thing that really hooked me in to the movie. So when the story evolved I got the feeling what was the meaning of the story,so the ending didn't surprise me that much. But all in all, the movie left a good feeling of being very watchable with a unique story and interpretation of our... Sleep? I must say, that I gave the movie a 9 out of 10, strongly because I liked it. I liked the story, the ending, the MESSAGE. The message is not Donnie Darko hard, it's simple. So if you're wondering if you should watch it... Yes! You may not like it, but remember to always look at this movie as a message in a world called fantasy. The acting is not the best I'v ever seen, but it is good. So, without spoilers... Watch it ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ink is a touching story about the possibilities of our decisions and their consequences. It follows the life of John, the protagonist, focusing on his relationships with his wife and daughter.The conflict manifests itself in an alternate reality where people called Storytellers come to us in our sleep and give us hope-filled dreams. Opposing them are Incubi, who give us nightmares.The film broaches the philosophical struggle of choice--what is or what might be our lives because of our choices--while presenting the values of family, life, and love.I give it a 9/10 for its creativity and beauty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great low budget fantasy film. For what was obviously a ridiculously low budget, they have made a complex, dense and inventive film about dreams, monsters and family. Wonderful use of Denver for the locations (I'm a native, we don't get to see D-Town in flicks too often. Love it!) and intelligent, effective effects work really helped to flesh it out. It is hampered at times by the low budget. It was obviously filmed using medium quality digital cameras, and the writing and acting were a bit dodgy at times. But overall, the story and the feel of the world they created almost completely overcomes these failings. I really think that if word spreads, this could be come the next Donnie Darko-esq cult hit. Powerful, entertaining and imaginative, if you are thinking about watching this, don't let the low budget look stop you. This movie is definitely worth your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jamin Winans and Kiowa Winans...remember these names one day they will be world renowned filmmakers. Jamin Winans wrote and directed this fantastic sur-real film. Kiowa Winans did a brilliant job with art and special effects for a low budget.SHAME ON YOU Hollywood (and any other film company) for not investing in this brilliant movie.This movie is truly a independent film. It was written, directed and featured newbies. Art, costume and make up were done by newbies. They probably rehearsed in someones basement and edited the film in someones kitchen. So independent that it was filmed thousands of miles away from Hollywood (Denver Colorado).Special effects are truly original and even though simple very effective. I particularly liked the very creative way they presented the Incubus. I do not want to tell you too much about the story but will say it involves like a alternate dimension with good and bad dream weavers of some sort.The only complaints I have are the movie moves a little slow at times, which is common for new directors. And some of the acting is a little rough...but still good for low budget actors.Anyway...this is the kind of Independent movies that should win awards. RENT this movie! If you can not find it in a local movie store...get a Netflix account and rent it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got through watching Ink for the second time, with about two months between viewings. I tried to write a review right after the first time, but I couldn't find words to express what I felt about this story. I still don't have the words: I know that I don't have the gift of poetry required to do this movie justice.All I can do is marvel at a movie that finally got things right. This movie is listed as 'sci-fi', but it is nothing of the sort. Its philosophical center is a brilliantly presented flower of religion (this coming from a jaded atheist philosopher.) "Brilliant," because so much was put forth without explanation: there were no clumsy pseudo-scientific 'reasons' for things to be the way they were. This allowed for Light and Dark to be non-contingent: dependent on nothing for their being. From this flows a purity of purpose, and of action: things are because they are; beings act because their nature necessitates such actions/reactions; not because they're the result of a profitability calculation.I have never seen such a simple yet logical theology, and I'm just amazed that the actors pulled off such a delicate presentation of something so unexpected. In a scene halfway through the movie, when I realized that the filmmaker was using the Storyteller as an analogue for Jesus, I was prepared right there to hate this movie. Christianity dresses the concept of a Savior in a retarded package: A god who sacrifices Himself to Himself in an attempt to appease Himself because a creature that He is responsible for creating violated a rule that He made up. I was prepared to hate the Storyteller because I thought that my intelligence was about to be insulted; I didn't think there was any other choice, given the source material. I was very much wrong. The filmmaker somehow managed to simplify the concept to the point where all the stupidity was burned away. Because the actress played the part perfectly, I was completely won over by the end of that scene. I honestly can't believe how she managed to act warm, loving, and comfortable in her skin yet still come across as having distinctly other-than-human perspective as would befit an eternal being. Ink is just one fantastic trip. The climax is like nothing else I've ever encountered.As has already been pointed out, Ink does start off discontinuously. I don't chalk this up to artistic BS, though. I think it is needed to cue the audience into the fact that there is something different in the underlying philosophy. If Ink had been played straight, I know that I would have made the mistake of applying the standard dependent philosophy of a sci-fi/action/drama to it, and it just wouldn't have made any sense in that light. I'm glad it shook me out of my preconceived expectations and allowed me to see the gem beneath.Ink is like a Donnie Darko that can actually be understood, since it banks on common religious concepts. If you can follow the filmmaker's adjustments to that context, the story within is poignant beyond words.9/10, and the only reason I don't rate it as absolute perfection is because the Pathfinder's introduction was poorly played. Ink really is just that inch away from a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Indie movie with an amazing ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say I've rarely been torn about a movie that much. First off, for a low-budget indie production, this movie is great, no doubt. But how does it compare to the Hollywood productions with similar ideas? The beginning is very strenuous to watch. It takes a long time before you will understand anything that's going on. This will not change until somewhere between the middle and the end, and thus frustrate many viewers.The story itself is creative and refreshing, but very confusing, I guess you could call it an adult fairy tale. The movie raises questions about family values, moral obligations, self-esteem and shame, all of them well developed and executed.The actors are mostly doing a good job, although some of the supporting actors' (one actress in particular) emotions are a bit too extreme to be believable, but this does not really disturb the illusion and is merely a minor inconvenience.The effects are worth their money and quite impressive for a low-budget production.What ultimately makes this movie worth watching, however, is the truly great ending. If you are patient enough to sit through the movie as a whole and pardon the few flaws in it, you will be rewarded with an emotional, surprising and heart-warming ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well firstly I must say all the shills in this comment/review section suckered me into watching this film. Really before I start trust me that they are shills without a doubt. No sane person unrelated to the makers of this film would ever give it over 5/10. Well I'll start with the positives- There are some nice effects here and there with one glaring exception. The succubus bad guys do look quite sinister using simple but quite effective tricks. The filters and muted colours are evocative and suit the material.OK that's that over with. Now I will try to keep the negatives relatively succinct so this doesn't turn into an epic post.The script is just a shambles. Utter juvenile trash. I mean this rubbish manages to make Twilight look like dostoevsky. That bad. The theme of dreams is apt as the plot seems to have been literally dreamed up over night. Or probably during the course of a daydream while sat on the bus to work(school). There is little explanation of the tenuous reasons for the bizarre dream people who give good dreams etc. And if you can manage to get to the toe curling finale you will probably feel very frustrated. The kung fu fighting while adequately choreographed and performed lacks any real context and as a result any real impact. The lead actor is the only actor who seems to have anything even approaching professional abilities, and those are rendered laughable by one half of his role which includes the comically bad prosthetic nose. I do actually feel sorry for that guy as if he wasn't literally smothered by this juvenile nonsense he may be capable of putting in an acceptable sub-bale performance.The characters are all paper thin and range from the simply annoying to the truly silly. Stupid angel with no eyes character tries so hard to be annoyingly funny but is just annoying. The storyteller has some of the most toe curling and awkward lines I have heard. And there are some other people. That's about the best I can say. There are some other people who say some things that are irrelevant and have some irrelevant kung fu fights. Although the little young girl does actually manage to not be annoying or precocious.The dialogue is consistently dreadful throughout and really reaches a peak of absurdity towards the end. Leaden and ham fisted platitudes pour from your speakers like a sonic cancer. Well thats about all I can say really. This is easily the worst film I have ever wasted my time on and I have seen some real stinkers. Jamin Winans as I note is listed as director/producer/writer/editor/composer. Well maybe for your next film you might think about sharing some of that load with some people who can actually do that work. You know, maybe get some of those shills to actually help you make a good film instead of spamming IMDb with nonsense reviews. I understand this is an indie low budget feature but that really doesn't excuse the utter rubbish that has been produced. If anything this film is pretty negative for indie features as there is such a gulf between this and a good high budget film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I get that this is supposed to feel surreal given the plot/setting, however I feel this movie that might've gotten 10 stars from me falls far short due to the cinematographic style - it was nearly enough to give me a headache, and I had such high hopes for this film based on the synopsis. There is a point where presenting an "artsy" film is a disservice to the story itself.Now that I've gotten that off my chest, I do have a few friends I'll recommend this movie to because the story is an engaging one, and I enjoyed the "prologue" and the ending.Would I have felt cheated if I had paid the price of a ticket and theater refreshments to see this? Probably not. If I had first seen it in a theater, would I venture to a theater to see it a second or subsequent time? Probably not. Do I feel cheated for paying the price of a Blu-ray? No. Will I watch my Blu-ray copy more than once? Too late, I already have - and probably will again. So, 6 stars - I can't offer more than that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ink oozes ambition, creativity and authenticity. It's a pretty simple movie told with originality and various thematic elements. However, a few things hold it back from standing out even more. Number one and the most annoying of them all is the camera-work and editing. There are so many camera shots in each scene that it gets quite irritating. Even a 30 word dialogue between 2 people has over 20 different shots. The fighting scenes also suffer from the same issue and also the shaky-cam syndromeNumber two, the pacing. This is probably my opinion and despite of listing various thematic elements as an advantage, i believe that there are a few too many for a 100 min. film. The movie feels like a race, like 'Crank' but with an elegant story. I don't think that works very well. There are many subtleties that just pass by so fast. Maybe the fast camera-work is the cause of that too. Number three. The two minutes explanation of the events of the movie. I think that it should be more subtle and shouldn't have tried to explain everything. It wasn't that hard to figure out the meaning yourself but instead you get the explanation served. It makes you feel like an idiot. You were subtle thus far, why try to explain it in the end. Clockwork orange or Blade runner didn't and that's why there are so highly regarded among other things. All in all, the film is entertaining, ambitious and quite original. All movies have a few cons but these felt quite important so Ink gets a solid 7/10. Looking forward for more projects from Jamin Winans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Cry Over Spilled Ink</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone has dreams. Some are good, some are bad, and some are never remembered. In the movie "Ink," directed by Jamin Winans, the reason we have dreams is due to "storytellers." These are people known as "wanderers," or people in limbo. They walk into people's rooms and transfer images into their heads while they sleep. They present people with pleasant dreams. There are also men who create nightmares, they are called "incubus." Ink (Chris Kelly) is a wanderer who is in initiation to become an incubus. In order to do this, he must sacrifice a little girl, Emma (Quinn Hunchar,) to the head of the incubus. Stealing her in this world, however, leaves her physical body in a comatose state. The storytellers are trying to return her soul to her body. To do this they must hunt down Ink and recover her. The movie has a lot of good film elements. The fact that it is a fairly low-budget indie film is surprising. The lighting changes throughout the scenes: bright amber colors in the world of the storytellers, dark blues and blacks with contrast of bright white smiles in the incubus realm, and blurred edges in scenes where memories were involved. Character development is also impressive in this film. There is John (Chris Kelly,) Emma's father, his life blooms and crashes as the film progresses. His love towards his wife (Shauna Earp) is shown, including the way they met and the birth of Emma. When she dies, he feels there is nowhere to turn except for drugs and alcohol. There is Jacob (Jeremy Make,) a blind "pathfinder" (another type of wanderer,) who can feel what he calls "the beat of the world." This is the connection between all things on earth, cause and effect, as some call it "the butterfly effect." Jacob's dialog is also very odd, he is often cussing, counting to four, or making jokes. The intention of this film is to never forget who you are. Throughout the movie, John is losing himself both mentally and physically. His wife is dead, his daughter got taken from him by her grandparents, and his work is stressful. He doesn't have much to live for. In one flashback, he is blowing off Emma as she is being attacked by her imaginary monsters. Suddenly she is on his shoulders as he is running around screaming "Get away from my daughter" and fighting off the monsters. Until the end, he does not realize that he was becoming one of these monsters he promised to destroy. This helps him turn around and become the father Emma needs in her life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A future glimpse at movie making in Denver Colorado</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying, being from Denver, I have a bias. This film was shot entirely in Colorado - a rarity, since Colorado State has been slow to give production studios the tax incentives they need. This is changing, and the change is welcome. Most movies taking place in Colorado, up until recently, were shot elsewhere.At a $250K budget, this movie tries to do A LOT! So I respect the effort Jamin Winans went through to make it, and make Denver look like a little Manhattan of the West. The mountain scenes are ethereal too (shot in Crested Butte, the grove of white-barked Aspen is only known to people who've been to the high country in fall - it's a welcome site to a Colorado native.There is enough substance here to justify 20x the budget, and this is perhaps where the movie falls short. It might have been better served to release it in three parts - each with a moderately higher budget. This would have allowed for a richer back-story and character development of the Storytellers, the Incubi and how drifters like Ink are transmuted from reality into an alternate plane of reality.Despite its shortcomings of fast cuts, and soap-opera acting ... it's worth a watch. Especially if you're from Colorado - or if you've ever wanted to visit. This movie signifies a new beginning for Colorado-based movie productions. We have everything here - except an ocean (wait, does Chatfield lake count? :-)</fullReview>

Considering the very low budget, the film for the most part looks great (though I do think they over-do the artistic lenses look and the jerky camera in action scenes are annoying) and generally the acting is very good. But as previously mentioned it's the story that keeps you immersed along with the music and interesting characters and I would definitely recommend this.I may be a little bias in parts, because I love dream themes movies (being a strong practitioner in lucid dreaming) so I am especially keen when these types of films come along; but go and watch it guys... literally 5 mins after watching this I went and bought the DVD online.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Commendable but not quite the Cult classic it describes itself to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The praises and great reviews this film receives is quite understandable with it being such an ambitious concept and being so visually captivating on such a low budget.The film itself touches on many philosophical topics of spirituality, psychology and the human condition and does so in a very bold sci-fi setting. The film is commendable on good performances from most of the cast with great lighting, innovative cinematography and CGI rivaling some of the studio budgeted films. My critiques with the film lie with its science fictional nature and its lack of solidifying a foundation for the audience about its far fetched premise leaving us for the most pulling at straws about whats happening. While understandably this could have been intentional, I however feel that for such a science fictional plot it didn't do enough to explain what was really happening leaving loose ends and causing me to loose a bit of interest through out the film rather than drawing me in further.Additionally I also would like to note that where the description of the film compares its self to Donnie Darko, The Matrix, Dark City and Pans labyrinth it definitely doesn't guarantee that you will have the same feelings about this movie. Given the movie has a similar dark/though provoking feel with a science fictional nature it certainly doesn't connect on the same level as any of those films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A mesmerizing film that will appeal to anyone who is intrigued by visually inventive, creative storytelling. The movie is somewhat disjointed in the beginning, but everything is explained by the time the story is complete. I love writers and directors who can see beyond the "real" to come up with a new way to create an interesting plot line. This is an independent production, therefore, anyone looking for Hollywood production values will be disappointed. But for everyone else Ink is worth the viewing.This story is about good and evil, which is in all of us, and that it is our choices that inform our fate. But what is really great about Ink is the look of the film. The visual effects and the music create a dreamlike state of unreality that moves the story back and forth between the dream and the real world. The good dream bringers battle the evil incubus, whose costume design is truly creepy and fantastic. I look forward to what this director and production team will create in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is about a spirit that kidnaps the sleeping spirit of a child into a mystical side-universe that exists. . .I guess, on the other side of Sleep.And the struggle of those who keep the balance between the StoryTellers and the Bringers of Nightmares. . .I think.In the middle is an estranged father and his struggles with his family and the daughter who goes into a coma because of her spiritual kidnapping.The colors are deliberately monotone washed &amp; sepia-ed because it's really a story told from the OTHER side of reality. The special effects are actually very well suited to the low budget-- which focuses more on the ACTING than it does Special Effects. But if you let yourself ride with the flavor of this movie, it's a VERY intriguing ride.Think of a story from the Sandman Universe brought to the screen. Then the notion of using little magical drums to open doorways between dimensions has a nice proper fit. Also-- this mythos is NOT in the usual Judeo-Christian-witchcraft mold. It takes its Dream Mythos from a different cultural place and I find that divergence enthralling.And at the same time, there is a undertone of modern tech horror to it in the Incubi that is nicely coupled with the overall flavor of corporate dystopia.I call this a translation of a mystical Graphic Novel concept to the screen, and it does so VERY WELL. And if you have been exposed to CURRENT Graphic Novels, you know that there is a level of Complexity &amp; Maturity that goes way beyond the old Superhero comics you read as a kid.Turn the Lights down on a late night and watch this one.</fullReview>

I really don't want to leave any spoiler in this review, but only to help others to understand that you can't call yourself a movie lover if you haven't seen Ink. The story is so creative, the soundtrack so well chosen and the direction so amazing that you have to see it to believe it!...

The way things are revealed and the timeline is shuffled is wonderful... the way they folded the perspectives into side by side realities in side by side worlds... the way the two warring dreamarmies are designed... the way the target is the ink.The price they decided to pay was to put it all into the service of a profoundly syrupy confection of moral simplicity. family/child = good, money/career = bad. But one level higher it becomes coolly reversed. This is film, but the bad guys are the ones with the film presence. The saviors are a storyteller and a blind seer who never meet. The conflict is designed not to reflect real conflict, but something staged so that you can see. It is an acceptable price. The storytelling is wonderful, just wonderful. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So bad it's awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As noted elsewhere, the relentless "10 stars!!!" shilling is enough to make you grind your teeth flat, but when you try to watch this lamentable piece of hooey, you'll want to scoop your eyes out with a rusty spork and wash your brain with a cruise missile.. It's relentless garbage, dressed up in dreadful gimmicky post production, and looks like the kind of nonsense a no budget student could throw together in a week on After FX or Final Cut with a few overused plug-ins. There are no redeeming features at all. The acting is rank amateur, the scripting is non existent, the cinematography sucks big time, and the direction is laughably inept. Quite who these aspartame-raddled shills are who are hyping this to the heavens, well.... I'd be amazed if someone as untalented as the director actually had that many friends. PR budget bigger than the movie itself? Looks suspiciously like it.In a contest to make the worst film possible with the limited means and imagination at their disposal, this outranks even Gymkata. And we all know how "wonderful, amazing, groundbreaking, and visceral" that was. If you can retain the will to live through the entire movie, your fortitude is to be admired. I hope the doctors bring you out of the coma soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The predicted age of cheap digital storytelling accessible to anyone with a vision is coming true</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best way I can approach this movie is to compare it to a similar discovery situation, Night Watch. Occasionally these small movies come out that nobody has ever heard of that suddenly appear on the rental wall in the midst of all the noise, with an appealing cover that reveals a visual experience different from the norm. When Night Watch appeared, however, I was mostly disappointed by a poorly written fantasy movie of the usual tropes with directing and editing that tried its damnedest to be completely unwatchable. When I discovered Ink, the first interpretation was that I had gone down the same path--only for the movie to slowly reveal it's true nature as a slyly paced, WELL-written fantasy... .of the usual tropes.Part of the difficulty in getting into this movie is the seven different beginnings it has. It honestly takes a while for the plot to build any momentum, and I fear quite a lot of people may be turned off of the movie before it reaches it's full velocity. The story is about a man named John, separated from his daughter, who has to rediscover his shame and get knocked out of his escapist over-successful capitalist life before his and his daughter's soul is lost. Instead of being a metaphorical drama, however, the characters are revealed through a parallel universe of Storytellers and Incubi. Storytellers are dream creators that go house to house spreading cheer and hope in people's sleep. Incubi, thus, are the demonic flashy-eyed people straight from Sin City and The City of Lost Children that are the necessary foils, spreading bad dreams and despair. A mysterious, ugly, shrouded man named Ink appears and steals John's daughter from her guardian Storyteller so that he can take them to the Incubi and become an Incubus himself. This theft then becomes a journey of redemption as the daughter's Storyteller in the parallel world and John in the real world have to come to the aide of the daughter--without ever having contact with each other, and in John's case, without even knowing he's on a quest.Admittedly, as fantasy movies go this one screams of a writer/director who has read way too much Neil Gaiman. Nevertheless, for that particular sub-set of fantasy genre (the parallel universe as journey for character change in the real world) is a successful formula, and the visual aspects of this movie are quite unique. The editing will turn off anybody who likes the camera to linger for more than a second on anyone's face but, as annoying and jumpy as it gets I can't honestly say it wasn't without purpose, as Jamin Winans is aiming for a beat and the fighting sequences pop in a way that I haven't seen before. What happens with this movie is, it starts to seem like it isn't going anywhere and that the style is causing the narrative to fall apart until a sequence where the beat of the world is revealed from a man named the Pathfinder, at which point the internal logic of the movie finally click into place, the gears start turning, and the rest of the pieces fall into order. It is unfortunate that it takes so long for the movie to get to that place, but on the other hand most of the first half is just trying to figure out how to get all of the many elements of the story introduced, and the low-budget production value of the thing reveals they didn't have much options.Which brings me back to my comparison with Night Watch. Night Watch's problems entirely consist of the fact that the director, Timur Bekmambetov, doesn't give a crap about what happens in the story as long as he gets to show off the thousands of different shots he thinks makes the movie look bad-ass. The result is a frustratingly stylistic movie where nothing can be seen because it cuts too fast and the twist at the end makes no sense whatsoever. Ink is the glad foil to that, a stylistic movie that shows off thousands of different shots that make the movie look bad-ass, mostly because the director is trying to fit so much information into what eventually builds into a story that he originally has a bit of difficulty telling. It's not a perfect movie by any means, and it may not get Winans a deal to make some egregiously over-budgeted movie like Wanted, but what it really reveals ultimately is that even crazy digital fantasies such as these are within reach of imperfect storytellers who nevertheless want to make a special effects movie and get it distributed.Did I mention distribution? Oh yeah. By the way: distributors turned from this as a lost cause because unlike Night Watch, it didn't get Quentin Tarantino's seal of approval. The result? Bittorrent fame as Ink was released on the Internet to garner word of mouth praise. The result? Ink is now on DVD. Like this year's Paranormal Activity, Ink is revealing what people have been talking about whimsically for the past decade: cheap digital equipment is making even the most SFX-filled fantasy movie ideas accessible to independent filmmakers with a vision and a story to tell. It's happening now. The result? Who knows, but without an ounce of irony I say this movie is better than Transformers 3 will be.I have also seen a short movie by Winans called "Spin", and so far it seems he is a director interested in the musical beat of movies and how they can affect the -- literal -- pace of narrative. It'll be interesting to see if he develops these ideas further and how many different ways he can go about it.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

If you like big budget sci-fi flicks with a nice linear storyline so its easy to absorb then this film isn't for you. If you are looking for something a bit more thought provoking and different then you will love this film like i did. The acting was spot on, the soundtrack sublime and ambient, and the effects.. well i have to say for low budget they're pretty bloody outstanding. I can see why this lil movie gained popularity so quickly. Definitely the best film of 2010 I've seen so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A symphony of the mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first review on IMDb. I just finished watching this movie and the movie itself inspired me to post my first review. Why? IF you are like me you come to IMDb to get a first, second or third opinion before considering to invest yourself in a movie. Based on this fact and no other qualifications, my opinion might be of some use.I give this movie a 10 because it was the type of movie that after having watched it you walk away a better person, nothing offended me such as the acting, and cinematography etc. in fact I do not even remember the directors name, really I Just wanted to see an inspiring film.This film as best as I can put it is like classical music as opposed to rock music. Therefore get ready for a slow absorbing symphony, if you are not in the mood, come back when you are and watch it. If you are expecting the typical run of the mill action movie you are going to be bored to death.Now if you are the type of person who woke up one day on planet earth and have been spending your life until now with no purpose other than to get what is yours and in the meantime irritate others and perfect yourself in practicing the seven deadly sins, the movie is not for YOU! In fact you won't understand it and it will only aggravate you, but it will provide you some time to pull out some unwanted nose hairs and then conclude by posting your review here and rating this movie 1-5 stars.On the other hand if you are a person with a multidimensional mind who believes in the complexities of life and the hereafter and the effects of your choices this film will portray a unique example in its characters, cinematography and story-line. So for you it is a MUST see symphony for the mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ideas...check. Acting...no. Writing...no. Adds up to: Not great. - 4 of 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stiff acting from most of the cast and terrible dialogue are two of the worst transgressions this film made. In one scene, I there were 30-40 clichs strung together spewing from every character. Many others are found throughout the film. This is on par with one of the worst writing jobs I've ever heard. I can overlook the constant over-exposed shots, the cheap sets and the inexpensive method in which the film is shot, but simply tell us a good story. It fails in this endeavor. I end up not caring halfway through because they haven't sold me on it, and well...I've checked out. I cease to care, and still I persisted. I was not rewarded.The trivial nature that the film seemed to adopt early on with the fighting initiated it's descent into tedium. At the moment the actors actually started speaking, the careening steepened. I didn't believe anyone. They had not convinced me. Neither through the words they spoke or in the nature in which they spoke them. I thought some of the characters were just awful. Especially the father. Without revealing anything, his motivations seemed quite obtuse. Once again, I didn't believe it.I cannot completely condemn this film as I liked some of the elements it had to offer: the blown bill sequence, the flat panel glasses guys, and the flicker effects were among them. The little girl was the only one I believed. She did well.Ultimately, I felt like I was watching a student's film. Nice idea, very poor execution. Do not go out of your way for this one. Isn't there a Seinfeld rerun on? For effort and a couple of clever concepts, I can only muster a 4 of 10.</fullReview>

According to this storyline, there exists multiple universes, one verse there is humankind, in another verse, kinda like the other side, after we die, where our souls exist, there is the ones, supernatural beings, who control the first universe. They intertwine, and help to control the previous universe. Two factions divide the control, one who create positive dreams and one who create nightmares. They are at a constant conflict. Sorta good versus evil scenario. There's an underlining story about a man who is dealing with his own situation in this world. He's lost many things, mainly his real world life, and he comes to terms with it and gets his focus back eventually. Anyway, this film was well done and must see.

It is a deeper kind of positivity, and it is brought into a visually fascinating movie with a good script, good acting, and a pleasant soundtrack. You just have to be prepared to a different experience than what you get every day from Hollywood. Although this is not a complicated intellectual movie, and it does not feel heavy at all, it may require a little more commitment than a popcorn movie or a easy going no-think "feel good" movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't cry over spilled Ink</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the visually fascinating Ink, teams of good and evil supernatural beings fight over the soul of one very unlucky little girl. Although the aesthetics are definitely pleasing, there is a lack of character development and a sometimes inscrutable storyline. In all, though, this is an intriguing tale.It all starts when a hulking, cloaked figure named Ink steals into young Emma's room one night and tries to make off with her, only to run into a small squadron of good guys called Storytellers. Ink gets away, but a small drum he uses to transmit a secret code (which allows him to return to a different realm.Ink wants to use Emma (played with great verve by Quinn Hunchar) as a way to ingratiate himself with the Incubi, beings that directly provide mortals of the real world with nightmares (contrasted with the Storytellers, who furnish people with sweet dreams). Ink is under the belief that he can overcome his overwhelming guilt and shame by becoming an Incubus himself. He does not reckon with a Storyteller named Liev (Jessica Duffy), who willingly surrenders to Ink in order to save Emma.But, lest you think this is something akin to kid-fantasy movies like Labyrinth and Willow, there's a deeper theme to all of this other than those of atonement and reconciliation. Everything is connected, a sentiment to which good-guy Jacob (Jeremy Make), a blind Pathfinder (his title is sort of explanatory), certainly subscribes. If you want to prevent a particular future, you must find an item in the sequence leading up to that future - and then break the flow of events.For me, Ink was one of those movies that seemed to make little sense at first. Gradually, though, I began to grasp just how fraught with meaning it truly was. So many questions occurred: Why is Emma so important to everyone? Who is Liev, and what makes her so special? Why do Incubi wear those creepy electronic monitors over their faces? Why is Ink so grotesque? And then, like finally being able to fold a fitted sheet, the battle comes to a remarkably satisfying conclusion. We don't learn everything, but the light shed in the final scenes is highly gratifying. The viewer may slap his or her head, wondering why they didn't piece it all together earlier, but that's the beauty of the screenplay by Jamin Winans (who also directed). The only real debit is that the movie doesn't delve too deeply into the motives or emotions of any of the characters, even the leads. Ink seems to only scratch the surface of a very intriguing mythology, that of the beings who fight to wrest away our souls by way of our dreams.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The visuals are stronger than the writing and performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>INK is a film I heard about while watching a review for another film, THE FRAME, and so I watched it based on the reviewer's admiration for it. Now having seen it, I must say that it is visually creative and unique, but it also suffers from iffy acting and a predictable story. The basic plot is that a wandering soul, or Drifter, captures the soul of a young girl in hopes that he will be accepted into a cabal of nightmare creators known as Incubi. Meanwhile her father, who is having problems of his own, has to find a way to reconnect with and save her. One thing that really recommends this movie is the mythology that it sets up which is unlike anything I've ever seen before. There are two different realms, the real world and the dream world, and in the dream world there are several different kinds of beings. There are Storytellers who give people dreams, Incubi who give people nightmares, Pathfinders who are able to affect the course of people's lives, and Drifters who are the wandering souls of people who have died. None of this is really explained in depth, but is shown first and then explained a little bit later in case you missed it. If there is one problem, it's that the narrative is a bit exposition-heavy in parts, but never for very long. My favorite part of the film was the visual style, though. There was an ethereal, chiaroscuro-esque filter that lent the film a dreamlike quality. They were also creative with the visual effects and editing which provided a disorienting effect as you try to figure out what's going on. Still, some of the editing wasn't that great, especially in some fight scenes between the Storytellers and Incubi. It was in those scenes that the film's low budget really came to the fore. However, the biggest drawback to this film is the acting. It was downright weird at times and felt a little hammy/stage-like, so much so that it kind of took me out of the story. Overall, the end result was a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, you have the strong visual style, but then you also have the (at times) weak and obvious writing coupled with some sub-par acting. Still, if this film is any indication its director is one to look out for, and for what it's worth this was an interesting watch.</fullReview>

My expectations for Ink were extremely high so it's pretty astonishing that it took my several years before watching it. Now that Jamin Winans released his third movie recently, Ink got my attention again. After watching it my feelings were mixed. Although it is a very strange story indeed, a lot of the movie felt very conventional. The acting was pretty mediocre (as if the movie was made for television in the 1990s), the storyline was drenched in too much pathos (with a soundtrack that magnified this feeling a lot) and the visual style felt all a bit too much "post-production editing". I get why Ink is labeled a cult movie, as I think its following is indeed very small yet passionate, but it didn't do all that much for me. Too bad, 'cause I really wanted to like this film a lot...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amateur affair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had just one word to sum up "Ink", it would have to be "Amateurish". 10 minutes into this clearly low budget affair, I thought to myself "this is more like a made for TV programme". 10 minutes later and I was revising that thought further to say "children's TV". What plot there is concerns a young girl (the not too bad Quinn Hunchar, channelling Heather O'Rourke in Poltergeist) who is trapped in limbo between the real World and the World of nightmares, thanks to a shadowy abductor known as "Ink".Now considering that he is the star of the show, not too much money has been spent on the costume of old Mr Ink. He wears shabby old rags which he has clearly nabbed off "Mr Susan" from the Mighty Boosh, and a ludicrous fake nasal appendage; presumably borrowed from Monty Python's "Raymond Luxury Yacht" character. But costume-wise he still fares reasonably well compared to one other character, whose blindness is signified by his wearing four pieces of black duct tape across his eyes. Feel the budget!Set design fares little better, with Ink journeying to a halfway house between Earth and Hell which I can only describe as Cr*ppyPixelWorld, and then finally arriving at his less than nightmarish destination; PlasticBagWorld. Along the way Ink must repeatedly fight off good guy dream warriors, who want to snatch the child back again. Tedious fight scenes abound. And to further pan his road trip out, he meets pointless other characters; e.g. a woman who is seemingly introduced solely to give someone else a haircut. I'm not sure why.The plot, with it's rambling about "Storytellers", "Pathfinders" &amp; "Incubi" seemed frankly just a tiresome load of old tosh to me. But some younger viewers may dig it.Furthermore the (over)acting by the adult actors was, for me, both cartoonish &amp; dismaying. Especially when compared to that of a film like "City of God" for example, where young kids were plucked out of a Brazilian ghetto, shoved in front of a camera, and performed incredibly. How can the disparity be so great?On the plus side though, I found the soundtrack of the movie, seemingly done my the film's director, to be a quite decent affair, with plenty of moving electronic string pads soaring away. And the nightmare baddies with TVs for faces actually looked rather good.In summary, I feel slightly guilty for not liking this move, as it is clearly a small independent affair, and movie makers have to start somewhere I guess. But anyone wanting to see a Sci-Fi shot on a shoestring budget should perhaps consider "Another Earth" instead.</fullReview>

It is definitely underrated by many.However, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Just because it's a surprisingly good movie does not mean it's an incredible movie. It is fairly original, but, and I won't spoil anything here, incredibly predictable. There were a couple lines of dialogue toward the beginning of the movie that immediately helped me piece things together, so the surprising, incredible ending everyone talks about wasn't that surprising or incredible. Anyone who has watched a good amount of movies should easily be able to figure it out long before the end.In the end, I'd recommend this as a rental. It's an entertaining and interesting movie that should be seen and appreciated at least once. More than that, though, it's just a kind of overrated indie fad.</fullReview>

He dreams of his daughter Emma, playing with her and defending her from monsters. A group of people called storytellers give others pleasant dreams by touching them on the forehead. At the opposite spectrum are the Incubi, who cause nightmares in the sleepers. A third type named Ink, a drifter arrives and steals Emma's soul, which leaves her in a coma. He needs a code to take her through a portal and he barters with other drifters for it. Her father, John, lost her tonger grandparents after his wife's death, due to his substance abuse problem. Three storytellers and a pathfinder, Jacob, try to get Emma out of her coma. A series of time shifting events occur, which finally explains the car accident in the beginning of Ink. This is similar to Donnie Darko, but not nearly as good. Nothing new for the sci-fi genre, just an average movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More imagination on display here than the average blockbuster can only dream of...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm guessing that the entire budget for Ink was equal or less than the catering bill for a major studio movie but don't let that put you off because it's likely the major studio movie left a taste in the mouth akin to junk food whereas Ink is much more nourishing.Ink doesn't have stellar performances (in fact they are mostly solid) and the look of the movie sometimes betrays its low budget roots but it doesn't matter because Jamin Winans has somehow put together something wonderful here and what Ink may lack in certain elements it more than compensates in others. There's more imagination on display here than the average blockbuster can only dream of, not to mention plenty of heart and soul too. What's also pleasing is that Ink doesn't 'spoon feed' its audience like most mainstream movies, it's not complicated to follow but it's refreshing that as a viewer you need to connect the dots.The editing (also by Winans) is pretty much perfection it's so tightly constructed and is wonderfully used to slowly reveal the story and even though the 'twist' near the end isn't that surprising it still manages to pack an emotional punch. I should also mention his music score too which is also superb, is there no end to this guy's talents? Equally surprising are the sprinkling of special effects which somehow never look cheap together with an outstanding set piece in the middle of the movie which is pure genius. Ink has been compared to other cult movies and while I can understand this somehow it still manages to feel like it has a unique voice. Really when you consider the budget there's so much to admire here and while Ink has great imagination it's a shame that it wasn't matched by anyone picking it up for distribution. Since I first saw this in 2009 I have recommended it to many friends and pretty much without exception there have all come back thanking me for the recommendation.So if you like movies that are imaginative, engaging, brave and poetic then you could do a lot worse than watching this.1 2 3 4...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best low budget masterpieces!2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched almost one thousand movies and this one has a spot in top 20, a movie that has beaten the budget with story, tho I had to cut a star for directing, the overall feel after I watched this movie was awesome. It promotes the true values of a human being, and in my opinion, it combines the lore of Christianity with Buddhism ideology in a modern setting. It is awesome for all ages, but I recommend that you watch this alone and pay attention and maybe you will learn something from this movie. I loved this movie! Each actor has played his role exceptionally, tho is hard to digest in the first 30 minutes, it will all make sense soon I urge you to watch it until end! Peace!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a must see film!...The story has a lot of meaning behind it as well as a very emotional ending, plus it has a soundtrack that pushes this film to a whole other level. Chris Kelly is great in this as well as the girl who plays Emma. There are a few fight scenes that seem to go on a little too long, also keep in mind that this is a low budget film (but hard to notice with such great sets/props)and some of the acting isn't the greatest, but I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great film with a strong message. It's almost impossible not to feel something after this film is over and you'll want to tell everyone about this great little movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lesson in how to use a budget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the things I notice most about this movie on a technical level is how low-budget it appears to be. I would imagine they spend more on sci- fi channel original movies. However, any filmmaker could watch this movie and take notes on how such a budget can be used and still look beautiful. There is an obvious labor of love here. The actors show an obvious passion for the project that comes through in their performances, the cinematography keeps the pace while adding to the fantasy without elaborate CG and over-the-top visuals to aid it, and the bit of special effects they do use in the feature are subtle but incredibly effective. The inventive structure of the plot as well as the world created here (which is told more through actions and natural dialogue than through lengthy "how the world is" exposition, as only a good writer is able to do) make this one of the most unique and enjoyable films I've seen in recent history. You add to that the fact that the big companies of Hollywood could learn a thing or two from this movie about how effective visuals are more about timing, craft and subtlety than throwing a ton of money at large, attention-diverting set pieces.In short, if you have any love for science fiction, action, and/or mind- bending story-telling, this is a movie that should not stay under your radar</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Such a great movie, it is not often that a movie like this comes along. This film truly makes you think and is one that you can watch over and over again and get something different out of it each time. Keep in mind that it is a low budget, indie flick so some of the acting is below par but there are some absolutely stand out actors in this film, Jeremy Make was amazing. The score for the movie is amazing and was actually used again in The Grey. What the director is able to accomplish not only in the plot but with the cinematography, music, props, etc. and what his wife was able to do with editing is amazing and truly uses the budget to its full potential. I actually am glad the movie was so stripped down, it really focuses the viewer's attention to the film's plot and message. The movie gives me hope that we aren't just getting CGI filled crap on screen in the future. Thank you Jamin Winans for making this film!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine if "Alice in Wonderland" were written by Edgar Allan Poe.Not since the genre-defining French masterpiece "City of Lost Children" (1995) have I experienced such creativity and poetry in a surrealist fairytale. Parts of this film seemed to be an homage to "City" such as the nightmarishly hi-tech Incubuses (similar to the Cyclopses) and the visually-imposing backdrop of dreams, nightmares and souls caught in a timeless world in between. But this film took a clever approach by blending a parallel story which is set in the real world of downtown Denver. In that respect it's similar to other great fantasy/reality films "The Fall" (2006), "Big Fish" (2003) and "Franklyn" (2008). But again, this movie has its own identity which seems to defy comparison.Other films with a similar vibe include "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" (2004), "Pan's Labyrinth" (2006), and anything by Terry Gilliam ("Fisher King", "Tideland", "Brazil"). If you like any of the films I mentioned, you probably know how rare they are to find. Well my friend you just stumbled on another.The plot? Like any good fairytale, the plot is deceptively simple, but once you recognize the symbolism &amp; meaning it packs a wallop. Without ruining anything, I'll just say the story is about a little girl who gets stolen by a shadowy phantom. Different forces fight for possession of her in an alternate dreamworld as well as in the real world. It's told in cryptic fragments, jumping back &amp; forth in time, place and universes, and it's up to you to piece together the story which ultimately comes to a stunning epiphany at the end. That moment had tears streaming down my cheeks, and I don't cry easy--the last time was in 10th grade when I got smacked by a hockey puck where the sun don't shine. This experience was somewhat more pleasing.Like "Alice in Wonderland" (or maybe a better one would be "Dante's Inferno") be prepared for seemingly random episodes and freakish characters whom we meet along the journey. Don't expect many explanations because it's up to you to figure out who's who, what's what, and why's why. It's a fun challenge.Acting is riveting, not just from the lead Christopher Soren Kelly but even the lesser characters who just appear for 1 scene and then are gone. I loved the psycho theater diva, the mad junk collector, and the blind guide who, like a Shakespearean fool, seemed to know everything all along. And who can forget the hauntingly beautiful Liev played by Jessica Duffy. Ultimately the memorable &amp; quirky characters are what bring this story to life.I didn't realize until I watched the special features that this was an indie film... very indie... like they didn't have any funding until nearly a year into production, and the final budget was only $250,000 (compare that to the $100,000,000 budget of "Where the Wild Things Are" in the same year). Small budgets or big budgets notwithstanding, this is a great film which doesn't fall into Hollywood tripe nor pretentious filmschool ramblings. No genre labels here, this movie is plain freaking awesome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every now and then a film comes along that makes you want to be a better person. This is one of those films. One of the most heart-felt and redemptive stories I've seen in some time. Occasionally, the low budget does show, but what they were able to accomplish on their shoestring budget is actually quite amazing. To be honest, I almost turned it off after the first 30 minutes or so. It takes a little while to get going and for the audience to get a sense of the direction it's heading. A few of the earlier scenes are a little jarring and occasionally cheesy, too. But about half way through the movie there is a scene that stands apart as one of the very best scenes ever put on film. A scene which changes the trajectory of the whole movie and begins to weave the threads together. The climactic scene of the film is another one that just blew me away. I was literally watching it through tears. You'll know these two scenes when you see them. So I implore you to persevere through the first half of the movie as it gets a whole lot better. And the first half of the film is a lot better on subsequent viewings when you know in advance where it's headed. The cinematography is great, most of the performances (especially the main character) are great, the soundtrack is excellent. Overall it's a very well made film, but more than this it's just a very powerful story that needs to be seen... especially if you're a father.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Upon my first watch of this i must be honest i switched it off not from boredom but from being completely confused as to what and who i was watching. This film does require an open mind and a willing to try and keep up with the complicated timeline throughout. The trick is the film is told through two separate timelines (what might happen and what is happening and then also to confuse matters you get flashbacks to the past of both)and gives you no warning or notice of when it is changing the perspective you are watching at any particular time. Your are expected to work it out yourself and by the end i felt rewarded for my efforts. My hairs still stand on end through the end sequence which i have just finished for the fourth time not including my first attempt previously mentioned.All i'll say is if you like a film which challenges you somewhat then give this a chance and you'll be glad you did, It just proves budget isn't everything.

The great news we are not forever lost in the crap mass production of remakes of remakes - there is still life and freshness in the movie industry! Ink is both simple and complex story that is done in very modern way, does not put weight just into special effects but really uses them well - the boss of the bad guys is really scary and the Incubi are pretty scary as well. The soundtrack is amazing as well - it seems not to fit to the movie (too slow for such dramatic events) but in the end it really pushes the emotions.Why are we flooded by generic Hollywood crap instead of such amazing movies that are so hard to find? Why is that? Why there is no greater effort to promote and distribute such gems? You really have to actively seek good movies these days and you will have hard time with that.This movie is definitely recommended for everyone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a strange, but wonderfully unique film. I took a shot on downloading this and was pleasantly surprised. I found myself being reminded of films like Dark City (1998), Being John Malkovich (1999) and They Live (1988). Although it was slightly predictable towards the end, I think the overall presentation makes up for it. I could have done without the blur/whitening effect, but it does sort of add a dreamy feel to the movie. This film does have a few great special effects such as the Incubi and the portal in the street. But it's tastefully done; never overbearing with flashy/unnecessary filler. Bottom line: If you dig obscure indie flicks with some plot then give this one a go!</fullReview>

Like other negative reviews I have read, I'll agree there's just nothing good about this movie. Except maybe the young girl who played Emma. Hers was the only halfway believable portrayal in the movie. There may have been a glimmer of what could have been a compelling storyline, but it completely missed the mark.It was like watching bad fan fiction written by emo teenagers come to life in celluloid. Ink should be mandatory viewing for beginning film students on how NOT to make a movie. It's just that astonishingly bad. Sucktacular. Craptastic. Truly awful.The only thing that could have possibly redeemed this movie for me would have been if Tim Curry came out in the final scene dressed in drag and lead the cast in a rousing rendition of "The Time Warp", thereby letting the audience know that the movie was supposed to be ridiculously pretentious and cheesy.On second thought, not even Dr. Frank-n-Furter could have saved this movie.That said, I will probably watch this movie again.

		<fullReview>Ink is a rare thing. Is it high budget? No. Is the acting phenomenal? Not at all. But what Ink may lack in technical execution, it more than makes up for in something far more important and far more difficult to realize - it's spirit. The creators have accomplished something truly rare in terms of world building and narrative. Ink presents a setting that is immediately compelling, and that leaves you wanting more. This film isn't likely to see sequels, but this is a world that is begging for more exposition.The tale is an old one. A story of self destruction, redemption and parental love. The message is uplifting and will stay with viewers a long while.Far more successful in its mission than so many films with much higher budgets and much higher profiles, Ink is a film that any film buff should sample.

		<fullReview>For those of you who are struggling over which reviews to trust, read between the lines in the severely negative reviews for this movie. In a large amount of them, the authors clearly state that they simply did not understand the story. The one semi-good review I read had someone stating that they "got" the movie, but that it was "too difficult", so it basically made them angry that they had to try so hard.Look, if you just want some cheap thrills, go watch the latest Nightmare On Elm Street movie. Go watch almost any major blockbuster where hundreds of millions are spent on special effects and advertising. Don't sit down to watch an independent film where the funds are lacking and the only OPTION is to fill the movie with moving and meaningful material in order to obtain an audience. And definitely don't ever give something a bad rating just because you didn't understand it. One guy even went as far as to put a spoiler in his rating without warning because he was raging so hard over the fact that he just couldn't get the movie. At least two of the one star reviews I read, the people said they didn't even watch more than 20 minutes of the movie. Absurd.This movie packs a lot in, yes, but it's not HARD to understand. Just don't get drunk with a loud group of friends the first time you're going to watch it. Material abstractly relates at very separate times in the movie, but does so for good reason. It helps to abbreviate the time it takes to explain some very deep parts of the storyline. Without making these connections the way the movie does, the movie would have been twice as long, or very important sections of the story would have to have been cut out.</fullReview>

Also like Primer, if you don't 'get it' or refuse to entertain the possibilities that the other timelines open up, you probably won't get this film.But if you listen closely the whole film is explained within the film. When Allel says that time flows differently on the different planes, that a day might seem like a thousand years or a thousand years might seem like a day, she isn't waxing poetical - she's telling Emma, and us, how the film works. And Jacob finishes the explanation with his comments about the beat and how sometimes you need to trip things up. It's all there.This film is a very carefully cut and polished gem - that refracts and reflects time instead of light. It is worth approaching with an open mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creating a new genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is classified as sci-fi/fantasy, but only because we don't have any other category. Let me suggest a new one: spiritual. Granted, if you travel over to netflix, you'll be given that option as a category. But never have I seen such a film that defines the category so strongly that it deserves it's own genre, right up there with drama, comedy, and the others. See, the faith/spirituality category encompasses films that deal overtly with religion. Or, they could be the very poorly produced and preachy Christian films such as the Left Behind series. But this film obviously transcends all that. It is not strictly talking about a religion. And it doesn't have a preachy message. However, there are parts religious, part Christian even, and also has it all under-girded with a common humanity.Fantasy wouldn't be as powerful on its own. It would be pretty to look at and possibly keep me captivated. But unless it connected me with something from my heart, it would all just be ascetics and I want more than that. Ink delivers heart in spades. As I was watching this movie, I found myself alternating between being in awe of the visuals and having my heart transfixed on a character or scene. This movie works on so many levels but most of all because it taps into something deep within us all - the need to be loved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable and Polarizing - Ink is a non-standard deviation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found Ink to be entirely enthralling. It's a joyride, plain and simple. I loved the characters, the storytelling, and the music.A lot of people mention that you should stick through the first twenty minutes. I don't see why. The movie's beginning struck a chord with me. I've been the guy screaming his lungs out in his car before, and I immediately empathized with the main character. He's the sort of person that may not be accessible to everyone, but he resonated to me.He's a father who really doesn't know what he's doing, and he's clinging to his pride. However, he realizes somewhere that his daughter is more important than anything else. Maybe, again, this doesn't resonate for everyone, but five minutes in I was cheering for John.There are also complaints about poor writing or terrible acting. I'll admit that I don't know a single thing about acting, but I can tell you that I didn't ever disbelieve the characters. To me, that's the important thing. I don't know about hitting their marks, or naturality, but they came across as real to me. As for writing, well, it's an intricate story. It's not that you have to be a genius to grasp the plot, but then again it's not vapid. It's subtle, and rich, and it's driven by your emotions for the character. I think that makes it strong, but obviously people disagree with me.The cinematography is another thing that I probably shouldn't comment on, but I'll mention it to be thorough. My major problem with movies is their use of slow-mo. I hate it. I think it cheapens the experience and is tacky. This movie did very well in not only avoiding slow-mo, but also getting around the issue of a fast-moving fight scene that not everyone can follow. At certain points, the picture freezes for an instant. It allows you to catch the action and highlight the choreography without seeming over-the-top or out of place.The music is really enjoyable. It's subtle, keeps pace with the film, and knows when to hold back. There's a few spots in the movie where the action comes to a massive climax, and yet the music stays light. It's a contrast that, for me, really sold the scenes. It's no Inception with rolling drums and sweeping crescendos, but it's a different style that I found better suited to the story.Finally, there's the issue of actually following the plot. That's a problem, as much as I'd like to push it aside. Of course, if you've ever watched Primer or Memento (or even the Illusionist), you'll wonder what people are complaining about. However, if you're used to very straightforward movies, you might want to bring a pen and notepad. The best way to keep track is to pay attention to the lighting. Winans chose very warm, surreal lights for the realm of the Storytellers, and very dark, harsh lights (usually green tinged) for the Incubi. The 'real world' is always true to color, and everything else is washed out and lacking focus. A lot of it is just training to piece a film together. Like I said before, if you've seen Primer, Ink is a breeze to understand.In terms of accessibility, you might want to give Ink a pass if you're used to mainstream films. This is no Harry Potter, and most definitely will throw you for a loop if you're not expecting the layers and intricacy that Ink provides. However, if you've seen Waking Life, or Donnie Darko, or films like Martyrs and Irreversible, Ink is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Very slight spoiler alert) Okay, so I joined this site just to submit my two cents' worth. I agree with you totally, chrismiller88 (see his comment on the fake voting/fake reviews thread). I watched this on the computer with my 16-yr-old son on Thanksgiving night, and we were sobbing together by the end. He lost his dad a couple of years ago to the same thing in the movie, and neither of us had any idea what was coming. I also agree about the reasons I watch a movie. We both commented on how annoying the action special effects were, but they were nowhere near being enough to keep us from enjoying the movie, and, more especially, being touched by it. I have been thinking about the movie a lot - am wanting to see it again soon. I thought the acting was just fine; I've seen worse in lots of big-budget films (Drag Me to Hell comes immediately to mind), and I was also marveling at the imagination of the writer(s). I have no connection to anyone in this movie, I just happened to stumble across it on Netflix. Bravo to the makers of this little gem. Differing opinions are fine; they're what makes the world go around. To anyone who's reading this thread, I'd say just rent it and arrive at your own conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Work of Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seldom have we seen such integration between art and film. The fact that it was under rated and didn't make huge revenues exposes the true nature of human taste, (when a meaningless movie like transformers makes much more money. The writer/director (same person) was very successful in blending the different time lines of the movie in way that keeps you guessing and questioning for the first part. Then when you start to make sense of everything the plot thickens and it goes much faster. The only drawback here is the acting, i think due to a low budget the actors, specially the extras were a bit poor, but the main characters were OK. i recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a unique movie blended with art sending a lovely meaningful message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was just a great movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got a chance to watch Ink a few nights ago on Netflix via Xbox 360. I usually look up reviews before watching a film I never heard of, and saw some very good reviews on the film and the plot looked promising.My wife and I watched it and she fell asleep the first 20 minutes of the movie, it was late :). Anyways as has been mentioned the movie starts off slow, and the actual story doesn't really pick up I don't think until around the 25-30 minute mark. At that time I was engrossed in the film, and couldn't stop watching it. The story is a true feel good story. This is the type of movie we would like to see with the budget of lets say a Matrix Revolution which was horrible btw, but had all the money and the great actors. Wow what a film Ink would be with that budget. But they managed to pull it off for $250,000. Thats what I read somewhere was the budget on the film. Impressive. There even taken donations on a website to help pay for it.I have since watched it 4 more times, because the ending makes me feel so good while making me cry my eyes out at the same time. Give this one a chance, you can tell they put their hearts into this one. A sleeper hit, Ink is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It takes special skills for this enterprise: telling a fairy tale in Matrix times, with no famous actors involved and with a low budget available. There are moments in this movie when you think that it will fall definitely into ridicule. But it never does, thanks to the huge care of the director. Some action scenes are really innovative and the script is very well written.And now the best: if you decide to keep on watching it after the first 20 minutes (if you don't particularly like fairy tale stories you'll be tempted to quit), you will be rewarded with a different, fresh, tender and dynamic approach into telling grown-ups a moving tale of their childhood. Worth seeing it, no doubt.</fullReview>

This movie is artistic and deep. I loved it and was completely entertained.

		<fullReview>This "IS" the best movie of 2009. Probably in a longer period of time for me. Absolutely wonderful. Without discussing the content and giving away what you are about to watch. This film reminded me of why I always loved to watch movies as a child and in my adult life. To draw you in, to take you away, to forget your surroundings and say a powerfully soft "wow" at the end. Brilliantly done. You become a part of this film in a way by releasing your creative self and letting go of your usual constructs. Different Yes. Brilliant Yes! My family has never been this together and pulled in collectively by a movie. Thank you to all that intended this film, it was a great experience for all of us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film! I was so surprised! It looks like it was shot with an HD camera, but it was so extremely well-done. The director did a masterful job. The acting and writing was great. The story was very original and kept my attention throughout weaving an intricate fantasy; adventure; drama. I can't say enough how impressed I was with this film! Great job guys do many more like this! It's not every day one can see a gem like this! Hollywood take note of this indie magic. The dark forces in this movie were creepy as hell to look at; probably one of the weirdest creations I have ever seen in film. The film shows us that there are many battles going on and many that we never see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The miracle here is the editing. It is all about the editing. This reworking of Wings Of Desire would be nothing if not for the superb editing. The blonde child actor (wow) deserves an Oscor but not if the editor doesn't get one first. Like Mirror Mask or Pan's Labyrinth, this film centers around a young girl and her dreams, fantasies, nightmares or whatever you want to make out of the surreal imagery displayed--but this one is much more complicated because the point of view of the bigger picture switches from real life to dreamworld every other minute at the pace of a episode of Heroes. The Winona Ryder look alike keeps this film appealing but, either way, it is intriguing. Plus, fight scenes, not as spectacular at The Matrix, but about as good as it get with a low budget. The combination of fantasy and reality makes this a real gem worth seeing. It is completely far out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. Its a masterpiece and a great watch. If this movie caught my attention its sure to grab yours. The only reason i gave it a 9 out of ten is because i felt a minimal part of the acting needed minor touch ups. This is a great movie if you're into quality sci if effects, good action, a little thrill,or just a plain good story. Hope you enjoy it as much as i did :) *spoiler alert* DO not read if you don't want to have part of the story spoiled. Another thing i loved about the movie is how real ink's costume looked and how well dreams were portrayed through out the movie. during the nightmares i actually thought Jesus these are seriously what a nightmare looks like. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good even by mainstream standards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tend to use a different scale to rate indie movies. Indie movies tend to try hard but often fall short because of things like budget and that just doesn't seem fair when put up against a huge budget, massive casting department, etc. But I don't think that scale is even necessary with this movie because, indie or not, it's still quite good. Imagine what they could have done with a bigger, Hollywood-style budget.The story itself is a bit too complex to fully explain in a concise fashion. To put it in simple terms, the film follows a battle between two groups of people: those who give us good dreams and those who give us nightmares. More specifically, it follows a little girl as both groups try to save or kidnap her respectively. Again, that's an incredibly dumbed down version of the plot, but that's about all I'd put here in order to avoid a pages-long post or any spoilers.Sure, the acting is a bit wanting, but still pretty good for an indie film. Even the special effects aren't too bad especially if you consider a significantly smaller budget than most films in theaters. But best of all is the originality. This will most likely end up being one of the most refreshingly original films most people won't see this year. It's almost impossible to compare this to anything else, so I won't even try. But all said and done I'd definitely recommend it.</fullReview>

This movie shows us why we live in the world so full of fear,war,hate and lie.Because at the end of the day we choose the wrong side, unlike what John does at the end of the movie.We let the ego/pride to control us though we choose money,position and power over our happiness and we think we didn't have another choice!Clearly every element of this movie is well done.(Acting, Music, Story line, CGI,...) and they made a synergy altogether.One of the "Must see" movies.

		<shortDescription>Deluded, superficial, anti-humanistic movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While interesting technically, i must say that the entire idea was based on some anti-human view of the world. This movie doesn't really care much about the reality of human being. Ink (main character) was portrayed as a long nose, ugly, which what a man will be when he does not choose between "good" or "evil": saying there's nothing could possibly be appreciated in between, just "fixed". Nothing humane about that! This film IS about the old stupid good and evil thoughts and naively constructed but sublimely included inside the superstructure of the story. The story was made by people who don't really have understanding of how the world really works. No existentialism like other reviewer wrote. No social comprehension. No psychology. Nothing. Just plain good and evil with new costume. It even felt evangelical.I must urge the writer to learn some more about human nature. Read philosophy. Anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ONLY amazing aspect to this movie appears to be the unbelievable gorilla hype machine that has bombarded these boards. I mean people will look back at this in years to come and compare to it the Blair Witch's (well maybe not)grassroots hype tactics.Do NOT believe the majority of these reviews, Ink is not the next cult classic. It is amateurish at best. Grand ideas but no budget, actors or script for execution. It is painful to sit through. The "fight scenes" look like excess celluloid from a Mighty Morhin Power Rangers episode and that might be generous. The film on a whole is slightly above the quality of entries you would find on Youtube but not nearly as original as some.I am not telling you not to watch this movie but I write this review to temper the over abundance of propaganda.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You read some books their plot and others for their prose. This movie you watch for its cinematic prose.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is set in a world of a daily and eternal battle between two sets of creatures of the night ? the Storytellers and the Incubi. The Storytellers bring people beautiful and happy dreams, whilst the Incubi bring fear and nightmares?The tale is really about John, a career focused man who seems to have lost his purpose and direction. As his daughter is kidnapped by Ink, we slowly find out his personal history over the course of the film. Chris Kelly plays a credible John ? whilst in early scenes he seems a bit shallow and stereotypical in his acting, he does a solid job of portraying the different sides of his personality and stages of his life experience. There are a couple of otherworldly characters that are neither Storytellers nor Incubi that don't really work so well ? both in terms of the plot and in their acting ? but they are minor and don't really detract from the experience.It is a low budget indie movie ? the director Winans failed to sell the script to the big studios so decided to go it alone ? yet the cinematography and score are unique and immersive. It channels a feel of the better days of Terry Gilliam, mixed with a dash of Guillermo del Toro.At its core it is a very simple story about losing or finding oneself, but it is told in a universe that takes the experience to a different level. You read some books their plot and others for their prose. This movie you watch for its cinematic prose.A generous 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, outstanding with a amazing storyline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ink has a really simple idea: There are two forces which fight for our souls, when we are asleep. The good one, called storyteller, give good dreams of hope and joy and happiness. The bad one, called incubus, (and this bad boys are maybe one of the frightening villains i have ever seen and i don't even know why...) give really bad nightmares including our biggest fears and anguishes. One night a little girl (Emma) gets kidnapped by a creature (Ink), who wants to give her as a sacrifice, so he can belong to the incubus. a few difficulties appear so it takes a bit longer to find his way to the leader of the incubus. In this time, the fighter, who was given the task to protect the girl tries to save Emma. She gets help from a so called "pathfinder" (Jacob), who is able to intervene the real world, which isn't possible for normal storytellers...Ink is a movie, of which i hadn't expected a lot. And to be true: at the beginning, i was disappointed, cause the clear structure of good and bad was way to simple. But with the time most of the characters became really interesting and especially Jacob is still one of my absolutely favorite movie characters of all time. The ending is amazing and i haven't seen it coming this way. The music is awesome and certainly one of the reasons, why i was moved to tears. But its the way the movie is made: The camera, the light, the colors, the atmosphere, the insanity, which make it one of the best movies i have seen in a while. Probably it could have been produced a bit better, with a few more effects or famous actors, but I think the indie, low-budget style is the best way it could have been made. So all in all: A very underestimated awesome indie- movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unconventional Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Admittedly I was initially sceptical about this title, predominantly due to it's obscurity and it's unconventional art style; trailers appeared unpolished and low budget, and the imagery disturbing and inexplicably bizarre. The concept however gripped me from the outset, and the accompanying music score evoked a concerning atmospheric uncertainty.What began as curiosity however soon flourished into fascination, as the plot unfolded I found myself gripped, heart racing, praying for a positive outcome. Everything is beautiful; the cast and variety in protagonists, the intricately poetic story, the power of love amidst the darkness of nightmares. The innocence of children always beckons empathy, and I felt genuine concern and anguish all the way until the conclusion of this beautifully created work of art.This movie quickly soared toward the top of my favourite films of all time; a genuine unconventional masterpiece, eternally reminding me to never judge a book by it's cover.A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to simply write WATCH THIS FILM and leave it there. However, I shouldn't be that blatant, as this is definitely one of those films which won't appeal to everyone.Personally, I think it's brilliant, but, if you read some of the internet forums on Ink, you'll see comments like 'a film student's film only' and 'a boring mess.' I wouldn't describe it as either (but then I did study film at university, so maybe I'm biased?).I guess if you mix a small pinch of Inception with Donnie Darko, add a tablespoon of The Matrix and a healthy portion of Russian sci-fi epic Nightwatch, then set it all to the musical score of a Richard Kelly film, you're in the right area of Ink.If you like your films quirky and beautifully-shot (including the action sequences), plus have some decent characterisation with some captivating musical scores, then give this one a go. However, if you want wall-to-wall action with little plot, character development and Michael Bay's name on the credits, steer well clear.You'll notice I haven't even mentioned the storyline in this review. If you like this sort of art-house, indie film and are going to watch it, it's best you don't. You'll never get another chance to be amazed at no knowing what's coming.Plus this is a rare example of what can be achieved with a limited (by Hollywood's general standards) budget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Case of a Great Movie with too small of a budget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Ink" is a great imaginative tale that to me suffers from its lack of budget. It is the kind of movie that you almost would have rather waited for the Director to do a few larger movies and keep on the back burner until he has the budget power to make it a huge blockbuster, kind of like George Lucas did with Star Wars. That being said I think it was done very well what they had to work with and Jamin Winans deserves a lot of credit.The story line as on this site is: A mysterious creature, know as Ink, steals a child's soul in hopes of using it as a bargaining chip to join the Incubi - the group of supernatural beings responsible for creating nightmares.At times the editing makes it a bit of a pain to watch, it constantly changes angles and views which some may find artistic, but I find annoying, although it did help slightly disguise some poor acting . Dream sequences, or at least the sequences from the characters of the dream world are again very imaginative but still leave you wishing for better effects, acting, and sound. I'm not a huge fan of a lot of CGI but this is a case where it would have been great.I do see where comparisons could be made between this movie and others like "Donnie Darko" or "Pan's Labyrinth," conceptually, but those 2 were much better acted and seemed a bit technically superior. It did have that dark quality that makes these movies worth watching.I wanted to love this movie, I really did. I love this kind of story and love the imagination. The story was great, original, but it just couldn't quite follow through due, in my opinion, too the budget. This ultimately hurts it immensely, and turns it into something that could have been a 10 in 5 or ten years, into a 5 right now. So to recap, Great Idea, very imaginative, dark, well done for the budget, but in the end just too ambitious for that budget.Like my reviews, Hate em? Comments, hate mail?

		<shortDescription>A Different Take On a Common Theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>INK is a crazy fantasy film, focusing on a world where dreams are determined by two sects who are continually fighting for our souls - at least that's what I got from it. Many say that INK is a cross between The Matrix and several other films... but I cant help but think coming of age story mixed with The Matrix and Scrooge. Sounds horrible, right? During the course of this movie, I found myself continually struggling for the first 35 minutes on whether to just stop watching (and I hardly ever have that issue). The acting, for the most part, is mediocre, the plot is so-so, and an educated person (not intelligence, but perhaps someone who watches a lot of fantasy films) might see the plot twist coming from a mile away.That being said, the visuals and soundtrack are utterly astounding. There were 2 or 3 scenes in particular where I found myself getting slightly emotional at how astoundingly beautiful the cinematography looked. Except for maybe one or two fight scenes, the choreography is amazing as well... and you'll find yourself really getting into it during the last battle.Many may complain that the story itself doesn't make sense, that there are too many loose ends... well, this is a film that was meant to be watched more than once. Everything comes together at the very end, but you have to be patient. Also keep in mind that this film was an extremely ambitious project on a modest $250,000 budget. That's a lot of money, but once you see what kind of effects were attempted you'll see some shortcomings. This is truly a film to be watched if you have the time and there aren't any particularly amazing films in your Netflix queue. Go into it with an open mind and you'll be okay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An independently made gem of a film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Ink is one of those independently made jewels that doesn't come around very often and it's a film that I urge everyone to give a try. It might be a bit hard to locate a copy of the film, but director Jamin Winans, who also owns the production company that made Ink once stated that he embraces piracy since Ink reached a much bigger audience after it was uploaded on torrent-sites and as a result DVD-sales increased significantly. So I guess that downloading the film shouldn't be any problem. Ink was made on a small budget (250.000$), but with that said I don't think of it as, just great considering the budget restrictions. I think it's a great film that doesn't suffer because of the budget restrictions and a film that can trump even the biggest productions. The plot is incredibly complex and thought-provoking. At night when we sleep, individuals called Storytellers enter our dimension to give us our good dreams. On this particular night at the beginning of the film a shadowy figure also enters our realm and abducts a young girl named, Emma, viciously battering the Storytellers in the process. The shadowy figure known as Ink manages to bring Emma into another dimension which leaves her physical body in a comatose state. Allel, the story-teller responsible for Emma must now enlist the help of a wise blind man ironically named, Jacob the Pathfinder, and find a way to bring Emma's consciousness back to the physical world before Ink delivers her to, the Incubi, beings who are responsible for our nightmares. This is a film that doesn't fit neatly into just one genre. With elements both in the story and the visuals that would categorize it as fantasy, some theoretical physic concepts such as multiple dimensions and non-linear time that I would attribute to science-fiction and some uniquely shot fight scenes that looks like revamped and modernized Wuxia film scenes. The film is thought-provoking in the way it builds up the plot and carefully keeps the viewer trying to figure out the solution to this extremely complex mystery for almost the entire duration of the film. Another way in which the film is thought-provoking is some philosophical statements about shallowness and happiness that it makes. The small cast consists of almost completely unknown actors and features Chris Kelly, Quinn Hunchar, Jessica Duffy, Jeremy Make, Jennifer Bater, Eme Ikwuakor and Shelby Malone. Although the acting is not always great, Quinn Hunchar, who plays Emma is one of the better child actors I've seen and Jeremy Make as Jacob the Pathfinder is a hilarious source of humor for the film and an iconic character. The inevitable climax of the story makes for one of the most action-packed and emotionally powerful movie endings that I've seen so far.</fullReview>

How many days pass by that we forget to stop and focus on the current people that are here with us everyday and should have our attention. It can be so easy to avoid pain or insecurities with distractions. Even to call something necessary for a person's well being can really be a distraction as well.

		<shortDescription>A Great movie to watch if you appreciate the craft of filmmaking (partial spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A hidden gem of America's AUTHENTIC indie film circuit, "Ink" does so much so well that it warrants the "tour de force" label. I will be the first to admit it: the movie is not perfect -- and among the problems is a number of plot holes and unanswered questions. In spite of all of this, the movie earns high marks in photography, editing, writing, some of the acting, and general style. In the end, so much is done right that for what it is -- nearly two hours of densely packed movie -- all of its short comings are overshadowed by everything that is good about it.In order for the reader to have an understanding of the story, I'll try to give an only slightly more detailed description of the movie's premise. "Ink," written and directed by Jamin Winans, is the story about the strained relationship between workaholic stock broker John (Chris Kelly) and his daughter Emma (Quinn Hunchar). The backstory of this story involves a dimension that intersects with the real world, in which time does not function in quite the same way that it does in the real world and in which supernatural beings that cannot be seen by the waking person are responsible for giving each person dreams as they are asleep -- these persons are called storytellers (who give good dreams) and incubi (who give nightmares). In the backdrop of this premise, a deformed figure named Ink -- who wears a makeshift costume of rags and chains -- kidnaps Emma as she is dreaming, with the intention of exchanging her to the incubi so that they will allow him to become one of them. Meanwhile, the storytellers respond by trying to change the human world in order to free Emma from her captivity and save her from a fate worse than death, which is said to await her when she is delivered to the incubi.One of the things that the movie does that sets it apart is that it tells a story mostly in visuals, leaving almost no exposition to dialogue. In fact, if one were to rely on the dialogue spoken by the characters you would probably get very lost, and the writer/director appears to know this, which is why the movie is shot and edited very characteristically of a visually captivating movie -- a lot like the visual style of such films as "Requiem for a Dream." At the same time, the movie does not take time to explain everything and leaves many things to the speculation of the audience, which while keeping the pace fast may frustrate others as they are not given direct explanations for the images they see.But what holds the movie together so that it does not rely too heavily on visual style is the story, which has multiple layers and an emotional center. In the end, it is the story that saves the movie, and as the viewer learns more about the movie s/he becomes more invested in the characters, including antagonist/antihero Ink who -- as the fact that the title is his name suggests -- has a back story that eventually ties the film together.Is "Ink" the movie of the year in 2009? Probably not. But what the movie does have is a bold visual element, a strong emotional center, and a new way of storytelling that abandons traditional exposition and adds pace. And more than anything else, if you want to see something different for your next movie, then this is it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that through allegory drama offers up the choice between the tragedy or bliss that life offers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film offers up a lot to think about, as well as something to care about. This is the type of film you watch and then discuss with friends, or make friends discussing it.There are films that are overlooked even though the cast does a great job, or even still when the director creates a world like no other. But this film is also so well written that it boggles the imagination that this is not a greater cult classic than it is. However, it may provoke so much introspection it is easier to think it away than to emote with it. But to be honest a film so overall dark may seem unbalanced to many. Believe it or not, a little humor and less horror could make it easier to digest. I liked it though. A Delorian of a film. Rich, unusual, a collectors piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly amazing - deserves to be seen by everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll keep this review short and straight to the point - this is probably the best independent film made on a small budget that you're ever likely to see.It has a great plot, it is well executed, and it has a hugely important message about fatherhood.I was amazed at how quickly the film pulled me in, and how easily it's obvious budgetary constraints faded into the background as I was drawn deeper into the story - that's truly how good this piece of cinematic storytelling is.This movie deserves to be remade with the budget of a Hollywood blockbuster, not because the original desperately needs it, but because it would see a much wider audience exposed to what is a truly beautiful and rare gem of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ink (2009)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ink is a spectacular little low-budget film. At night, as we sleep, two groups of different warriors battle over our souls. There are the Storytellers that give us dreams, and the Incubi that give us nightmares. There are also drifters, that are kind of trapped between worlds. One of these drifters, Ink, kidnaps a young girl and it is up to the storytellers to rescue her. WHat I loved about this film is that you can see the passion and hardwork that has gone into it. It doesn't allow for its budget to become a limitation. The film also uses simple but very effective effects. There is a fight scene early on where things get smashed up but then magically put themselves back together again. It is probably just footage in reverse, but it works a charm. The designs of the characters are also very original, at least for this kind of story. The film is one you have to stick with, as it reveals its intentions and story over time. Some scenes seem completely unrelated which can cause the film to drag in the middle, but stick with it because the emotional ending is very powerful. Lower your expectations in terms of lighting, acting, and fight choreography, and you should find a lot to love in this little film that refuses to be held back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is now in my top 3 movies of all time. I absolutely loved this movie. It's STUNNING. You have to work for this movie; the director doesn't give it all away in the first thirty minutes, or even the first hour. Once it gets to the point, it blows you away. The humanity of this movie is so touching. It's definitely something magical, without losing it's human touch. If anything the magic involved amplifies it. The scenes are incredible. The story-line is one that you won't easily forget. The main character is tragic, as is his story. There is a twist to it that makes you cry. It's not often I watch a movie that moves me as much as this one did. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A friend of mine who is into horror recommended this to me so I was thinking it was gonna be about some crazy tattoo artist but ink is in fact the name of one of the main characters. I am giving this a 9 because after watching the entire movie I really enjoyed it. In the beginning of it after maybe thirty or so minutes I thought I was going to have to question my friends judgement. At that point very little of the movie was making any sense at all. I think the "matrix style" effects were a little over done in fact annoying at one point which unfortunately takes away rather than gives to the story. I believe a little less of those would have been sufficient and would have adequately gave the feeling the director was looking for. So even though I was getting annoyed I continued watching and I am very happy I did. It wasn't until the end of the movie until things started to make sense, which of course was intentional, and i always love a good plot twist. If you like matrix, Donnie darko check this one out</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ink is a truly mesmerizing journey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jamin Winans' new film Ink plays with the classical dichotomy between good and evil. While seemingly linear in motion, Winans has a tendency to make his audience work for the meaning behind his films. Ink takes place in a world where several planes of existence are present. In the "dream world" the Storytellers and Incubi reign supreme. The Storytellers are responsible for good dreams while their darker counterpart, the Incubi, conjure nightmares that people of the "real world" experience in their sleep.The story begins on a wild yet forthcoming tangent by introducing two of the main characters of the story, Emma and her father. We are then driven into the main theme of the film where we are presented with the abilities of the Storytellers and Incubi and their unique gift to give people the seemingly impossible through the imagination of the dream world. And thus the tragic hero Ink comes to the forefront; a disfigured and socially unadjusted wanderer of the dream world.It is Ink's belief that by taking a child sacrifice to the leader of the Incubi he will be saved thus making the final transition into becoming an Incubus himself. What Ink does not yet know is that the journey from one child's bedroom to the lair of the Incubi will be long and distraught and full of challenges both morally and transcendentally.With a soundtrack written by Jamin Winans himself and a screenplay co- written by his wife, Ink is a truly mesmerizing journey through the enlightening moments of the human experience. This is one film of 2009 that you will not want to miss out on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was thoroughly disappointed to see how poorly Ink has been rated. This is without a doubt one of the finest movies i have ever stumbled upon. Ink is essentially the classic fairy tale. Made on a minuscule budget,it masterfully utilizes effects to establish a dream like quality to the movie, without being overbearing. I guess what i truly love about the movie is that it has a very genuine feel to it. It doesn't pretend to be more than it is, but merely sticks to a good story and is executed brilliantly. Unlike many psychological thrillers, like "Pi", Ink does not lose itself to a convoluted story line, but rather, slowly leads the viewer to well established conclusions that provide the same thrill. This is truly one of the most memorable films of all time and certainly worthy of your time. It is a wonderful movie, and "The Pathfinder," is one of my favorite characters of all time.</fullReview>

After almost 2 hours ,i was sitting in the front of my TV ,speechles,dumbstruck,trying to understand what i just watched.I usually tend to resonate with the characters i love in a movie ,but this time was different,i was actually crying.And then it struck me,i had just watched one of most amazing ,brilliant,powerful movies ,and i am not saying this lightly.The idea ,the characters,the cast,the fight scenes,the soundtrack ,you name it ,are just amazing,but the most amazing think of all is how it made me feel after everything sunk in : is it possible that somebody is watching us just to make sure we won't fall off from some stairs?

		<fullReview>For people who don't like to think while they watch movies, this is not for you. But I do, and this movie is just euphoria to my mind. It is not often that people show the supernatural and the soul in the same film. It is about the ultimate choice of good and evil, between being left handed and right handed. In the basics review of the movie (stop if you don't want to know anything), the writer makes the characters like angels and demons that protect the world in the story's own way with their spiritual gifts and to save or destroy the life of the people in it. It is really beautiful and the ending made me cry. I highly recommend this movie, please watch it with an open mind. I like to compare it to Donnie Darko, in thinking level but it's different than that in story line.</fullReview>

What I found was a movie that quickly grabbed my attention. I have no complaints about Ink. I loved it from beginning to end and was completely enthralled in the story and where it was leadingI do believe this is one of those "you either love it or hate it" movies and I also believe many may not get the full story line. The interference run by the pathfinder was very creative within the story line with the what is, what could be etc. I also think the casting was done well and helped to make this a definite movie worth watching.Well done, so glad I stumbled upon it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive But Flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS AHEAD! Why did Jacob kill the other driver? The performance of Jacob in general and Jacob's causing the driving accident in particular mar what otherwise could have been a powerful, intriguing, emotionally moving film.Via inspired cinematography and an excellent performance by Chris Kelly as John, the film presents a world in which humans are influenced through their dreams and through whispers to their unconscious minds by warrior spirits reminiscent of guardian angels and demons called, respectively, Storytellers and Incubi. A drifter (sort of a spirit lost in limbo) kidnaps a little girl's soul, so the three storytellers involved are joined by a Pathfinder, a more powerful sort of warrior spirit, called Jacob.Unfortunately, although it becomes apparent from the dialogue that Jacob is intended to evoke the trickster sage type, sort of a Yoda or Mr. Wednesday type, with a delight in harassing or harming others in ways that make their lives better and pithy sayings-- Jacob even waxes rhapsodically about "listening to the beat" of life -- it also becomes apparent that Jeremy Make and/or director Jamin Winans are not up to the demands of the archetype. As depicted by Make, Jacob comes across not as wise but as adolescently self-righteous; his sayings make sense in the IMDb Quotes section or in print, but from the way Make's Jacob says them, they sound more like the poser "insights" of The Sphinx from the old Mystery Men movie.More and more as the film progresses, Jacob's successes (and the storytellers' awe of him) seem to occur only because the writer made them occur and for no other reason. By the film's halfway point, the viewer begins to feel insincerely manipulated by the writer every time Jacob appears on screen instead of engaged in the film. Fortunately, Chris Kelly's performance keeps pulling the viewer back into the film.The worst moment is when Jacob proudly sets in motion a chain of events that causes a car crash, in part to remind John he is not God and to think of others. Jacob and the storytellers rush over to check on John, but they completely ignore the other driver, clearly visible in one shot as slumped over in his vehicle. No other storytellers are seen tending to the other driver (even though numerous storytellers beyond our central three had been seen in the beginning of the film), nor does the film show any civilians tending to the other driver. The predominant impression is that the other driver is dead.So, to accomplish his mission, Jacob exploited the other driver as a pawn, even though it killed the other driver, with no remorse and no reaction beyond proudly stating that John is too proud? The remaining flaw is the alleged happy ending. John appears to have thrown away his career needlessly (a 30 second "I'm in the hospital with my daughter" before politely hanging up would have solved everything) just because his writer told him to for the sake of an easy moral message. Second, there is no indication that his spiteful in-laws will not isolate his daughter from him again the moment she is out of danger -- after all, his in-laws had ordered John to accept he has no daughter once they attained custody of her and have basically denied him any access to her, and nothing on screen ever suggests that these people are capable of compassion or gratitude or fairness. So it's hard not to imagine John ending up impoverished, homeless, and never seeing his daughter again now that he has fulfilled his function of awakening her.Despite all the above, this is in many ways an elegant, powerful film. One hopes that Jamin Winans will mature further as a writer/director and live up to the potential this film shows.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard about this film for a few years and never find the time or ran across it when my brain wanted a good Horror flick. First thing is that it is NOT a Horror film, it is Sci-Fi/Fantasy.This movie is very thought provoking even though the dialog is not the best. For an indie film the depth and amount of locations and characters amazes me (as I am a Director). What Jamin Winans did with only $250,000.00 is nothing short of magic.Movies don't often move me anymore; this one did. To the point where I question my own life and how I often put work before playing/interacting with my own children.Anyway you slice it the movie is great! The special effects are excellent for the budget and this film NEVER feels constrained by budget, or imagination. This truly is a rare gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Made for a quarter of a million dollars when Hollywood would have spent at least $100M and wouldn't have been as good. One of the reasons this works so well is because it wasn't made by Hollywood. Sure, could it have benefited by having different actors? Probably... but the acting isn't bad, it's pretty good - especially considering I heard this movie was 100% ADR. The production is top notch all the way around. You can see it for free on Hulu or Netflix, but I'd venture to say most people will want this in their collection if they can appreciate a REAL independent film, I'm not talking a Miramax flick that cost $20M to make. Don't miss this one and don't give up on it (as it does drag a bit from about 20 minutes in until about an hour in) - once you get to the "chain reaction" scene things start coming together and the last 30 minutes or so are SO powerful. The director did such a great job, his first feature "11:59" (which I watched because I liked "Ink" so much) was not nearly as good, but decent. His short film "Spin" is great. Can't wait to see what's next from Jamin Winans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Had I not been told this was an indie film, I wouldn't have known it. Had I not been told the budget for this was almost non-existent, I wouldn't have known it. Had I not been told by chance that it was worth a look... I never would have known it existed and this is practically a crime.The characters are well done and the actors carry them well; these are characters you can't help caring about and seeing as real people. The story is intriguing in that they give you just enough to follow along without giving things away; I honestly couldn't have told you how this was going to end and it's a breath of fresh air to come across a movie so truly unpredictable. The mythos behind the story (The Storytellers and the Incubi and how they work) feels full, solid, and real. You can tell there's a whole world behind this that you don't get to see all of and that only makes you wish the movie would keep going just so you can find out more. The whole concept itself is wonderfully original and has almost a folk tale sort of feel about it, putting one in mind of childhood creatures like the sandman, but is mature and modern, a brilliant use of childlike imagination and wonder used to tackle adult fears and real world problems. The most brilliant part about it being that it manages to do this without coming across at all campy or patronizing. It's a sad thing that this movie isn't more well known because it's utterly wonderful in every way a good movie should be. No doubt it will be a cult classic in short order. If it was possible to give a standing ovation via text, I would be giving one right now. If you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favour and give it a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has many flaws, but considering it was made for no budget (yet has incredible ambition - bravo for that) and never picked up by a studio, the photography and art direction alone are worth 8/10 stars. Uneven acting, but some brilliant moments; slow at times, but other times choreographed like the best rock-video-ballet; cheesy makeup on a main character, but completely genius visual construction on the evil incubi - completely original and incomparable, actually. It's a crime it was never released in theaters, maybe due to its anti-corporate, anti-one- dimensional-man, quasi-Bohemian point of view. If it had been produced in Europe, it would have been an indie hit and won awards, but Hollywood obviously is uncomfortable with a movie in this genre that dares to probe the subconscious in a non-cartoonish way. Yeah, it's not for everyone, but it's beyond me why people who don't go for this kind of film resort to accusing everyone else of being a shill for the filmmakers. Pretty low - typical of the grouch - you're in the minority so you have to accuse everyone else of being a fake. Sounds like Washington D.C. in here these days. For chrissakes, it's just a movie, don't get your panties in a wad just because somebody liked it and you didn't. PS - If you don't make it past the first 20/25 minutes, you won't like it, and you're too impatient for this kind of movie anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surrealism is a tricky genre; it's not quite science-fiction or fantasy, but definitely outside of reality. Ink is a great example of surrealism.This is definitely not a movie to pop in in you just want to waste a few hours. I tend to categorize movies as "beer movies", that you'd watch with a few friends and a six-pack; these are the movies that entertain without much thought. In contrast, "coffee movies" don't just entertain you; these are the movies that, after watching, keep you thinking. In the following days, you find yourself putting the pieces together, realizing connections that weren't obvious, and wanting to watch the movie again. This is a low-budget production that does not waste time and money on bad CGI or over-the-top makeup. The actors are not well-known, but are pretty good quality. And the story is a gem. How often have you had a dream -- or nightmare -- that affected you for days? Have you ever wondered what causes these dreams, beyond your brain processing events that have occurred or your immediate environment, and if something "bigger" has an influence?Ink is an adventure. It's not within the current science-fiction or fantasy trends (there are no vampires, no big scary monsters, and minimal special effects). But, if you are looking for something a bit more interesting than the Transformers franchise or with better acting than the average made-for-Syfy weekend movie, give Ink a try.</fullReview>

Number of non-superficial or artificial movies, yet with clear idea thought through and followed through movies are rare nowadays.I understand that movie like this one divides spectators. 90% percent will score it as either excellent or bad.

		<fullReview>Ink is really quite good... for being a movie such and such, and therein lays the problem with ink. It's a great independent, low budget, fantasy, growing up movie with an agenda, especially for fourteen year old. Yes, but is it a great movie, period? In parts, definitely so.The first 20 minutes tries to set the mood, in the worst ways possible. Right from the bat you get the horrid "oh no. it's one of those movies" feeling, and it isn't, at least not through and though. The acting is generally bad, sometimes cringingly so. The cutting is jumbled, jittery and a bit TV-ish. The special effects does its job with acceptable grades and even inventiveness. Thumbs-up for that.Now, you probably all know that and those are not reasons to watch any movie. Why you should watch Ink is because its an ambitious project which only made it through because of a heart, a lot of work and the strange spell of the internet. It draws from, and also gives homage to A lot of movies, without leaning to heavily one any. If I should pick any that would be something between Labyrinth and Silent Hill (in the best ways possibly), but it draws its mood from books like "Momo" (like "Dark City" cunningly did).I don't really see the target group here but I guess I would have loved it as an 14 year old. My rate varies between 5 and 7 so how about 6/10? It's not perfect but quite charming. If you're interested, give it a go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weirdest. Movie...no, Film. Ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was far and away the weirdest film I have ever seen, which includes Nightwatch, the Cube trilogy, and so on. I read all the reviews that were shocked that this wasn't picked up by a major Hollywood studio. If you watch it, and you're not completely delusion, you should have no problem seeing why. The acting was bad, the story was bizarre, and the ending was predictable once you got past the tripiness enough to figure out what was going on. That said, it was beautifully shot, and the music is perfect, but these two elements alone were not enough to. Ake me glad I watched it. One of the characters is so odd and obnoxious that it completely disrupts the feel of the movie. If you're into really triply indie films and can get past the bad acting that often comes along with it, you'll enjoy. Otherwise, I'd pass on this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was created, noticeably on a marginal budget at best. However, this talented crew has made the most out of every dollar.First, the screenplay is perfectly written and executed. The plot is cleverly woven, never revealing so much as to make the story predictable, but always revealing enough to keep the viewer attentive and deeply engaged. The story was highly original, while never being overly nuanced with echoes of other popular features. Some viewers have made references to the Matrix, and with a stretch, it's possible to understand why, but this comparison undermines the innocence of this film. The story is inspired and provides a beautiful rendition of the mythos of all great story telling, the conflict between good and evil and the flawed hero that dances between.Second, the screenplay is artfully interpreted through a mastery of direction. The actors are motivated and the scenes are compelling. The interplay between actors is emotionally charged and choreographed with precision; never is a scene drawn out too long so as to obstruct the flow of the story. The arrangement of sequences, combining flashbacks and parallel story lines is worthy of the same directorial credit given to Christopher Nolan for his 'Memento' and 'Inception'. The translation of the story from the written page to the vision that is gifted to the viewer is as perfect, one might imagine, as the music of Beethoven's complex mind as played out on a grand piano with all the subtlety and like his music, without any flaws.Last, the technical processing of the film- from the photography, to the lighting, to the editing, deserves a film enthusiast's highest recognition and honor. Alternating changes in frame speed, various filter applications, and creative angling (see car crash, see fight sequences, see incubi eyes, etc.) envelop the movie seamlessly with just about every trick in the photographer's play-book. Moreover, this banquet of camera work is so much at the very top of professionalism; the viewer never feels that it's an academic display of the photographer's knowledge. Just as well done was the lighting- soft edges frame intense memories and dreams, flickering of lighted panels give the viewer a palpable other-worldliness that the script requires, and the interplay between over-exposure and shadow is masterful. The editing was perfectly executed as well. Every snippet of extraneous footage has been left on the cutting floor where it belongs, leaving a tightly wrapped film with creatively mixes sequences that keep the movie ever flowing and never veering off course.The fact that this movie was constructed on a budget is obvious because of the types of props that have been used, and because the actors are relatively unknown, and while very talented, are more theatrical that what might be customary in film. But don't let that throw you- this is a film that requires theater. Despite its middle class pedigree, this is a world class case study on brilliant film making. I for one will be following the careers of the crew, because it's obvious to this reviewer that they'll each have a long and prosperous career in film making. Bravo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I registered solely to vote for this movie. I am not an everyday reviewer. I rarely post or dedicate time to anything of this sort but this movie deserves a better rating than the one I see. The script is amazing. The acting is very good. The music is phenomenal! Do not hesitate to give this movie a try, you will not regret the complete experience.. This movie might start slow for some but believe me when I say this, it is worth every minute of your time. You will watch it again and again and recommend it to others and watch it with them as well! Not bad for an indie film indeed. I would go out on a limb and say it is on par if not better than many of todays main stream movies. Be prepared for a ride that can only be described as a roller coaster of emotions and enjoy the overall experience to the end. Highly recommended :o)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something Different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally a movie that is something different. The movie is quite strange and the writer must have a big imagination. The storyline had its cracks and some things didn't make sense, but i don't think that everything needed to make sense. It was not the greatest movie i have seen in while but i don't regret watching it as i think it was well made and has some real depth to it. It made me think and that is one of the characteristics of a good movie. There are 2 ways to look at the events in this movie: one way is to see everything as a reality in which these 2 forces exist and fight without them knowing about it and the other one is that all that only happens in their subconscious minds and that maybe we all have those kind of battles in the hard times of our lives. I prefer the latter. Watching this movie did made me think about that view of life and its problems. I would recommend this movie but since not all people can open their minds to something different, some might not enjoy it, so if you don't usually like "weird" movies then don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those films that you stumble across, watch the trailer on IMDb and read the user comments to decide whether or not to watch it. Its a film you most likely won't hear about in the mainstream and based on the trailer you may think to yourself that its just another low budget indie filmed on digital....but you'd be be wrong.Don't get me wrong if your the type that only likes films that make you drool then you'll hate this film because it does require the use of your brain and that dusty old thing called your imagination.For all you other people its a beautifully filmed look into the human psyche, about redemption and what is truly dear to us in life. Im unsure as to what there budget was but i imagine it was less than a million dollar Hollywood movie would spend on paper for scripts. And with it they have created a masterpiece of cinematography with great characters and a meaningful storyline.The soundtrack was superb (although the main theme music was suspiciously similar to the music from "sunshine" by Danny Boyle).My hat comes off to all involved with this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie carries a unique idea and some beautiful visuals but it doesn't fit right with the poor execution. It may be an indie movie but no indie movie is determined to have poor fights without a style and devoid of any finesse. If you don't know nothing about those martial arts why try emulating them? And no movie (indie or otherwise) has to contain those cheesy right and wrong dialogs. The world's not about right and wrong only, it's way more complicated and it would be better to avoid that simplicity. The acting wasn't so great either. It could be a great experience overall but it failed to deliver anything more than a small aftertaste to me because I cannot accept an unskillfully dressed art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A LOT of good ideas but a bit of a messy execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ink follows the journey of eight year old Emma (Quinn Hunchar), who falls into a coma after she is kidnapped into a dreamworld by a mysterious monster, called Ink. In the real world Emma gets hospitalized after falling into a coma, but in the dreamworld she is being used by Ink as a pawn in a metaphysical war being fought between the forces of light and darkness.The forces of light are a group of people who give dreams to the living, known as storytellers, warriors, fighters, navigators and pathfinders. The forces of darkness, the Incubus, concurrently give nightmares to the living. Now Emma's only hope lies within her negligent father (Chris Kelly), a successful business man, as the forces of light cross over to the real world and try to alter his path to save Emma... What a crazy ride. Ink is unlike any other movie I know.Its definitely the most original movie I have ever seen and visually, it is quite stunning,the special effects really enhance the film.They're not state of the art GCI but they are tremendously effective.The soundtrack is wonderful and very suiting.The acting was good, specially Quinn Hunchar,this little girl is not only beautiful but she played her role with a maturity way beyond her age.The story its kind of a grown up fairy-tale and has an epic feeling to it,unfortunately it gets too confusing and complex at times,its one of those films you have to watch more then one time to fully comprehend everything that happened.My other complaint is the following: I think the movie is a bit all over the place.It has many great ideas and elements but it ends up being a bit messy.Having said that I'm amazed by what this director was able to accomplish with a low budget and probably not many resources.I see a LOT of great ideas here and I see a lot of potential.If Jamin Winans can do a film like this with this budget, I could only imagine what he would do with a Hollywood budget. In conclusion,Ink is a crazy and surreal journey that deserves to be seen.A very original and refreshing piece of work and the director is one to watch!7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just had the pleasure of seeing this film at the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood and I was blown away. I haven't seen something this original in ages. INK is film like no other. The acting, the storyline, the world, the editing, the music, EVERYTHING about this film took me by surprise. Its like nothing I've ever seen before. It does not do it any justice to compare it to other films, but it takes a little from Brazil, Sin City, and maybe even a little from the Matrix, but it is truly a world of its own. And amazingly, in this dark and sinister world there is still so much heart and emotion that never gets lost or goes over the top. This film is destined to be a cult hit and pave the way for a whole new genre of film-making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fooled again, shame on me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So it seems that there is a plague of undeserved positive reviews infecting review sites such as IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes. Call them what you want: shills, fakes, imposters, plants. Whatever you decide to call them, one thing is certain: the praise they pour onto bad films is usually easily spotted because of their generic sounding reviews. "This film is a miracle!", "Greatest accomplishment in cinematic history!", "My favorite film of all time!". All these people love this movie and yet no one has heard of it? It hasn't won any awards? Absolutely no one is talking about the movie except these "reviewers"? And you tend to find that the more truthful reviews (aka negative reviews) end up getting buried far down the review pages. So after being duped a couple of times, here's a tip on how to spot bad movies masquerading as good movies on IMDb. Look for the bad reviews. See what the discrepancy between the positive reviews and the negative reviews are. If the positive reviews are all giving the movie 9 and 10 stars and calling it amazing, and the negative reviews are giving it 3 stars and under - and there doesn't seem to be any in-between, then you've got yourself a real good candidate for a bad movie.Ink is one of those real bad movies that miraculously got amazing reviews on Rotten Tommatoes and IMDb. The good reviews are just praising this movie like it's a Best Picture contender, while I had to scroll pretty far down to find any negative reviews. That right there tells me that someone has a lot of friends drumming up some hype for them. Within the first five minutes of watching Ink I could immediately tell that this was amateur hour. When the best actor in the entire movie is a six year old girl, you know you've got problems. The movie starts off looking like a film school short (but alas, this movie is almost two hours long - and it felt like 2 years). The first lines yelled unconvincingly was three "f*cks" as a guy is driving a car down the road. Clich. Then we get a ton of editing cuts, and I mean a ton. You know what the easiest way to spot a bad movie is? When a director needs to use 500 cuts for two minutes of footage. We start off with random strangers in their beds sleeping and the camera never stops moving for what is supposed to be peaceful sleeping. It just goes all over the place with cut after cut after cut. Next we get a fight scene in a house between some good Dream Warriors and a bad dream warrior. The cuts were down right nauseating. Incomprenhisible action. 10 cuts were used just for running down the hall. And then those Adobe After Effects filters. My God, someone just used the entire library of filters for one movie. Every single scene had a different filter effect. Between the editing and the filters, you could tell this director was just trying to put lipstick on a pig. I won't spoil the movie, for those that may actually want to sludge through the entire thing, but let's just say there's a twist ending - that you can spot from a mile away if you pay attention (and let me tell you, it's damn near impossible to pay attention to the entire movie. You deserve an award if you manage to make it all the way to the end without falling asleep).The acting in Ink range from "surprisingly decent for a child actor" to "mentally disabled adult" (aka 1,2,3,4 guy). I'm sorry, usually I can forgive a film for raw acting, but when it's a combination of bad dialogue and reading straight from a cue card - that's where I draw the line. And I've read that they made this movie for $250,000!! I'm sure all that money went straight into the prosthetics for Ink's nose. Now I'll give credit where credit's due. The main little girl actress is too good to be in something this bad. She was the only believable thing in this whole movie (and that's including a dead corpse in a coffin). The only person who didn't look like they were acting. The lead actor (John) was serviceable. He had some decent diarrhea faces when he was sad and some OK constipation faces for when he was angry. And there were actually some good inventive characters. Mainly the evil Dream warriors who gave nightmares to the sleeping people. I thought the combination of the video screens over the faces with the eerie smiles and static was fairly well done, and very reminiscent of Terry Gilliam's work. Also, every so often there would be a well-composed shot or sequence that made me think that the director might have a little bit of talent (such as the butterfly effect sequence involving the car crash). But the sum total of the movie does not a good film make. It's laborious, laughable, and lame. It's a shame too, because under the right guidance, the story itself could have been quite interesting. I could have seen it evoking a Labyrinth-type design and journey. Please please please, if you end up watching this movie because of all the positive reviews you read - just turn it off early when you start to ask yourself "It must get better right?? The reviews are too good!". It doesn't get better. There's no transcendent moment that makes you go "It was worth it.". There's no redemption at all. The reviews are a lie. Just like the cake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So impressive...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, the movie was so impressive and it changed things in my life. Somethings about to forgive... It's changed my opinions about good and bad people. One of the my favorite quote from the movie is "Because I choose to see you for what you were intended to be, not what you've become.". Isn't it so engrossing ? I think about this for a while and now I think being good is something about to struggle. Everybody has a tough life and it is not easy to be good all time. Isn't important to try fix somethings ?It reminded me the movie which is called "The Fall" I know the topic is very different but they are similar in a way. Maybe the same fantasy elements. I don't know exactly but I've felt some similar feelings. Hence, I think if you like The Fall, you will likely to like this movie too.Changind destiny scene is also similar to another movie which is called "Benjamin Button". There was a accident scene. And I think The Prince is Laplace's demon. He can change the destiny with just a little push but knowing all conditions which is effects to that situation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a time waster, but not amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aspects of the movie were amazing, but it was easy to tell it was a low budget film. The idea was amazing, however certain features definitely detracted from the movie. Initially I had high hopes, but when I realized the movie displayed an unnecessary, annoying filter throughout I could tell the editing wasn't top notch. The plot and the story line had me going, but the acting wasn't superb (though definitely passable for a low budget film). Things that were irritating or distracting: the costuming was predictable or even detracting (for example, Ink's nose was way too over the top); also, the entry of the good dream creator's into the movie was a little clich and the fight scenes were a bit too predicable. Overall, the movie ended on a good note and made the first half seem quite a bit more bearable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>6.8? You guys who put this below an 8 should be ashamed. Go watch transformers and stop rating movies that you don't understand. I am surprised you could even figure out how to review a movie or use a keyboard if you can't understand that this movie is beautiful and artistic on so many levels. You should probably stick to coloring with your helmets on trying to stay in the lines and not hurt yourselves. I have watched this film 4 times now and, much like Eternal Sunshine, it get exponentially better with each viewing. I marked it as a 10 for that very reason but it is not to say I didn't enjoy it the first time. The first viewing I was extremely entertained but missed some of the subtleties that makes this movie what it truly is. That is not to say you won't understand it by the end but, just as with any well written yarn, it becomes richer with each experience (I call it an experience because that is truly what it becomes). You will not be able to help thinking in a supremely introspective manner after viewing this film. This film, if understood, has the power to make you a better person and a more valuable individual not only to yourself but to every person you come in contact with. If you are a film major (or just somebody who studies art) you owe it to yourself and your craft to soak this one up. In the words of the great Ron Burgundy..."Drink it in. It always goes down smooth" and satisfying.</fullReview>

Lots of footage, using lots of shiny postproduction effects, very little dialogue, lots of really, really stilted, mediocre, drama school type acting, and (for the most part) no sense of a plot at all. Oh, and lots of unimpressive fight scenes that seem entirely pointless and stretch the length of the film without making it any more exciting.It's the sort of pretentious nonsense that the most pretentious student in the film production class might produce in their final year to impress their most pretentious tutor - only this is hours and hours and hours of it.

		<fullReview>This movie is pretty good once you watch the whole thing. I was doubting it while watching but in the end I decided it was pretty decent. The acting is horrible though so the story is actually the only thing keeping the movie alive.I'll cite two examples of the acting, the first being at the beginning when Chris Kelly is driving his car and just bursts out into a screaming fit. It was noticeably contrite. The second scene was when the "tracker" meets the "storyteller" and he goes into a tirade for no apparent reason. It really makes me feel like the writer thought his dialogue was hip and cool but just fell flat. But those were the only scenes that I absolutely abhorred.The plot is pretty good and I think the use of time was well written. I also liked the creepiness of the Incubus characters and thought they were unique. However, even though the Incubi are nifty, the tracker's duct taped eyes make me roll mine. Even if the filmmakers were thinking about budget when designing his character, they could have made him look better than that.All in all it was a good movie and just stay strong through the first half-hour or so as it will get better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very experimental movie, with an extremely weird story, and even crazier visuals. Partly the story is great, and partly the visuals are amazing - sadly not always. This movie failed to create a homogeneous mass. Colors in the dreamworld sometimes look really trashy and plain bad - same goes for some costumes. The story has been bending the rules of time and logic itself - I am not quite sure if it wasn't too much for me. And while watching the movie, it felt like it was about saving the world, while it was only about rescuing a little girl.I am not totally sure how good I actually consider this movie, but I had fun watching the movie. I loved the character of Ink. This character made so much sense to me, and I liked the message he was transporting. I also really loved how the Incubus have been looking. Too bad that this movie has so many flaws, it could have been one of the best. (And I could list more flaws! Like: bad acting, music-video feeling and bad action scenes.)I don't know when a film is given the title of an independent movie. But I guess this is one, and it might have been the best I have ever seen. (Unless Pi is considered an independent movie as well. That one is far superior.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard of this movie when reading some piracy news and decided to give it a closer look when i read the producers embraced piracy for the benefits of advertising the movie. After reading the reviews here i see plenty 10 out of 10 with almost as many 1 out of 10 reviews... Obviously people reviewing this movie need to let go of their own presumptions and "demands" and look at it from the correct perspective. With a budget of just 250k and actors from the "reject" pile (in lack of better choice of words) one would expect this movie to be sub par at best with plenty lesser quality props and one or two frequently re-used "refined" props and horrible acting throughout the entire movie... It's far from horrible or cheap!The first 30 minutes... or was it 50??? It felt like more! Either way, the beginning of the movie leaves you with an empty feeling as there is no story happening and at first glance you might think this is all because of a horrible plot, bad acting or bad directing. However, if you give it the attention it needs (which basically means, pay attention to what's happening) for the first "odd" parts and you should start figuring out what it's all about.The second half of INK is the part where everything starts making sense and if you paid attention and at the very least tried to get into the movie in the first half you should be hooked by now! As the saying goes: "It's better to end with a BANG" and in this case, the movie ends with a spark, ignition and firestorm. Every piece of the puzzle is laid and because you had to invest into the story to understand it you are more deeply involved with it all which shows you the whole point of the movie, for me it nearly ended in tears. (Not the bad kind but the emotional kind)---The beauty of this movie and movies like it is that instead of pulling you along a red carpet where everything about the movie is fed down your throat with a hose you are supposed to figure it out yourself. It's like reading a book where you are allowed to fantasize about the character, rather than having a picture slammed in your face you draw it with your mind. You get involved in the story in a whole different way as you try and gather information on who is who and what their part is in the film.The other wonderful thing about this production is that with the limited budget, rather than spending almost every penny on some super awesome special effect they spread the budget across the entire movie so that you aren't left with a laugh about how some parts of it was really cheap while others had that extra OOMPH to it for no apparent reason other than being the ending scene or whatever. The filters and effects they applied to the camera throughout the movie at first felt rather distracting and cheap but it's all part of the story telling. You will know what i mean if you watch the movie. Which you should as long as you are prepared to give it a FAIR CHANCE!In summary, it deserves a 7 out of 10 because every asset they had they utilized perfectly! If they had slightly better acting and a little bit more room for depth to the movie it would have gotten an eight for sure! Whoever ordered this production should have given it more to work with!---Now a word to all those who rated this below average:Either this movie wasn't in your taste or you failed to understand it and if you didn't understand it's possibly due to you not giving it the attention it needed in the first half or sadly because you are of lesser quality yourself... or both?And to those who rated it 10 out of 10:Are you absolutely sure you haven't seen a better movie than this one ever in your entire life? A top rating like that isn't something you simply throw away. It ruins the entire purpose of having a rating system to begin with.SHAME ON YOU ALL!

		<shortDescription>Better than Inception</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and two teenagers watched this movie last night via Netflix Streaming. The first 30 seconds were jarring, followed by a few moments of confusion, but that was a small price to pay for what was by far the best movie for us of the year. We just got back from Inception the weekend before which was a great ride, but not the deep work this was.I would not recommend a movie of this complexity and with this much force for anyone under 13. The violence is not comic book, but very in some cases very real. A must for adults struggling to balance job and family. This movie is not at all preachy, but obvious lessons are offered. Goodness and evil defined for the 21st century makes the lessons hard to ignore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Non Hollywood Movie to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ink is a fantastic indie film. At first it may seem hard to understand but it's a more complex film than what you usually see in theaters, however if you actually watch the whole movie it all comes together and it's quite heartwarming. The acting in this movie is great, from the little girl to John. Of course it's not ultra high grade Oscar acting but once again for an indie film it's quite believable. The plot and setting are even more impressive. The sets span many different areas and I'm surprised how thought out they were. The movie's concepts are pretty far out but the sets fit perfectly and complete the story.Ink is a great movie to watch if you're bored of the usual Hollywood moneymaking movies and want to watch a movie that is both different and enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thumbs up for this superb film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is definitely not every day that a film like Ink is made. Not even every month and I dare to say there are few of this kind every year. But when I consider the approach of its creators, I must say I'm not that surprised.After reading an article about the unusual tolerance &#x2013; joy even &#x2013; the filmmakers expressed about this movie being pirated, I just had to see it. It is very unusual for filmmakers to openly point out the struggle indy films experience on the market these days &#x2013; even the problems with getting paid by the already established bigger distribution companies &#x2013; and go out of their way to make their film available to those who films are actually for.The film is a celebration of creativity, fantasy, a never-ending game of lights and film-making experimenting all wrapped into a story everyone understands and can relate to: When Emma, a little girl, is taken at night by a creature called Ink, into a different world that exists parallel to what we can see and comprehend, a fight between good and evil unfolds for the girl's life, a result of which largely depends on the path her father chooses.Apart from some of the weaker performances by some of the actors and actresses and the little slow of the pace in the second half, the film is just one big spectacle of what I call a film-making art.I was so reminded of Aronofsky's The Fountain and Requiem for a Dream from the first till the last shot, which, surprisingly, did not bother me at all. On the other hand. I enjoyed how the story was told and that there was just the right amount of that imagery not to disrupt the overall impression of the film.A great achievement for such a little budget.Thumbs up, in all aspects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clearly low budget but beautifully crafted into a rare and interesting film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admire this movie. It takes on such an interesting and unique idea. (at least in modern films) Unspoiled plot overview... The main plot involves a guy named John that got so caught up on his work/alcohol that he neglected his family is such a way that he becomes this bitter self absorbent pr*ck whose actions cause a series of strange and quite disturbing events in a parallel dreamlike world with no time restrictions. Meanwhile the more prominent aspect of the movie is the idea that while people sleep, these "storytellers" which look like "hip 20 something-year-olds" come and give you good dreams (demonstrated by slightly clichd but generally successful images of what people seem to cherish most.) at the same time Incubi come and give you nightmares.(these dudes look pretty weird and maybe even mildly terrifying) John's daughter, an adorable girl that i swear looks exactly the girl in poltergeist is seen being the generic cute little girl that you know is gonna have a main role in the movie. This other character(with a gargantuan nose) is introduced that pretty much kicks all the storytellers butts and manages to escape kidnapping John's daughter in the "dreamworld" and leaving her in a coma in the real world. The motive behind this guy is apparently he wants to become a Incubus and needs a sacrifice. This is where the plot begins to unfold as the storytellers try to get her back in the dreamworld with the help of a rather comic relief like character (that is apparently a blind "gatekeeper" with electrical tape crosses on his eyes...but hey its forgivable...specially because considering the nature of the movie probably has a deeper meaning) before is too late. On the real world we follow John as he tries to manage his VERY IMPORTANT executive job and his daughter being in a coma. His pride over takes his persona and there is a lot going on in his mind regarding events in his past. My thoughts on Ink... Well this movie seems to capture you in a way that not many movies now days do...the imagery is pretty awesome (as in awe inspiring). There's so many aspects of the "dreamworld" that seem very interesting and even seem to reassure some beliefs cemented by famous books or old folk stories. The camera work is good. the acting is decent and it works with the overall indie feel of the movie. The special effects are very good considering the budget. (i think $250,000 as some reviewer mentioned) The way it manages space-time is clever yet simple enough to understand without having to think deeply. Ink really does the best it can with the small budget and it becomes a really heart felt, genuine, unique and overall interestingly good movie. I recommend you guys check it out when you don't have anything to see and you're not with your ACTION CRAVING, MICHAEL BAY LOVING friends.9.3</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie I've seen in awhile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't justify an indie movie's success to me personally by their budget, I justify an indie movie's, or any movie's success by how it captivates me as the viewer.My girlfriend and I are avid movie watchers, and we both agree when it comes to movies when we're picking one that we want one that respects our intelligence as the viewer.Ink did not.Ink exploits so many borrowed rhetorical devices to make this seem like an allegory, when in reality, a good allegory occurs when you have actors that play a character you care about on top of an elegantly (or even decently) constructed plot that is delivered in an intelligent way, and the components left out to make it an allegory are left out for you to construct your own theories about, but it only works the story has elements for which you care about.About 40 minutes into the movie, my girlfriend literally turns her head into the couch and falls asleep. "Are you bored?" I asked, she nodded indefinitely.So, I decided I would finish the movie to get my money's worth, for at this point, there HAS to be some sort of pay off to the movie, a pay off to all the out of sequence rules and explanations.The confusing cut scenes and the "mysterious" plot that is the product of the writer trying too hard, putting too many rules to the universe in, and then not explaining them to make it seem intellectual rather than well structured.I found myself regretful that I'd selected the movie. The back of the box describes a great movie, and this was not. It claims to be on par with fantastic movies like Donnie Darko, and even the Matrix, it is not, nor does it deserve to be compared to such well delivered movies. Ink is nothing but a glorified abortion with some interesting concepts that fail to meet their expectation.This movie being compared to such quality movies, I expected a great film, and was utterly disappointed at the execution of this movie. Special effects DO NOT make a movie, and if they did, this would be pretty decent. The description on the back of the box was more enjoyable than the actual movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor story, actors, dialogs, nice effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, I really can't understand the good rating of this movie. Well, 4-5 stars, OK, but 7, that's sick. I also watched this movie because of the good reception this movie got, and sadly it was a waste of time.I watched the whole movie, which was pretty difficult sometimes, and I had to split it up in two days, because it was so damn boring.But well, let's start with the good things: The effects are astonishing for this low budget, some scenes are really great, there are a some good ideas in this movie (first fight scene), soundtrack is OK and the little girl and her father played their roles very well.However, that's the whole good stuff. In contrast to those two good actors performed the rest really poor. Worst, the story teller. I don't know if it's the actors fault or because of the lack of dialogs, if we can call them dialogs at all. As I said in the beginning it was really troublesome for me to watch this movie. On the one hand because of the poor actors, on the other hand, because of the lack of dialogs and long senseless scenes. You can watch a second movie at the same time and still know at the end what Ink was about. The story executed in this movie is poor (I don't talk about the idea), the dialogs non-existent and action not available (fight scenes look ridiculous), the story and the characters have just no depth and the background music in dialogs too loud most of the time (maybe so we don't notice how poor the dialogs really are).It was one of the most boring movies I've ever watched. If I look back and try to remember some good scenes or dialogs of this movie or some scenes I would like to look again, well, then there's nothing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You've no doubt already read the summary, now hold on a second and hear me out: I'll start by stating that I like many others had heard the comparisions and praise this film has been receiving, so I decided to stoke my curiosity, bad idea. This film has a few good ideas wrought with poor execution. The nature of the story is something we have heard before, the conflict is nothing new. Some have commented on the actors, and yes, they are as bad as you've heard. The script, or lack thereof, is very thin, very very poor character development in every case except John the main character. Why is he so important? The movie never tells you, the storytellers and incubus are just there to be opposing forces and add to a weak narrative. The concept is great and when I read the description I was excited, I understand the limited budget but you cannot use that to justify the dross of this film. The story is told in fragmented pieces, which has been done quite a bit already, but it isn't done well. Not until the 40 minute mark do we have any sort of idea of whats going on, they should have left at least 20 minutes on the cutting room floor. The film lacks dialoge too, for the slow pacing you would expect some dialoge to keep things moving, but all you get is a mediocre score that only aids the snail-like pace of the movie.So why did I even bother giving it a 3? There's some neat concepts that should have stayed in the oven a bit longer for one. Second, it has some decent effects here and there that were impressive for the budget. And third some of the photography is somewhat inspired. But in most of the film I disagree with the photography, it really should have been applied better so you knew what dimension you were in, or you knew you were watching a dream or a flashback and so on. I cannot in good conscience recommend this film to anyone who wants a film with substance or a good cohesive idea because this movie does not know what it is trying to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard some good things about this film but after just the first ten minutes, I had to pause it and check the other reviews to see if it got any better. One in particular said to wait it out until the 20 minute mark. So I tried slogging through some more stagnant dialogue, inane morality whining, and acting best saved for community theatre,to come to the conclusion that most of the reviews must have been written by the director's friends. I wondered if I was coming down with quick on-set glaucoma for all of the blurry post-editing fluff added on the screen and the sound design and soundtrack felt like they were mixed on someone's 10 year old Mac. The story might have made an interesting graphic novel, or a five minute short, but this pretentious, horribly-casted "indie" is best avoided.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different, but in a good way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For about the first thirty minutes of this movie, I was a bit confused with what was going on and not extremely interested with what was happening in the movie. At that point, I could have just stopped the movie and gone on to do something else. But, I heard that the movie was good, so I also could have decided to give it another chance and watch the rest of it. I'm very glad that I went with the second choice. As the film continued on, it just kept getting better and better. Things in the story became clearer to me and near the end all of the pieces of the story fit together perfectly, revealing that the scenes in the beginning weren't just thrown into the movie for the heck of it, but were used to reveal the full story of the movie. I just hadn't realized it since the scenes where not put exactly in chronological order. Things happened that I wasn't expecting, and the movie proved to be terrific. There were bizarre moments in the movie, but those moments just made the film unique, allowing it to stand out from other movies. And sure, maybe some lines weren't delivered just quite right, but the incredible story and outstanding music score easily made up for that. The story is very complex and can be hard to understand, which is why I think some people thought that the story was full of gibberish and meaningless things. If they could have just paid closer attention to the film and tried harder to understand the story, they might have realized how fantastic the story really was. I ended up really enjoying this film, and if you can handle a complex, well thought out story, then you should really enjoy this movie and truly appreciate the film's uniqueness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smeagol's Redemption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beauty of Indy films is that they can take chances, the rewards of Indy films are the amazement of combined entertainment and enlightenment derived from a well constructed, well paced, well written, well acted, well directed potential film (or film noir) masterpiece. What if Mozart had only a tinker toy piano upon which to express his views.This is a low budget independent film with few special effects and no sex, drugs or rock and roll, however, that being said, (Thank you Larry David!) it is a drama of life and death, a fantasy of past, present and future, a multiple time line theme that has familiar classical (over and) undertones, and yet possesses a newness that is remarkably compelling in an avant-garde,very indie-film sort of way. It combines a new wave interpretation with a classical or timeless fantasy feel. I think it it does pay homage to and at times mimics remarkable older films such as "Brazil", "Dark City", and Bekmambetov's magnificent and vastly under appreciated "Night Watch" and "Day Watch" films, as well as some older fiction novels such as Dickens' "A Christmas Carole" and Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings" (perhaps as a spin off tale might have been written as Smeagol's redemption). Although the film stumbles and falters and occasionally borders in a few places on being pretentious, it does not get close to being preachy, cloying, or soap operatic. In the hands of a lesser director, cast, and crew this could easily have lapsed into a disaster.&nbsp;I found myself enjoying this film more and more as I watched. NOTE: I almost stopped watching after 15-20 minutes. Shame on me! Patience can be it's own reward, but then sometimes, it can be so much more. I was also reminded favorably of the under rated film "What Dreams May Come", (without the tears and production).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*mild spoilers, but nothing that will really effect watching the movie*This is my disclaimer. I am not a movie critic. I am not a professional nor even a novice movie reviewer. I rarely delve into movies to understand their deeper meanings, and in fact rarely ever WATCH such movies. I love action, sci-fi, comedy, and only the extremely rare drama. My experiences with the few indie flicks I've seen (on recommendation) have typically left me with a feeling of disgust at a gory and twisted plot, or so utterly confused that even with a walk through I haven't the slightest clue as to what the movie was about.When I saw this movie on Hulu this evening, I checked here to find a few trailers. What I THOUGHT was a trailer, turned out to be the actual movie, and before I knew it I was sucked in. The special effects, though low key, were VERY enjoyable. The characters were highly intriguing. The story line moved at the perfect pace so as not to leave me bored and wishing to fast forward, but not so fast that I felt I was in a marathon sprint to get to the end. Action scenes were perfectly sprinkled through out, and the dialogue was minimal yet felt adequate enough that I was never left wondering what was going on.For those who prefer to know, there are a large-ish number of curse words, a number of fight scenes (no graphic violence, just your typical punches, kicks, throws, and a few stabs but nothing squirm or 'hide your eyes' worthy), and though a few scenes were a little uncomfortable, none were what I would consider scary. I scare pretty easily too, so that's saying a LOT.The story is about an unseen world comprised of the Storytellers, those who encourage good dreams while we sleep; and the Incubus, who give only nightmares and dark thoughts. (Side note: the only MAJOR issue I had with this movie was the use of the name incubus simply for the fact that these beings were NOT the traditional definition of the word. The only connection I could find was that they did for a fact mess with people in their sleep, and they seemed to all be male.) "Ink" follows the story of a man who kidnaps a dream version of a child and takes her into the dimension of the Storytellers and Incubus. His plan seems to be to deliver her to the Incubus in exchange for becoming one of them. Along the way he encounters a Storyteller who becomes his prisoner along with the little girl. As they make their way to the 'assembly' (where he will deliver the girl), we the viewers find that for some reason the Storytellers are highly upset by this abduction and are doing everything in their power to rescue this child. In our dimension, we also follow along the story of a highly successful man who is the father of the child, of which we find that the child's physical body is in a coma in a hospital.That's all I will say about plot. I really have to encourage anyone to give this movie a chance, even if you aren't an indie film fan. If nothing else, at least try the first 10 minutes before hitting the 'close' button.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first when I heard of Ink, I didn't think much of it. It's something like a stone beside the road. After watching this, I was mesmerized by the amazing visual, great action, top-notch acting and costumes, etc etc.The starting scene between the father and daughter was strong and emotional, seeing a mature person, all grown, married and old being told to role-play for his daughter.The action scene does not disappoint. It's mostly fist-fights with blunt weapons, but vigorous and action-packed.The costume of the incubus i.e. the bad guys was amazing. Creepy and evil.The whole story leave the audience clueless, but the pieces of the puzzles falls in their places. It's a warm-hearted story, sad to an extent. The twist ending exploits time-traveling clich, but imo, the twist isn't the main supporting column for the plot.Overall, Ink is a great fantasy flick, on par with Pan's labyrinth, The Fall and Mirrormask(which seems like a sister to Ink). Watch this and spread the word.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Profound romp through the unconscious world.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll preface by saying that this movie has all the flaws of an indie film, some shaky acting, and a few low budget effects. But I gave it a perfect rating to counteract the low rating it was getting. Which I guess is counter productive for a site based on social rating systems.Ink is not for everyone. This is not a scifi movie. This movie should be approached as you would a dream. The vivid images and somewhat disjointed storyline give it a dream-like feel. Moreover, if the characters and events in this movie are interpreted as they would be with a dream, it takes on a profound meaning that is far reaching and diversely resonating.I'm not a fan of scifi movies because usually even if they have something meaningful to say they waste time with exposition explaining this and that. This is another way Ink is not a scifi movie. It doesn't waste time trying to legitimize itself. And if you recognize that the fantastic characters are symbolic, it doesn't need to.Ink is a movie about a man's subconscious world. Take in every scene in the dream world, because each one has a meaning beyond what you see on the screen. The message is deep and ,in my opinion, very important. This movie is dense, with the exception of a few scenes involving the storytellers, there is very little exposition that doesn't drive the message of the film.This movie would not do well in theaters. I don't think most people out there are ready for Ink.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watch about 200-300 movies a year. I've become quite numb when it comes to movie atmosphere -- i.e. it takes a lot to make me feel more than excited about action and violence. Ink did it. And it did it very deeply. I'm almost ashamed to admit this, but I haven't cried like this for a movie in years.. if ever.Something in Ink touched my own lifeline. I doubt it'll do the same to most of you. To understand Ink your life needs the same ingredients it contains.But something about the movie also. After watching it 20 minutes I was about to press stop, but then the first intensive scene started. Some action, nice. I let it continue. Then it started to fade away and I was thinking, does this movie ever really start. But it did. I was just too blind to see that it was actually building the plot. After an hour I thought it deserves 7 or even 8. I was wrong. I don't want to spoil more, so I'll just say that when it ended, I was crying like a little baby.You can make movies looking better than the Ink but considering the budget they had, it is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me say that I had been looking forward to this film for quite some time, and I couldn't have been more disappointed. The most annoying thing about this picture is that it had the potential to be the next Pan's Labyrinth, when instead it barely qualifies as the next Labyrinth. Every "revelation" is telegraphed to the viewer at least twenty minutes prior to the reveal. The characters can more accurately be described as caricatures. The acting is passable at the best moments in the film, and the most interesting thing about the movie, the nightmare-producing Incubi, is incredibly downplayed. And the dialogue... some of the stiffest I've ever seen. To be polite, it was "on the nose" far too often. The best thing I can say about it is that if count each clich you find, you'll have a pretty good drinking game. I wanted to like this movie, I really did. Unfortunately it wouldn't let me.</fullReview>

I have no hesitation or doubt in stating that this is absolutely my favorite movie ...period! General opinion seems to be that the start appeared a little slow and maybe a little loose at times but even during that first 30 minutes I was hooked, knowing for sure I was watching something totally different. The visuals, the simple and honest acting, the original and moving storyline in fact everything about this movie just gelled for me. Six months on and this movie stays with me on a daily basis, the message, the idea that we are flawed but not without the possibility of redemption if we but seek it. This movie was for me an amazing and uplifting experience, and one for which I will be eternally grateful that I was able to share. Jamin and Kiowa Winans have in my opinion produced a cinema cult classic, and deserve the highest of praise for their efforts.

		<fullReview>Alright. Truth to tell, I saw the trailer and wanted to see this movie... badly. I did, and I'm somewhat disappointed now.In my eyes there is one serious problem with this movie. It's totally, completely, utterly overloaded. It's not that I don't get it, but there are simply too many ideas in this thing fighting for dominance with each other. Its one of these creative projects where the mind behind it seems to have tried to put everything in it that made his brain tick. Like he's afraid that he won't get another chance.Well Mr. Winans. Let me tell you something. You're terribly talented. Take your time. You're good now, keep at it an you'll be good for years to come.Well now, let's get to the point. This movie is just a convoluted mess of ideas. Enough for probably three to five movies. While nothing of it is terribly original, the mix actually makes it worthwhile (yeah, I seem to argue against myself but this movie is just this kind of movie). There's influences to be seen all over the place. Matrix-fighting, DonnieDarko weirdness, DarkCity look-and-feel, Aronowsky editing, hell, the story feels like out of a twisted Michael Ende's world of Momo.But, alas, as mentioned above, the whole thing fails too deliver in terms of... consistency, focus. The main story is also far too predictable. I kept waiting for a twist, but it never happened. After five minutes you'll probably figure out how its gonna end, and a thing like that is doing terrible things in terms of drama and pacing.On the other hand, the really interesting things are never followed through. What's a Pathfinder and why the hell is he taping his eyes, what are the dream guys doing and whats the organization acting as evil counterparts. What's a Storyteller? Why does he have that nose? (my guess would be because he's lying to himself... you know Pinnochio like...) Matrix 2+3 told us far too much. This movie tells us far too little. Don't get me wrong. I like to think about a movie. Watch it more than once and come to my own might-be-answers (see DonnieDarko), but there have to be hints. Ambiguous hints are alright, but here there are none, so when the movies over, you don't feel motivated to explore.On the technical side I have to say, while low budget, they still could've done better. Well, the only thing that really ticked me off were the constantly overexposed images. It just seemed like exactly what it was, a cheap effect, and nothing else.Awesome, on the other hand, was the thing with the reassembling furniture. More of an awesome idea than an effect, but still. Also the screens in front of the bad guys. Also the chain-event scene of the Pathfinder. Yes, I DO like this movie, it just has some major mistakes in it, that lessened the experience considerably.Watch it if the Trailer hit the right nerve, all failures aside, its still something you don't see every day and at least watch out for this Director/Writer. I'm pretty sure there are great things to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is going to be a short one. After first 30-40 minutes I wanted to switch to another movie and thank god I did not. Beautiful story and I only can say that it's 1000% worth to watch it. Don't judge after seeing bad made fake nose or other little details. It's not important. The whole thing going to make sense in second half of the movie. It's wonderful how you can put all the peaces together and then see how simple things should be most important. Still after finishing the movie I am thinking about all different meanings of that master peace and how bad judgment I had at the start. Wonderful story, so touching and worth seeing.</fullReview>

Now, that will probably earn me a score of zero on the "Was the above comment useful to you?" check box, but oh well. The score is quite beautiful. It is touching and haunting at the same time. Regarding other reviews, and my advice. I have read several reviews, and the sometimes nasty comments to follow. My comment on this film is to let it develop. Watch the whole picture. I was shocked to learn that this was an independent film, but the cast should have been an immediate giveaway.

		<fullReview>I first seen the trailer online. I am a Sci Fi genre geek and i did as i do always; searching for new releases of this genre to feed my imagination. I cam across this movie online. The trailer wasn't extraordinary and watching it i had a whole different concept about what this movie would be like. Then I had the chance to rent and see this movie. I was like OMG even since the beginning. This is something i would like to watch and remember, this one i am sure will stay forever in the top list of the best sci fi of all time, no questions about it! it. I must ad that the movie may look inexpensive, but it's not. Only the idea makes it that way. Very well imagined and reinvented watching this movie would teleport you in this great world of imagination and art. Please watch this movie by buying it or renting it. It truly deserve the money. The director and the producing company should be encouraged to produce more of these beauties. Bogdan Canada</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly i didn't expect much before i watched this. If you read the negative reviews most admit to only watching 20 minutes of it. It's a low budget indie flick, don't expect cutting edge effects, or perfectly choreographed fight scenes. what they've done with that budget is nothing short of an amazing. If you're one who gets easily distracted by slowly evolving story lines, or lack of familiar faces, you probably won't like this movie, The story moves slowly, but it's a good story. I'd much rather watch a decent indie flick like this, than some of the big budget over-hyped garbage they're kicking out these days. good story &gt; big budget imho.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The DVD cover advertised that it was "A Dark, Wondrous, Poetic Tale" but those things always exaggerate. If it weren't for one picture on the back of the case, I would have put it back on the shelf and never thought about it again. I'm so glad I didn't.Ink was all those things and more - surreal, intriguing, imaginative - and one of the things that really surprised me - well acted. Not a single member of the cast was a face I recognized, most of them have only acted in a handful of movies, but every performance was smooth, well delivered and did not detract from my immersion in the film. In similar praise, the dialog was never stilted or forced (which is more than I can say for some movies raking in the box office dough). Whoever this Jinan Winans guy is, he's one to watch - he wrote, directed, scored and produced this gem with Kiowa Winans (either his sister or wife, I can't find an answer to that).It's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, don't miss it.</fullReview>

If ever a movie were to place one back into their own heart it is this one. It is a beautiful movie from beginning to end, it feels great, it appeals to not only the visual, and the kinesthetic but even to the auditory while following the true "beat" of life. You gotta watch this movie otherwise you may be plain missing out on a really cool experience! I have seen thousands of movies in my lifetime and often turn movies off after just a few minutes when they bore me to tears.

		<fullReview>I watched this movie online, didn't aware whats this about at start. The whole idea is very cool, and unique. We don't need the big celebrities to be in the action, what we need is something that can show us another side of life. There are a lots meaning in this film. I enjoyed from very beginning to the end, the music, the actors, and the colors etc... I cant believe the entire movie only cost $250000 dollars. Good movies does not shine on the big bucks. This low budget movie is a good example for indis. It turned out to be very stunning. Its abit hard to follow the storyline at first, but after 10mins of watching, you will found out its all linked together. The story behind this is a great comparison to our darkside of life. This is something we should think of. Truly its a story teller...I love it. We need more films like this one! Cheers</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the beginning of this movie you'd think it is one of these cheap movies that use corny words and sentences. As you progress with the movie you get sucked into the lives of these people. Although we are not told why this girl is so important, it should be obvious for us that the girl represents all of our loved ones. I don't know what the main interpretation behind the movie was, but i believe it speaks of depression and the way it scars the soul. How it changes who we are, and it affects the lives of our loved ones. This movie is truly enlightening and moving. I promise you that you will have some tears in your eyes by the end of this movie.

		<shortDescription>INK - a hope for independent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film warrants a comment. As a film school graduate, I can fully understand and appreciate the hard time, effort, love, and disappointment that can accompany a film. This independent gem gave me hope. Something feels different with this film. It's not the contrived "indie" that insults one's intelligence, but instead a true labor of love (I mean c'mon the man did sound, editing, directing &amp; writing). Maybe because it's an indie production and I'm trying to support it or maybe because it's just a great film. The truth is that this movie takes you on a journey that is both fantastical and yet so very real. It makes you understand with its distinctive story telling, the importance of simple choices we make in our lives, especially when these choices affect the lives of children. It's a movie worth watching.The film has all the elements for great movie-watching and does not disappoint. The unique story line provokes and intrigues without being overdone nor extravagant. The acting commands our attention. The direction excellently frames the story, while the amazingly executed cinematography, sound, and editing complete the film.Please watch this movie: it is a true pleasure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>INK is truly an amazing film, and really lived up to the hype. I worked with Double Edge Films in the past on several products, so when I heard about INK, I was very excited to see it. After hearing an incredible amount of hype on it, I was worried that I would be disappointed when I finally saw the film.When I did see the film, I was blown away. Visually it looks amazing, has a great concept, and really found a way to dig in to me and involve me while watching. I can't believe this film hasn't been picked up by Hollywood yet. It's great to see how much they have done without the backing of a big studio though, and everyone I know that has seen the movie has the same reaction.

As a huge science fiction fan, I can normally stand just about any crap in this genre and I would probably give any movie in this genre a higher rating that it really deserves. But without an intriguing story or philosophical depth, this movie was just unbearable.Of all the thousands of movies I've seen during my life, this movie was definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen.</fullReview>

We finished our Sunday lunch and I drove over to the DVD rental store with my sister to get a movie.There was not much choice on that day that we had not already seen.Eventually the women behind the counter recommended Ink. I still voted for The Happening (which I have still never watched but hear is also rubbish) but my sister went with the lady and chose Ink.I never stepped into that DVD store again. (Partly because the store went bust a few months later).10 minutes in my sister apologized to dad for wasting his ?3.50. 20 minutes in I apologized for not overruling my sister and choosing The Happening which could not possibly be worse than this movie. In short this film nearly ruined a rare family day. But we all sat through it taking the TORTURE that this film is as a family and we got through it. At the end of the film we all apologized to ourselves for wasting 107 minutes of our lives.1/10. Utter rubbish. 1 point for costumes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ink is wonderful.After you have watched this movie, you may be a better person. Although this sounds pretentious and I assume not everyone may be affected by this film as I was, you will definitely FEEL something inside. Something that all high-budget productions cannot deliver. It's not about a rosy love-story or a martial arts fighting movie like matrix. It is something special, it is unique among all other films I watched in my life. I'm truly lost for words, because I am not a native speaker, therefore I cannot fully describe what I have just seen. But I can recommend you this movie, but only if you are interested in a truly heart-touching and innovative story with a examination of existential questions on life, shoot beautifully and acted comparatively skilled, because it is just a low-budget production that you probably will not event recognize if you don't know. After having watched you will understand. All others I can recommend to avoid this movie, to prevent too much of negative critics here on IMDb, because that is not what this film deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Intriguing and original indie fantasy movie. Forces of light and darkness (who kind of come off like the angels of Wings of Desire, subtly influencing living people, as well as providing good and bad dreams at night) war over the souls of a little girl who has fallen into a coma and her absent, Wall Street professional father. Meanwhile, in the spirit world, a monster named ink has kidnapped the little girl's soul in exchange for a career as an incubus (which is the name given to the dark forces). Director Winans creates a unique look with high definition digital video, and, while his direction and editing are pretty spastic (perhaps influenced by Darren Aronofsky's first three films), once I got used to it I could see a lot of talent behind his work. Unfortunately, the amateur actors, who all seem to have been cast from a community college acting course, are simply terrible, and it significantly harms the movie. I'd love to say the film needs to be remade, because with even slightly better actors some of the more emotionally potent ideas of the movie could have been sold better. But I'd be really afraid that a bigger, Hollywood remake would lose the remarkable aesthetic qualities. Some of the images Winans comes up with are truly startling, especially his incubi.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very good film by an independent production, which although had some flaws in the visual effects at some points (there are some fight-scenes which stop motion for some reason), however gave off a magnificent jewel in independent cinematography.From the beginning the film captivates the audience and does not fail to make us smile or chill where it is supposed to. The director is very confident and does not underestimate or overestimate his audience, giving out the plot exactly as it should be given out, without any hints and without any holes.The structure of the film is much like an ancient Greek tragedy, the direction is amazing and manages to pass on the feelings and thoughts of the director, the cast is doing a great job with just a few rough edges that could be worked on. However, the film overall manages to hide away any flaw appearing and leaves a satisfaction to the spirit, even though it is a low-budget film.Great job. I wish the system would let me give it a 20 out of 10. It truly brings back memories from Donnie Darko, and I know it is a film always to be among the first in my favourites list.</fullReview>

I watched it based on some other IMDb recommendations. Usually IMDb is very good at giving me a rough idea on what to watch. Not in this case. If somebody gave me one word to sum this up, I'd ask for two...absurd nonsense.

		<fullReview>'INK',A man driven to 'success' because of feelings of low self-worth based around a poor upbringing, neglects his own family consequently consumed with guilt after the death of his wife, turns to alcohol and drugs, in the process losing his only daughter in a custody battle with his late wife's parents.On the eve of a large business meeting he receives word that his daughter is in a coma and needs him to be there, he makes a decision to instead travel to the meeting however on route 'fate' intervenes in the shape of a car crash and between the accident and his eventual arrival at hospital with concussion we are treated to an 'imaginary' journey through the labyrinth of his mind, memories and imagination where the main character projects part of himself as an ugly monster ("he's really ugly dad") based on an earlier memory of time spent with his daughter, eventually concluding with an 'awakening' in a literal and metaphoric sense at the end of the film, essentially a child saved by her father and a father saved by his child.A beautiful film with beautiful music and a good performance by the main actors especially the young actress who plays Emma.In a world where we are used to Hollywood movies using big budgets and special effects to make up for a hollow storyline and wooden characters this movie goes against the grain (for all you budding George Lucas and Spielbergs, put that posturing aside and take the movie as you find it) and as a result will not be everyone's cup of tea, however if you are human (not yet numbed by our societal follies), can think and have an imagination you will likely find this movie well worth watching and may even be moved in the process.I rate it as 9/10 and one of the best films I have seen in a long time.</fullReview>

OK now the good stuff.Watching this movie was like listening to Mozart play while staring up at the ceiling of the Sistine chapel.The special effects were beautiful.Maybe they were just tricks of the light and cameras but 50 years ago thats all they had and those tricks still work.The soundtrack captivated me.I have never see has ten minutes of people looking sad been made magical simply because of the music.Finally the plot I'm not gonna ruin it but when it came together it brought a tear to my eye.From start to finish it paints a picture and you wont know what it is until the end.Maybe not even then.Just think real hard or watch it again!</fullReview>

The cinematography and all the effects, visuals are also very well done. Acting is also. So, you've got an independent movie that really rocks. The only flaw I found was the few moments where the guys' head with the glass plates in front of their faces (sorry forgot their name) were filmed from the side, so their true face was a bit visible... I can't really explain but this made them not so scary, because this glass plate with the ever changing face was quite scary, worked well all along the story, but, in some places, especially in the end, you could see the real face from the side view... Ohh well, this was the only flaw I found. Worth a watch or two, really!</fullReview>

When I went into the theater it was packed and me and my friend had to ask around for a place to sit. All I have to say is that I understand why. I thought the movie was great. It was done in Colorado which was a nice little kudos to us, and the acting was well done. It was different, and I think that's what I liked about it. The plot had a dark mood even though it was a happy ending. But most importantly it was the FIGHT scenes that sealed the deal for me. The action was priceless at times, (see first bedroom scene). Altogether I think the movie deserves a 8 rating out of 10 due to the good acting, interesting plot and top action. The only reason it falls below a 10 is the special effects get a little corny at times, but thankfully it works with the dreamy, sci-fi feeling of the film. *GO C IT*</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the first couple minutes I thought this was a one star movie and thought it was funny that I might be reviewing my first one star movie ever. But this movies is one of those that get's better as it goes on, and on, and on.What makes this great is it has a great message. Also the film contains some kind of existential thing going on maybe in relationship to angels and demons being responsible for acts rather than self. This makes it truly unique. Lastly what kept my interest are the effects, but I wish they wouldn't have used such a soft filter so much.Their are 2 things that kept this from being a five star movie 1. The F-Bomb. In many ways this comes across too pretentious or like the writer was forcibly trying to make the film cool for a specific audience, but after thinking about it I think this was done to help the overall message remain stronger. Still too much though.2. The Nose!!! The main characters nose is really stupid. I think they probably got this from some 80's fantasy novels or something but it just isn't cool. You really have to have an abstract mind which I do, but other viewers will hate it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting experiment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fanboys hate it. Auteurists love it. So what to make of this film? It's an independent production, which means fanboys won't forgive it's minimal f/x and amateur fight choreography while auteurists will love it's raw indy look. However, despite some awkwardness on both fronts, the f/x and choreography are better than one might expect.It's under written, sure. Under written to the point where it can't be explained away by it's indy production origins. On the other side, it's chock-a-block full of ideas - some interesting and some just plain silly. Truthfully, imagination makes up for a lot.It's plot is complex and doesn't go to much trouble explaining itself. Auteursts love that kind of self absorption while fanboys hate anything that isn't spelled out for them in big block letter. Ink may tilt a little to the auteurist side, but not egregiously so.Sum up. In an environment where 99.9% of all films are boring studio product, Ink gets props for even trying to do something different. Even where it fails, and it does in several places, it fails from a point of strength. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honest and Concise Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NO SPOILERS HERE. So you can read on safely.I'm going to be concise about my thoughts. A couple of things to note before watching this movie though. This is NOT you regular movie by a mile. Watching the movie for the first 10 minutes will tell you that the director is more interested in producing a piece of art rather than movie. Second thing to note is this movie has a rather slow pace, and some patience is needed to be rewarded. I got quite impatient about 50 minutes into the movie, due to many unexplained events and the feeling of plot disjoint. But if you stay on for a little while more, things would be explained.The good about the movie: - Different and unique editing of the movie - Good suspense - Ingenious setting of overall plot backgroundThe mediocre: - Acting was alright, nothing great but not bad eitherThe bad: - The pacing of the movie could be improved, things move too slowly in the middle - The fast changing scenes could make a person dizzyMy final advice: If you feel you want to see something totally different, try watching it. Otherwise, might want to keep it until you really have some time to kill. But generally, I think the people who will be rewarded from watching are those who likes sci-fi / artistic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a good movie. You have to listen to me on this. I watched this film because it got glowing reviews. Not realizing that they were back handed compliments and stretched truths.This movie is nothing more than an OK student film. Do not waste your time.It seems like the makers got together all the people in their church or town and got them to write glowing reviews even if they weren't crazy about this film.One reviewer gave it 10 out of 10. The first line of that review was "Far from perfect." Then why do you give it a 10/10? I understand that the movie is low budget. It doesn't make it better. there are plenty of fantastic low budget sci fi films that are good on it's own without having to put it on a curve.Those people who lied should be thrown off the site.I signed up for IMDb just to write this. I am advising you not to see it. If you do anyway and you hate it, I told you so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Who brings the nightmares?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unknown to the human race, two supernatural forces move secretly amongst us. There are those who give us strength and hope when it is needed and fill our minds with pleasant dreams as we sleep. And then there are those who whisper dark suggestions in our ears and corrupt our slumbers with terrifying nightmares. Caught between these two powerful forces are John, a man who has replaced his family with ambition and greed, and his young daughter whose soul has been kidnapped by a dark stranger named Ink whilst her body languishes in a coma. Can the young girl be saved before she is offered as a sacrifice to the dark ones? "Ink" is a tough movie to describe and it's an equally tough movie to love. There will be those who dismiss it, perhaps finding themselves confused by the puzzle it builds its story around or disappointed by the flaws which come from making a movie on a low budget. And let's be honest here - there certainly are flaws. The acting is merely adequate, some of the prosthetic make-up could be improved and some of the footage has the look of your standard straight-to-video movie.If you can overlook these problems, you might find yourself surprised by "Ink". The budget may have been low but there are still certain shots in this movie which will make you wonder how the director managed to achieve them - such as the main look of the antagonists (the nightmarish Incubi whose features distort behind planes of glass bolted across their faces), the scene in which a room grows steadily darker with the mood of those within it until only the inhabitants remain and a collision sequence which occurs suddenly and with great realism.The story, as mentioned before, is actually a puzzle and it doesn't offer any easy solutions. Although the final twenty minutes provide many satisfying answers to questions which might have arisen on the journey to reach them, there are almost as many left untouched; and viewers are expected to draw their own conclusions. If you like everything explained and neatly wrapped up, you'll be left scratching your head as the credits roll. If "Donnie Darko" had been filmed for less money, it might have looked something like "Ink".This is a movie that will divide people. Some will reach the conclusion (or perhaps not even make it that far) and possibly hate what they've seen. Others will watch the credits rolling and realise that they've witnessed something special. It is a movie that will touch certain people, beguile them with its story of a struggle to save a young girl's life and her father's soul, dazzle them with its occasional moments of wonder, and impress them with its wonderful soundtrack (the haunting main theme, crafted by the director and writer, adds to every scene in which it appears).You may love this movie. You may loathe it. You owe it to yourself to watch "Ink" and discover which.</fullReview>

I lasted 20 minutes and just couldn't take anymore.It just beggars belief why anyone would bother making this rubbish, let alone pass it on for public viewing.Even trying to recount what happens in the film hurts, so I'll pass on that and give those who actually paid to watch it, in one form or another my sincere and deepest sympathy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Self indulgent tripe like this may be the start of a great career for someone, but most likely it is just proof that amateur dramatics is best consumed after a great deal of alcohol, and it's best to listen to independent voices rather than the ever supportive encouragement of your mother. "benjamin-holland" puts it perfectly, saying "Ink is like watching an episode of The Power Rangers. It feels like a student film in nearly every respect. Most of the actors seem as if they were picked at random from a crowd, the cinematography (although, I'm certain it was a stylistic choice) is often flat and over-exaggerated, the soundtrack is tactless in its use at times..........Unless all the reviewers are the filmmakers' friends, I don't understand the praise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have trusted the rating system on IMDb for years, though I've never bothered to register before.I do so today only to balance out the ridiculous reviews for this horse muck of a movie.It's terrible! There is literally nothing good to say about it. I duly stuck with it after the first 20 mins (as advised on other reviews). I'm not sure what they all think happened after 20 minutes, but whatever it is, I didn't see it.Ink is so bad, I felt the need to register to moan about it.Don't watch it. It's just not worth it. Do some washing and watch the machine for a couple of hours. You'll have more fun and the plot will be better.The other reviewers must, must, must be part of some campaign to get this recognised. I've seen more entertaining stains in my bathroom.I would happily sit and extract my own toenails with a taser rather than watch this again.Seriously, I'm dead on the inside.

		<fullReview>...and I was. The recognizable elements of dialogue from other films was never anything that pushed it into the realm of being a rip of those other movies. Sadly this is something I pick up on in other flicks all the time. The special effects, although somewhat limited, were very well used and done. The effect of the goodies pooping into our reality was excellently thought up and I really did enjoy the industrial Devo- esquire baddies chosen look. The creepy nerd in school meets black clad medical examiner is a disturbing image. The story did work for me as did the fight choreography but the two oddballs I could have done without and you'll recognize them as out of place here too I suspect upon viewing. It almost looks like the film was shot then these two scenes done at a later date. The conclusion to the whole shebang was both expected and accepted.Bottom line is if you need your sci-fi wearing more digital makeup than it takes to make Hugh Hefner look truly alive, this is not the film for you. Anyone else should get a kick out of "ink". Its well worth a look-see.</fullReview>

If they can pull this off with that budget, just imagine what their next film will be like, main stream all the way.

		<shortDescription>Visually amazing but drags in some areas.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught the screening in Denver at Starz opening night. Let me preface this with I am extremely critical when it comes to movies so getting an 8 out of 10 is very high. The originality of this movie is amazing but at the same time it's not original at all. It takes elements from fairy tales and movies such as the Matrix and Dark City. It's a simple story of a monster kidnapping a little girl and those who set out to save her. Here's what's amazing, they shot it on a middle of the road HD camera with almost no budget. The editing is pretty good and the special effects enhance the movie. I'm sure a lot of it was done in After Effects or something similar. My only gripe is Jamin (writer, director, editor) could cut about 15 - 20 minutes of the overall movie b/c when it drags, it drags (kill your babies dude) and the sound levels seemed too high throughout (one more pass in the NLE system should fix it).Overall, If you support independent film go see this, if you're sick of boring commercial crap go see this, if you have nothing to do on a week night go see this. I liked it, a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find it hard to stay awake past 10 minutes. So here's what I could summarize for the ten minutes worth. It feels like more to watching a television series rather than a movie, or perhaps suffice to say like a home made movie at some point. The editing made me felt like watching a TV commercial, mixed up with some MTV videos. Too much of mixed up experimental elements, complexities, abstracts, artistic in many ways therefore losing its direction. More like a student movie or artsy film concept than that of a professional movie with the end consumer in mind. Poor casting, average to decent CGI but good sound effects. Confusing story line, the only impact it had on me was confusion and a good sleep therapy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The enthusiasm I had heard about this film had me intrigued, but the result is far beyond what I was expecting. Don't dismiss this one if you're not into dark tales with fantastical creatures and super-human fight sequences. I'm not into those films either. But what sets Ink apart is that it is simply a beautiful film, founded on highly original storytelling, that doesn't get caught up in trying to be too cool for its own good. Its stylized treatment genuinely serves the story and ties the film together visually, and brilliantly.My guess is that this one will make its way around the country in a successful theater run, and have a loyal following for some time to come. Anything less would be a disservice to this excellent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ink deserves the hype that it's been given. It may not be a new premise, but it has a brilliantly different take on the storytelling. A real visual treat with some truly stunning shots, Ink tells the story of Emma (a young child who lives with her grandparents) and her widowed and estranged father, John, a high powered broker.We are also introduced to the 'storytellers' who visit us in our sleep to weave good dreams and also the enemies of the storytellers, the incubus, who give us nightmares.When Emma's spirit is kidnapped by incubus in training, Ink, and her body is left in a coma, the storytellers set out to bring her back while they try to contact her father.The story unfolds slowly and though visually stunning, including a great fight scene, the first part may seem a little slow to some. Be patient and you will be rewarded! Ink is definitely one to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It doesn't take much for me to want to check out a film, and with INK, all I needed was a quick peek at the poster, and bingo, it's watchin' time. But does the film stand up to the cool poster? Maybe, maybe not.The story of INK revolves around the real-life world and it's sub-plot of parenting, and a fantastical-tastical hidden reality where stylish dream warriors, enchanting 'storytellers', and comedy relief 'path-finders' square off with nightmare nerds aka Incubus. And then there's Ink, the down-in-the-dumps vagabond martial artist with the nose only a mother could love character. Ink has abducted a little girl, and plans to give it to the 'Assembly' which is the guys in charge of the Incubus. But of course, the do-good stylish dream people can't have that. So, it's off to the rescue to save the little girl. And maybe, just maybe, Ink will learn something about himself along the way.I gotta admit, INK was unique, or should I say felt unique. It looked fresh, it had style, the ideas thrown about seemed new, but besides that, it's nothing truly memorable. The martial arts aspect was clich, the stylish wardrobe and hair-dos of the good guys had me smirking, the writing at times was too melodramatic, and ultimately this blended together to create something that felt like it's target audience is the tween demographic. And what's with the dubbing? The dubbing of the voices made the acting just that much more noticeable. When it comes down to it, INK is formulaic and predictable. There were a couple moments that opened my eyes which took place within the first 15 minutes, but as the movie continued there was nothing that would persuade me to agree with it being called the next 'it' film. The director's wife calls it that by the way. But as I said before, it worked in the production department as it looked good. But it wasn't my cup of tea. It'd go nicely as a double-feature with Mirrormask.EDIT: To back up my thoughts: 70 votes for Users Under 18 have resulted in a 8.0 rating; the second highest of all user ages, with Males Under 18 giving it 8.1.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film in Denver last night and was blown away! Very high quality, it was a unique solid story, with great acting, great color, great cinematography, great makeup and effects and great sound (harder to find in the indie circuit). It was unlike anything I have seen!If you like dark fantasy at all, you will love it. It also has a point and heart. The characters are engaging, and the little girl in it is so sweet and natural in her role.If you are in Denver and have the opportunity to see this, do it! I also think that this is an appropriate film for most ages, although the F word was used in one scene, and there is fighting (no gore) and some creepy imagery, oh and some adult alcohol and brief drug use. Maybe fits into the PG13 range (in my opinion), although officially some things might make it an R. Ink is more intense than those, and of course more adult oriented (live action, swearing), but that is the only comparison I can make. Those two movie also being my favorites.</fullReview>
