		<shortDescription>Exceptional Film, Extremely Talented Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although "The Great Debaters" does not open until Christmas, I had the good fortune of seeing it at a preview -- and I can recommend it without reservation. It is a great story, based on real events that most of us never heard of, about a debating team from Wiley College, a small black institution in rural Texas, that performs extraordinary feats because the kids are good and the team is taught by Mel Tolson, a real person, acted by Denzel Washington, who also directs. Forest Whitaker, like Washington an academy award winner, plays James Farmer Sr., the school president and the father of one of the debaters, James Farmer Jr. (yes, that James Farmer Jr.). The participation in this enterprise of Washington, Whitaker, Oprah Winfrey and the Weinstein brothers should draw crowds (provided the film isn't cursed by being described as "uplifting," though it is). The revelation in this film are the performances of the three principal debaters: Jurnee Smollett as Samatha Booke (with an "e", as she proclaims when she tries out for the debate team), Nate Parker as Henry Lowe (also with an "e" as he announces in response to Samantha's declaration) and Denzel Whitaker as James Farmer Jr. (It's an amusing coincidence, but he is unrelated either to Denzel Washington or to Forrest Whitaker.) You may have seen Jurnee Smollett earlier in her career when she was a "cute kid" and a promising actress. This film could be her portal to stardom. In addition to being a gorgeous young woman, she's also an accomplished actress, ready for bigger parts in the future. You'll also be impressed with her colleagues, people whose names you may never have heard. You don't have to be black to find this film engrossing; I'm not. All you need to be is (a) a human being and (b) someone who appreciates a good movie. I hope it makes a ton of money at the box office but it is, above all, a quality film. It just happens to be about a difficult period in American history, the rural South in the 1930's. It just happens to be inspirational and uplifting and all that good, boring stuff that cause your eyes to roll when that's how the critics describe it. But it's better than uplifting. It's GOOD and it's REAL.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Great Debaters" is a very fine film.It reminds us of what it means to be excellent, to stand for something good, to love with all our hearts, and to shine.The performances, or the cinematography, historical care, or directorship all lift it out of the ordinary.And in its difficult subject: racial tension and the education and discovery of values by the three young debaters from Wiley College, one of the oldest colleges in America, it creates real excitement and interest.But the real reason that this is a fine film lies in is its plea that in education lies the reasoning, the power, and the will to change history. That learning lies not just in knowledge but also in applying that knowledge to better yourself, your world, and all of humanity.The very significant point of the film is at the end. I can forgive the slight drag here and there because the ending is magnificent and explains something crucial about American history by its finish.From an era when bigotry, racism, and degrading behavior was a wretched norm to our era where values are mutable, where dumbing down has no limits, and taste little place; "The Great Debaters" stands out as being a story that stands against all of these things.The rating says it all: excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Sophomore Film by Denzel as a Director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two words perfectly sum up this movie - inspirational and uplifting. I have not seen Antwone Fisher, but I will be sure to check it out after seeing this.Before watching this, I had never even heard about Wiley College or what it did in the '30s, so not only is it great entertainment but it is also educational. I don't know how closely the movie follows the actual events so I can't point out the flaws, but it doesn't matter because the movie is brilliant and moving. This is an underdog movie and you'll be rooting for the Wiley College team throughout the movie. The acting is marvelous by all the actors, but recognition has to be given to the three stars that portray the debaters, Denzel Washington, and Forest Whitaker. Not only is Denzel great as an actor, he is even better as a director. As other reviewers have said, out of all the actors Denzel Whitaker is the star. His portrayal of James Farmer, Jr. is outstanding and this role will certainly further his acting career. Forest Whitaker doesn't have a huge role to play, but he performs his parts beautifully (for example the hog and the sheriff scenes).Overall this is a very inspirational and uplifting movie. I wouldn't be surprised if it gets a few Oscar nods. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I say this because: 1) The acting is remarkable. Denzel Washington, Forest Whitaker, Nate Parker, Jurnee Smollett, Denzel Whitaker, and Kimberly Elise are all stunningly good 2) The cinematography is very well done and the score is beautifully and uplifting. 3) The story is great. It has multiple underdog themes which when watching, you root so much for the underdog it actually hurts :). These would be: a) the black people in the south in the 1930s b) little Wiley collage (especially when they are vs Harvard) c) the 14 year old boy James P. Farmer Jr. (Denzel Whitaker) who is seemingly incapable at first of debating. Do yourself a favor and see "The Great Debaters". You are going to love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Great Denzels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his sophomore effort, actor-director Denzel Washington has created one of the best films of the year, The Great Debaters. Never trying to be the cliché coming of age tale of student-teacher relationship that becomes like a bad aftertaste like past efforts, as Mona Lisa Smile; the film takes a high road to transform its narrative into a beautiful canvas for Washington to paint on like forgotten masterpieces like Stand and Deliver and Dead Poet's Society. Adapted from a Tony Scherman article by Robert Eisele and Jeffrey Porro, the film follows an astonishing pace and never forcing anything down the audience's throat rather, uses images and manifestations for its armor.Washington's achievement here is pulling the performances of this new, unknown young actors. Denzel Whitaker as the innocent, curious James Jr. is wonderful in exposition of character and gives the best child performance of the year. At 17, young Whitaker should have no problem coming into his own as a great young leading man in the future. Nate Parker in a momentous breakthrough performance indulges the audience as Henry, the angry young college student dealing with the inequalities of African-Americans in the South. In the end it's the tenacious performance by the beautiful Jurnee Smollett that holds the emotional premise of the film together. Not only dealing the racial barrier, but the barrier of being a woman, a woman running away from her past and trying to settle into a world dominated by the differences of her own. Smollett's debate speeches are felt with every word, every expression, and every influential command. Smollett's performance is the ignored performance worthy of consideration for awards of 2007.Not expecting too much from last year's Oscar winner Forest Whitaker probably helped him in watching the film. Whitaker reminds the viewer of how great he was for years before The Last King of Scotland. This is a true superior work on the actor's resume. So how Denzel Washington do in directing himself? Not glossing as much as Clint Eastwood and Kevin Costner past works, Washington does an admirable effort and takes the supporting role (yes it's supporting) and acts as the film's right hand man. Adding his charisma, potency, and veteran thespian persona, the film is a success.In terms of Oscar's chances, costume designer Sharen Davis nominated for her designs in Ray and Dreamgirls is worthy of citation. David J. Bomba's production design is quite easy on the eye and captures the era of tyranny and persecution. With the potential to be a late surge to the Academy Awards race, The Great Debaters delivers on every level encompassing the richness of love, the evil of oppression, and the beauty of triumph.Grade: ****/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Triumph ... and Treacle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes you can enjoy every second of a movie, every frame, and be phenomenally moved by it, and cry a happy tear ? and yet, when you ponder the film afterward, you feel disappointment, a sense of "why couldn't this film have been braver?" For me, this was that kind of film. There's just no subtlety in it and situations are stock.Best things: the design of the film, the cinematography, the casting of the primary characters, and, most importantly, the inspirational theme of debating, of speaking well as a way out and up. I hope it inspires young people of all races to clean up their bad speech habits, speak up and be heard. As the Samantha character says at one point, in wonder, "I didn't need weapons, I had words!" Worst things: predictable plot line, the fact that the speeches themselves, while well delivered, are not always well formulated, and the deliberate decision to end with an unalloyed triumph when the actual situation was less glamorous and more poignant; other postings here have explained why. As someone pointed out, the white characters are demonized (I would say "stereotyped") and not only by cretinous pig farmers in Texas but by the young Harvard debaters whose delicate features and snooty bearing make them seem like Stepford Scions. Oh, well ? black characters in films have often been stock but one must ask, if that was wrong then why is this right now? Oprah is a soft-hearted person with an aspirational dream for her people. That's nice but it doesn't necessarily lead to great art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Beginning of Civil Rights Legislation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course the title deals with debating but it goes far deeper than that. Forest Whitaker, playing a true academician in every sense of the word, has both a precocious and gifted 14 year old son played by the brilliant Denzel Whitaker,no relation, and that son is none other than James Farmer Jr.,whom 7 years later becomes the founder of C.O.R.E., the Congress on Racial Equality. Thus began the beginning of the end of segregation as well as the vicious Jim Crow laws of the South which made it as difficult for a Negro to live and thrive there as it did for the Jew in pre-war Third Reich Germany. Yet, the film was basically not political in theme.It deals with a small black college in Texas,Wiley,that had a poet plus a political agitator played by Denzel Washington as many students' mentor. Denzel, knowing that if given the chance, a few gifted students could form a debating team to challenge any college team in the nation and he sets out to prove it. Keep in mind that the main theme of the Civil Rights Movement was "if given the chance" and so the film builds on it and does the kind of damage to opponents as did the great "Brown Bomber," Joe Louis.Although a bit slow moving and at times, pretentious, the film was very skillfully done in bringing to light the efforts accomplished by the African Americans to do away with the perniciousness having pervaded this nation from the time the first slave ship landed on our shores. Without delving into the ultra-political, nevertheless we are made to see for ourselves how prophetic became the words "We can overcome".Who wrote, "And the youth shall guide them?" Truer words never written. Those Wiley College kids, without anything but minds for weapons, caused a revolution from the mid '30s to the present--kids who put real meaning into the Emancipation Proclamation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This wasn't about my Texas, although I am familiar with many of the topics in this film. I have been to Marshall in my travels over most of the highways in Texas, I know about Paul Quinn College and Prairie View A &amp; M University. This wasn't even about my Daddy's Texas, as he was just a small boy at the time. It was, however, my Grandfather's Texas. he typified the characters in this film.With Denzel Washington directing and acting, I expected an outstanding film. I was not prepared to be so emotionally taken in that I left the theater wiping tears from eyes. This was a powerful statement about the differences in American. Differences that were typified by Franklin Roosevelt's affirmative action program for whites - the New Deal; differences that would be repeated twenty years later after WWII when the whites again received affirmative action in the form of the GI Bill. Robert Eisele's story really brought home the pain and deprivation of being Black in America, and how some could overcome that deprivation with the right help, but could never overcome the pain.Besides Washington, there were outstanding performances by Forest Whitaker, Nate Parker, Jurnee Smollett, and Denzel Whitaker, as a 14-year-old in college.Tears in my eyes, I will long remember this film as one of the best of the year and of many years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE GREAT DEBATERS is a movie-going treat, with young people exemplifying truth, respect, pride and dignity. In an entertaining way, with some preaching, this movie shows four African-American debaters succeeding in the face of adversity, growing stronger with success AND defeat. Their debates are lively and thought provoking.However, before, during and after these contests, other serious and complicated issues are revealed. Two of these issues deal with a confrontation on the road between two farmers and a minister, and a lynching in the middle of the night. Both are reflections of the time, unsettling and disturbing to those in the movie and in the audience.This is not family entertainment, nor is it mindless entertainment. It has no gratuitous sex, but there is a hint of romance. It is fast paced, but the action is verbal ? not physical. THE GREAT DEBATERS lives up to its name in that it has something for everyone, and not everyone will like it. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a quality film that will be debated by all who see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Votometre doesn't show decimals, but really my number rating is 6.9. Today, anyway....I may change my mind tomorrow.Knights of the South Bronx, Akeelah and the Bee, Glory Road- we've seen this movie before, and we've seen the same themes before. A feel-good underdog story with the typical American cinema's portrayal of Blacks centred one-dimensionally on how they are forced to relate to the issue of "race" in a racist and classist society.At least the characters in this film get to display their full humanity and are not reduced to one-note caricatures, centred on their "race". These characters are not stereotypes, but fully realized human beings who have decided that not only education, but intellectualism, is as much their birthright as any American.There are major problems with the script and/or the editing of this film that will hopefully be rectified in the DVD edition. There are several character arcs that have no logical building, just a juxtaposition of problem and solution later in the narrative. Forest Whittaker's humiliation during the pig incident, and his subsequent redemption in his son's eyes when dealing with Denzel in jail- there's dramatic stuff missing in the middle that makes me think that this is a three-hour film. Ophrah has been known to do those, so why not here? We all know Ophrah Winfrey is full of good intentions. But as a film-maker, whether in front of the camera, or behind it, she has a very limited repertoire of themes that inspire her. We all know that the poor lady practices counter-transference in everything she does, but funding a $30 Million psychotherapy session should not be one area of her practice.By fictionalizing a true story (not Harvard), you rob the narrative of its one true virtue- it really happened. And by fictionalizing it, you make it merely product to stand with the other films of identical theme. I don't buy the film-makers claim that by altering the venue from USC to Harvard they are able to show the magnitude of the Wiley team's achievement. Some careful exposition through the film could have easily made USC do quite nicely. No, Harvard is the symbol of the white eastern intellectual elite, of white class and privilege, and that is why the film-makers chose Harvard. I am not sure that this is a legitimate reason for me to complain, though. As the Harvard Chancellor says in introducing the Debaters, Harvard is the school of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and numerous other US Presidents. Harvard IS America: the Debators are knocking at America's door and saying "we coming in 'cause we live here, this is our home".The characters in the film certainly are enamoured with the possibility of being associated with Harvard. The device of the black butler at Harvard is not fully explored, but the choice to include him accentuates the viewers' perceptions of Harvard as a racist institution, and a locus for racial oppression. Part of the problem in North American education (in Canada and the U.S.) is alienation of certain groups by not telling their stories, rendering them 'invisable' to themselves and the wider society. When you fictionalize an important human story, you are essentially saying to everyone that the real history isn't good enough. And it IS! It seems to me that that can be potentially damaging, because you are saying that the real story isn't worth being told. And it IS! Note to Denzel- take the training wheels off, you did "Antoine Fischer", you didn't have to film it twice, and please don't do it a third time. Antoine was a much more self-assured and cinematic work.This film would have worked far better as a stage-play- not surprising since it was written by a Pulitzer-prize winning playwright. The actors do their best to "elevate the material" and are actually the reason why the film is worthwhile to watch and engaging: the actors are uniformly charming and charismatic. It is their feelings and common humanity that I empathize with on screen.This film is set in the Great Depression. This is of little consequence to the main characters of the film. But, Denzel's Communism seems to be a throw-away theme, as are the plight of labourers and share-croppers themselves. "Of Mice and Men", or John Sayles' "Matewan", or even the Coen Brothers' "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" are films that explore these themes with much more authenticity.Social injustice is portrayed in this film as racism, not as the poverty that creates an underclass, regardless of skin colour. In the climatic debating scene, political reaction to racism is the theme, provided by the debaters own experience of witnessing a lynching. Yet, racism has its roots in classism, and economic oppression that could have equally been cited in this movie. It seems to me that Denzel's communist character could have made better use of this avenue of social commentary. But perhaps, being an American film, nobody wants to hold capitalism itself responsible for racial oppression, and therefore, the larger issue. The central characters are middle class, even in a racist society. And it is worth remembering that even in the Depression, the employment rate was 70%. Does civil disobedience have a place in today's society? Or, is that theme used in this film as a precursor to the Civil Rights movement of the 1960's? With Barack Obama less than 12 months away from his Inauguration, Stephanie Wilson sitting on Harvard's Board of Governors, and Ophrah the richest woman on the planet, memory of injustice should be memory of fact, and anger at injustice directed towards the present, and focused on eliminating that injustice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-intentioned but formulaic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Great Debaters is inspired by the true-life exploits of the all-black Wiley College debating team in Marshall, Texas in the 1930s. The script follows only the bare outline of the events that actually occurred. The debates themselves and the ideas behind them are a very small part of the picture. Instead we're treated to a series of snippets (or sound bites) with the Wiley team always taking the morally superior position and of course winning. At no time are they asked to show their real skills as debaters and take a position which they ethically and morally oppose. While the true Wiley College debaters of history were certainly admirable for what they achieved, there was no need to put them all on a pedestal by having them best the Harvard Debate team in the film's climax. In reality, Wiley beat USC; by depicting them as beating Harvard, the implication is that somehow they were superstars for beating the best (and hey maybe they were just excellent students who don't need to be mythologized).The main character, Melvin B. Tolson (played by Denzel Washington) is based on the real Wiley College professor who also was a union organizer. In a scene that felt like it was more likely to take place in the 1960s than the 1930s, Tolson heads a secret meeting of black sharecroppers as well as whites intent on organizing against racist farmers. The meeting is broken up by a group of angry whites and Tolson escapes with his life (along with James Farmer Jr., the 14 year old member of his debating team, later to become a famous civil rights leader). The probability of this scene actually having happened in 1930s Texas is low especially the idea that there were progressive whites who would even consider attending a meeting together with poor black sharecroppers. Later, Tolson is arrested for organizing the union meeting. In reality,wouldn't he have been taken away in the middle of the night and dumped in a shallow grave? Or perhaps lynched? Here, the black community wields a lot more power than it actually had in those days, when a group led by James Farmer Sr., the dignified Wiley professor played by Forrest Whittaker, convinces the town's sheriff to release Tolson on bond. We never really find out the outcome of Tolson's arrest (which presumably is a fictional scene) but according to the end credits, he went on to live a distinguished life as an academic and poet. The rest of the movie is taken up with a subplot concerning the romance between the team's only female member, Samantha Booke and the bad-boy character, Henry Lowe (who incurs Samantha's wrath by getting drunk and hanging out with another woman after witnessing a lynching). The aforementioned 14 year old has a crush on Samantha and must overcome his feelings of jealousy before he can best Harvard in the final showdown. The film is not without its powerful moments. The most memorable is when James Farmer Sr. accidentally kills a boar while driving in his car with his family. He's forced to pay compensation to two racist whites by handing over his paycheck and is further humiliated when one of the racists drops the check and makes Farmer bend over and pick it up (it's scenes like this that are far more effective than the typical mob scenes of racist whites on the loose since they show the day-to-day humiliations which blacks had to endure across the country on a daily basis). There is also an actual lynching scene which Tolson and his debaters stumble upon while driving on a darkened road. Despite this, The Great Debaters is a well-intentioned but formulaic project. Yes, it always feels good to be on the winning side but when drama becomes manipulative, art is subsumed by propaganda.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Hollywood BS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie and i liked it. A few scenes were bland where James tries to hit on Samantha. I thought it seemed pretty well done and especially with the job Denzel did with his acting. I wasn't as thrilled with his directing, but it was still a decent job.Later that day i was looking up online about the story of Wiley College and i realized the script was highly inaccurate. The writer deserves all of the blame. During it, it was hard for me to believe that small Wiley College could get an opportunity to debate against the honorable Harvard, and now i know why. They NEVER faced Harvard, they faced USC and they barely won. However their victory was negated because they weren't a member of the national debate association, which further shows how hard it was to be black, which was the real reason it was taken away.This was all "hollywooded up" as i like to say. It is a David and Goliath story, with Goliath coming out on top, during the time of the civil rights. This had the potential to be a box office hit, but not a success in my eyes. They are telling me a false, inaccurate story that is hard to believe considering that it was 1935 and not 1960. I wasn't moved by it at all. I feel if the writer had gone with the actual story, it would have not made as much money, but would have been more artistically effective and more moving, because the fact that their win was taken away adds more to the whole racism idea of it. I have no respect for the writer who destroyed an interesting story to make money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made feel good story that is weakened by the use of some clichés that have been over used in recent similar films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denzel Washington directs and stars in the fact based story of the debate team from a small black college in Texas that was so good it beat Harvard and went undefeated for 8 years. That may or may not be too much information, except that this is an Oprah production and is being billed as a feel good movie.Well acted and well directed Denzel Washington clearly knows how to put a film together. For all intents and purposes we are in the south in 1935.We see what it was like to be both poor and/or black in the south at the time with the dangers of lynching and white on black violence possible at any moment. The film also shows the joy of having an education and of the doors that having one can open for anyone.His cast of younger actors is excellent with young Denzel Whitaker (no relation (that I know of) to co star Forrest Whitaker coming off best, probably because playing a 14 year old college student he's given the widest range of things to do.If the film falls down its because it follows the same path that every other feel good underdog story of recent years where the team comes together and over comes impossible odds and makes everyone feel good by achieving something no one thought possible. To be certain its dressed up more fancily and has two Oscar winners heading its cast, but at the same time it hits almost every cliché you can think of right down to the "banned" team coach, played by Washington, showing up in the back of the big final debate to see his team pull it out. I knew it was coming the minute he didn't get on the train. While I grant you there is only so many ways you could probably tell the story its a shame that the film ends up in the well worn rut of similar films, the film is so good in so many ways that it almost seems like a laziness that they didn't find away around the clichés, or at least dressing them up in a suit (however fancy) that was clearly a hand me down.7 out of 10 more for the disappointment of not transcending the clichés. Probably should be a little higher. Comment on this</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Extremely uplifting and very well acted. It also has a few important flaws which, in my thinking, took a film that should have been rated a 9 to a 7.I heard Denzel Washington say on radio that two "poetic license" changes were made. One was that Wiley College did not defeat Harvard but rather U. of Southern California. This change was made with the permission of both schools. He also said that Wiley College did not, as shown in the film, lose a debate. They went undefeated but felt it would be more dramatic if they gave them a loss.There are two other problems that I had with this film. One was that it was never explained how Professor Tolson made it to Cambridge since he was required by law NOT to leave the state of Texas.The second, and in my mind most glaring, is when Professor Tolson asked his team who was the first African-American to earn a PhD. and from what school? I can't remember the name he gave but he said that he graduated from Harvard. In fact, the first African-American to earn a PhD. and the sixth ever in the United States, was Edward Alexander Bouchet and he earned it from Yale and not Harvard. Why is this important? Because there are a tremendous amount of people who are seeing this film and are taking these statements as fact and I think that something as important to a culture as this should be correct.Other than a few other flaws of much less importance, the movie should be seen and enjoyed for the terrific acting performances of the entire cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was exactly what I had expected: a compelling story, strong actors and a great message. However, while Denzel delivers another stellar performance, you can't help notice that it has been seen several times before. You can mix the racial tensions of "Remember the Titans" with the underdog vibe of "Hoosiers," "Freedom Writers," and "Stand and Deliver" to understand where this is going. The story has solid pacing, a great cast and an easy to understand plot; a few minor side steps (talented but tormented student, first female student fighting both racism and gender issues, a younger than average student fighting for a father's love/respect while coming of age) but the message holds up and delivers an appropriate but completely unsurprising conclusion. A few frightening images for children need to be balanced with the powerful messages those images represent but overall an enjoyable movie but you will see the third act coming from a mile away....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie, but not perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another great offering from Denzel Washington (surprise, surprise). I'm not going to spend a heck of a lot of time on how good the movie was. Just know that it is definitely one you'll want to add to your DVD collection when the time comes. A "feel good" film for those times when you may need to be inspired.Now, the criticism. I learned about the true history of the debaters from Wiley College when I came home from the movie on Christmas and started searching the net. I was disappointed to find a couple major points omitted or changed in the movie, moreso because adding them would not in any way have taken away from the quality of the film, or even significantly to its length. Turns out the Wiley debaters did not beat Harvard U as in the film, but rather USC, albeit still a momentous accomplishment. But also, the Wiley students were not allowed to even call themselves "victors" because racism did not allow their school to enter the same debate league as the White school. So technically they were victors only in sentiment, not on paper. Adding this element to the film would have certainly brought home how racist the times were and thus how monumental the victory from the Wiley students. I would add also that the writers could have easily (and I sooo wish they had) taken out the awkward, UNNCESSARY sex scene between two students and inserted the aforementioned historical material. That would have really added to an already quality--but not perfect--film.Just a little gripe I had with an otherwise great movie. Go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Great Debaters, taking place 1935 in Texas, is about a young debate team of Wiley College, a school which became famous as it won many debates against schools of any background in the 30's. Denzel Washington, playing professor Melvin Tolson, coaches this team to finally debate against Harvard University. Tolsen selects four young people who he trains in debating and who he strengthens in their resolve to fight for the civil rights. Melvin Tolsen also organizes the Southern Tenant Farmers Union, which contributes to him coming into constant conflict with the town's sheriff. The Great Debaters allows you to gain a great insight view of the lives of these four debaters (not to mention Tolson's life) and their family circumstances: For instance Hamilton Burgess (played by J. Williams) quits the team because his parents are too worried about the radical actions of Tolson and possible consequences of those.The actors were perfect. Especially Denzel Whitaker (as James Farmer Jr.) who catches your attention when debating about the cruel conditions to be faced by blacks, delivers an outstanding performance. J. Smollett (as Samantha Booke) is chosen the first woman to ever debate and N. Parker (as Henry Lowe) is sort of the leader of the debaters yet plays a surprisingly small role in the showdown in Harvard. Overall this movie is a masterpiece of the drama genre and definitely a milestone of Denzel Washington as Director. Hence, I am looking forward to more movies to come with him directing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a good film definitely but something that could have been much better. Racism is what this film is about I can say. But the debates are equally interesting. It's tough to debate on anything without having much knowledge about the topic. If we were to debate then we must have full knowledge of what we are talking about. The actors here have precisely done that, they seem to be in control of a good director and make us believe that they are fully aware of the topic of the debate.Denzel Washington is the director and also acts in the movie and I am sure this was the toughest thing to do. To act is much easy than directing, but to do both and still make it good is terrific. I am happy that Denzel almost pulled it off with neat direction.Yes, I have qualms from this movie. It's very nicely packaged but at the end leaves a void and leaves us with a wish of how much could this have been. I wish it was more about debates than about personal turmoil and conflict. There is a love story, a parent-child relationship and the relationship of teacher and students. Except for the love-story, the other things are fine. I wish still that this love-story that was between Samantha Booke (played by Jurnee Smollet) and Nate Parker (played by Henry Lowe) was not needed.It's a film based in 1930's and the production design, the art direction have worked well. They are pretty decent and seem to take us through that period of 1930's. The cinematography was just good, but I believe there was lot much scope in this film and considering that film was made in 2007, I suppose full potential of camera was not used. My biggest crib is editing though, there are few scenes that I believe were not needed and cut have been cut. The second biggest crib is in writing, I suppose that the material given was good, but not enough to make an interesting movie. So, I think that's the reason why uncalled from drama and relationships had to be added up in the screenplay.Surely, this is a good film, but some deep down thought and more focus on debating would have made it a great film. A 3/5 for a good film. For others, it's up to them to decide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should have focused more on the debates</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story could have been so much better. This is an important subject matter, but somehow it goes far away from its real inspiration, that a team of black college students was in fact winners of several debate-offs in the depression.Do we really need to see an educated man being humiliated in front of his son to get the point, that Texas was a segregated state way into the 20th Century? You could just as easily have seen that on an episode of Roots or even North &amp; South. It is a rather shameful scene and it detracts from an otherwise superb subject matter.Also, there should have been a lot more focus on what it meant for Harvard to be debating a group of not just black students, but a college that was way below Ivy League. Here we are just shown that the people of Harvard are a more respectful bunch than any of the other supporting characters we have met in the film. Is Oprah and Denzel afraid of alienating the white elite? The only white people we see as bigots are small town folk and an especially creepy John Heard.Otherwise, the last scene at the Harvard debate is certainly powerful. Not only does it say everything that the rest of the film so blatantly avoids, but it actually isn't that corny as I thought it would be. Yes, it is not based on reality at all and the moral is something that is far from fresh. But it is not overdone and actually believable, as believable as a fictional account can be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It isn't often you can enter a theater to view an interesting film and leave with a sense of emotional awe. Each time we risk a trip back in our time to not only witness what our predecessors did, we also experience the shocking mayhem, violence and tragedies of the day. Indeed we further allow ourselves to become immersed in the ugly ignorant world of human reality. Time was when the events which take place in this movie called " The Great Debators " was the basis for a story, ostensible written by Robert Eisele and ably directed by Denzel Washington. Having a featured role, Mr. Washinton also portrays Melvin B. Tolson a social activist and debate teacher. The film relates the story of how he selects a group of talented black students and instructs them in the art of the verbal debate. Their ability and intellectual growth is mirrored through their lives and social interactions. Each is subject to the hatred and prejudice of time. Further, each witnesses the enormous pressures of a subjugated people and their demeaning subservient role. Despite the enormous danger of mob violence which could exploded on any given day or time, the students are able to rise to the challenge of expressing through words, their feelings, emotions and eventual victory to overcome their racial bonds and shackles. The movie is a remarkable triumph for Washington and the entire cast who allow us to join them in a time which reminds us of our social inhumanity. The best and worse remains and only time will tell whether we have learned anything from our past. Nate Parker, Denzel Whitaker, Jermaine Williams, and John Heard complete the fine cast. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far from awful, but still a disappointing second directorial outing from Denzel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning The true story of Melvin B. Tolson (Denzel Washington) who arrived at a West Virginia college in 1935 and inspired the students to form the first ever black debate team that saw them go on to take on Harvard in the championships. Though he wins the admiration of the students, fears of his communist leanings create tension as well as the general racial tension of the time.Denzel Washington has tried his hand twice at being a director now, and one thing you can say for both of the films is that, in the UK at least, they have both received poor distribution. His first, the excellent, hugely under-rated Antwone Fisher got barely a limited release, whilst this is a 2007 release yet to receive an official release over here. And, while it would be a shame if it fails to ever find an appropriate slot to pop out of over here, it would certainly be much less of a tragedy than if it had worked out the other way round.We find ourselves just thrust into this biopic of communist witch hunt/racial tension America, with little in the way of build up to the story or development of the main characters, which makes it somewhat difficult to care as much as we could for any of them. Denzel's character is introduced far too early, and while the main man puts his heart and soul into his performance, sadly he doesn't seem to have done such a good job directing this time round. The performances in general are pretty good, notably Forest Whitaker in a supporting role as the devout preacher father of one of the debaters, but without a sound script to support them, they can't shine to their full potential. The film also has opportunity to make something out of well worn but interesting topics, like over-coming racial tension/triumpth over adversity, but stretching to just the two hour mark with this little backbone, it's all a bit of a slog.It's hard to think when this will come out over here, as it's hard to think what appeal it will have to a UK audience other than on a dull Sunday afternoon. Sadly, fairly well made and well acted as it is, this is a huge missed opportunity all round. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Cast In Another David vs. Goliath Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Great Debaters" is the latest entry in two different story types: the battle against racism and the historical fight against segregation, and the now somewhat cliché David vs. Goliath type story as the underdog overcomes the odds, except this time it ain't basketball, it ain't football and it ain't hockey - it's debating! The movie chronicles the journey of the Wiley College debating team in 1935. Wiley was a black college in Texas who happened to have an extraordinary debating team - extraordinary enough that they began to get invitations to debate white college debate teams, finally leading up to a match against the national champions from Harvard.The movie has a very talented cast, headed by Denzel Washington as Melvin Tolson, the debate team coach, and Forrest Whitaker as Dr. James Farmer, Sr., the president of Wiley College. The young actors who portray the Wiley debate team also do a good job, headlined, I thought, by Nate Parker as Henry Lowe. All this leads me to say that with such a great cast giving such great performances, I feel somewhat let down. The movie didn't blow me away. It underwhelmed me, frankly. Denzel Washington's direction I thought was slow, sometimes to the point of plodding, and the movie tried to do too much. Tolson's union organizing and the portrayals of racial segregation and violence were important to the story, but sometimes took the focus off the debate team. Of course, some might argue that the focus of the movie wasn't really the debate team overcoming the odds to take on Harvard, it was the broader struggle for blacks to overcome the odds. Fair enough. Point taken. Still, I thought the movie struggled with its focus at times. In the end it's a not bad movie with a great cast telling a very interesting story from history that more people really should know about. For all that, I still can only go to a 6/10 on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the most fun I ever had being preached at</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best movies ever to be saddled with a stupid name (see THUNDERBOLT &amp; LIGHTFOOT, LET'S SCARE JESSICA TO DEATH, WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF), this film is nothing more nor less than a first-rate feel-good revisionist history lesson of the big-string-section Hallmark Hall of Fame variety. That is no faint praise. Remember SARAH PLAIN AND TALL, another name for the books?Is THE GREAT DEBATERS intellectually dishonest? It is, sometimes, as the price of emotional truth: that idiotic 11th hour reincorporation of the coach's mantra feels as false as anything in any Spielberg summer picture, but at least it's over in less than a minute, and the crisis of faith in that dramatic moment is justified by the events preceding and following in the script.Is it historically inaccurate? Yes: Samantha Booke is a fictionalized character; Wiley College debated national champions USC, not Harvard, and though they won, they were not declared champions (as the film's silver-cup denouement suggests) because blacks would be barred from the debate society for another ten years after 1935.So what. It's a movie, and doesn't pretend to be history; well, okay, it does everything but claim to be a true story. But it doesn't make that claim, and so it's ultimately to be judged simply as a work of popular entertainment. As such it works better than about 90 % of what I saw come out of Hollywood last year.The three young principals are excellent, their acting a study in focus and restraint. Forrest Whitaker is violently good in his limited role, and the entire supporting cast speaks well of Denzel Washington's eye. In fact the whole movie does: it looks great, feels right, and satisfies without insulting me more than it has to. Denzel the director has as good a sense of timing as Denzel the actor, whom I only like when he plays a dangerous hard-ass, as he does here very effectively.Why not revise history, anyway? What the hell are we so precious about, those of us who have things to move on from? I remember the outcry when A WALK IN THE CLOUDS came out: some Mexican-Americans were angry about the portrayal of a Hispanic-owned winery in 1940s California. They wrote opinion pieces stating accurately but ill-advisedly that most Mexicans in vineyards were migrant workers, not landowners. They protested the theft of their heritage of oppression. I'm Mexican-American, and I say to be robbed of such a heritage is to be relieved of a dangerous and crippling burden. The sooner we stop embracing our tradition of economic despair, the better. When we stop waving Mexican flags in Los Angeles, when we get as many of our kids into college as into gangs, maybe we'll start valuing educated cultural assimilation as much as a certain minority population that happened to survive the Holocaust. Maybe then we'll figure out how to get an honest government in power back in the old country, and build an economy that supports more people than it sends into diaspora. Maybe then we'll stop mowing lawns in Bel-Air and start living there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed But Interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE GREAT DEBATERS is an interesting historical look at the first black debating team to ever compete at a white college. And although it is interesting as a film, it isn't very historically accurate.The good is that, as a film viewer, you care about the main characters. Denzel Washington (DEJA VU) stars in ? and directs ? this ethnically challenging movie, and does so in his usually adequate way. Melvin B. Tolson (Washington) is the teacher of the Wiley College debate team in 1935 Texas. His team is comprised of three bright young black people: Henry Lowe (Nate Parker), an overly-clever man with a possible future ...if he can stay out of harm's way; Samantha Brooke (Jurnee Smollett, HOUSE, M.D.), the first female debater in Wiley College history; and James Farmer Jr. (Denzel Whitaker), a chubby lad with a penchant for research.Growing up in the South (that's South with a capital "S"), the team must not only fight to win debates against local colleges, but must also battle the prejudices of the times. They come into close contact with ignorance and racism on a daily basis. Even their teacher, Mr. Tolson, is threatened at various crossroads.This is what stood out in the film ...and rightfully so. But there were some serious flaws in the film, too. The biggest was the debates themselves. Many of them were based on emotion and not facts and statistics. It would've also been nice to have had the names of the actual persons within the film and not some made-up ones (some were real, like Tolson, but others were not).Some praise has to be made for Forest Whitaker (THE LAST KING OF Scotland) as Dr. James Farmer Sr. His role was understated and held much of the powerful, emotional punch toward the final third of the movie, especially when his son James Jr. discovers why his father reacts the way he does during an embarrassing prejudicial moment.That Wiley's black debaters made it to Harvard and debated their team is now history. But I would've liked to have seen more of the actual history than this Hollywooded version. Still, it's an interesting movie that'll give many viewers an insight into something they probably knew nothing about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not much debate, more of a small racial-issue epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While we are treated with great set-designs, acting and cinematography, I thought this film to lack focus and failing to communicate what it was supposed to be.Someone compared the film to the Rocky movies and he or she surely had a point. But where the rocky movies tried to focus on the actual boxing, providing clear moments of tension, The Great Debate wasn't at all so much about the actual debate. And the way the debates took place, although maybe historical correct, was not really exciting to watch.The film's focus lies fare-more on the subplots of racial drama which almost makes the debates feel secondary. And although the message is clear and important, it is not something you haven't already seen in dozens of other movies. The overall way the movie is structured is formulaic with a love-story here and a defeat for the debating-team there (Which is historically incorrect) and therefore makes it a predictable watch, especially in the last half of the movie.All in all I felt that the movie could have been much more entertaining if they had focused more on the underdog position of the team and the actual moments of debate. The way they easily kept winning their arguments despite their background, made them not even be real underdogs. This resulted in a bit of a listless walk-through towards the inevitable tag-lined challenge against the Harvard Team with an outcome suiting a typical Hollywood production.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this at the WGA Theatre and Robert Eisele, a white man, Polish-German, if I remember right was in the house. Being a white American myself, I very drawn to race conscious stories, though I strongly believe the only race is the human race.Eisele the screenwriter has teamed up with Oprah Winfrey, producer, and Denzel Washington, star-director, and the result is one of the best inspirational movies I've seen. I was impressed with Director Denzel before when I saw "Antoine Fisher." Very thought provoking that was and this one has multiple characters to root for.In 1935, Jim Crow was still in effect and blacks were clearly living as second class citizens. Based on historical characters and events, a debate team from the South went on to become the undefeated champs for the next ten years.Washington plays the college professor who coached and even wrote for the team but also was an agitator who used blacks and poor whites to join an union. Forest Whitaker plays a genius level minister who must cow down to whites to protect his family. It's fun to see the two Academy Award winners on the same screen.While everybody is good in this period piece, special mention must go to Denzel Whitaker, the one who has visual daydreams for the female but it's unrequited but still able to raise above that to win the debate at the end. Even more important, he's the one who failed the first time which makes the final victory so sweet.As the debate team is traveling, they narrowly escape whites when they witness a burning lynching from their car. Very believable done.I highly recommend this movie and hope it has great success.</fullReview>

These three topics are really the main points in this movie, and the actors delivers them all quite nicely. Also, Denzel continues to impress me with a stunning performance - how can he be awesome in both director and actor seats?The main idea of this movie is you have to do what you have to do in order to do what you want to do - you have to search for truth in order for others to act truthfully.. You have to stand and speak, just like the Spartans did stand and fight, if you don't want to fail or loose being nobody..In my country, i'm also on the debate team, so I can even take some idea's from the movie and deliver them in my speeches. The speeches were pretty strange and simple, but it was still quite entertaining to listen and to compare to our own debates. Sadly, it was nothing like the real debates in USA looks - the speaker, who started the debates, also ended it? I don't know how creators would explain it, but never ever in debate tournament team gets benefit from saying more speeches than the other team.. In "The great debaters", it happened. However, it still can be just a little plot hole as they could have just skipped the last speech.. This is not like i want to spoil something or I didn't like the movie, i just think that even perfect movies are somehow imperfect..Still, this was only a minor misunderstanding and i liked the movie very much. It's even marvelous for me.. Story delivers to a amazing and almost worth crying ending.. So watch it in theaters, don't hold back..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For a Film About The Power of Speech, it is The Quiet Moments of Rapture That Say Everything!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Great Debaters chronicles a chapter in the life of a fascinating man, Professor Melvin B. Tolson, who created quite a name for himself by assembling a prodigious all-black debate team, while also creating a stir with his radical politics.The movie takes place in Marshall, Texas in 1935 at the all-black Wiley College. On the first day of class, Tolson (Denzel Washington oozing the charisma, intensity and barely reined rage he always taps into) announces the debate team tryouts at his house the same night. The tryouts draw 45 students, vying for four positions. He eventually staffs the debate team with an eclectic rag-tag group of debaters: Intelligent-but-brooding Henry Lowe (Nate Parker), who is a randy loose cannon, makes the team, along with returning member Hamilton Burgess (Jermaine Williams). The team is rounded out by alternates Samantha Booke (Jurnee Smollett), an absolute stunner and the only female to try out, and James Farmer, Jr. (Denzel Whitaker), the 14-year-old son of the college president, who has the experience to do the massive research required for the debates. Tolson employs unrelenting, unconventional methods to train his team, which pay off in victory after victory in debates with other Black colleges. Unbeknownst to his students, Tolson writes to several white universities to try to secure an unprecedented debate with one of them; his ultimate dream is a long-shot debate with Harvard.No story works well without conflict and The Great Debaters brings it on in the second act. Personal relations become a problem when Samantha and Nate form a couple, and James ? who has had a crush on Samantha from day one ? can no longer control his anger over their relationship. Another problem arises when the local police learns of Tolson's secret dealings trying to help unionize the local sharecroppers and farmers, a mixed-race partnership. But Tolson and the four under his tutelage fight not only with the racism of the time but also with tensions within their own ranks, as they eventually get the coveted shot against Harvard.As is well-known, academic competitions are addictive nail-biters. When you add the racial tensions of a segregated South, you've got a powerful emotional dynamic. Enough fictional liberties were taken with the movie to make it fit neatly on the inspirational genre shelf, but it's grounded in enough reality to excuse Robert Eisle's we-shall-overcome contrivances. Denzel Washington's crisp direction and the sharp performances by everyone ? giving us characters we can root for - help to leaven the inspirational emphasis of the screenplay while steadily building tension. Surprisingly, for a film about the power of speech, it's the quiet moments of rapture that say everything.The Great Debaters may be accused of being naked in its shameless desire to make audiences wince at every setback and cheer at every victory. The strength of the movie is that it gets away with it almost every time. By the time it's over, even cynics will be fighting the impulse to stand up and cheer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great story but not so good in the development</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is another of the factual based tale that receives little spotlight in the mainstream cinema. Overall it's based and also executed quite well. But the development leave me quite curious and wondering that it can be done far more better. It's because the screenplay looks as it puts too much weight to the side plot of the romance angle whereas it should be focusing more on the political and the racial issues side plots. That would make the movie more serious and thrilling, as it should be done for me. The acting overall is quite a good one. Denzel Washington did a pretty good job here, double timing as giving a good serious character acting and directing. Forest Whitaker nicely portrays the strict yet logical-thinking preacher. The team of Nate Parker, Denzel Whitaker and Jurnee Smollett Bell is having more than needed exposure on the relationship while their more significant performance on the debate is often replaced with montages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was fantastic. Aside from a few minor details that I can get over, it was perfect. It was an amazing movie due to its well acting from Denzel Washington to Forrest Whiticker to even the younger &amp; newer cast, they were amazing. The writing was also something to watch out for as it was extremely well written. It keeps you engaged into the movie from start to finis &amp; the fact that it is based on a true story makes it all that better. This is the 2nd time I've watched it &amp; I now remember why I like it so much. It deals with racism at the time which is always interesting to see.

		<shortDescription>Formulaic feel good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is formulaic feel good movie that has some good messages. But isn't all that intellectual. Don't get me wrong, it's still a good movie for adults. Kids on the other hand will most definitely get bored real fast with this one though. When it comes to the story, they added in some fiction but is ultimately predictable. Which is understandable since it's based on a True Story. Most movie goers will get how this movie will go from point A to point B to point C really quickly. Jurnee Smollett-Bell was just fantastic as Samantha Booke. There is few violent and little bit of sexual themes, but the violence isn't there for entertainment value or just for it to be there. It actually plays a part when it comes to the core of the story. So will you be emotionally charged after watching this movie? Maybe. Will you have new perspective and new mindset or have something really to ponder upon. Probably not.6.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moving flick based on a true story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Great Debaters is a no-holds barred depiction of a disgusting time in American history in an upsetting era of extreme racism in the south. Fine acting by the entire cast, particularly Nate Parker as Henry Lowe, an emotionally charged young black student without fear. He pushes Denzel Washington (Melvin Tolson) who teaches the students debating at Wiley College, an all-black college in Texas. Looking back from the present time, you think blacks, Texas, 1930's - this is not going to be pretty...and it wasn't.You feel the seething undercurrent of mistreatment throughout, starting with the young woman (Jurnee Bell as Samantha Booke) who arrives in town to attend Wiley. She gets off the bus and the only bench is marked - whites only. Fights, arrests, guns, violence (some direct, some implied), lynching, the whole 9 yards. Sometimes I felt like I wanted to cry, other times, just throw something. The utter stupidity of the times is shocking.I guess the film, backed by Oprah and Denzel, really wanted to show how much blacks have had to overcome, and how there were many who preached using your mind, and words, not violence, to debate, to fight, to stand up for yourself - to get ahead.The final scene involves the juxtaposition you would expect from a typical Hollywood ending. Rich, white kids facing off against poor, black kids. Who will win? Let me just say that the final speech from the young Mr Farmer will move you.If you liked Ghandhi, or even Mississippi Burning, you will enjoy The Great Debaters. The only critique is the film editing, where they probably could have shortened many scenes to bring this closer to 100-110 minutes - minor point.Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating slice of history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 1935 Wiley College Texas. Professor Melvin Tolson (Denzel Washington) coaches the debate team with a bunch of raw youngsters. James Farmer Jr. (Denzel Whitaker) is one of the kids. His father Dr. James Farmer Sr. (Forest Whitaker) is an over bearing preacher. Meanwhile Tolson is trying to organize both black and white farm hands to unionize.This movie has its moments. Directed by Denzel Washington, this movie allows all the actors to shine. But as a visual drama, debates are not the most physical endeavors. If the competitions are real, they do not make for a compelling story. After all, good debaters take both sides of the debates with equal gusto. There are some good exchanges. However the debates feel both overwrought and fake. It's arguable whether a real debating contest could ever be truly cinematic.The movie is very earnest in its story. There are great slices of the time. The unionizing effort seems to be the better story. And the puppy love is too much melodrama. I can't really feel sorry for the boy. Mostly for the subject matter and the great actors involved, I would recommend this movie.</fullReview>

Farmer Jr. (Denzel Whitaker), Samantha Booke (Jurnee Smollett).Booke is the first woman and black to ever participated in the debate team simultaneously also defeating the Harvard College alongside with Farmer Jr.--During the 1930s, some states of United States of America still enslaved the black people. They discriminate them and lynch them alive and hang them for the vultures.The white supremacy in that era was strong and some still adapt the old culture of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). The blacks are always living in fear until a few would stood for their rights.In The Great Debaters, we explore to see both black and white culture and their upbringing. There were racism and discrimination in every way. It's a great film. Somehow, it still reflects on our today's society.And it's almost like having Barack Obama as the first black president of United States.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Denzel Washington is Mr. Tolson, the head of the debate team of a Blacks only Willey college. He starts building a team of students to participate at the inter college level. He is also secretly inspiring the cotton growing farmers to fight for their rights against the land owners. Forest Whitaker is the theology professor and the father of one of the students who gets selected for the debating team. How the debating team is selected, how they go on an unbeaten spree and how they perform against Harvard's debating team forms the core of the movie. There are 4 members on the team whose characters are well drawn. There is Ms. Booke who has joined the college with the express view of getting on this team. There is Whitaker's son who is the youngest member of the team. Then there is a restless soul called Lowe whose character goes through a huge transformation during the duration of the flick. The dialogues are wonderfully written and end up stirring your soul more often than not. The best part about Washington's direction is that he does not bring the focus on him but keeps it on the young debaters. There is a heart wrenching scene showing lynching of the blacks. Just wish that Whitaker would have got a few more scenes. The one scene between Washington and Whitaker is one of the best scenes of the movie. This is an inspiring movie and I loved it. 3.5 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Great Debaters is a biopic period drama film starring Denzel Washington and it co-stars Forest Whitaker, Kimberly Elise, Nate Parker, Denzel Whitaker, Gina Ravera, Jermaine Williams and Jurnee Smollett. The screenplay was written by Robert Eisele.It was directed also by Washington,the movie's lead star.Melvin B. Tolson is the kind of educator who truly recognizes the remarkable power of knowledge. An outspoken Wiley College professor who boldly challenged the discriminatory Jim Crow laws of the 1930s, Tolson's recognizes that his young debate students possess the spark of a new generation. Convinced that they could invoke great change if given the confidence and tools needed to do so, the tireless educator implores his students to take responsibility for the future while furtively attempting to protect them from his clandestine role as an organizer for the Southern Tenant Farmers Union. Chief among Tolson's promising young students is a 14-year-old prodigy named James Farmer, Jr. Farmer's father, James Sr., is a renowned scholar and an important presence in the emerging student's life. Yet despite his formidable reputation, James Sr. has not yet learned how to truly harness the power of knowledge through action and assertion. James Jr. has seen the raving effects of racism all around him, and longs to live in a future where no one must be in fear simply because of the color of their skin. Other talented debaters on Tolson's team include fiercely independent student Henry Lowe, and Samantha Brooke -- the first ever female ever to join the Wiley College debate team. While most educators may not have recognized the remarkable potential of assembling such a disparate team, Tolson's unique vision truly set him apart from the pack as the team begins to experience a series of consecutive victories on their road to challenging Harvard at the National Championships. The Great Debaters soars with words and feeling.The movie is important and it's deeply inspiring for it's something from our nation's not-so- distant past that we must not forget.Also, it is must-see viewing for students of all backgrounds.Finally,it is a wonderfully acted and directed movie and it has an important message to impart to the viewer particularly students.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two of society's evils publicly condemned by Oprah Winfrey are violence against women and racial oppression. Unsurprisingly, Harpo Productions' (Oprah spelt backwards) latest offering is a period drama that not only speaks about racial violence, but the courage of real people and what they did to overcome it.Set in 1935 Texas, a time before public swimming pools and colored swimming pools, a time when it was not derogatory to call African-Americans "Negros", Wiley College professor Melvin Tolson (Denzel Washington) assembles a team of young black Americans in preparation for the annual inter-college debate competition. Comprising of James Farmer Jr. (Denzel Whitaker), Henry Lowe (Nate Parker) and Samantha Booke (Jurnee Smollett), the team quickly gains momentum with an undefeated winning streak. Populated by the traditionally black community of rural Texas, Wiley College enters the championship league, but must now face their greatest advisory ? an all-white team from the acclaimed Harvard University. But even before they have a fair chance, Tolson faces allegations of stirring political unrest as a black communist, leaving the team to go on without their coach.The outcome of the final debate, though a tear-jerker, is just one amongst various highpoints in this remarkable film. At the very core is the bleeding cry for truth and justice ? quintessentially manifested by outstanding portrayals from Farmer Jr, Parker and Smollett, not forgetting Denzel Washington and Forest Whitaker (as James Farmer Sr.) in fiery supporting roles. Adapted from Tony Scherman 's journal on American Legacy, Robert Eisele's screenplay is a driving force with just the right pace and depth that induces a strong yearning to learn about an untold but dark story before America's so called 'Golden Years'. Borrowing from actual events, Eisele's premise is a juxtaposition between Gandhi's Satyagraha and Martin Luther King's Civil Rights movement, making this not just a true story, but the biopic of a man that would become a modern American poet - Melvin Beaunorus Tolson.At a time when it is politically incorrect to call an ethnic race by the color of skin or traditional sustenance, "The Great Debaters" is a film with a story that boldly refuses to remain hidden within the forgotten pages of history. In comparison, this film could have been executed with the darker tone of "Mississippi Burning" or perhaps even a lighter shade similar to "The Help". In essence, it remains an intellectual masterpiece with a purpose ? a stark reminder that racism still exists. As does slavery.By his inherent nature of on-screen charisma, spit-fire dialogue and tenacious characterization, Denzel Washington is a cinematic marvel and nothing short of a silver screen incendiary. But if these are his traits as a skilled actor, then this film is all the more inspiring, encouraging and uplifting because "The Great Debaters" also benefits from having Denzel Washington as the director. Oh yes, Oprah Winfrey would be proud!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Great Debaters is another inspirational tale of the oppressed, but unlike most, this film has the distinction of being pretty close to historically accurate. I was hesitant to see this film, because who wants to watch a film about a debate team? Denzel Washington, however, happens to be one of my favorite actors, so I gave it a shot and learned quite a bit. The debate team was just an instrument, and was comprised of four people who would all go on to play significant roles in the Civil Rights Movement. The films follows award winning author, Melvin Tolson (Washington), on his journey to create the best African-American College debate team in the country, a team that would eventually go on to challenge the debate team at Harvard University. Everything about this movie was extremely powerful and well done. From the language to the graphic imagery to the story and the performances I was completely blown away by this film. I went into it thinking, if it's bad I'll turn if off after a half-hour. Now, I'm thinking about watching it again tomorrow. This is the way historical films should be done, The Great Debaters was fair, accurate, and just a great film!</fullReview>

It has multiple underdog themes which when watching, you root so much for the underdog it actually hurts :). These would be: a) the black people in the south in the 1930s b) little Wiley collage (especially when they are vs Harvard) c) the 14 year old boy James P.

		<shortDescription>A great film for all audiences out there.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching The Great Debaters, we thought it would be kind of boring ? we both couldn't have been more wrong. Being based on the true story of Melvin B. Tolson this movie made us laugh, cry, and eat a lot of popcorn. When our LA teacher told us that we would be watching some movie called The Great Debaters, both of us were wondering what in the world we had done to deserve this. The movie truly proved that a "smart movie" doesn't necessarily have to be boring, and in many situations, it isn't. The Great Debaters showed the story of Wiley College's debate team of four African American college students in Texas during 1935, and how they debated in one of the most controversial debates of all time. The main plot is brought to life by the incredible cast. Denzel Washington was perfectly casted by Natalie Ballesteros to play Melvin B. Tolson, the debate team coach and professor at Wiley College. Actors Jurnee Smollet, Nate Parker, and Denzel Whitaker truly embraced their roles as Samantha Booke, Henry Lowe, and James Farmer Jr., the students on the debate team. Their performance in this film was Golden Globe worthy.The characters in The Great Debaters were very dynamic. By showing the contrasting personalities in Henry Lowe (Parker) and James Farmer Jr. (Whitaker), Robert Eisele (screenwriter) showed how two completely different people can still work together for the better. Showing how a cynical, angry man and a fourteen year old optimist could grow to be so close really touched us both while watching this movie.Along with the incredible characters, the plot itself in this movie was incredible. The plot was made even more interesting with added subplots such as a love-triangle, and a father/son relationship. These slight problems made the movie much more suspenseful and intriguing to a viewer. The Great Debaters is a quality film that we both would recommend to all audiences who are looking for a heartfelt, suspenseful, interesting, funny, and sad film. This film teaches people about the racial discrimination that took place during the 1930s in America and also explains many crucial things about American history. The performances, cinematography, directing, producing, editing, and designs in this film were truly extraordinary. This drama was truly one of the best movies that both of us have seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Denzel Washington directs and stars in this inspirational true story set in the Texas of 1935, about tiny "Negro" Wiley College, where teacher Melvin Tolson (Washington) was the debate coach. That particular year, he took real chances with his selections for the team, taking for the team a brilliant but prone to trouble young man, the team's first woman, and the very young son of the formidably erudite pastor Dr. James Farmer (Forest Whitaker). The team went on to be the first "Negro" college to take on "White" universities in debates, and inspired many, including the team members, to an awakening of their own awareness of the injustice of prejudice in the United States. This is a wonderful movie that deserved to be seen by more people, for its inspirational message that words do matter, and being able to eloquently formulate arguments can change lives. The real James Farmer Jr. went on to become one of the most prominent civil rights activists in the United States, and the others led lives of similar distinction. On the down side, the movie does take liberties with actual events to such an extent as to be disturbing to those wanting to know more about the true story; but probably wisely in terms of making a more enjoyable drama to watch. Recommended for anyone in the mood for an inspirational story.</fullReview>

Wiley College never debated with Harvard but with USC. And they were never defeated. But the producers felt that Harvard sounded more prestigious and that the undefeated record of Wiley sounded unbelievable. This is very pretentious and lowered the dramatic impact that would have been sustained after watching the movie.Despite these flaws and some movie end well worn clichés, the film was very entertaining.

		<fullReview>The Great Debaters??"Debate is blood sport. It's combat. But your weapons are words." Biographies are meant for people to know what happened, how it happened and most importantly, to inspire. The movie truly inspires a lot. The battle of words shown is so intense that at the end of almost each debate, involuntarily, my hands came together to applaud. This movie is a drama based on the true story of Melvin B. Tolson (Denzel Washington), a professor at Wiley College Texas. In 1935, he inspired students to form the school's first debate team, which went on to challenge Harvard in the national championship. When the cast has names like Denzel Washington and Forest Whitaker, its hard to think that the content will not be good. Also Denzel Washington is the director and he does a real good job. The characters in this movie are simply the students (Debate team) and the mentors (Washington and Whitaker). What works fine throughout is the bonding of the two sides, the situations in which wrong decisions are made, in which the integrity of the confronting person is put to test, even the master(Tolson) is put through situations of doubt where he responds "My politics are my business and it won't endanger the team". He's labeled a communist, an extremist and what not, but, at the end it was because of him, his belief in truth, in his team that lead to the level of success which according to most of them at that time was unattainable.Something special in my point of view was the proper and correct mention of Gandhiji and his civil disobedience in the last debate which highlighted many valid points. In a Nutshell: a) Highlights: The detailing of the mid 1930's that is the job of art direction is good, the acting is lively and commendable, the ensemble is also fine and of course the direction is good.b) USP: The battle of words. TRIVIA: Washington's second movie as a director. Great Lines: i) Defeat makes a person stronger.ii) Opponent doesn't exist because he is a mere dissenting voice to the truth I speak.My rating 8.5 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In "The Great Debaters," a true story that takes place in the 1930s, Denzel Washington plays Melvin B. Tolson, a professor at Wiley College, an all-black school in Marshall, Texas. The movie chronicles his efforts to get his debating team to compete against some of the most prestigious Anglo colleges ? including Harvard ? in the country. This was no mean accomplishment, given the intense prejudice and opposition thrown up against the very idea of a "white" school hosting a black debating squad, particularly in the Jim Crow South. Tolson was also a furtive union organizer of local sharecroppers, an activity that ultimately got him accused of being a communist in the politically volatile world of the Great Depression."The Great Debaters" is a solid, old-fashioned social drama that wears its emotionalism and its "squareness" proudly on its sleeve. As director, Washington doesn't indulge in narrative complexities or fancy cinematic flourishes, preferring to let the drama and the temper of the times speak for themselves. It's true that the characters could use a little more development, but the acting is solid, with Denzel Whitaker winning top honors as James Farmer, Jr., the 16-year-old member of the trio who's torn between his impressive intellect, his innate self-consciousness and his burgeoning puberty. The first-rate cast is rounded out by Nate Parker and Jurnee Smollet as Henry Lowe and Samantha Booke, the other two members of the team who become romantically involved with one another; Forest Whitaker as James' loving but overbearing father; and John Heard as a bigoted sheriff who has it in for Tolson.The movie ends with a where-they-all-ended-up title-card wrap-up that adds to the movie's inspirational effect. It's easier to reject the film intellectually than emotionally, since the filmmakers know all the right buttons to push. That may make the movie overly-manipulative in the long run, but you'd have to have a heart of stone not to be moved by it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pretty much captivated by this film. While from a past era, it was the intellectual version of Remember the Titans. This guy and the coach had more than a physical similarity (I'm kidding, of course). This film pulls us back to a time that set up the second picture, with all of the Jim Crow laws and the nasty Souther whites. We have some nicely developed characters here. It was fun seeing Forrest Whittaker's son play his son. I thought there is a real resemblance, and then I read the credits. it's interesting to see how the promotion of labor movements were treated in those days. Black or white, police often opened fire on strikers and rabble rousers. The lynching scene here is so powerful. It is so sad that a people had to live in such terror, often from people who had IQ's way below theirs. I was a little disturbed by some of the sexual stuff--how realistic would that have been in 1935--and how does this fit with college life at that time. I'm sure that much of this was thrown in because we have an audience that needs it. Oh, well, it still works on many levels and we do pull for these guys, even if there's quite a bit of revisionism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Great Debaters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The time is 1935; Wiley College is an all black college in Marshall Texas. There they have a debate team who has done well in the past. Now though is the time for change in this little "Negro" college. You will meet four students, Henry Lowe, an intelligent young man who knows; knowledge and pain far beyond his age, he speaks with a certain passion, anger, and hope that young men his age could never speak with. Samantha Booke, who traveled from her first college just to be on the Wiley debate team, is the only female to make the Wiley College debate team since its conception, though at first she is only an alternate, it is still a great feat to have been made. During the movie she gets her chance to step up and make herself heard. she is a strong young woman with compassion and a strong understanding of what is and isn't fair and is not afraid to say when that is. 14 year old James Farmer Jr., the son of Dr. Farmer who works for the college, made the debate team as an alternate as well, he will get two chances to speak one of which will make a huge difference. He is considered one of the best researchers on the team and is looked to a lot more than any 14 year old boy should be looked to. The last young man you will meet will drop out of the team due to political problems between him and the debate coach, his name is Hamilton Burgess. These four brave young people will be coached by Professor Melvin Tolson a free thinking man who gets himself into a bit of trouble with the law. He has an extraordinary talent for debate; he can persuade people easily and without saying much. An extraordinary team is made up of these four/three young students who use words to battle there way to victory. Together they will lead a nearly undefeated record with only having lost one debate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Great Debaters!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Great Debaters was a warm hearted, touching movie that truly came from the heart. I felt as though it was really meant to show people what life is sometimes all about. It was about three young black kids who tried out for a debate team in Texas and were more than ecstatic to have won there place on the Wiley College Debate Team. There coach, Melvin Tulson, played by Denzel Washington was there main inspiration through it all for being so strong and pushing them to do there best and going through his own mess with civil rights and such. While Tulson deals with his personal issues with the town's sheriff he pushes these three great debaters to do there best at every debate that they attend and they do just that until one unlucky one which happens to the best of us. Still the team gets invited to Harvard University to Debate and along the road they face lynch mobs and the facts of reality during those horrible racial times, but the kids take these hardships as some of the best success in life and as just some of there best lessons in life. All of the actors in the movie were perfect and played out each role with heart and with soul. Samantha Booke, played by J. Smollett played a strong, awesome part as the African American women in her time trying to deal with everything that was going on around her. Denzel Whitaker as James Farmer Jr. also played the fun intelligent character in the movie that I think held the movie together. "He was the little boy who made the movie," In my own personal opinion. Every single actor was putting themselves out there in The Great Debaters which is what makes a fantastic movie. I give it two thumbs up for a eye catching, goosbump giving, edge of your seat sitting movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an entertaining and educational movie. There are relatively few good movies on the struggle for civil rights for African Americans and this is one of them (there are plenty of good documentaries). It's an inspirational story of a small college in Texas (for African Americans) that is training some students in debating skills during the 1930's Roosevelt America. They compete within the local area and win enough debates to start touring on a national level. In their struggle to attain recognition they witness and are victimized by the evil of the 'Jim Crow' south.One of the debaters is a young James Farmer who later was to be an organizer of CORE (Congress of Racial Equality) and in the early 1960's took part in the 'Freedom Rides' in the deep south. Many of the civil rights leaders started to come of age during the 1930's and for them it was a long and arduous journey to the legislative achievements of the 1960's. One of the strengths of this film is it depicts the growth of civil rights as an ongoing movement that took place over several decades.All the actors in this film are convincing and the story is one that needs to be told.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally, movie made to show the world that you can overcome many obstacles in life by having a brain. I am in high school, and I see so many kids throwing their life away, doing stupid things. A lot of my friends get C's, D's and F's and justify it by saying that nobody cares about your grades if you're not going to college anyway. They don't understand how easy it is to throw your life away. All it takes is one wrong choice. This movie proves that being dumb only hurts you and being stupid isn't cool. Sure, this movie took place in the 30's but it still rings true today. You don't get anywhere being stupid. Our ancestors worked so hard to give us all the opportunities we young people have today. And now we take it for granted because it's always been available for us. This movie takes place in a time where African Americans didn't have many equal opportunities. We take for granted that we can ALL go to school...they couldn't. They lived in a world where it was set up for a black person to lose and a white person to win. And a majority of the whites liked it that way, as portrayed in the film. And it isn't "racist" as some have posted. It is the truth whether you want to believe it. The story of this film is amazing, the acting is impeccable, and it is something that all young people should see. As Tolson said people need to "find, take back, and keep our righteous mind."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by one of the celebrity's African-American star movies (Denzel Washington), the great Debaters which based on a true story is amazing and educational film in my opinion. Even though there are some sad parts, it's all about history and I strongly recommend it to the new generation. The story was strong enough to show how was difficult for black in general to face the practice of segregation in their live and particularly in college. Even though black students cannot go to the same school with other whites, nevertheless they were succeed to debate one of the prestigious University in the world and to beat its withes team (Harvard University). I was very impress of what ambitious was for their black professor (Denzel Washington) to push his student's team to win the national championship never happens before. During their glorious step against others colleges, those black students had a fear to be lynched, but once again James L. Farmer (Forest Whitaker ) to said to his son : doing what you "have to do", and for the team to believe of what they were expected it to. According to the key dialog line that I most like in the movie: We "can do "what we "want to do". The Great Debaters may be a good inspiration movie for many other s blacks and colored people that it is possible to dream, in what we do to success if we really trust in our capacity. In this movie I see the example of the first Africa-American President B. Obama with is famous "yes we can" which make history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...at least here on the IMDb. With fewer than 10k votes (with three out of five from overseas users!) and less than 90 user comments so far, it's obvious that "The Great Debaters" failed to make much of an impression on the IMDb demographic despite the lure of the Denzel Washington brand, nor does its box office indicate significant mainstream success, despite the backing of the Oprah Winfrey PR machine. And that's too bad, because "The Great Debaters" is a much better film than most of the fluff that puts butts in seats in theaters nationwide. It has its problems, including an awkward and off-putting title, but "The Great Debaters" tells a story worth hearing, with themes that bear repeating no matter how many times you've already heard them: the importance of human dignity and rights, the innate power of personal responsibility and determination, the value of a good education, among others.It's a well-produced period piece (mid-30s America) that belies its relatively low budget (by Hollywood standards, that is), and a fine sophomore directorial effort from Washington, who if he keeps it up may someday become the black Clint Eastwood. DP collaborator Philippe "Antwone Fisher" Rousselot's camera-work complements Robert "3: The Dale Earnhardt Story" Eisele's earnest script, though I found James Newton Howard and Peter Golub's score a bit too overtly manipulative. I tire of "uplifting" string sections, and much preferred the licensed musical selections, but that's just me. The acting is pretty much beyond reproach, especially from the three young newcomers in the lead roles: Nate "Tunnel Rats" Parker, Denzel "Training Day" Whitaker, and Jurnee "Full House" Smollett all show great promise. Washington is obviously an actor's director; what a pleasure he must be to work with.Upshot, "The Great Debaters" tells a mostly true story with various compromises for narrative effect (e.g. Harvard instead of U.S.C. and the compositing of various characters) along with undoubted melodramatic embellishment for cinematic effect (chases, daydreams, love scenes, etc.), and mostly pulls it off with good style.NB to fx geeks: Greg Nicotero headed the fx team that created the shuddersome corpse for the film's pivotal scene of racist sin and evil. Younger children should probably not be watching this film in spite of its positive thematic appeal; they don't really need such vicarious trauma.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this movie. When it was running in the theaters, I somehow missed it, and finally watched it on DVD.First of all, I was not sure how one could make a movie about debates. This movie kept me glued to the seat (OK, the sofa) throughout, as if it was a sports or a drama movie. Actually it had elements of both. There was a real story that moved at a very nice pace. The atmosphere of the 1930's seemed well depicted. There is some violence, but it is never over the top. The romantic scenes were tastefully done, and they added to the story/drama.The best part was the acting. All the main characters- Denzel Washington, Nate Parker, Jurnee Smollett (sp?), Denzel Whitaker, Forrest Whitaker were all superb. The younger Whitaker is very talented. Is he the real life son of Forrest Whitaker? The scene between him and Nate Parker after Parker returns drunk, was particularly well done.The debates were just the right length- just snipets of the key points. Longer speeches would have slowed down the movie and made it boring. Excellent direction (by Denzel Washington), editing, cinematography. The music was very appropriate.I really enjoyed this movie. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fight between rhetors- this interesting idea was chosen by Denzel Washington to make The Great Debaters. 99% of characters (including the main ch.) are black, who did a great job in performing. We must say that because of the 2 angles on one problem you will get a picture about the times when the black were segregated by white in America. Unfortunately, the love story in the movie is completely unnecessarily, which takes off the quality of the film. From the beginning you are expecting the final debate, which would bring you shivers. After you hear that it is on Harvard, you will be as happy as characters in the movie. And it will not disappoint you! Of course, you already know the theme- the oppression of white against the black, but arguments are strong on both sides and till the end you just guess who is going to win. I recommend to watch The Great Debaters, because it might be much more actual than it seems&#x2026;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denzel Washington's The Great Debaters is an inspirational true-life based movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On this, the day of the vice presidential debates that I recorded and will watch later, I decided to watch director Denzel Washington's The Great Debaters right after watching "Survivor". Co-produced by Oprah Winfrey and inspired by actual events, The Great Debaters is a very compelling history lesson about a small black college called Wiley and that school's debate team that wins enough of them to be challenged by perhaps the biggest university of the country: Harvard. (Okay, I get that the actual final debate was at USC. Still, Harvard made a more compelling institution here.) Washington plays the teacher, Melvin B. Tolson, who also organizes a sharecroppers' union at night that temporarily gets him in trouble with the law. The students who comprise of his team include Henry Lowe (Nate Parker), Samantha Booke (Jurnee Smollett), and James Farmer, Jr. (Denzel Whitaker) and yes, he was named after Washington! Forest Whitaker plays James Farmer, Sr. and no, he and Denzel are not related. With that cast, there was, no doubt, some expectation of quality and that's what you get throughout the picture. All the conflict and some romance between Parker and Smollett are handled with great dramatic clarity and when Washington and Forest are not on screen Parker, Smollett, and the younger Whitaker have enough presence in filling in. All in all, The Great Dabaters is one of the most inspirational movies I've yet seen. P.S. As a Louisianian, I was pleasantly surprised to read that parts were shot in Shreveport and Mansfield and that there was a "Filmed in Louisiana" logo in the end credits.</fullReview>

Plus it lacked a certain amount of realism with the drama between people that really never formed a relationship in real life.This movie does point to one thing: there were real debaters from Wiley College. And while that college doesn't command much respect anymore, it did at one time.Overall, because it confusing fiction with history, I have to drop it to a B-.

		<fullReview>The Great Debaters is an OPRAH WINFREY production from her Harpo Studios. Denzel Washington both directed &amp; has a leading role. Forrest Whittaker also is also prominently cast. This tale of a debating team in a very small BLACK college in a very small town in Texas in the year 1935. It is supposedly a true story about 4 very bright black youths debating other schools &amp; eventually a team at HARVARD.SPOILER ALERT-Sorry to tell you nice people it was NOT Harvard but a team at USC here in sunny Los Angeles. USC was just starting to gain national prominence in 1935.The producers made this change, because Harvard was &amp; still is one of the most prominent schools in the USA. They thought it would be better box office this way,Setting this detail aside, The film is non-the-less very well acted &amp; made. The costumes &amp; settings are quite accurate. The entire cast is first rate &amp; the acting top draw,A wee bit of nepotism. The lad who portrays Forrest Whittaker's 14 year old son in the movie is his actual son Denzel. (he has appeared in many TV shows prior to this) He is one of the debaters &amp; of course has the final speech in the last debate.I do think young Denzel Whittaker has a bright future ahead of him.There have been many films over the years that have had racial bigotry as a major or minor theme. Very few if any have been even sided. The Great Debaters is no exception.Do see it for its fine acting &amp; sense of the period.Ratings *** (out of 4) 82 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10) ***Note on ratings, GENTLEMENS AGREEMENT &amp; IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT received the same ratings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Great Debaters" is an enthralling movie about three young people from Wiley College, a school from the south where only blacks attend (the setting's in 1936) who use their personal experiences, undeniable wit, research and passionate oratory skills to become a powerful debate team. This movie is not just a dry documentary of what debating is all about and does not give us three bland ciphers to scrutinize and aw over. Instead, it shows us, through their debating experience how discipline, hard work, inspiration and standing for what you believe in can make you succeed. I believe that all people taking Speech and Debate in their school should watch this movie. Because if you can speak like how the Wiley debaters spoke, then you are a winner. Although the Wiley Team never fought affirmative for what they didn't believe in, I felt that constant victories in their performances and heartfelt speeches are what the audience (namely myself) would want to see. I was truly inspired by this movie and now I understand why my dad was so keen for me to see this. I could totally relate to how James (Denzel Whitaker) felt when he couldn't stand up and defend his proposition, it is truly nerve-racking to speak in front of a bunch of judges. It is, I think one of the best movies of the year.</fullReview>

The college is in Texas and it's the 1930s, so racism plays a part in the film. The team goes on a winning streak, and begins to be invited to white schools. The team witnesses a lynching and finally gets invited to a big debate with Harvard.What I didn't like was the topics the debates were on made no sense to me. It was very uninteresting.

		<shortDescription>Flagrant Oscar bait but pretty good nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Great Debaters" tells the true story of the debate team at all-black Wiley College in the 1930's. They attracted enough attention in their time to warrant a match against the reigning national champions, which serves as the climax of this film.I should note that the film takes a few liberties with the facts, including switching the final opponents to Harvard instead of USC. Personally, I don't mind these mild inaccuracies since the film generally correlates well with its inspiration, which is an American Legacy article that is worth reading.The story is interesting, though perhaps a little too overtly 'Hollywood' for my tastes. Basically, it's an inspirational story that feels specially tailored towards Academy voters. The fact that the film didn't garner any Oscar nominations is probably due to the difficulty of converting the subject matter into something truly compelling. Not that the film is boring, but I find that the true story (ie. minus the artistic license) is just as satisfying.The cast is solid, including past Oscar winners Denzel Washington and Forest Whitaker. However, I was most surprised by the unknowns who portrayed the debaters. Judging by their performances here they won't (or at least shouldn't) stay unknown for much longer.I was also pleasantly surprised by Denzel Washington's directorial efforts. I wouldn't say that he equals his acting prowess but he certainly proves that he takes his craft seriously. On the audio side, the movie boasts a score by seven time Oscar nominee James Newton Howard. It complements the visuals nicely and doesn't fall into the trap of being self-consciously stirring.All in all, this is a pretty good effort from Washington and leaves me looking forward to his next stint behind the camera. It's not exactly an edge-of-your-seat experience but it will certainly appeal to those who enjoy a good historically based film with an inspirational tone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspiring, well acted, irritatingly factually inaccurate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is inspiring to see, is acted well, and generally is directed well. It generally avoids cheap, treacly tricks (with the notable exception of Samantha Brooke declaring that blacks were the thread that united the country into a whole). It is hard to remember nowadays just what life was like for blacks in the south of the US 70 years ago. It was very bad. That aspect of the movie is accurate.Unfortunately, the movie contains a number of unnecessary historical inaccuracies that detract from its overall score and indeed to some extent from the very point it was trying to make. The facts concerning the debates are vaguely the same as in the movie, but, as usual for Hollywood, many things were changed for dramatic effect. It really is unfortunate that Hollywood has no compunctions about rewriting history a la Orwell's 1984.The Wiley team beat the reigning national team in 1935. However, that team was from the University of Southern California, not Harvard. Harvard, Harvard, always Harvard! There really are other good universities in the US, you know. It is unfortunate that Robert Eisele, the scriptwriter, chose to deprive USC of its rightful recognition as the national debating champion in 1935. In fact, the movie story fails to tell us a poignant and relevant fact, which is that, even though Wiley College won the debate, it did not thereby become the national champion because black colleges were not then included in the national debate network. I have not seen any mention of the debate being broadcast on radio. It doesn't smell right to me. I suspect it did not happen, but maybe it did.The topic of the debate with USC had nothing to do with civil disobedience, a topic that was not debated at all that year among university debate teams. The stuff in the movie about switching the topic to civil disobedience is total fabrication, added for dramatic and political effect.There is no record that Wiley ever debated Harvard. Apparently, a myth about that was created out of the faulty memory of Benjamin Bell (no relation to Henrietta), a member of the Wiley debate team in 1936-1939. The movie, of course, now will establish the myth as fact, to be cherished along with other fashionable myths such as the supposed genetic "proof" that Thomas Jefferson fathered a child by one of his slaves. (All that genetics can establish is that a male Jefferson was an ancestor of Sally Hemmings's child. The historical record strongly suggests the father was Thomas Jefferson's brother, not Thomas. The switch to Thomas got popularized by Bill Clinton, who sought to minimize his own sexual transgressions by pretending that other presidents had behaved similarly.) Henrietta Bell (the inspiration for the movie character Samantha Booke) was on the debate team only one year, 1930. She was not on the team in 1935, the year of the victory over USC.James Farmer was indeed a child prodigy who started at Wiley at age 14 and was on the team in 1935, but he arrived at the college after Henrietta Bell had left the team and possibly the college itself. He did participate in the debate against USC but was the third member of the team and did not speak in the debate, contrary to the movie.The model for the movie's Henry Lowe apparently was Henry Heights, who did go in and out of college and had a drinking problem. He was on the team with Henrietta Bell, left the college for a while, and then was back again in 1935 and on the team with James Farmer in the USC debate. Heights was one of the Wiley speakers in the USC debate, so the movie's stuff about Lowe stepping aside to let Farmer debate is total nonsense. Heights was from Wichita Falls, TX, a town northwest of Dallas on the Oklahoma border, nowhere near where bald cypress trees grow, so Heights did not grow up amidst the romantic cypress swamps.There appears to be no historical evidence of any romantic relation between Henrietta Bell and Henry Heights. The movie just had to have an excuse for a bed scene, which seems to have become the modern test of whether a movie is serious.The lynching scene is a composite of several events experienced by various Wiley debate teams over the years. Apparently none of them involved witnessing an actual lynching.Melvin Tolson, the debate coach, was present at the debate against USC, so the stuff in the movie about his not going was pure dramatic bunk. Tolson did engage in union activities, organizing farm workers and sharecroppers, but he was arrested for advocating Socialism, not for organizing tenant farmers. (How times have changed. Nowadays, a professor is much more likely to be arrested for advocating capitalism.) It is unclear from the brief online biographies where or when the arrest took place. I doubt that James Farmer, Sr., led a bunch of sharecroppers to the jail and got Tolson out. That scene smells like more Hollywood claptrap, but maybe it happened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Great Debaters" wasn't good enough for me in recognizing it as a great black American film. It was decent but not great. The last great black American film in my opinion was "Antwone Fisher". So, Mr. Washington still wins. Before AF, "Eve's Bayou"... I guess Jurnee Smollett wins as well.The acting, writing and cinematography were all above average. However, I couldn't engage with most of the characters except for Forest and Denzel Whitaker's characters. And, unfortunately, I don't think the kid's acting gave enough range to fully realize the emotions of James Farmer Jr. I also think there is something phony about Jurnee Smollett's performance. She was always in the moment but would shift to "Acting" with a capital 'A' in moments that seemed unscripted or improvised. And I hated the slow droll in her words when she debated in the end, sounding like the soulful narrator from "Eve's Bayou." I do appreciate the sports genre feel of the film, substituting the typical sport for something like the competition in debating. However, the debates were not interesting or insightful at all. The debates were just the same old arguments mostly presented by black intellectuals since forever. I found myself bored of the debates. I needed to hear a new perspective on the same ole'issues.The best part was the scenes stemming from the characters witnessing an abominable act of violence committed to a stranger, which rightfully left them all distraught up until the final debate competition of the film.It was a great effort for a mediocre film. And I'm still waiting for the next great film featuring a predominately black cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well no words can match Denzel Washington's persona. He always delivers something which surprises you. "The great debaters" I think is his second self directed movie but his work behind the camera was as good as in front of the camera. One thing I mentioned about a good director which I found in this movie too was the distribution of screen space. This movie boasts of some of the biggest stars of the movie industry like Denzel Washington himself, Forest Whitaker (Oscar winner) but at the same time it also cast some of the youngest members likes Denzel Whitaker, Nate Parker and Jurnee Smollett. You can easily sense the brilliance in distribution of screen space. Performance wise also the movie is of more worth than pleasing. The movie depicts a small past of James Farmer Jr. (Denzel Whitaker) when he sees the struggle and lynching of black people in the land of Texas due to racial discrimination. The movie shows a Debaters Team from the University of Wiley (for Black students) of which James Farmer Jr. was a part with Nate Parker, Jurnee Smollett and with Denzel Washington as their Teacher. This team Travel across the whole country defeating one by one all the major universities of country including the white universities. By this the strategy of taking the revolution against racial discrimination came up in the national map. The final scene or debate is shown between Wiley and Harvard University and this is a debate which one should watch out in the movie. All the debates scenes in the movie are brilliant.Watch this movie. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stirring drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denzel Washington's second feature as director, The Great Debaters, is a deeply moving, intelligent and inspiring work that both entertains and educates without being overly manipulative. If you hadn't guessed from the title, it is about debaters - in particular those from a small black college in Texas who competed for the national championship in 1935 and who subsequently took on all comers white or black and went undefeated for the next ten years. Based on actual events, the film is not only about debates, but about racism in the South, union organizing, radical politics, and the power of education to make a difference in people's lives. While it has an underdog formula that you have seen many times, it has rarely been presented with such skill and passion.An outstanding cast features Washington as poet Melvin Tolson, professor at Wiley College in Marshall, Texas, James Farmer Jr. (Denzel Whitaker), as the 14-year-old son of the college president (Forest Whitaker), Henry Lowe (Nate Parker) and Samantha (Jurnee Smollett), as debaters, Samantha being the first ever female member of the team. After grueling auditions, Tolson rides the four students selected for the debate team harshly but with compassion, demanding from them that they reach their full potential. Unknown to his students, however, Tolson moonlights as a union organizer for sharecroppers and is considered by the local authorities as a dangerous radical and probably a communist.One of the team members Hamilton Burgess (Jermaine Williams) has to decide whether or not to remain on the team after Tolson refuses to tell him the nature of his politics. Two instances bring home the kind of society in which they live. In one incident, the elder Farmer is humiliated by ignorant sharecroppers and forced to pay an exorbitant fee after he accidentally ran over their pig. In another incident, traveling on the road late at night they encounter a white mob that has just lynched and burned a black man and they barely escape with their lives. These incidents bring their debate topics out of the pages of academia into personal experience and the film becomes more than an academic "Hoosiers", but a primer on racism.Only snippets of the debates are shown and in these the Wiley team is always on the more popular progressive side. Having been on the debate team at the University of Wisconsin, I can attest that debating involves much more than championing progressive causes. It is in fact an exercise in sophistry in which the debater has to be skillful in making the worse seem the better case. Nonetheless, for dramatic purposes in the film, it works and would have seemed pointless to show the team debating positions that were counter to their experience and convictions.After Tolson writes to several white universities to try to secure a debate; his ultimate dream is realized and the culmination of the film is the Wiley team facing off against Harvard for the national championship. Here, Harvard is substituted for USC because, the writers wanted to demonstrate the heights that were achieved. While Denzel Washington is outstanding as the fiercely competitive, angry black activist and teacher, other performances deserve mention as well. These include the great Forrest Whittaker as the strict theologian school president, Nate Parker as a highly intelligent young black debater who had recently been in prison and was given to episodes of drunken behavior, and Jurnee Smollett as brash young Samantha who aspires to and in fact eventually becomes a lawyer.A special mention should also be given to Denzel Whittaker (no relation). Though it is not explained how a 14-year old can be in college, his work, first as the team researcher then as an eloquent debater, is thoroughly believable. While a little more stylistic risk taking would have been welcome, The Great Debaters is entertainment with an edge, a stirring drama about a group of young people who show what it takes to transcend the built-in limitations of their life situation and achieve greatly. While the film may not convince the cynics among us, it will appeal to those who are still capable of being moved by exceptional human achievement.</fullReview>

The dialog was tight, and there are moments that effortlessly induced emotions I've not felt from any movie in quite awhile.

Watch this movie, and you'll be deeply touched, if not transformed by the significance of it's content. These are the people that paved the way for Human Rights to flourish for the rest of us.

		<shortDescription>A rare sedimental uplift during awards season</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Great Debaters will likely be dismissed as cheap sentiment as wards season rolls around in comparison to all films making belated statements about the Iraqi war or stylized crime stories. At it's surface, the film is just an old-fashioned tear jerker about a team of underdogs beating the odds. At the next level, however, the film is a wonderful portrait of small-town life in a racially charged Texas town at the dawn of the civil rights movement.The underdog in question is a college debate team at a black college and Denzel Washington plays Melvin Tolson, the team's impassioned debate coach with politically questionable ties. Opposite Washington, Forrest Whitaker in a wonderful performance, plays James Farmer Sr., the college president who holds the distinction of being the first black man from his home state to earn a PhD. Both Tolson and Farmer are incredibly dignified and revered men but only within their own world. When Farmer is threatened and humiliated in front of his children by a hillbilly who's pig he accidentally ran over, it's a truly shocking moment that will leave quite an impression.It's in this oppressed world that Tolson struggles to break barriers for his three star pupils who, through discipline and training, turn into an unbeatable debate team. The three pupils, played by Nate Parker, Jurnee Smallett and Denzel Whitaker; are wonderfully fleshed out characters and the film balances their adolescent tribulations (alcohol, a love triangle, trying to measure up to their parents, etc.) with the pressures they face as three courageous people who are trying to represent themselves with pride. Whatever flaws the film might have, it is genuinely moving and uplifting and at this time of year, that is increasingly rare. It is also worth noting that the liberties the film takes with history are not as great as one might think. The story largely tells itself according to true events so any overly clichéd moves in the storyline might be better appreciated when one considers their authenticity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>RESOLVED: This movie deserves several Oscars.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this film without even knowing more than the title, and I left misty eyed and eager to learn more about this remarkable story. The acting was dead-on, the casting perfect and the cinematography exquisite. Denzel Washington should get an Oscar nod for director, and Denzel Whitaker a nod for supporting actor. Nate Parker and Jimee Smollett also turned in fine performances as the other two on the debate team. Forrest Whitaker was his usual best as the president of Wylie College and father to his son. Of course, ever present is the pernicious evil of bigotry and hate that pervaded the south during that time period and still exists today. Chilling in it's portrayal, the racism is so thick you can smell it.But, despite overwhelming odds, and all naysayers, this story is, not unlike Stand and Deliver, a true success story, where perseverance of mind conquers the unwillingness of the flesh. I highly recommend this movie to all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Debaters is a Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some viewers have compared this movie to "pump up the fist" sports genre movies and that could be true. And maybe the movie can come across as a "been there done that" cliché. But the bottom line is that it's a great movie based on a true story which of course I'm sure Hollywood embellished a little, but isn't that what Hollywood does? It's a feel good movie with a good message. You could say it's an academic version of Remember the Titans. Denzel is King, but the co-starring Princes and Princess steal the show. If a movie can educate as well as entertain, it's a bonus. I guess you could view debating as sparring with words. And in that sense, comes the sports comparisons. It was interesting to see how the debaters would change direction in mid "fight" and adapt their strategy on the fly. They took a boring subject such as debating and made it interesting enough to turn into a good movie which had you cheering for the underdogs. Which of course sports movies tent to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dangerous Life of a Harlem Renaissance Poet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When reading about what may be described as the lesser celebrated heroic figures of the Harlem Renaissance, we rarely get a definitive look at just how complicated and sometimes dangerous their everyday lives were. In fact, until the past ten years, many defined the period primarily by its well-known literary, musical, and artistic elements while overlooking the fact there was any political component to it at all. THE GREAT DEBATERS corrects both oversights by giving us an extraordinary portrait of poet and educator Melvin B. Tolson (1898-1966), portrayed with convincing restraint by Denzel Washington, who also directed the movie. At the same time, it delivers an exciting story filled with the creative intellectual genius that characterized the Harlem Renaissance, the thrill of youthful romance, and the painful loss of innocence.Tolson, historically, is known largely as the celebrated author-poet of "Rendezvous with America" (1944); "Libretto for the Republic of Liberia" (1953); and "Harlem Gallery" (1965). But we meet him in The Great Debaters, prior to his literary fame, as a professor of English at Wiley College in Marshall, Texas. By day he teaches and guides his students through the passion-filled topics of the era: labor rights, race relations, public welfare policies, and personal ethics. By night he is a labor organizer who runs the risk of imprisonment or getting lynched when he meets with Whites and Blacks to convince them to organize unions to protect their rights as workers. His efforts cause him to become branded as a communist, and therefore distrusted as a threat not merely to labor laws (or the lack of any significant ones at the time) but to American democracy.Nate Parker as Henry Lowe, Jurnee Smollett as Samantha Brooke, and Denzel Whitaker as 14-year-old James Farmer, Jr. all give inspired performances in their roles as Tolson's brilliant student debaters who endure challenge after challenge before earning an invitation to debate the team at Harvard. With the odds stacked solidly against them, they nevertheless pull off an historical win. Just as significant as the final team's triumph, is the footnote identifying these students as future community leaders and history-makers in their own right. Henry Lowe would go on to become an influential minister, Samantha Brooke a lawyer, and Farmer a founder of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE).Much has been made of the fact that The Great Debaters is the first major film project on which media empress Oprah Winfrey (one of the film's producers) and two-time Oscar-winner Denzel Washington have worked together. Of equal significance, if not greater, is the fact that in addition to Washington the movie features powerhouse Oscar-winning actor Forest Whitaker as Dr. James Farmer, Sr. How many movies are there, after all, in which two Academy Award-winning African-American actors play characters of historical consequence like Tolson and Farmer? More important than the novelty is the contrast between the two, somewhat like the classic divergence noted later between Martin Luther King Jr.'s political philosophies and those initially espoused by Malcolm X. The differences between Tolson and Farmer, however, appear more subtle and that very likely is due to Robert Eisele's amazing screenplay.The hype and buzz surrounding The Great Debate sometimes comes across as a bit over the top. Despite that, the movie is actually far more excellent than anything you've likely heard about it.By Author-Poet Aberjhani, author of "Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance" (Facts on File Library of American History)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denzel Washington: An Actor's Director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit it, I'm such a lover of the over cheesy rubbing the message in your face movies, The Great Debaters was of course going to be no exception. It also won the golden globe for best drama of 2007 and I couldn't wait to see how Denzel does in the director's chair. I rented The Great Debaters and watched it the other day and the main thing about this movie that makes it great is the acting. I mean the story is fantastic, but it couldn't have been told any better because of the three young actors in this movie: Nate Parker, Jurnee Smollett, and Denzel Whitaker. We also have stellar performances from Denzel and Forrest as well of course, but it's just these three young actors that I have never seen before or heard of that just blew me away. They presented themselves with class, intelligence, and courage to carry on in the tough world they lived in.Henry, Samantha, and James are three young black students who have joined a debate team led by Melvin Tolson. They all live in Texas and have to deal with the harsh world of racism, where black people are lynched without knowledge of what they did that was so wrong. But the team pulls in strong together to win several debates despite their color and the ignorance that surrounds them, eventually leading them into competing against Harvard University.The Great Debaters is just a terrific movie, it's very inspirational and makes you think. Denzel as a director, he could be a little more visionary in my opinion, but he makes a great actor's director because he just delivers all the actor's best. Denzel Whitaker's last debate against Harvard brought me to tears, the honesty that just comes from his words makes you want to stand up and clap after his speech. I would very much recommend The Great Debaters, it is worth the watch and I'm sure will have you cheering at the end.8/10</fullReview>

You can really draw upon that here since your own personal experiences may help you come debate time. This is exactly what occurs in this film and it is done very well.There is an amazing supporting performance by Forest Whitaker as a Ph.D religious fanatic who correctly views education as the way to achieve success in this world. Whitaker depicts a fanatic and is truly phenomenal in this role; he is far better here than in his award winning "The King of Scotland."Denzel Washington, as the instructor and union organizer, is condescending in the role, but he brings the necessary strength in achieving another unusually good performance here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The one thing that truly impressed me about this picture was how well it captured the tensions of the time... living as Blacks in Texas in the thirties. I don't think any other film has quite captured the truly shameful way that Black people were treated only a generation or two ago.Many other films (for example, In The Heat of The Night) have touched on similar territory, but none really got to me quite as much. It is in stark contrast to modern times in that, although there is still racial prejudice both socially and economically in America today, nevertheless I wonder how many young people today (both Black and White)really realize just how bad it was on a day-to-day basis. In our modern era where White and Black not only mingle but often date, the strides that have been made in just a few generations is quite literally a reason to hope - especially now that America might even soon have a Black President.But there is something else that this film does, besides simply relate some Black history. It holds up the sophistication and excellence of these kids in contrast to too many of the Black kids today, who have so many more opportunities to make something of their lives, and who seem to be wasting them by taking the easy way. How many rappers or their audience would even know who Thoreau was - not to mention half the other names quoted in this film, both Black and White? How many kids today settle for reputations based on flashy clothes and street smarts instead of true education? What was most obvious in this film is that the people here were NOT afflicted with a ghetto mentality. Yes, they knew very well who they were and what there history was, but they realized that it is in conquering the world OUTSIDE the ghetto that truly shows character and excellence. In this film the Black debaters beat the Harvard team on their own territory and showed that education and sophisticated thinking are not just the white man's prerogative. In that time, being poor was not a reason to remain ignorant. Today, in the inner-city black culture, it seems that bad grades and a prison record get you more respect than success. I can only hope that this film will help set things straight in some kids' minds, although I suspect that such a fine film might be ignored by those who need to see it the most - after all, there are no rap songs on the soundtrack, no explosions, no quick editing like on MTV - nothing that the average Black kid today can relate to... or am I being too harsh in my judgment? In any case, this is a film worth seeing, not only for its subject but for the wonderful job the actors do - there is not a bad performance in the entire film. Kudos to Denzel Washington as the director, who was smart enough to focus on the characters rather than trying to impress with any fancy technical tricks. An honest film, revealing a story that has been too little known for too long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed in the manner Marshall was portrayed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the movie went overboard to portray 1935 Marshall as an economically poor and illiterate community.For example, the Marshall "town/city" scenes were filmed in Louisiana. Marshall had at least three theaters in 1935--one was for blacks on the town square (did you see a square with a courthouse in the center?) and two white theaters where blacks did have to sit in the balcony.Marshall was a hub of the Texas &amp; Pacific RR and had a very nice station for the 1930s (granted it had separate waiting rooms for blacks and whites). And, you would not see a grove of trees or forest as the train left the station for 3-5 miles in any direction.Furthermore, I do not recall ever seeing a bench in Marshall with a sign that said "Whites only." The Bus station had a waiting room--again separate areas for whites and blacks.The only downtown benches I recall were around the courthouse and they did not have any signs on them. Yes, the restrooms and water fountains were marked for "Colored" and "Whites." The wife and daughter of the sheriff at that time would not have let him out of the house dressed in the manner of the movie sheriff. He generally wore khaki or tan trousers with a starched and ironed light colored shirt. And, no sane official that had to manage a county budget would have rammed a county vehicle into a closed barn door.Marshall also had another Black college--Bishop that moved to Dallas in 1960.Although there was no mention of it, Wiley had an outstanding football team. As a youth, I attended a number of their games during WW II as well as Bishop's inaugural post WW II game. We white kids did not go to the Wiley vs Bishop games.Nonetheless, my wife and I enjoyed the movie especially since we knew about Professor Tolson and James Farmer. We did not know about the Southern Tenant farmers union activities which probably were in the eastern part of the county where most of the cotton was grown.</fullReview>

I had been worried that a movie produced by Oprah would be a little heavy on the message, but it is carried out quite well.That said, any debaters watching the movie are in for a bit of a surprise. Despite the great lines ("Debate is bloodsport!"), the "debates" shown are barely relevant. They are not so much debates as pathos-filled punchlines that do not do a movie with the word "debaters" in the title much justice.But if the lack of real debating does not concern you, The Great Debaters is a fine movie worth seeing.</fullReview>

In a hundred years? Never? No, the time for justice, the time for freedom, and the time for equality is always, is always right now!" Samantha Although debating is described in the beginning of The Great Debaters as a "blood sport," only after viewing the film can the most jaded audience not agree. The true story, fictionalized here but basically accurate, about little Wiley College in Texas, 1935, contending with the premier white college teams across the nation is as formulaic as any underdog sports story.But it's good formula fun and a bit inspirational, not a bad thing.Melvin B. Tolson (Denzel Washington), teacher and poet, takes a foursome of debating hopefuls, and through an application of tough love and wit, shapes them into contenders with the likes of Harvard University. The fact of the matter is that the college won ten national championships in a row, although it was the University of Southern California it faced that first year, not the more dramatic Harvard.Because this is an Oprah Winfrey production, there is plenty of corn to go around, including a romance that takes too much time and feels contrived. The whole theme of making something of yourself also feels Oprah-like. But when the students are debating, it is heavenly to hear them raise their deliveries and their interaction to higher levels.Having been a debater who framed his own arguments, I was disappointed that Tolson wrote their arguments, a not unusual action, but one fortunately nixed by their Harvard rivals because then our combatants were willingly on their own.Interestingly, Tolson is also involved in union activities that may or may not be communist, providing the much needed tension and surprise that the debates don't always offer. However, the film is an inspiration to those of us who value education and see the parallels between debating and traditional sports. Education grounded in critical thinking and verbal jousting is the best possible preparation for that blood sport called life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-made, yet clichéd sports flix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Picture 2000's "Remember the Titans". Now, move the story-line back 40 years and replace the football team with a debate team. In a nutshell, this is "The Great Debaters". Directed and starring the masterful Denzel Washington, "Debaters" tells the true story of the first debate team from an all-black college to have a match against a white university in 1935. Washington, who most recently starred in the Oscar-nominated "American Gangster", plays Melvin Tolson, a college professor at Wiley College in Texas. As head of the debate team, he motivates his students to overcome the Jim Crow stereotypes that surround them and make more of themselves. Although the film covers important themes, they are handled with cliché after cliché. In fact, there is hardly a moment that doesn't seem copied from another flick. Call it the black "Dead Poet's Society" or "Hoosiers" goes to Texas; whichever way you spin it, this film has a sense of déj? vu about it.Despite its contrived execution, "Debaters" is saved by its winning actors. The reliable Washington as well as Oscar-winner Forest Whitaker give a much-needed shock of life to the movie. The debate team members are played wonderfully, too: Nate Parker as the fiery and troubled Henry; Jurnee Smollett as the beautiful and headstrong Samantha; and Denzel Whitaker as James Jr., a young man in the shadow of his successful, scholarly father. Through their vivid portrayal of these real-life characters, they make the film a success. In addition to the compelling on-screen performances, the film production quality is equally strong. Even though this is only Denzel Washington's second time in the director's chair, he shows a firm and creative hand. Writer Robert Eisele and media queen producer Oprah Winfrey contribute to the picture's success. The viewer will be moved to see beyond the clichés by the passionate and inspirational speeches beautifully delivered during the final debate, which remains with you after the credits roll.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. No question this is a remarkable story that deserves to be told. Mega-star Denzel Washington teams up with Queen of the Universe, Oprah Winfrey, to bring us a fictionalized account of a very true and inspiring story. Sure, it has a touch of "Remember the Titans" and just about every other feel good underdog sports story, but what makes this one a bit different is that it is based on words and education, not athletic ability.Based in the Jim Crow south, Melvin Tolson drives his team of debaters to heights never before reached by a black college debate team. The man had his flaws (a suspected communist, socialist and successful union organizer) there is no questioning his ability to inspire his team to reach down and find the passion to compete against far more established teams (white and black). The three keys to his team were Henry Lowe (played well by Nate Parker), Samantha Booke (former child actress Jurnee Smollett) and 14 yr old James Farmer, Jr. (played with zeal by Denzel Whitaker). This team fights and struggles and pulls together just like any other championship team. Again, the difference is that their battles are done with the mind ... which is remarkable given the times.Denzel tackles the role of Tolson and also directs his second feature ("Antone Fisher"). A better actor than director, he still does an adequate job of capturing the feel of the times ... though there is no shortage of clichés and stereotypes. John Heard plays the "cracker" Sheriff just looking for any way to keep the black man down. Forest Whitaker is again outstanding, this time as Dr. James Farmer, Sr., whose brilliant mind and moral standards set the tone for his prodigy son.The screenplay by Robert Eisele could have benefited by losing the sappy and predictable love story between Lowe and Booke, and the actual debates don't provide near the suspense and tension that the "real life" segments do, but he does capture the added stress of being an educated black in the 1930's.The enduring message from this group of amazing students is that education is the road to freedom. That message is just as strong today as it was 70 years ago and it is a message that does not discriminate based on color.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robust rather than inspiring, solid rather than spectacular but the sweep of the film is just about enough to work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wiley College in Texas, circa 1935. Inspired by other examples and his own work as an union organiser, Professor Melvin Tolson coaches the debate team each year. This year he has female student Samantha, angry young man Henry and young preacher's son James on his team. Against a background of racial hatred, sexism, love and jealousy, the team set out on an undefeated run that sees them get national attention and opportunities that brings with it further danger.The Great Debaters is currently only available in the UK by getting it from outside the UK on import (Amazon has decent prices) and I was curious why given that it looked like a good historical drama with a couple of big name stars in lead roles. Of course the clash of worthy historical drama and the genre of "inspirational school teacher" but I gave it a go with some hopes that it would turn out OK. The resulting film is actually much closer to genre standards than it would have liked and it does have an air of worthiness and predictability that it cannot shake. It doesn't help itself by having a rather fragmented collection of threads that don't sit well together ? we have a love story, we have a father/son relationship and we have Tolson as an organizer. Individually they all sort of work but it does feel like we are stepping between them at times and no one thread really performs as well as it should.It is to the film's credit then that the overall sweep covers this up, engaging and delivering a spirited film that trades on how worthy and correct it is. I can totally understand why this will grate with some viewers, because it is very upright and correct in its delivery ? even down to ensure that whenever a debate is shown, the Wiley team never have to defend the "bad" side of an argument. It does work though as director Washington pulls the usual tricks (sweeping music, tearful scenes) to evoke emotions from the audience in the general rather than the specific. His presence as actor also helps as he is a great presence ? likewise Whittaker, although the latter has little to do. I enjoyed Parker, Smollett and Whitaker (no relation) as they delivered what was asked of them.The Great Debaters is a quite obvious and worthy film for the most part but it does work in a Hollywood way. The lack of detail or complexity will leave some viewers cold but the general sweep and emotion of history all packaged in an effective and professional film will please most viewers, even if it is not a brilliant piece of work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular Film, Highly Recommended</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film caught me by surprise. I did not expect this film to be remarkable since there was very poor advertising. I highly recommend this film. It was just as powerful as Antoine Fisher. Denzel brings out the best in the entire cast. Forest Whitaker's character was amazing. Today, most African American films lack luster and great acting. This is quite the contrary as you will see. The story is one of courage and determination. I learned so much from this film.I am actually buying the DVD since I rented this. Please see it and tell everyone you know--------------------</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent film. Denzel is excellent in front of and behind the camera. Forrest Whitaker and the young cast of debaters are also equally impressive. I have for a while complained that not enough "perfect" 10/10 films come out today that most of the great classics are much older. This is one of my top 10 films of the 2000's decade and quite possibly my favorite film of the year. This is a film that will stand the test of time and is a must see for anyone who enjoys solid drama and excellent movie making. Perhaps not suitable for younger children, but anyone 15+ should get the message and understand the power of the film. Surely will at least start to give you goosebumps during at least one of the passionate speeches.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Look at it for what it is, not what it isn't, and you'll see a rare beautiful story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I live only a few hours south of Marshall, Texas, I have been there many times yet never knew Wiley College, founded in 1873, was there. Until I saw this movie.Back in the 1920s and 1930s Wiley College was a magnet for black professors, often educated in the best universities but unable to get work at traditional "white" colleges. This in turn became a magnet for serious black students who realized that a good education was their best path to success.Denzel Washington is fabled professor Melvin B. Tolson, who incidentally was the coach of the debate team. Tolson was so demanding and prepared his debaters so well, the Wiley College debate team rarely if ever lost a debate, even against the USC debate team which were the National Champions.This movie, "The Great Debaters", is about those glory years. While Tolson is real, most of the other characters are fictional, but composites based on real people during that period.One of the other key "real" characters was Denzel Whitaker as James Farmer Jr., 14-year-old son of the college Methodist minister. He was a member of the debate team, and while most of his contribution was research for the topics, he in fact became an orator and a key mover, along with others like Martin Luther King, in the Civil Rights movement in subsequent years. (Note: Denzel Whitaker is in fact a big fan of Denzel Washington, but apparently is not related to Forest Whitaker who plays his father here.)This is a fine movie, even though the featured debate against Harvard in 1935 apparently never happened. You find this by researching the Wiley College debate records. Some have suggested it was faulty memory, handed down through the years, or possibly confused with a debate against Oxford University. However Wiley College did defeat the National Champions, USC.The story is also significant as a reminder of how the Civil Rights efforts in the 20th Century required brave, educated men and women to stand up for what is right, to bring home the points that just because something is "law" doesn't make it right upon examination in the correct light.Highly recommend for everyone.The DVD also has a superb extra, featuring some of the real men and women who were at Wiley College during those years, including Tolson's own son.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the 1930s Professor Melvin Tolson (Washington) of Wiley College in Texas puts together a crack debating team, but is also involved in organizing a union for the sharecroppers (white and black).Remember those great debating teams of years past, especially the ones from black colleges? What? You don't? You never heard of anything like that? Well, maybe you should see this movie and learn a few things for surely they existed. I did. This is a very impressive film. The pace is good, the dialogue and acting by all is excellent and the story is inspired by true events and we learn more about our history that we never knew existed. There is a good balance among the debating aspect, union organizing and life in general for blacks in the deep south and much of that isn't pretty. Some scenes are hard to watch and sure, you can say, "it's only a movie" but keep in mind that these things did happen and they did happen more often that we care to think of. Just be thankful that these things don't happen today as they occurred in the past. You walk away thinking how can people treat people like that. But, they did. And, it is here that one should question the concept of freedom for all in the United States. I did.Yes, everyone is waiting for the moment Wiley College debates Harvard College and what will happen? Who will win? Regardless of the outcome you will get another shot at cheering at the end of this movie for surely you will cheer. I did.The actors whose names you don't recognize in the movie are up and comers and are very good.Denzel Washington directed this film and did an outstanding job. He did, he did, he really did.Violence: Yes, Sex: No, Nudity: No, Language: No</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>10 stars -1 for the Willie Lynch fraud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrific film! But, there's no excuse for Denzel Washington repeating the Internet-era fraud about a West Indies slaver, Willie Lynch, being the origin of "lynching." (There may have been, however, another expert in terrorizing slaves, hired by Virginia planters to do just that, after the Nat Turner rebellion.) Revolution-era judge Charles Lynch was the source, with another, later Virginian, Willie Lynch, being an impostor claimant. See the film anyway for all the other, little-known-but-true, amazing, genuinely uplifting history.Here's a quick list of good lines: "You're a heathen, Henry," "Who the hell is he? Oh, he's my husband," "I'm going to cut your head off," "Who do you think you are? Jesse Owens?," "I am the Darker Brother," "What's a professor doing in the middle of the night dressed like a cotton chopper?," "Do well tonight, Junior," "Debate is bloodsport! It's combat!," "I love DH Lawrence," "Sit down Mr. Burgess," "Junior, what is the greatest weakness of man?," "What the hell happened to my hog?," "Would you punch yourself in a fight, Mr. Burgess?," "You're a good dancer," "You ain't got s**t! He ain't got s**t!," "I don't know is not an acceptable answer, Junior," "I can't allow my son to be corrupt," "Hell is where you're headed if you question me again," "I think you're afraid to debate white people," "Jesus was a radical," "Ruth, this is a fine party. I think it's time for some sweet potato pie," "Great news! Great news! Great news!," "Are you threatening me, boy?," "That pig wasn't worth twenty-five dollars. You owe my father some money," "There's n*****s in that car!," "He didn't have to do nothing! In Texas they lynch Negroes!," "It's good tea," "You give Boston my regards, you hear?," "Heellloooo Harvard!," "James, this is high tea.

		<shortDescription>a wonderful, inspirational movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the sort of film which really warrants a Best Movie nomination. The Academy likes to consider itself Very Serious though and consequently they select movies that often more dour. That is not a criticism in and of itself-I'm a big fan of movies that are good, regardless of whether they are pessimistic. But this movie is well-made, well directed, a lovely, understated but diverse soundtrack. The acting, by Denzel Whitaker as the young prodigy (who would go on to be the founder of the Congress for Racial Equality (CORE); he is not related to Forrest Whitaker), by Mr. Washington, by the lovely and very very good Jurnee Smollett, and the smoldering, reserved fire from Nate Parker - all three serving as the main debaters of the title, is uniformly very very good. Washington functions at such a high level. It's almost redundant to note how good he is, but the obvious still deserves recognition and such is the case for Mr. Washington. Forrest Whitaker is also understated but typically excellent; Kimberly Elise, as Washington's patient, wise wife, also warrants personal recognition.Washington apparently knows how to get great performances from his actors. He did the same thing in Antwone Fisher and wonderful acting also pervaded that film. His direction is self-assured and confident and the composition of the film is also. I have read too many comments in which folks say the story is pat or banal. I don't think people realize the odds which these characters had to beat in order to accomplish what they did. How many of them had to encounter racial violence on their path to success? How many had to confront the sorts of racial slights that these kids did on a regular basis, on the way to beating a nationally ranked debating opponent, when the national environment was extremely unfriendly to them? I find that those sorts of critiques are extremely cynical and too worldly by half. One cannot criticize or question the strength of character which those folks had to show in the face of huge odds. This is a great film and one that also, coincidentally leaves one feeling good at the end. It's rare that those two characteristics coincide, but their common presence here should have secured the film a Best Film nomination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Martin Luther King, Jr. said "Black Is Beautiful." So is "Gay Pride."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Great Debaters" is all about civil rights and social justice being denied to the black people. Today, we refer to blacks as African Americans. This movie is about the black civil rights leaders as great debaters during their youth in the late 1930's.I wept throughout the entire showing of this movie. I hated what my white people did to the American Negro. I felt dirty and uncomfortable because earlier I was making fun of a telephone representative from the deep south talking with a black accent that I had difficulty understanding. Though I am white, I identified on a gut level with the black characters in this movie because I am gay. The movie churned up feelings deep inside of me that go way back to my youth. Today, gay people are suffering the same kind of civil rights denial that was done -- and still is being done but to a lesser degree -- to African Americans.Remember all the cruel jokes about black civil rights leaders: "What do white washing machines have in common with white southern states? Black agitators." Ha! Ha! This joke is not funny. Neither are the anti-gay jokes being mouthed by bigots today.The African Americans were actually fortunate because they couldn't hide what made them different. There are not that many very light skin African Americans that can pass for being white. Martin Luther King, Jr. consider the fact that a black person cannot hide in a "black closet" a strength rather than a weakness. He convinced his people that "Black is beautiful"! Most of my friends, whom I grew up with, were macho and could hide in the "Gay Closet." Because I never was super macho, everybody knew I must be gay. I was a borderline "Bird Cage" star. This proved to be my strength instead of my weakness. It made me an outspoken advocate for "Gay Pride." Also, I love getting attention. If I cannot get attention playing football, I can with my writing talent and being campy. I will not spoil the end of this movie for you. However, I was joyful and tremendously sad at the same time during the ending of the film. I did not know whether to laugh or cry. I actually stood up in the theater and joyfully cheered the great debaters on. After the movie, I called a Puerto Rican friend to tell him about my emotional roller coaster experience in seeing this outstanding movie. I couldn't talk to him. I wanted to apologize as to how some of my bigoted former friends treated Puerto Ricans as well as the black people. I sobbed out-of-control over the phone. I told him that I am not only crying for the African Americans and Puerto Ricans, but also for the gay people who are now being singled out for prejudice and segregation in Puerto Rico. It seems like the vast majority of the straight people are against gay people as the vastmajority of Americans were against the African Americans. This anti-gay straight majority wants us to remain silent. Disappear in one enormous Puerto Rican anti-gay closet. Martin Luther King, Jr. said "Black Is Beautiful." So is being gay or a Puerto Rican! If you don't agree with me, see the movie "The Great Debaters." It may make you think more about your democracy and to speak up loud and clear for your civil rights!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie has anti-white undertones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie very interesting, but as a white person I found this movie insulting at times. Virtually all of the white characters in the movie are 'bad guys' and are generally characterized as ignorant, mean-spirited and boorish while the blacks are shown as highly intelligent, polished and long-suffering. There is little or no attempt to balance this bias with some major 'good guy' white figures. That's unfair and presumptuous, especially considering that white judges were clearly often the ones giving the victories to the black debaters.Also, sometimes when Miss Booke would speak, she would make outrageous proclamations like saying that blacks were the thread that put our nation together. Sure, they made their contribution like all the other races but to say their the thread is simply hyperbole and just not true. It does nothing to 'bring us together'.But all of this is part of Oprah Winfrey's style now of 'blacks-are-smarter-than-whites' which includes her bully pulpit endorsement of Barack Obama and her constant drumming up of these sorts of issues. How do people like this expect our nation to ever heal from our past racial wounds if it's constantly being dished back into our faces all the time? Mistakes were made in the past, for sure, but let's face on making things better from where they are now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Denzel has defiantly come a long way from Carbon Copy. I thought the actors did a really good job in this film although I was not really convinced with Denzel Whitaker's final scene in the debate. He did really well for most of the movie, as a smart 14 year old in love, but I think he kinda fell apart in the debating department. That being said, apart from the predictable ending, I did not think I wasted my time watching this movie. It showed a lot of heart and I walked away with a bit more understanding of the struggle of Black people in the south at the time. Could have been better, a bit less predictable, and more accurate but all in all a good film. I do not understand why this has such a high rating and doubt I would want to watch it again, but as another reviewer said, It seemed like a great made for TV movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Great Debaters is far more than the title promises</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is in balance as well as any movie I can remember. It moves on so many levels with none of them becoming too much or overpowering any of the rest. It presents a completed portrait of multiple characters.As much as I enjoy Denzel Washington in almost every role he has played, he still has certain acting style artifacts that appear in every character. The same is true here. But in this role, Washington seems to have walked right into the skin of Melvin B. Tolson and he fits in it like a coat of paint. He is inspirational as a teacher, debate coach, motivator of his students and as human being.At the same time, it is hard to believe that in East Texas of 1935, a black man could have successfully spoken so boldly without some serious ramification. One is tempted to think that Toleson would have met a fate similar to that Wilson met. The movie depicts and points the viewer to what was once prevalent practice.The movie is about excellence. It is about excelling, learning to believe in yourself and those on your team. The movies is also about racism. It is about simple "Whites Only" signs all the way to the most horrific racist acts ever committed. The movie is also about perseverance, tenacity, and the commitment to overcome hate, fear and ignorance. The movie is about family love - both immediate family and the family that forms around common goals and drives.The performances of the other cast member were on par with very little weaknesses. Forest Whitaker delivered the best performance in the sense that I rarely thought of anyone other than the character he was playing. Like just very few actors, Whitaker is able to do this. I have one complaint with the script and screenwriters. Is it not possible to communicate deep feeling of love, passion, and commitment without a bedroom/sex scene? This movie and its story is not moved forward one iota with the inclusion of this even though it was handled in as tasteful manner as possible. The fact that the star of this movie and the director were the same (Washington) is perhaps the reason the movie weaves all its threads into a triumphant story with such perfect balance, I give this movie a 9/10, something I rarely do. If this movie were fine wine, it would be scored 98.</fullReview>

And I'm so glad I went.I have to admit, it is a bit intense, but phenomenal. It started out with a bang and ended with a tear-jerking rise of the underdogs. Plus it had Denzel Washington AND Forest Whitaker - two of my favorite actors of our time. Washington brings light to every role he has and I was moved by Whitaker in "The Last King of Scotland". With a couple newcomers to the big screen such as Jurnee Smollett, Nate Parker, and the adorable Denzel Whitaker. All had great performances, including "L'il Whitaker" who's only 17.All in all, if you ever get the experience to see this, you MUST see it. Kudos to all who worked on this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie last evening. I was expecting a dry, boring cliché filled movie about rich kids with too much time on their hands. This was an awesome production showing how to trust in God, "You do what you have to do, so you can do what you want to do." The acting by Forest Whitaker was superb. It is not easy for a man to humble himself in front of his family. The action was just enough to keep you excited with history mixed in, in such a way to fool you in to actually learning something when you thought you were just going to be entertained. Wonderful mix of theology and secular world events. I whole heartedly recommend this film especially to middle school students who need to see the vast possibilities as they go through school. I will absolutely purchase this film, and place in my library next to Malcolm X, Martin Luther King and Professor Cornel West.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Win for Denzel Washington</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denzel Washington continues to prove that he can NOT make a bad film. "The Great Debaters" is the latest in his series of Oscar-worthy performances. The man has an uncanny ability to convey everything a scene calls for with a slight change of expression or inflection. His performances are so smooth, so utterly believable that it's simply a pleasure to watch him practice his craft.The rest of the cast in this ensemble piece also turn in outstanding efforts. The characters are so finely drawn that you believe in them. You want things to turn out well for them. You *invest* in them.Well photographed and with excellent locations, sets, and costuming, you never fall out of this movie. It pulls you right along. The only minor quibble I have with the whole effort is how Denzel Washington's character manages to show up for the final debate, since a few lines of dialogue a bit earlier established that he couldn't make the trip. This is never explained in the film. But when something that minor is the only flaw you can find, you know you've got a good flick on your hands.Best picture, best actor, and possibly best director nods at Oscar time would be well deserved for this movie.</fullReview>

Cinematography was good. The movie was way better than I thought it would be, the movie also did not come across as the evil white people type of movie, yet it did not shy away from the reality of the times, it was really balanced, Denzel really did capture the atmosphere very well, the movie was not really so much about debating like I thought it was going to be, there was debating but there still was a whole lot of sub-plot going on, the relationship between the debaters, the relationship between melvin tolson and his students(with regards to his extra curricular activities, with the local farmers and an alleged communism).My qualms with the movie was most of the debate topics was structured in the clichéd way were the wiley college debate team's winning points against the white teams gets to be a big hulabaloo on racism, it's also a good thing because this makes this movie way different than the other movies of it's kind as the fight against racism was done through the debate topics, instead of having it in every damn scene, it was rather subtle .There was this one scene which I found cringe worthy, right before they debated howard, they recited their coach's motto, about who is the Judge, and who is their opponent, it was supposed to come of as emotional, or quasi-emotional but it cam off as forced and cliché. Forest whitaker was pretty good with what he was given to work with, the girl jurnee smolett was also pretty good, denzel was good but it was just a normal performance him. At best i see them getting some ensemble nods. I'll rate it a 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Great Debaters Named Best Inspiring Film of the Year by Reel Inspiration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Great Debaters is easily the the most inspiring, empowering movie of the year. In fact, I chose it as the number one movie on my "Best Films" list on the Reel Inspiration blog at Blogspot.The Great Debaters, directed by Denzel Washington and produced by Oprah, is Hollywood all the way. It is an empowering underdog tale inspired by the true story of how the debating team from the small African American institution of Wiley College won the 1935 National Debating Championship. Outstanding performances by Denzel Washington and Forest Whitaker make the picture.After a hectic montage to introduce the setting, we're in the classroom studying revolutionary ideas from the writers of the Harlem Renaissance with Professor Tolson. Denzel's passionate delivery is reminiscent of Robin William's in "Dead Poets Society. I suspect that Professor Tolson was much more interesting, controversial, and radical than the man presented here. However, it is so moving to hear these important ideas spoken by a African American teacher to African American students at a time when there was still lynching in their part of the country.The film doesn't back down from the racism of the time. In fact, its an ongoing theme. The film asks if the power of words can really make any difference in the face of violent acts of racism.Through his example, Professor Tolson inspires his students to speak up for what is right despite how it might conflict with their personal lives or the dangerous world around them. Debate all you want about it, but don't miss this important story.Jana Segal Reel Inspiration</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's 1935 and some students make their way on the debate team of a black college (from Texas) ran by a professor played very well by Denzel Washington. The story starts slowly with a few debates with other schools and a few side stories make for the full momentum in the end where they get to debate the masters of the universe, Harvard.The movie itself is pretty decent and overall masterfully acted (Forest Whitaker is really astonishing) but it really lacs that something to stand out the huge ocean of mediocre movies. In the end I was left with nothing but my head stuck on all the details that were made so badly. I'm not going to go deep here but let me just say that I almost cried when the debater from Harvard said that they had "rescued Europe from German slavery" even if the II world war wasn't even fought yet; and he mentioned Hitler who, well, hadn't gone mad yet since he had ruled only for 2 years (if you are thinking that "2 years is enough" it isn't since his mad actions began in the summer of 1938). I would have been able to give this movie a 7 or even a 8 since I'm in love with Forest Whitaker but that bullshit out of a Harvard debater made me change my opinion.ps. I don't even mind the fact that the story isn't even close from being true but when you twist the truth like that you shouldn't say it is true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Familiar Motif, Inspiring Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll begin with my only critique of this film: that the motif was a bit too familiar, bordering on the cliché'. If you can bring to mind any of the frequently produced against-all-odds sports movies, you will have a good idea what this film is about. While centering around a college debate team instead of a sports team, it shares a common theme with movies like "The Mighty Ducks," "Remember The Titans," and "Glory Road": A group of initial strangers bind together for a common purpose. Battling internal and external conflict, they are inspired by a renegade coach and garner the respect of many previously antagonistic personalities. After one final unexpected, and seemingly insurmountable obstacle, they take on a championship- caliber foe and pull the upset.While the arc of the film is dictated by this overdone motif, "The Great Debaters" does turn in a moving depiction of the early civil rights movement in the south and some very good performances. Denzel Washington acts as you would expect him too--convincing, but also not a performance for which he will be remembered. In my opinion, the "other" Denzel gives the most surprising performance as James Farmer Jr., the youngest yet most studious member of the debate team. He slowly becomes the glue, and eventually the true hero, of the underdog Wiley College team. Forest Whitaker, Junior's father in the film (but not in real life!), also does an exceptional job as Dr. James Farmer, an upstanding professor of theology and pillar of the African-American community in Marshall, Texas. The developing friendship between him and Tolson, and his tangible respect for his son are two of the more enjoyable developments to watch in this film. While "The Great Debaters" is mostly predictable in its overarching plot, it is a film that is insightful, inspirational, and certainly worth seeing. Seeing the performances of the junior and senior Whitakers alone makes it worthwhile. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the "must see" movies of all times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some films that must be seen, and shared with others to get the most out of the experience. Exodus (1960) and To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), are a couple of those films, as is Doctor Zhivago (1965), and Schindler's List (1993). Each story depicts events in the life of humanity (for better or worse) and they all show the struggles of people against circumstances into which they have been thrown.This movie isn't just about entertainment -- although it is that too. More than just entertainment, it's education at its finest. The Great Debaters is one of those movies that needs to be seen. Parents need to take their children, churches need to take their youth groups. And then, when they get home, they need to talk about what they see in the movie.I debated in high school (for three years), in the Los Angeles Public School System in the early 1960's. My granddaughter is in high school now and is interested in debating. So, we went to see the movie with the rest of the family. It was a wonderful experience.History is one of my passions, and seeing the history (albeit heartbreaking at times) portrayed in the film was educational for me and my family. Sometimes I think we've gotten past a lot of what was reflected in the film about the Jim Crow laws of the southern states in 1935. But then again, I'm not convinced we've not just pushed it into the background of our American culture.Young people, and those of us from areas of the country where persons of color were not subject to the prejudice displayed in the film, need to see this movie to understand how far we've come (even if we have not yet arrived at where we ought to be).To study the background of the film is even more enlightening. The final debate was (according to a recent History Channel special) against the University of Southern California (USC) the reigning champions of the day. We used to hold some of our high school debates on the USC campus. The film mentions that Wiley College (a Methodist related institution in Texas) debated Oklahoma City University (a Methodist related institution in Oklahoma -- and my alma mater).The acting is first rate -- but oh, how it must have hurt the psyche of the actors to have to reenact the life of struggle that persons of color experienced in the south. The interpersonal struggles between the students is well played as is the relationship between at least one of the students and his parents. But also, the struggle of the oppressed (both white and black) in the midst of the depression in southeast Texas is brought home in a background story that plays right along with the debate team's story (and which has its own implications for the team).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is outstanding,so real and truly inspiring. Believe me no matter who you are this movie will move you and certainly transform you.Definitely one of the years best movies,an excellent performance from all the actors.Indeed a wonderful masterpiece.This movie made all i had learned in school come alive, yes all those heartbreaking painful memories of Jim crow in the south.I cried then and even now as i watched the movie. My tears were not only for the painful dark moments but for the affirmation that excellence is undoubtedly without question colorblind. Brilliant directorship from Denzel Washington and as always Forest Whitaker and Kimberly Elise no matter how small their parts prove what it means to be a great actor this is one movie not to miss and one that will forever be timeless.Definitely Oscar material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People complain that movies like this are made too much. I say these types of movies cannot be made enough. I believe this is the type of movie that can change a person's life. Whether you see bits of yourself in the characters or just see what the people overcome, this type of movie can inspire you to do something in your own life. It also gives you even more insight of what people were dealing with before us. I highly recommend this movie to anybody. I can't think of a person that wouldn't want to see this movie. Unless you are the type that doesn't enjoy inspiring, inspiration movies that are based on a true story...which should be nobody</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get up off the couch and see this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will admit that I was hesitant to see this film upon discovering its production under Harpo films after the poor quality of their adaptation of Zora Neal Thurston's novel. I was expecting this movie to fall along the lines of The Dead Poet Society or The Emporer's Club, but neither of these films overwhelmed me in such a manner as this one. I cannot express into words the power this film held over me as to render me speechless. The cast was beyond superb, glorious. Denzel Washington's necessity for perfection transformed this true-story adaptation into a piece that will be responsible for conversations all over the nation, at dinner tables, in workplaces, classrooms, and in the hearts of all Americans. Each pondering the magnitude of the actions of men and women such as these who sacrificed all through their actions and examples for the freedoms we enjoy today. This film leaves nothing to be desired and will only uplift and inspire those who are fortunate enough to partake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You've gotta give it to Denzel Washington. This is brilliant, understated, stunningly efficient film making that invites the audience to fill in some heartfelt emotional arcs and provide its own mind-images of the horrific violence that punctuates but never overtakes the film.Everybody in the credits -- from screenplay to cinematography to costumers and set designers to actors -- deserves the highest accolades.But Denzel Washington's hands, especially as the director, are all over this project. Whoever brought it to him initially, Washington committed to it completely, and managed to convince Oprah Winfrey and the Weinsteins to make it happen.There is no more collaborative art than film.But all collaborations need a Leader. Denzel Washington, with "The Great Debaters," moves beyond being one of our finest actors to one of our finest directors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why I'm Proud of This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Date, I have seen this movie, four times; I don't know how many more times I will see it. I do not buy bootleg tapes; when this comes on DVD; I shall most definitely purchase it.It gives me a sense of pride and well being, you see, I've always known we are a lot more then how we are depicted on television and in the movies.All races need to get over judging people by the color of their skin; I would be willing to bet there wouldn't be so much crime. I loved the respect that was shown, being addressed as Mr. or Miss. I don't see the respect much nowadays. I'm 67, years old and I still address my elders as Mr. or Mrs. unless told otherwise. This movie should be seen by all races. One thing for certain is my people pray. I remember the man (Katrina) whose wife told him to save their children, she drowned, he said " God is Good". He just lost his wife of numerous years, but he saved his children and he thanked "God" for that We know if it doesn't kill you; it will make you strong; I'm getting stronger every second. In the film while waiting for the decision; the students are bowed and praying; James Farmer's family, held hands and were praying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie, Great Director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the privilege to be a part of this movie . ( Sheriff Deputy -The Barn Scene - Supporter in the Oklahoma Scene). I was very impressed with all the professionals in the film. Denzel Washington is a not only a fantastic director .but was a real pleasure to work around. He always thought of the the comfort and well being of the principle actors and background actors . I look forward to seeing it myself. This will prove to be a must see film !I also had the pleasure of meeting John Heard and Ritchie Montgomery . Although it was around 3 or 4 in the morning , they were remarkably nice people.</fullReview>
