		<shortDescription>The quintessential action movie. One of my favorite films of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Predator is the classic action film. What makes it so unique is that the story starts off as a simple but exhilarating rescue mission; but then it suddenly switches gears and becomes a fight for survival for everyone involved. The genius of that! The cast is wonderful; Arnold as Dutch was very convincing and commanding, yet humbled and low-key in his performance. The only way you would know that he's the star is that his face is on the cover, he's the leader of the group, and he survives at the end. He was 'one of the crew' instead of a one-man wrecking machine like in so many of his other films; that was very nice to see. Carl Weathers turns in a good performance as Dillon, as does Bill Duke as Mac, Jesse Ventura as Blain and Sonny Landham as Billy. The whole cast worked very well together. The one thing that still astonishes me to this day, 16 years later, is indeed the Predator. The special effects in this film was very much ahead of its time, the camouflage was pure genius. I still can't believe my eyes when I see the camouflage effects; it blows me away that even now in 2003 it could sit alongside the FX seen in TODAY'S films with no shame. I'm waiting for Fox to put out a special edition DVD with behind the scenes footage explaining how the Predator was done; from the effects with its sight and the beautiful camouflage, to the suit. I caught a little snippet of a behind the scenes feature on AMC or Bravo, and ever since I've been anticipating its inclusion on a new DVD (WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?!??!) Predator is evidence of how action films should be done. A great story and relentless action, all progressing the story along. A timeless classic, one of the best films of all time.**** out of **** starsP.S. The 'forest massacre' scene is one of the funniest scenes in movie history!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent Schwarzenegger classic that still attracts viewers and keeps people thrilled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Predator is definitely one of the best alien thrillers ever made. It is one of my personal favorite movies. When I first saw just a brief part of Predator when I was about five, I was freaked out and scared to even watch the movie for many ages, but eventually, once getting older, came to like it. The Predator, played by Kevin Peter Hall, is a very realistic and believable creature for the 1980s, when this movie was created. I like how humanlike its form is, and how un-humanlike it is at the same time. The creature's four mandibles were a great idea for its distinct facial characteristics and the creature's roar is awesome, one of the best ever produced. This movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Jesse Ventura, Richard Chaves, Elipidi Carillo, Shane Black, and Sonny Landham and they are all believable in their roles and even add to the humor that this movie has. This is obviously the best of the Predator movies and still one of the most highly liked thrillers today. And let's all show respect for Kevin Peter Hall, who died a year after he had made Predator 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the release of Alien Vs Predator i decided to watch the original Predator movie today. I've seen Predator many many times since i first watched it back in 1989 and i love it each and every time. I think Predator 2 has a slight edge over this but Predator has a slight edge over Aliens BUT i think they are all extremely excellent films.Just in case you don't know, it's about a big alien whose race lives to hunt worthy prey and Arnold Schwarzenegger's team of commandos are that such prey. The commandos are sent into a South American jungle to find some missing airmen who are being held by guerrilla's. They do what they got to do which attracts the attention of the predator who is hunting in the area. So the predator goes and hunts the commandos with the aid of his kick ass weapons and cloaking device. The commandos also have a female prisoner.I think the whole sub-plot about the so called missing airmen isn't too important to the viewer but makes it possible for the commandos to be there. The entire concept of Predator is really clever and it certainly made me sit on the edge of my seat while watching it the first time. It is kind of spooky in a terrifying way as we don't see the predator properly for ages but see through his eyes which adds to the tension.The effects are great, the acting is OK and the story is cool too. I really like the music and especially the spooky twisted jungle sounds that we hear when we see through the eyes of the predator. This is a sci-fi action movie that isn't just full of cheap explosions. It really does have great atmosphere. Everyone who likes sci-fi and/or action movies should like this. If you don't then your taste in movies suck! This in my humble opinion is probably the second best sci-fi movie of all time.Alien Vs Predator has little of what made this so excellent so if you haven't seen Predator and thought AVP sucked don't think that this will. Predator is absolutely fantastic viewing. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adventurous Sci-Fi Thriller masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>McTiernan's Predator released in 1987 and has stood the test of time as a Sci-Fi classic. A fitting and elaborate cast (Arnold, Carl Weathers, etc.) help viewers come to grips with the environment of the movie. Silvestri's soundtrack kicks in with excellent timing as do the sound effects which remain crisp and heart-stopping. The cinematography is good and the action scenes are smooth, realistic and fun to watch.The characters are commandos targeting renegade forces in Central America to rescue a diplomatic hostage. Watching them transcend from macho-man confidence to panicky prey-like paranoia creates a perfect atmosphere for the film, which plays off your imagination until the climax where Dutch, played by Arnold, relies on wit and instinctual strengths to combat the terror at any cost. The effects are impressive and are excitingly original, especially with the creation of such a sophisticated beast as the Predator.Perhaps what makes the film have a such a raw, earthly quality is its relation to settings of man vs. nature in the modern world. Facing something infinitely more powerful than man is what the story comes down to; perhaps even man can conquer the unknown if he remains true to his natural powers than his ammunition. Survival suspense of the purest kind. Predator deserves higher ratings. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to the jungle, baby?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Consider that so many of the roles that Arnold Schwarzenegger takes on are so similar, including Predator, and yet this film is so much better than most of the others. I enjoy watching his movies just because he's such a watch-able guy, even in his bad movies (which are many), but I think the thing that really makes Predator stand out is its simplicity. The movie starts, the guys get dropped in the jungle, lots of blood and carnage flies across the screen, and the movie simply ends. No romance, no complex back story, no soldier struggling with problems in his past or even trauma caused by the horrible things he experiences during the movie. This is one of the things that made First Blood so good. It may turn out to be a movie about a lot of muscle-bound meatheads in the woods, but it doesn't insult the audience or try to apply complexity to a story that can't support it.Interestingly, the movie features two eventual governors. Jesse Ventura even wrote a book which was released while he was the governor of Minnesota and he used his favorite line in this movie as the title. And the book's actually pretty interesting; there are some funny stories in it about things that went on while they were filming this movie. Arnold, on the other hand, is actually (and thankfully) given a relatively small amount of stupid one-liners, which are an idiotic byproduct of hard action movies that I've never really understood the necessity for. They don't reveal anything about the characters who say them, they don't add to the story or further the plot, and with rare exceptions, they're not funny. But I guess comic relief has to come from somewhere, and since complexity is not a requisite for movies like this, I can't really expect a lot of thought being put into the comedic content either.I watched Predator having never seen it from beginning to end and having just re-watched the original Alien. I am currently in the process of re-watching both series', for obvious reasons. One thing that I notice about both of them is the way they take their time in introducing the enemies which, in both films, are aliens. Predator doesn't waste much time dwelling on the origin of the alien, we pretty much assume it came from a space ship that flashed across the screen at the opening of the movie. Alien, on the other hand, went into remarkable detail about where its alien came from. What Predator does do, very effectively, I think, is that it has the guys fighting some very human enemies, which allows the movie to later take its sweet time in having them realize that the new enemy is not human at all. This is also, incidentally, weakly rehashed in the sequel, using the secrecy of this mission and team as an excuse to have more guys who don't know what's going on.The death scenes are actually pretty tasteful, given the genre. They are just gory enough to illustrate the violence of the enemy without being gratuitous. Just enough is shown to show how vicious the alien is, and there are some strange things done to and with the bodies that make you wonder about the alien's intentions or needs. The first deaths suggest vengeance if not some sort of ritual, but later ones suggest that the alien may be feeding off of his (or her) victims. Oddly enough, it is not until the awful Predator 2 that we learn that it kills for sport.Yes, the movie occasionally gets embarrassingly macho, but the skill with which it is put together far overshadows any tough-guy goofiness. Consider, for example, the ease with which the movie switches from showing the guys hunting the alien to their realization that they are the ones being hunted. In some cases, this transition takes place during a single shot and with virtually no movement in the shot at all except a change in someone's expression. It is truly a fight between a group of predators, which we understand because they are human like us, and a single predator whose powers and weaknesses are unknown. It's not Oscar material, needless to say, but it's a great action movie in part because it already knows that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very, very tense and murderously suspenseful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, if you haven't seen this action, suspense and violence extravaganza, you most certainly are not a true action movie afficionado. The immediate grabbing feature of this movie is its score, very imaginatively composed and created by Alan Silvestri whose other credits include the Back to the Future series and other gems like Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The tempo and build up which the score lends to the film engage its viewers with feelings of fear and nerve wracking suspense for what lurks within the thick of the forest. Take note of Sonny Landham's comment;"there's something out there,and it ain't no man.The action is fast, furious and merciless. The commandos are killed off one by one, leaving Arnie, Carl Weathers and the surviving members extremely terrified and on the verge of breaking down. Note the heated arguments that some of the commandos get into with each other. There is very animated and fiery action in the beginning (assault on the terrorist camp) but as we are introduced to the true terror of the jungle (or should I say, outer space), the action takes a turn for the more insane eg.Arnie running away armed only with a knife and trembling in fear, almost drowning in a waterfall and thereafter, continually pursued by the Predator). All this followed by a half hour long jungle battle mano a mano with spears, rocks and fists and hall deafening yells by both warriors. Very, very fierce and macho stuff I assure you all.I shall not go into the other intricacies of the film and will leave it to the curiosity of potential/virgin viewers to find out for themselves. "Predator" is essentially one of the few action movies that truly lives up to its name and delivers the thrills and spills in no small amount and at breakneck speed. True connoisseurs of hard action.....YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!! 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arnie is at his best in this sci-fi classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film will always have special place for me, as aside from being one of the best horror/sci-fi films of the eighties; it's also a huge childhood favourite of mine. Despite the fact that I've seen it dozens of times as a kid, I have only seen it once during adulthood; and that single viewing was more than enough to remind me what it is that I love about this film! Predator works as a macho action film, gory horror and intriguing sci-fi, and despite it's short running time of just 100 minutes, it somehow manages to find room for all three. The fact that it stars action icon Arnold Schwarzenegger ensures that the film will always be favourably remembered. He's not a good actor, but Arnie always manages to bring that extra something to his movies. The plot is deliciously simple and follows a group of commandos that go off into the jungle on a secret mission. However, things go awry when it turns out that they aren't the only ones with weapons there. Finding the skinned bodies of the last group of men that entered the jungle is about to become the least of their worries...The jungle makes for a great setting for an action sci-fi flick such as this. These sorts of films tend to be set in space, so seeing the action down here on earth is different; and the fact that it's set in the jungle, with it's dense foliage, ensures that Die Hard-director John McTiernan is able to bump up the suspense, as just like in the Vietnam war; the soldiers are dealing with an unknown enemy. The atmosphere really is excellent, and the special effects help to create a futuristic tone, while the suspense builds and makes sure that the audience are on the edge of their seats at all times. Predator was released hot on the heels of the success of James Cameron's amazing 'Aliens' - but don't be thinking this film is merely a rip off following a trend, Predator has more than enough up it's sleeve to ensure that isn't the case. The action is great, and director McTiernan clearly knows what he's doing. It's fast and furious, and the amount of weapons on display ensures that the film is sure to delight fans of macho action films. The fact that the lead actor is a monster of a man doesn't exactly hurt the film either! Now, Arnold Schwarzenegger may well be a terrible actor; but it doesn't matter because it's his screen presence, not his acting ability, that makes his performances what they are. At times he's cringe-worthy, but it's hard to deny his prowess when it comes to the action sequences, and that is all a film of this nature needs. Arnie isn't the only big man in the film either, as an assortment of muscle men, including ex-wrestler Jesse Ventura, and Carl Weathers; Rocky's Apollo Creed, among other B-movie actors, join him. The man himself also finds himself a very worthy ally, in the form of the movie's central alien. The Predator may not be as beautiful as the creature from 'Alien', but it's just as inventive. Here we have an extra terrestrial that isn't merely trying to breed, or to 'phone home' - but one that is actually there to hunt humans for sport! Aside from being ingenious, the idea also borders on frightening. The gore here is gratuitous, but never goes over the top and on the whole, Predator is a film that never really got the credit it deserves. It's mindless fun - but its damn good mindless fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the classic sci-fi movies and one of the most entertaining action movies ever made. Certainly one of the best Arnold movies, along with Terminator 1 and 2. Mix a simple but effective story, one cool alien, well directed action scenes, Arnold kicking ass and you get an top notch action movie. Sure, there are some exaggerated macho performances, but John knows how to do it with style.So if you're a young (but not too young) movie viewer who haven't yet seen Predator, be sure to do so to get a sample of action 80's style with Arnold at his peak.Rating: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lean, Mean Action With Arnold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching `Predator', which is one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best action movies, it becomes obvious why Arnold's recent return to action (`End of Days', `The Sixth Day) have all tanked at the box office. For some reason, Arnold's chosen to play men with a dark past in his recent films, men with a complex background . . . men with laughably bad backstories. His great characters - such as Dutch Schaeffer in `Predator' - have no background. It's not necessary. The second Arnold steps onscreen, you know it's time for blood and bullets, plain and simple. Not every moviegoers' cup of tea, to be sure, but it works. Unlike `End of Days' or `The Sixth Day', classic Schwarzenegger action films like `Predator' never insult the audience by attempting to explain the often threadbare plot. Predator is kind of a Zen-philosophy action film - the violence and cheesy one-liners just happen.`Predator' is a fairly simple story; it's essentially a sci-fi version of `The Most Dangerous Game.' A group of American soldiers, led by Dutch (Schwarzenegger) and his rival Dillon (Carl Weathers), lead a full-blown assault on a group of South American revolutionaries. Carnage ensues. After wiping out said revolutionaries, an alien creature armed to the teeth with high-powered weaponry - the Predator - assaults the American soldiers. More carnage ensues.Hey, it's not exactly Shakespeare, but thoughtful, well-written action movies aren't exactly common. `Predator' works as an action movie - and as a darn good one - because it's kept simple (thus minimizing the plot holes and the head-scratching moments), it maintains a high level of excitement, action, and tension, and it's cool. Schwarzenegger is larger than life as Dutch, pure swaggering testosterone at its best. Jesse `The Body' rules as Blaine, Carl Weathers is icily cool as Dillon. . . and so on and so on. Enough sarcastic, macho one-liners and brutal firepower fill the movie to make it a male adolescent snapshot of tough-guy heaven. The Predator looks wicked as well - Stan Winston outdid himself, as the Predator does look and move like a vicious being from another world, and not just some stunt guy in a rubber suit. The direction by John McTiernan adds the final piece to the puzzle; the cinematography of the jungle is appropriately hot, steamy, and claustrophobic, and the quick pacing of the film moves rapid fire between all-out action and the tension of hunting one's prey . . . or being hunted. Everything adds up to a simple, streamlined, first-rate action movie.Again, not the most intelligent film ever made, but `Predator' is still quite good - it's probably Schwarzenegger's best pure action movie. (Not his best movie overall, though; that honor belongs to the excellent `Kindergarten Cop'.) `Predator' is a lean, mean, intense action flick from start to finish. Grade: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Predator" is a genuine Classic. Action, Horror, Sci-Fi it's all there. Lets see for starters we have Arnold Schwarzenegger, on top form riding to the peak of his action status, leading a team of tough Commandos. Made up of a great cast including Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura and Bill Duke. They're on a mission to rescue Hostages from Gorilla forces but are double crossed by the C.I.A, stop there and you already have a great action movie.But oh no, this film also has an Intergalactic Alien Big Game hunter equipped with plasma cannons, Stealth Invisibility and Thermal Vision. It would be so easy to imagine this film going nowhere if it where to have fallen into the wrong hands. You could really imagine a plot of an Alien hunting Commandos in the jungle coming off a bit lame but no, Fox thankfully had faith and McTierman had a vision. Fox's faith may have been down to there two previous unexpected big hits "Aliens" and "Commando" which you could possibly say this film is a hybrid of.Film also benefits from being made in that 80s early 90s era where your action film could take its self seriously yet still not too seriously. One minute we see a fairly realistic use of of weapons and tactics the next Arnie throws a truck down a hill equipped with C4 and Jesse Ventura pulls out his M-134 Mini Gun and shreds some Gorillas.The Predator it's self is a classic design, thanks to the genius Stan Winston, and in my opinion never looked better than in this movie. It looked slightly fake in Pred 2(Not a bad film too) and don't get me started on the travesty that is AvP. It could have been a different story if they had stuck to the big rubber turtle they had shot scenes with thank god Arnold himself suggested Winston.I won't spoil the plot for anyone who's not yet seen it I just urge you to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A B-movie creature feature given the A treatment by a great action director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A team of commandos are sent into a central American jungle to extradite US airmen that are being held by terrorists. During the rescue attempt the airmen and the terrorists are killed and the commandos being to return to their pickup location. However as they travel back across the jungle they are picked off one by one by an unseen assassin. With his teams' numbers dwindling, Dutch decides to take a stand.This ranks as one of Schwarzenegger's best films, mainly because he doesn't ham up the one-liners etc and just plays it straight. The story is pretty straight forward. Once the issue of the airmen rescue is forgotten it is a straight hunt or be hunted affair. The film manages to create a great sense of tension by not revealing the predator until near the end, this means we, like the commandos, are not quite sure what's doing the hunting. If the tension was so good then this could have been a slasher style film with each character being bumped off in a series of gory ways. However McTiernan makes sure that it never feels that basic.The action is good throughout. But the film benefits from a strong male cast - not great actors but they all fit the parts well. Schwarzenegger isn't wearing his star power on his sleeve like he does in other films and is good here. The rest of the cast are filled out by what could be kindly described as B list stars (except maybe Bill Duke), but Carl Weathers and ex-wrestler Jesse Ventura do well.Overall this is a B movie creature feature, but it's carried out with such style and aplomb that it's hugely enjoyable throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really cool action with unforgettable characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1987, Arnold Schwarzenegger was solidifying his position as an action superstar with the releases of the epic Conan, the influential Terminator and the somewhat mediocre Commando that was still fun to watch anyway. However, that position wouldn't be fully cemented until the arrival of Terminator 2 in 1991 which forever raised the bar for the action genre. But plain and simple, "Predator" is a staple for Schwarzenegger's profile. It introduced the ultra cool "Predator" to the world and changed the popular culture's perspectives on alien movies. But the movie itself isn't just known for the central character, like the crappy Friday the 13th movies that are only known for the murderous Jason Voorhees and his stupid hockey mask. But "Predator" is known for the movie as a whole, with a great simplistic plot, awesome characters and great action that will make people want to see this again and again.The movie is a about a former soldier/mercenary named Dutch (Arnie) who has been involved in a lot of conflict and has since decided to settle down and be the leader of a rescue team. He goes to a South American country to participate in a mission that would supposedly rescue a Cabinet Minister and a few other hostages, but later on he finds out that he's been set up and it was actually a mission to destroy a rebel base that would've invaded sooner or later. And Dutch gets ticked off and he and his team try to escape the jungle, but they're then being pursued by an alien who "hunts" rather than kills. As the situation escalates, Dutch starts to lose his sanity and that's totally evident in the final showdown with the creature.Like James Cameron's "Aliens" that came out the year before, "Predator" is shaped by it's excellent characters, Dutch is the great, silent leader who is somewhat broken inside from all the combat that he went through in the past and his quote "If it bleeds, we can kill it" is among the greatest. Blain is the totally cool tobacco-chewing, mini-gun-totting guy who spewed out 2 of the movie's best lines: "I ain't got time to bleed", and "This stuff'll make you a goddamn sexual tyrannosaurus, just like me". Mac is pretty much Blain's best bud and frequently shaves with his razor and without the shaving cream to show his manliness. Hawkins is the super-nerd of the group who reads comic books and occasionally makes some sick jokes about his girlfriend. Billy is the silent, no-nonsense spiritual dude. Dillon is the dirty CIA agent who was best pals with Dutch a few years back and then sets up Dutch and his team, which leads to their demise and his, as well. And finally, Poncho is the sympathetic, yet sarcastic soldier who connects with Anna, their hostage, during the course of the film. And these guys are great characters; and they each have their own personalities, which makes you want to see more out of each guy.And of course, I can't forget about the "Predator". The high-tech alien that hunts other creatures for sport was a very creative and original idea. It also held a very intimidating presence and the special effects were very well done, especially the camouflage. And I'm still wondering how that managed to do that in 1987.And last, but not the least, the action really stands out thanks to the direction of John McTiernan, who directed this right before he made "Die Hard". The scene when the team attacks the rebel camp is, without a doubt one of the best in cinema, since it shows each team member providing something in the attack, and it's not just one guy who acts like a one-man army and destroys everything in his path all by himself. Also, Dutch's confrontation with the predator at the end, which displays more prehistoric styles of combat with the setting of the boulder and spike traps. And this movie makes up the modern warfare action and the caveman action so well.Any action/sci-fi junkie should watch this, and they will be HOOKED. And you will want to see this again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Action Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in a time when the term "popcorn movies" actually meant something, Predator stands out especially today, mostly due to its high quality writting and top notch action. This movie never gets boring, as we watch the characters interact with each other, it brings to mind the feeling I got when watching the Marines from Aliens; a great feeling of comradary and gruff friendship. The special effects, while dated, in my humble opinion look better then the snazzy "futuristic" effects we are seeing today. The Govenator is perfect for the lead role in this film, he commands a certain respect both from the characters and audience alike.The title character of the film is still cool and frightening by todays standards. The filmakers knew how to use the Predator makeup, they shadow it in as much darkness as possible, cover it in mudd and grime, which hides what could have been very obvious makeup "guy in a suit" effects. The guy who plays Predator did everything he could to add some life to the creature, to make people think he could stand up against Arnold in the end. Its really alot of fun to watch the Predator hunt these hapless soldiers, when just a while ago they were kicking ass everywhere they went.As we watch the downfall of summer "popcorn" movies, its good to know we can still go back and watch something great like this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, underrated action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some will tell you "Predator" is another dumb '80s action flick. It's not. It's very different from anything else Arnold Schwarzenegger has starred in. First of all it begins as a standard Military war film, setting up the plot for about 45 minutes! It then morphs into a suspense-thriller/sci-fi film: Like some sort of Agatha Christie novel meeting "Rambo" via "Aliens." It's quite intelligent and thrilling, not revealing the Predator creature fully until the very end. Part of the reason this film works, and the sequel does not (as successfully anyway), is the level of suspense and mystery surrounding the Predator.Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers one of his best performances as Dutch. Granted, he isn't required to do much more than shed his upper-body clothing and look ripped, but he _does_ do more than that - I felt sympathy for Dutch, he seemed like a realistic character, and I forgot that I was watching Arnold Schwarzenegger. He has a few good one-liners ("Stick around!" being the cream of the crop along with "Knock knock!") but especially later in the film, his confidence stumbles and he turns into the flip-side of the typical Arnold Schwarzenegger action hero.The sequel worked as a comic-book-style creature feature but the original "Predator" is a much better film than most people give it credit for, being the rare smart action film that is solidly constructed and worth watching far more than just once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid, well-executed action film that continues to impress</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Possible spoilers*"Predator" is arguably the best of the '80s/early '90s action bonanzas. Well-conceived, psychologically taut, visually vibrant and deeply entertaining, it has aged remarkably well. The direction, screenplay, special effects, and general production values of "Predator" are just as muscular and confident as its cast. Even when the movie slips into excess (which it frequently does, with gratuitous flexing, absurdly over-the-top firefights, and unabashed macho banter), it does so with such a boisterous swagger that you can't help but hop on for the ride. This is film-making at its most self-assured and unapologetic. Director John McTiernan has said he set out to make a classic popcorn movie, and he succeeded in spades.The story is surprisingly thematically strong, and believe it or not, it owes that to the depth of Schwartzenegger's character--a monster-movie hero who's actually on par with the monster. Every action hero has to have his requisite humanizing moments--it's par for the course. Smiles at a kid, saves a puppy, blah blah blah. But Dutch's are more effective than any other instances I can think of because they are so believable and unforced. "I don't do this kind of work," Dutch says indignantly after he learns his team ("We are a rescue team, not assassins.") has been duped into attacking a rebel camp on the pretense of rescuing hostages. It's really a great moment--a simple, unexaggerated statement of ethics--as tough as Dutch and his team look, they derive real pride from the fact that they are in the business (primarily) of saving lives rather than ending them. It's not shoved in our faces, we don't have to watch Dutch cradling a tattered child's doll in the wreckage or anything--it's just there. This crucial humanizing moment makes Dutch's struggle with the Predator all the more striking--he has to give in to that part of himself that he rejects early on in the movie: the aggressor, the killer, the hunter, the savage. He has to allow this part of himself to take over in order to survive. The ensemble cast deserves kudos, too (especially Bill Duke in the performance of a lifetime as the smoldering Mac)--the film is much deeper and richer thanks to their spirited characterizations. We ACTUALLY CARE when these guys (who would be called "side characters" in most other action movies) are picked off by the malicious demon that hunts and haunts them. Again, the characterization is effective and feels genuine, which lends greater meaning to the central action of the movie. As screen writing formulas go, this is definitely not rocket science, and most action and horror films attempt it in some form or fashion, but surprisingly few do so successfully.And, of course, the other star of "Predator"--the creature itself, is masterfully conceived and designed, both with and without the mask. It still stands (along with, yes, the Alien) as one of the coolest and most imaginative monsters ever put on film.This is a very important movie to people (especially guys) of my generation--I remember re-watching it repeatedly when I was ten or eleven (probably too young!), totally fascinated and drawn in to the primal story of kill-or-be-killed. I can honestly say that this appeal has not dwindled one iota. If, like me, you grew up on "Predator," I highly recommend picking up the new DVD so you can see for yourself how well it has stood the test of time. If you haven't seen it and have any respect for action films or thrillers whatsoever, check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my all time favorite sci-fi movie. I love the characters, especially Billie, and not just cuz he's fantastic eye candy. I love when he says the thing acts.."like a hunter". Bingo!! hit the nail on the head you did, right there! This movie is fast, interesting, suspenseful, and then in the end, when most movies rip you off and show just a tiny bit of the beast, or nothing at all, you get a ten minute eye-full of this creature!! And is he awesome!!!!!!! Dreadlocks and all. I loved it. And, the scenery of the Amazon rain forest was fun to see. It was great fun to discover, along with Arnold, that being cold hid him from the creature. It was just a great movie, through and through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing Short of the Greatest Action Movie Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot: A special strike force team is sent in the jungles lead by Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger), for what he believe to be a rescue mission. But come to find out they were sent to stop a small army from crossing tons of weapons into the country. After they destroy the camp they soon relies they were tricked and expendable. Thinking this is the end they proceed to the check point where the Helicopter will take them home. But they are then hunted down one by one by an invisible enemy. Then find out this thing isn't human and is a hunter of unstoppable and futuristic tactics never seen on are planet. A Hunter from another world!My Spiel: This movie is absolutely one of my favorites. From a time I watched this movie for 3 straight months, for every day. Some days I watched it more then once. I had this on a terrible VHS tape. But for some reason having to rewind it and in the rewinding time span I wanted to watch it again and again. This movie is full of everything from blood/guts/bullets/knifes/aliens/war/soldiers/death. All those mix to make the true "Guy Movie". Granted this movie has it's flaws but come on, this is one of those ultimate badass movies where none of that crap matters. There have been tons of movies to try to duplicate this movie and all fail. I can't urge people enough to just watch this for what it is. The ultimate what the hell else could go wrong for a special elite team lead by Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger). That has already been tricked into doing a job, also in 115+ degree heat, and then to top it off a out of this world galactic hunter wants there bones for collectors pieces. From the attack on the base camp that they completely demolish, to the destruction of a square block of jungle with the mini gun scene. But this movie true message is the fact that Dutch is left to fight the Predator without the use of military weapons, but has to make his own out of the supplies and natural surroundings around him, which completely throw the Predator for a complete loop, or does it!After screening this movie to many times to count I have come up with a conclusion about the end. I believe that Poncho (Richard Chaves) the soldier with the automatic grenade launcher, Survived at the end. Well I believe he was in the lap of Anna (Elpidia Carrillo) in the helicopter at the end. Because you can see the hair of someone laying down but no face. And the only one with that short of hair at the time was Poncho, and heck I think Anna came back for him, granted he did get hit by a huge log, but who the hell else could it be. Also on another note in "Predator 2" they talk about only two special mission force members survived and I don't know what this means to you, but Anna is no special forces member! This is truly something that has bothered me for some time. But this movie had given me days of satisfaction and a must watch for anyone who likes Sci-fi/Horror/Action.

		<fullReview>After starring as one of the most iconic and unstoppable villains ever in Terminator, it was high time that Arnie had a worthy foe to fight against. And he got way more than he bargained for with the Predator.Before his crowning achievement of Die Hard, John McTiernan assembled a group of seven muscle-bound commandos in the South American jungle and let them unleash hell on Latino, Russian and Aliens alike with an awesome arsenal of macho weaponry. This is definitely a boys' movie. Both Alien and Aliens - hell, even Friday The 13th - had a thing about two females going head to head at the end. How are us guys supposed to get a kick out of endings like that? Arnie plays Major Alan 'Dutch' Schaefer, the leader of an elite Spec Ops force. His team is called to duty by General Phillips (R.G. Armstrong) and the very suspicious Dillon (Carl Weathers) to rescue a bunch of government officials, who have been shot down in enemy territory in Latin America.As soon as they arrive in the jungle something is watching their every move from the trees. And they get the feeling that things just ain't right. The first rescue team is found disembowelled and skinned. Same goes for their chopper.None of them trust Dillon. He's up to no good. There are no cabinet ministers being held hostage, just a bunch of his CIA pals being tortured by the Russians. In no less than five minutes, all seven of them completely obliterate a rebel guerrilla camp. The CIA hostages are dead.Dutch is angry and feels mighty betrayed. Dillon lied to him and their mission is over as soon as it started. All they have to do is make a journey through one valley to the nearest rendezvous point and fly back home. Not so simple when a high-tech, seemingly invisible, 7'2'', extra-terrestrial Rastafarian hunter is picking them off one by one and keeping their skulls as trophies. This predator is obviously a fan of the 1932 movie, The Most Dangerous Game.In the same way that he created nervous claustrophobia around the Nakatomi Plaza in Die Hard, McTiernan floods the movie with an oppressive and twitchy atmosphere. Half of the film's ominous tone comes from Alan Silvestri's militaristic and primeval score, with pounding drums and lurking strings, indicating that the Predator's haunting presence is everywhere. He could strike from any corner at any moment. And he does.Nothing Dutch and his men seem to do can thwart this enemy and in no time at all Dutch is the last one standing. He runs for his life with the Predator in hot pursuit.The final act is no doubt the strongest and can even be viewed as a separate movie altogether. McTiernan ditches the lush, steamy jungle from the first two acts and completely turns it around into a strikingly Gothic, baroque, supernatural landscape. There is a subtext of primitive brutality winning over highly advanced super-weapons. And there is enough testosterone between Dutch and the Predator to fill 100 tanker trucks. Women, totally, need not apply.Definitely one of Arnie's best and a landmark action movie. No doubt. Outdone only by the sequel.Note: When the Predator rises out of the lake and tries to locate Arnie, who is covered in mud, he notices a monkey sitting on a log. Freeze frame the film when he zooms in and you will see a single frame shot of a man in a white vest with an explosion/lens flare behind. It looks like a shot from Die Hard (which wasn't made at the time!) and I have no clue how it got in there.Weird huh?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ball busting Vietnam allegory McTiernan style delivers wholesale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will start this by giving my ratings, yes plural because to me as a sci-fi/action film fan the film has few peers, it is 100% pure suspense testo explosive fun that along side John McTiernan's other action template Die Hard, stands the test of time to the point that it will be thrilling viewers long after we have left this earth. So with that I give it a personal rating of 10/10, it's faultless for my needs in a genre I indulge and lose myself in on a frequent roster. For any other movie fan aware of the genre's traits and peccadilloes without being a fan of sorts, then I rate the film easily at 7 or 8 out of 10, what's not to like here?The film is without a shadow of a doubt another allegory of Vietnam, a crack unit of soldiers are stuck in a central American jungle being killed off by an invisible enemy, the soldiers are there after being lied to by the powers that be, tactics are paramount but the enemy that stalks them holds all the aces. This crack special rescue team are a testosterone fuelled band of beef, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Sonny Landham, Bill Duke &amp; Jesse Ventura, these five alone have a combined muscle weight heavy enough to have sunk the Titanic, and McTiernan uses the beefcakes to the max in a series of joyous ball busting sequences.The dialogue is sharp and funny with Schwarzenegger quipping his way thru the first reel, and the score from Alan Silvestri pumps the blood at just the right time, whilst the effects crew have done sterling work to bring this "hardest man in the world versus bad ass alien predator" to life, none more so than when viewing POV heat seeking infa-red shots as our deadly alien killer. The end throws up some interesting thoughts, that have for better or worse? Been fleshed out with further films involving the predator of the title, but one should judge this film as a single entry because it sits at the top of the tree as one of the best of it's kind; so truly this is a benchmark for the genre that will take some beating as far as I'm concerned.Enjoy 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One major mark of a good movie is its ability to draw you in to its own particular brand of reality. An attribute of a Great movie is that for a time you forget it is a movie. The first time I saw Predator I even forgot what time it was. The cast and crew sucked me into a hot little battlefield somewhere near Earth's equator and for a couple of hours I was right there, next to Dutch. Wide eyed and with my heart in my throat I chased and fought and ran from a new on screen Terror so awesome that it succeeded in creating a new Hollywood Archetype in horror.

		<fullReview>WARNING: SPOILERS AHEADThe Predator might just be one of the most entertaining movies ever made; honestly, its ability to addict anyone who watches it is amazing; once you see it, you'll want to see it again and again and again...It's as simplistic a plot as it can get, you won't learn important lessons on life after watching this masterpiece of the action genre, you don't have to do much thinking... and that's great! You just have to watch with an open-mind and expecting just big, fast-paced, explosive, action-driven fun! It's really that simple: a group of marines vs. an alien predator. How come no one ever thought about this before? And why haven't they made something this good again afterwards? From the first until the last scene it's just marines kicking rebels' asses, the predator kicking the marines' asses, and Arnie kicking the predator's ass. Machine guns, uzis, knifes, explosives, fistfights, you'll find it all here.The predator's visual is a sight to behold: definitely ranks up there with the Alien's creepy, beautiful look. He's more humanoid-like, he has badass claws, he has lasers, he has a creepy mask, he's got fishnets where he hangs skulls, he's got lizard-like skin, he's got fangs underneath the mask, he's huge bastard and he's a mean killing machine. Yep, it's a seller! How can you not love this movie?!Arnie is at the top of his game here, too, as well as the entire cast. This is the meanest team of marines ever assembled in a movie, and it shows when they go into killing mode. Great lines, great attitudes from all the actors, and a great kick-ass mood makes this movie one of the most unforgettable experiences in cinema.</fullReview>

It has some of the best acting, directing, effects and sound-track ever produced.&gt;This is Arnold's best acting roll in his career. But, we must not forget every other actor who produced spine-tingling performances! &gt;The effects are simple, yet will last the test of time &gt;The weaponry is huge! And will remain huge in my heart!If you like 'war type' action you should love this. From the title screen the action begins, and does not end until the credits. The sheer brute force of the story leaves one feeling truly satisfied, and even spiritually fulfilled by the end. Without Predator my life would be incomplete. Stick around and watch this one people. If not, get to the chopper and announce your sins!Thank you</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Up there with the greatest of 80s action movies !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Schwarznegger movies in the 80's saw Arnie taking on allcomers - whether camp commandos, evil barbarians or the mafia no one stood a chance against his one liners and big guns. Since no bad guys on earth could stop him, in 1987 a logical choice was made- let Arnie do battle with an alien. The result is predator- one of the best action movies of the 80s.From the very beginning the machismo and hard boiled dialouge comes thick and fast and things escalate, getting more intense and action packed as the movie progresses. There's serious air of tension and mystery too as the script wisely keeps the predators appearance secret until the films thrilling climax.The well assembled cast (consisting of real life tough guys) play their bad ass roles brilliantly and Arnold schwarznegger handles his part with his unique charisma- he has a screen presence strong enough to hold the movie when every other character has been killed by the predator. And speaking of which, the titular predator looks awesome to this day- very few computer animated creatures can hold a candle to the human hunting extra terrestrial bad ass.Preadator is awesome- its a tough talking, exciting action packed thrill ride from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an action sci-fi masterpiece on all levels.I have seen this film more than I can count.In my top 10 movies of all time.I first saw this when I was 5 years old and was immediately sucked into the story and characters.This film combines perfect action,drama,sci-fi and great humor.Arnold plays his greatest role here along with the terminator.He shows some serious acting skills which i always knew he had.His character Dutch is hardcore in every single way but has a heart also.All the others are great too with Billy being my favorite.This guy is the definition of awesome.And the Predator himself is the greatest alien in movie history.The director J.McTiernan builds a perfect characterization of him by showing only bits of the creature and teases the audience.By the time the team are taken one by one we are already on the edge too see what is this thing that rips spines,blows bodies and skins people alive just for the fun of it.The moment when the Predator finally comes out of the water is insane.He's bad to the bone.Later when he removes his mask you see a face so ugly that only his alien mother can love.It shows that Stan Winston is the best at what he does.And this is the 1st and only time when Arnold is beat almost to death.I mean how cool is to see him finally meeting somebody stronger than him,huh?Go see this movie if you haven't cause it's the best of the best in the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better memories from my childhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We had once a black-and-white TV-set at home, which used to "fade away" when showing something interesting. It was the case when they transmitted "Predator" back in 1988-1991 (don't remember the year exactly). The image became weaker and very soon the signal was lost. It was lost completely during the "helicopter" scene. Deep frustration it was. Then, years later, it was possible to get a VHS on the local markets. But that was not enough, of course. Now we have a DVD release. No extras - just the movie itself (like "Commando"). Quite happy with that."Knock, knock!" and "Stick around" are charmingly cruel jokes delivered by you-know-who in a usual easy-going manner. All the characters in the movie are real tough. They look tough, they talk tough, and they can kill all right. There is no stupid "love story" attached. The only detail, which is not very true to life, is the way the Russian men are shown. If the Russian men had dusted at least one or two persons from Dutch's team ? it would have been more believable (as well as Dutch's death at the end). But that is a matter of personal preference? In "First Blood" also would like to see Rambo die (not because dislike him ? consider it would have been more tragic and cool).The design of the title monster is quite good. The "little painless" is superb. The choice of the actors surpasses any expectations. The music is very to the point ? in a movie like this it is just priceless (it seems to be in "jungle" trend). All in all this movie is of the highest class and can kick the hell out of nearly any action/horror of today's cinema. The second part doesn't get close to the original ? it never had a chance. It could not have reached the heights of "Predator", even if the big Dutch would have been there.After numerous watching still cannot see any interfering drawbacks.It is a definite 10 out of 10. Thank you for attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back to the basics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being fully dependent to technology is a weakness. That's what Dutch and the predator learned. At the beginning, the human team made mistakes that cost many lives. Leaving all the human-made weapons and becoming one with the Nature wasn't a choice, it was an evidence.It was a better idea to focus on efficient use of raw materials than wasting time with predictable guns. Once Dutch understood the trick, the predator began to reproduce these mistakes. Dutch became invisible and the predator tried to blast everywhere as if he was blind by his confidence on his technology. To sum up my ideas : Nature vs Technology, Unconsciousness vs Rationality, Confidence vs Fear. To conclude, i would say that Dutch finally reached his distant ancestors' primal instincts for hunting and survival that made the human race competitive on the natural selection. As my title said, Dutch has gone back to the basics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's an element about this film that critics now, and before at it's release, never remotely were able to grasp. And that was the huge amount of humanity contained within this film. The sum of the movie devolves in to the struggle of a single person against overwhelming odds. And a great many people who have watched the film, appreciate and respond to this. And it's clearly seen in the longevity of it's popularity. Struggle for mere survival is a perennial theme, and Predator exudes this at it's very core.Of course first, and foremost Predator is an eighties action movie, with all the essential elements present. Big guns, big muscles, and small lines. The scene is set early on, and the tone maintained as movie gives a rousing gun battle early on. And it's easy to see how film critics would of simply 'switched off' at this point in proceedings, and scribbled their flaccid notes a.k.a Roger Ebert. But the arrival of the alien into the movie instantly takes the film in to a new direction, both in tension and in depth. The creatures motivation is clear, it's on earth for a hunting trip, looking for trophies. A force of nature prevalent in the prehistoric, and modern world, and utterly plausible for a future one. But why a single critic could not grasp this aspect is baffling to say the least. But what happens from here is where the movie truly comes into it's own. As Dutch's team is slowly dispatched, he is left stripped of support and ultimately his weapons. He's left scrambling for his life through the undergrowth of the jungle. And it is in this element that the movie resonates loudest. In the climatic scenes of the film, Dutch is reduced to his mere wit's and courage, and against an alien force, highly equipped and bearly scratched for all the efforts of the team to fight, and survive against it. And the climax of the film completely delivers, with a 'Dirty Harry'esk fight scene, with Dutch firmly on the loosing side of the things. Dutch is stripped back to pure ingenuity, and humanity to persist against his ever decreasing odds. And here the movie has it spades, the tangible futility against a far superior force. But Dutch clings on to ultimately defeat the predator. And even after he's defeated him, there's one last twist, giving Dutch another reason to run for his life. Predator delivers a hard, and fast adrenaline charged ride to your inner survival. Something has yet to be surpassed within this genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having not being born when Predator came out, the first I heard about any sort of Predator was the Alien vs. Predator franchise. Therefore I was never too bothered about seeing this movie. And what I was missing out on! I want to start by saying that this is, alongside The Terminator (also staring Ah-nuld Schwazenegger) this is probably the action movie of the eighties. Nothing comes close to the suspense and pure brilliance of this film. The Predator and the lack of it visually creates a genuinely terrifying antagonist who ruthlessly butchers his way through Ah-nuld's elite squad. Ah-nuld himself is brilliant as Dutch, the ripped leader in a film strewn with brilliant one-liners (knock knock!), Ah-nuld was perfect for the role as someone fighting on the side of good rather than the evil monster-type role. Everyone else has a great part and the characters are developed well in the opening scenes, before they're mercilessly butchered. Overall, the action movie to see. Predator-10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Predator is my favourite film, next to Rocky, and has always had a special place in my heart. Scaring me to death as a youngster, the film succeeds completely in merging different genres together. For the first part, a gung-ho action flick - for the second part, a nerve-jangling horror that develops into a tremendous adventure film.The film feels like a real team effort, much like the heroes of the film itself. Everyone involved in the production has brought something creative, unique or memorable to the table and has made Predator become a hugely popular film and franchise.Firstly, the scipt is chock-full of classic dialogue, making this one of the most quoted films in history, with so many cheesy one-liners that you've be forgiven for thinking the characters were being hunted by a hungry mouse. However, the script and the premise is genius - by simply pitting an alien hunter against Earth's finest prey, humans (commandos even), the situations write themselves; boy-scout traps, mud-camouflaged Arnie and the villain which imitates and toys with its prey. The sequel, which is OK but not a classic, managed to develop this idea even further with a wider arsenal and deeper understanding of the alien race, which gives this film a little something to separate it from other standard Alien-ripoffs.Secondly, director John McTiernan keeps the film zooming along at a sensible pace. When there's any danger of actual character development, we move straight on to the next scene and dispense with said character lol. There's a tremendous atmosphere as the commandos enter the jungle - it's like another world and straight away the audience is thrown out of its seat with a shocking discovery up in the trees. In fact, the massive outbursts of violence in Predator are still very savage today and despite more violence now getting through censors, we don't get to see anything quite so shocking as skinned corpses and spinal cords being ripped out! Eventually, the tension is cranked up to breaking point as it's left to Arnie to "stick around" and avenge his team, Tarzan-style.Next, the visual effects people should be congratulated. From amazing pyrotechnics to the legendary heat vision and camouflage which is part of Predator's unique quality. Even today, the image of a blurry silhouette running through the jungle gives me the shivers and when the final battle kicks in, sparks truly fly. The cameo-effect is one of the best special effects i've ever seen and feels like the discovery of bullet time or something just as classic.Thank the lord for Stan Winston, who practically saved the film by ditching the original dopey design of the Predator and coming up with the masked humanoid with some nice dreadlocks. Most people prefer Giger's Alien design over this, but I always prefer the Predator, largely thanks to Kevin Peter Hall's performance. Instead of a guy in a suit, which Alien eventually seemed like at the end, we get a nasty looking alien under a mask. Never do we think that it's just a bloke under there. The Predator swings from to tree to tree like a monkey and bounds great distances like Frankenstein's monster on steroids. Instead of a clumsy, fake alien, we get something that really does act and look intelligent enough to hunt a team of crack commandos. The appearance itself is truly memorable and it's debatable whether the Pred looks cooler with or without his metal mask.As I said before, it's a real ensemble effort and even the actors bring something to the film that stands out. We don't need character development for this type of film, we just need something that makes each guy different so that we know who's getting wasted - a problem which many monster flicks mess up by throwing in a bunch of blands. Here, every character is radically different; Dutch, the sensible team-leader (although Arnie doesn't exactly need to be distinguished), Dillon who has shades of Apollo Creed in trying to keep his cool and save face, Mac who starts off quite laid back and eventually goes mad, Blain who utters the best one-liners and carries a bleeding mini gun around(!), Billy the tracker who is just out-there and knows something's wrong from the off, Poncho who speaks Spanish and wields a grenade launcher and Hawkins who reads comics, works the radio and tells dirty jokes.Finally, the score needs mentioning as this is one of the most atmospheric soundtracks ever and adds to the films pounding tension. As soon as we enter the jungle, the music spells doom for all with subtle tones that soon explode to life. Considering how much hiking through jungle there is (and yeah, the locations people should be noted as well because this is some truly bad-ass bush), it's surprising we don't feel it because the whole time Alan Silvestri keeps us entertained with the film's classic theme tune.Spawning a decent sequel and countless other media, it goes to show the power of Predator. It all started here, when it was just considered an alien-ripoff but has since shrugged off those roots and claimed it's own slice of history. Everyone involved in the film has contributed something - it's as though their careers have all peaked at the same time and met up on this film. The result is just quality; remarkable, memorable and exhilarating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was 12 when I first saw Predator and it has been a firm sci-fi favorite ingrained in my psyche ever since. Predator, now 23 years old, hasn't aged and still feels current - if you can excuse the 80's testosterone. It just goes to show that expensive CGI is no match for a good story with a colourful and competent cast. The story follows Dutch (Schwarzenegger) the leader of a specialized group of bad-ass soldiers who run rescue missions in areas Chuck Norris would be scared to go. He is duped into a supposed rescue mission in South America by an old college, Dillon (Carl Weathers) who now works for the CIA.Once in the Jungle, Dillon's true reason for using Dutch becomes apparent when the team comes across the mutilated remains of a previous special ops team sent in by Dillon. The team is not there to rescue anyone, but stop an arms deal. Someone begins picking off the team one by one and and to quote Billy (Sonny Landham) who provides the spiritual insight "There is something out there, and it ain't no man". The action begins...Alien hunters on safari, CIA operatives, professional black ops soldiers, South American rebels and a whole lot of hot steamy jungle in the mix and you have one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made.The 80's style testosterone fueled acting gives great insight into the period and muscle-bound cast perform well and this must be Arnie's finest performance. Thankfully there isn't much of the of cheesy 80's dialog, like that painfully delivered by Bill Paxton in Aliens and Predator 2.Like Ridley Scott's Alien, the franchise has only gone downhill since and fans have eagerly been waiting for Robert Rodriguez and Nimrd Antal to restore the franchise to it's former glory with the release of Predators.A timeless classic and sci-fi masterpiece. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Commando' meets his match in one of the most popular sci-fi/action films of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Muscle-man, Arnold Shwarzenegger's screen presence dominated the destructive, macho action films of the 1980s, and this innovative classic combines those very ingredients from 'Commando' with sci-fi monster horror and emerges itself as one of the most popular Hollywood blockbusters in history.Arnie leads a team of military mercenaries along with government man, Carl Weathers into the deep Central American jungles to infiltrate an enemy operation only to find themselves up against an alien hunter who is attracted to heat and violence and hunts for sport. This is the perfect blend of tough-guy, military clichs featuring all of the nasty dialog and heavy artillery (You gotta love Jesse' "The Body" Ventura and his ultra-destructive Gatling gun) with a remarkably technological creature (played by a towering 6'8" Pittsburgh native, Kevin Peter Hall) that can camouflage itself to its terrain ,see in infrared vision, and utilize a force of unstoppable high-tech weaponry. Arnie uses his trademark one-liners, and a great ensemble cast featuring Ventura, Weathers, Bill Duke, Sonny Landham, and Richard Chaves) pulls no punches especially during an introductory action scene presenting one hell of a fire-fight. The monster meticulously stalks the soldiers one by one until an unforgettable showdown with Arnie himself, and the creature's unmasked face at the film's climax is a real accomplishment in make-up effects. The kills happen quickly and sometimes seem quite illogical (a fireball is shot through the head of Duke, and is later on shown completely in tact, as well as Ventura's ribcage scene.), but most of the inconsistencies are negligible due to such tremendous suspense and pacing which is only enhanced by Alan Silvestri's legendary musical score.Its classic sci-fi/action that helped define the genre, and spawned a huge barrage of successful follow-ups including it's subsequent infusion with the 'Alien' series. Director, John McTieran will also go on to direct the excellent slam-bang action hit, 'Die Hard', and Kevin Peter Hall returns for 'Predator 2'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what's the secret?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>what's so good about this film (if you consider it's style became formulaic in recent years), is that it tries not to be intriguing. I believe that it was Brian Aldiss that once said of science fiction: "the trick is not to explain everything". it sure works here for this film! if you think about it, even the simple title "predator", doesn't give away much. If you have never seen this film or talked to anybody that has about it (if you lived in a cave, perhaps) the title would trow you off. Predator... what kind of predator? Who, or what is the predator? the humans, to begin with (the commando team), but soon after the ultimate killing machine steps in.The story doesn't wallow pointlessly into the origins of the creature. It, quite unapologetically, shows that it came from outer space, and that should be enough. The premise is simple: "it came to earth, it's different from us and it feels no remorse", got it? No pseudo-philosophies on "are we alone in the universe" or "it came in peace" or some crap like that. It delivers the story of the hunter being hunted. Period.As for character development, it goes without saying that it's remarkably sparse but effective; it gives some insight into their experiences, but in a bonding kind of way, without referring to "combat trauma", "shell shock" or other problems posed incessantly by other films. It's enough to be believable, like in "Alien". You can tell who's best bud's with each other. It's not a soap opera, it's just an action film! The acting is well all around, considering that this is not a very dramatically demanding story for anybody (and the fact that neither are particularly gifted actors). The script is precise, it doesn't force the cast to act stupid, or insults the intelligence of the audience; another reason why it works! It never tries to explain much, it sure leaves open questions at the end, but you don't get that feeling of a plot hole in the story.The visuals are stunning. The art direction turns the jungle into an enemy on its own accord, shooting at highly tilted angles to give you a sense of isolation, of how small you are, of something lurking in the trees, that you are being watched. While this is only suggested in the first half of the film, it becomes clear that it is really the case in the second part.The story is simple and convincing. The plot actually gives you a reason for the commandos to be there, it's not a typical "they went into the jungle after some Axe murderer to get chopped to bits" kind of thing. We are led to believe that it's a rescue mission and get that feeling of betrayal when we find out the real purpose.The creature is amazing; applause to Stan Winston and also James Cameron (he suggested the fangs "thingy"). An alien that doesn't just seem to be fetched out of the star trek reject bin. Doesn't look like a human in a Halloween costume at all. Like the creature from Alien, this is totally refreshing and original. Plus, it carries the most spectacular apparatus of killing contraptions ever devised on film. It seem like a daemon, at times, because it's in in for the kill. But that just goes to show what happens when you are not at the top of the food chain.John Mctiernan delivered an absolute gem with this one. The pacing is superb, the photography (by Donald McAlpine)is brilliant; he turns the somewhat dull green environment of the jungle into a character of its own. The editing is master full, taking you where the story wants to, driving you into a crescendo of fear (that part when Carl Weathers bites the big one come to mind!).Definitely "Ah-nuld's" best!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this film I had the feeling something completely new was achieved by the film maker. An Action Sci-fi movie with action scenes that are believable (humanly possible) but still with a mysterious, powerful alien that is slowly developed from a computer generated wispy creature to a real and frightening being. Yes, the alien has superhuman strength, abilities and equipment but remains believable. Yes, Arnold rolls his muscles but not too explicitly as in some of his other movies, besides he needs them all in the physical fight against the alien who is very clearly a size too big for Ernie. In summary, a fast, innovative Action Sci-fi movie so full with small detail that you can see it time after time and still discover something new.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Alien: Pure Intensity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:McTiernan mimics Scott's use of seeing progressively more and more of the Predator. This is such an effective way to increase curiosity and suspense. We see, slowly, more and more until the unmasking when only Arnie is left. The pacing is the star of this movie along with the photography. The jungle is used so you never know when it is going to pop out on you. The movie starts and simply never stops. After the discovery of Hopper's team, it rushes into the hostage rescue which is done very well. If you notice, the director kills off the cast in order of acting ability, Arnie excepted, of course. We are left with Duke the best actor of the group by a mile. I always though the Predator cam was a mistake for it kills suspense. We know proximity by seeing through it. The scariest parts of the movie are at the end in the one on one battle where it does pop out on Arnie. Imagine Alien with a camera that shows proximity, it is a suspense killer. Yes, it is cool, but it would be scarier without it. The cast is great especially Ventura who has some really great lines in the movie. Like The Terminator, it is at the top because of its believability. We do not have Commando with Arnie taking out one hundred men hiding behind rosebushes. The Predator slowly whittles the group down, smaller and smaller and there is this growing sense of futility and impending doom. When Landham turns and says,"We're all going to die," this is what makes it stand out. The first time you watch it in the dark it is one intense, unpredictable great movie. The Predator is not portrayed as invincible; it gets wounded a couple of times. This also adds verisimilitude to the movie. No movie is perfect; you have to endure Alan Silvestri's dreadful score. He always puts that Bahama xylophone in all his movies. He was big in the 80s and we have to endure it here. I hope someday McTiernan redoes the music for the film.The acting is weak in the back end of the cast but, like I said, do not worry the Predator kills the worst actors first. Duke really is great in the movie; always an invisible actor, he turns in his usual great acting. Please, stop with Die Hard, this was McTiernan's masterpiece. It is like a roller-coaster; it never stops. One Great Movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one of those good old Arnold Schwarzenegger's action movies. If you haven't seen it yet, you definitely got to do it. The action was pretty good for that time's action movie. The plot is pretty simple, but what's original about this film is Predator - probably one of the most unique fictional creatures. It looked like a very dangerous creature and there was some heart-stopping moments when it was attacking US soldiers and it looked like that they are totally helpless in those situations. There also was some original deaths, lots of blood and explosions. It's a very original action/Sci-Fi film and it's a must see for everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before i saw this film i was expecting a typical good 80's action film enjoyable relaxing and my reply to it would be a shrug. But John Mctiernan gave an exciting and very enjoyable film. The film is about a group of Green Berets or Commandos (I'm not sure yet) who go on a rescue mission into a hostile guerrilla area but after they eliminate the guerrilla camp they soon figure out they are being hunted by something not human. My favourite part must be the way the Predator hunts down each man one by one the film begins to lack when the rest of the platoon was killed off in around ten minutes (except Arnie and Anna(The Girl)) Overall the film was just off perfect very well directed good screenplay and one of the best parts was the way the environment was used by not just the Predator but by the soldiers as well and of course the way you didn't know who was going to go next.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi Guys,I'll start by saying there is some legendary comments by everyone on the other threads. Great stuff! I am a huge fan of the film &amp; have been looking for a site dedicated to the film. There doesn't seem to be one.I have seen the commandofan.com one. It's good. Anyway just wanted to say I was 15 when Predator first came out &amp; I didn't go the cinema to see it, think was 15/16 when it came out on video. Loved it &amp; sh*t myself. Like most teenagers I loved action films, but even then felt much of the stuff hitting the big screen was kind of crap. This film stood apart &amp; has stood the test of time. I have probably watched it 20-30 times over the years &amp; still love it.The atmosphere created, the music, the brilliance of the predator (still unbeaten for me) to the acting. I know it was cheesy at times &amp; sometimes plain funny, but it worked. All the other comments about the great one liners &amp; scary moments have been fantastic by others so I won't touch on them . My favourite characters are Dutch (Arnie), Mac (Bill Duke) &amp; Billy (Sonny Landham). I felt all the characters played their roles perfectly &amp; ran their course apart from Billy. I felt he was killed too easily. Maybe that was intentional to scare us more. I dunno I loved Billy. (not like that!) Incidentally his website is okay. sonnylandham.com It's worth visiting it just for one thing. Make sure your speakers are turned on quite loud when you visit. I will agree the really scary thing is being watched though &amp; being deep in that south American rainforest is enough in itself, seeing your mates being picked off &amp; being relentlessly chased. I might have to watch it again soon. Would love to hear others views on a few things they could have added, or other routes the script could have took for certain characters. Although don't get me wrong I love this movie the way it is &amp; is right up there. Why did they even attempt a follow up. Hated the Alien v Predator. Watched 40 mins. Same as Highlander. Great, great film. Second film, trash. Anyway good luck chaps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Arn takes on a formidable opponent in this superior sci-fi/action pip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An elite commando squad led by the rugged Dutch (an excellent and engaging performance by Arnold Schwarzenegger) find themselves being hunted by a ruthless and relentless predatory alien (towering Kevin Peter Hill) in a Central American jungle.Director John McTiernan relates the gripping story at a snappy pace, stages the action set pieces with rip-roaring gusto, builds plenty of tension, delivers a handy helping of gore, and makes the most out of the steamy tropical setting. The clever script by Jim and John Thomas provides a hyper-masculine aesthetic that's positively dripping with testosterone along with several choice one-liners ("Stick around") and a welcome and refreshing opportunity to see a bunch of tough stomp-ass alpha male types placed in a disadvantageous situation in which they are vulnerable and getting bumped off instead of invincible and happily butchering folks. The members of Dutch's mighty team are a likable and well-drawn bunch, with especially stand-out work from Carl Weathers as the duplicitous Dillon, Bill Duke as the unhinged Mac, Jesse Ventura as rough'n'tumble redneck Blain, and Sonny Landham as expert tracker Billy. Kudos are also in order for Donald McAlpine's sharp cinematography, Alan Silvestri's fist-pumping score, and Stan Winston's superbly grotesque creature make-up. Essential viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predator-terrifying Sci-Fi Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Predator a Sci-Fi Movie released in 1987, became an instant classic. The movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as "Dutch" a tough army Major who is leading a special Black Ops Mission to assist "Dillon" (Carl Weathers) who is from CIA to rescue some survivors in South American Jungle. As they arrive Dutch realizes that they have been sent there by supplying false information. But this information is their least problem because there is someone or something in the jungle who is hunting his team one by one.After giving great action flicks in 1984 as The Terminator, Conan and Commando in 85 Arnold returns as the hardcore angry army major, he is not afraid of killing anyone or anything. The supporting cast works well too except some scenes involving Elpidia Carrillo Mexican actress.The Director John McTiernan is able to create an atmosphere which helps convert this action science fiction movie into horror movie in second act. The shooting location inside the jungle is well chosen and helps to add in the terror spread by the creature out to hunt-Predator.Watching hardcore commandos turn into panicky prey with Alan Silvestri's Classical soundtrack again amplifies the horror quality of the movie. As the climax is reached the viewer is so pumped up that he forgets about other characters and the girl. The final act is full on one to one fight between man and predator portrayed brilliantly by McTiernan.One of the best thing about the Predator was its practical effects and special effects. The Predator's vision is well made which lends into the suspense of what is hunting them. While this movie may not be for everyone and faint hearted as the movie get a little bit too graphic at some points. But the effects still holds strong after 28 long years.A survival-horror-suspense-action-scifi-thriller with Arnold and directed by McTiernan. What else do you need.For More Reviews check out my blog at filmicsite.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Films that teeter the line of brutal horror and all-out action are hard to come by but Predator is an exception. Predator is absolutely my favorite alien horror film made over the likes of Alien, The Thing and Invasion of the Body Snatchers. I can't say that Predator is better because those are some rock-solid classics but Predator does get criminally overlooked and probably isn't looked in that category to most. Special effects for the late eighties were risky but it worked perfectly, the camouflaged movements of the Predator were original and powerful on screen. Predator itself, seems unbeatable and a worthy villain to be remembered in the horror genre. The kill scenes were all graphic, not showing mercy to anyone, and definitely unpredictable not knowing who the next victim would be until their character came to contact. The characters were strong and defined thanks to an incredible cast that made this seem like an actual deadly in combat rescue team. Jesse Ventura, Sonny Landham and Arnold had their hoaky one-liners but they were often funny and quotable. Definitely check out Predator for a great theme song, well thought out storyline and special effects, and relentless gory action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie when I was 5 years old, and still, at the age of 32, I watch it nearly every year. I never tire of this masterpiece.Why is it one of the greatest action/sci-fi/horror films of all time? Because it's director John McTiernan at his best, it has a cast of talented macho men running around in the jungle firing witty dialogue and big guns at every leaf or tree branch that looks out of place, and the slow-burn build-up to the epic last act keeps your heart rate steadily increasing until you think it's going to explode out of your chest.The Predator itself is one of the best designed creatures in the history of creature design. Stan Winston's imagination has been immortalised by this creature alone.The greatest part of the movie though: Alan Silvestri's thumping, pumping, bravely brass score. It's close to being the most perfect score to have ever been written for a movie. Every note, every horn, every drum beat feels like if the film had a bone fide soul, Silvestri was channelling it.If you have not seen this movie, there may be something wrong with you, so get to the video store, fly there on a chopper if you have to, and see what a real action movie looks like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Predator represents how sci-fi horror is so marketable. After James Cameron's Aliens, Predator offers another thrill for the mass audience, combining similar story structure with an instantly recognisable film star - Arnold Schwarzenegger (in a role that suits him perfectly). Through somewhat interesting visual effects, the filmmakers are able to sustain the film with almost intolerable suspense, and occasionally heart-stopping moments.Predator is solid fare, but it doesn't match the standards set by Aliens. While McTiernan has a steady hand in what he's doing, he's unable to capture the 'dread feel' associated with Aliens. Nevertheless, the action doesn't tire viewers on repeated viewings, and the film has a lasting quality to it. It's not a bad way to spend two hours, anyway.SCORE: 8.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Often Imitated Never Bettered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get this right Predator 1987 is an Action/Sci-fi movie? Before you have any idea of the 'predator' you could be watching any Arnie movie of the 80's but its still fun even like that with a cast that blends together perfectly &amp; each actor filling roles which unique at the time are now clichd beyond belief. The subtlety of the predator just watching his prey helps build character and tension during the film, with the location used to great effect. The moment of realization when the characters know they are being hunted is fantastic and helps flesh out the characters even more while the attention gradually increases on the predator and his preparation for the hunt.Lets not forget this is an Arnie movie and despite the fantastic cast there is really only one winner here and Arnie really does shine, if your not an Arnie fan just let go and enjoy the cheap jokes &amp; muscleman attitude, this is Arnies jungle. The gradual deaths of the team, all feel meaningful in some way or another with the screams of Carl Weathers character echoing around the now eerily quiet jungle being one of the best, followed by the death of 'Billy' in another classic moment.Having stalked and killed at whim during the movie, the predators eyes turn to what can only be described as the lion of the movie, Arnold Schwarzenegger. With this the movie swings away from guns blazing to a music driven finale where there can be only one winner. This is Arnie of the eighties and you know who the winner will be, but it is done in such a way that you take your hat off to Arnie &amp; especially the late Kevin Peter Hall who portrayed the predator in such an elegant yet deadly grace. The music score is matched perfectly to the movie scene for scene, &amp; builds to an amazing crescendo something which is sorely missed in today's movies. The special effects are good for there time with the predator costume working well in the jungle environment, and to this day the ideas of predator &amp; aliens are ripped of in numerous poor imitations &amp; this alone speaks for itself.Make your own mind up, but just make sure you watch it as predator is without doubt one of the best Action/Sci-fi movies ever made.</fullReview>

Upon arrival, they discover some skinned alive soldiers hanging from a tree. Assuming it's the rebels, they launch an all out war against the group of tyrants, blowing them away in an all out ambush. Unfortunately they discover that it wasn't the rebels that skinned the soldiers alive &amp; that the rebels were nowhere near the threat that another enemy will soon prove to be, as they are stalked &amp; hunted by a vicious, savage alien that hunts them all down &amp; kills them for sport &amp; has amazing camouflage like abilities to hide itself while it carries out it's vicious attacks. Soon Dutch &amp; the remaining survivors realize that if they want to survive these jungles &amp; get out alive, they are going to have to use every bit of army training they ever learnt, but even that may not be enough to help them escape this vicious otherworldly villain.PREDATOR is such a fun movie, easily on of the best action/sci-fi/horror thrillers ever made! There's just so much good stuff here I really don't know where to start! it's easily one of my favourite films. Trust me when I say, there's a very good reason PREDATOR is a very well known &amp; widely received film by fans &amp; critics &amp; why it's still widely remembered &amp; talked about many years after it was made. Just imagine if THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME was cross bred with RAMBO &amp; ALIEN &amp; you'll have the plot for this awesome flick! Ironically enough the film's villain &amp; it's characteristics bears an almost strong resemblance to the alien villain in the little seen, almost forgotten horror item, WITHOUT WARNING (1980) even more ironic is how the late KEVIN PETER HALL (Who is terrific as the Predator) also played the alien monster in that one as well. STAN WINSTON'S creature design for the monstrous Predator is a real piece of work &amp; certainly not a face one can forget. It's easily one of the best villains to ever grace the silver screen in the annals of film history. Interestingly enough, it's not until PREDATOR is over, that one realizes that we barely see the creature for a good portion of the film's running time. It only reveals itself through heat seeking POV'S &amp; it's invisible form (noticed only by the ripples that surround it) through most of the film, yet while this could so easily have been a damper to the film in terms of it's execution &amp; story, the good news is it's not, since it's presence is always felt throughout the film, which goes to show just how clever &amp; good a movie PREDATOR actually is! In fact it's close to an hour in, before the creature even reveals it's form on screen. The score by ALAN SILVESTRI is really cool. Best of all, JOHN McTIERNAN was the perfect choice to helm this movie, there's a real good reason McTiernan became one of the best, most finest action directors of our time &amp; PREDATOR is the perfect showcase for his talents &amp; the very film that opened up the gates of Hollywood to him. His directorial style is simply amazing, as the camera glides through the jungles &amp; manages top capture all the action scenes at all the right angles. The stunts &amp; explosions are breathtaking &amp; the action set pieces are highly charged &amp; some of the best choreographed to ever be caught on film. The acting is really strong here &amp; the characters are very interesting, well written &amp; fun likable characters, particularly Schwarzennagers DUTCH &amp; former pro-wrestler turned governor JESSE THE BODY VENTURA'S role. CARL WEATHERS character is very interesting &amp; SONNY LANDHAM does well as the quiet, weird &amp; withdrawn soldier of the bunch. There's a few good gory bits on hand as well, so gore hounds should find plenty to like here. Best of all, PREDATOR manages to deliver the right amount of suspense &amp; tension filled moments to help keep even the most jaded of action/sci-fi/horror fans on the edge of their seat.All in all, I highly recommend PREDATOR! it's a film that ages well &amp; gets better &amp; better with each viewing. It never loses it's charm or excitement &amp; thrills, no matter how many times you may see it! Followed by four sequels (two of which saw the Predators square off against the Aliens from the ALIEN franchise) starting with PREDATOR 2**** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predator: A work of art &amp; Pure Action!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie with atmosphere &amp; spirit! 'Predator' is a modern classic and it might be one the best action-movies ever. Seldom you have the possibility to experience such well done atmosphere, filled with suspense. 'Predator' is rough, ruthless and brutal. Kevin Peter Hall steals the show as a dangerous and powerful menace. The special effects are also well made. The most powerful scene in 'Predator' is when Bill Duke together with the rest of the group stands in the forest shooting wildly all around the trees without knowing what they really are doing there! 'Predator' is similar to 'Hell in the Pacific' in it's motives with the same claustrophobia, and it has a discussion about the macho-ideal, which few seems to notice.Rating: 10 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now how do I start out reviewing the best movie ever??? Predator is not just the best sci-fi movie ever, but the best movie ever. It is Arnolds best movie. I voted 10 on this because it really is a 10 movie. It is more sci-fi then it is action. With phenomonal special effects, it got screwed at the Oscars when Innerspace beat it for best special effects! It is a must have movie! It is the best Arnold movie ever by far. Predator is a story of 7 Special Forces troops out of the Delta Force recruited by the CIA to rescue hostages from the clutches of Central American Guerillas. And once they rescue one hostage a woman named Anna played by Elpidia Carrillo, one by one Dutch's (Arnold Schwarzenegger) men are hunted by an alien hunter called a Predator. The proper name for the Predator's are Yautja. Excellent movie. No flaws. Arnolds best. Better then Star Wars (all of them), The Matrix and both Terminators. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rambo Meets Alien...Sort of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arnold Swarzenegger, the master of the one-liner, action sequences requiring huge budgets, and the acting skill of a dead snake, brings a rag-tag commando group into the South(or Central) American jungle to find a cabinet member. At least that is the story told to him by superior officer(and another "great" actor) Carl Weathers. The first half of the film(actually 40 some odd minutes) shows Arnold, Carl, and this crack commando group, which by the way is populated with the various stereotypical kind of guys like the nerdy guy with glasses making sexual jokes, the Indian that can smell danger before it happens, the rugged outdoors type(Jesse Ventura) with guts for brains, and so on)walking through the jungle, finding a group of men earlier sent in stripped to the skin, and then firing and capturing an enemy camp. Okay...pretty boring up to here, but then things get interesting as the group plus one hostage girl are preyed upon by an alien hunter ala The Most Dangerous Game. It seems the alien enjoys hunting for sport. He is an impressive alien, and mucho credit goes to the genius of Stan Winston for its creation. The alien has green, phospherescent blood, a surgical kit imbedded in its arm, and an ability to cloak itself and blend in with the jungle. You know what is going to happen every step of the way, but the film is fun and entertaining if not taken too seriously. Just don't look for great acting or some rich subtext here. You won't find it. Just some good old-fashioned man versus alien, good versus bad stuff here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Sci-Fi actioner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Arnolds best movies. Here he plays the leader for an elite army-unit who is given a mission to rescue south-american officials from left-wing terrorists in a south-american jungle. On their way to the terrorist compound one of the men sense something in the trees and they discover skinned corpses. What they dont know is that an invisible alien creature is pursuing them. It has come to earth just to hunt for sport and Arnolds group makes a perfect target. The team reaches the terrorists camp and levels it to the ground in a very well filmed action-sequence. However they dont manage to save the officials. When they return to rendez-vouz with the helicopter they are being hunted of the Predator who picks them off one by one. The Predator is a very well done film which catches you from the start. The location-filming is brilliant and so is the casting of tough characters in Arnolds team. Im specially fond of Jesse Ventura. The script is un-pretentious and straight told. The monster is a kind of Rambo-Alien. Very awesome and very intelligent with the seven foot Kevin Peter Hall in the monster make-up. As always in Arnolds films, the action scenes are of highest class. I consider this a winner and ranks it: 7 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic motion picture. A must see for all!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Predator knocks it out of the park! Even though it might appear dated at first glance, do not be fooled. This movie is a timeless classic, and is a must see for anyone who has even a remote interest in action, sci-fi, horror or adventure genres, or just loves epically awesome movies! A group of U.S. commandos is sent on a covert rescue operation, deep into the jungles of Latin America. On their way back from the mission, the members of the squad start getting killed off, one-by-one. They realize that something in the jungle is hunting them.Predator is as great as it is straightforward. The story, acting and special effects are not elaborate, but are all exceptional on their own and work extremely well together. Yes, I said acting in Predator is exceptional. It's not going to win any Oscars, but the collaboration of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Carl Weathers, along with a group of fine supporting cast members are perfect for the kind of movie that Predator is. Thus, I deem it exceptional. Same goes for character development, which effortlessly makes you feel like you've known these men for years.This movie is violent at times but it is not sadistic in nature, which is the route so many of the current action, sci-fi and horror films have chosen to take. A character's life comes to a swift, glorious and warrior-like end rather than a slow, miserable and painful finale.The Predator takes pleasure and pride in the challenge of the kill, rather than the torment of the prey. I believe this to be an important distinction that needs to be made. It shows that the Predator has a lot more in common with his prey than one would think. After all, humans have been hunting for sport for centuries. The Predator also takes his victim's skulls as trophies. The need to collect trophies of personal conquests is not unlike the behavior of many human hunters.The score in this movie is brilliant and well timed. It achieves the desired effect of heightening the tension and suspense of the film. The atmosphere created by the music is both worrisome and exciting.This movie is great because, among other aspects, it deals with the human nature. We witness a band of hard men, who pride themselves on their toughness and fearlessness, succumb to doubt and fear. To their credit, even when the commandos are facing certain doom and are clearly worried, they never panic, and fight and die with honor.The dialog is short and to the point. There are some pretty funny catch-phrases as well. This movie avoids the uncomfortable, corny state that some sci-fi, action and horror movies find themselves in, when trying to be too funny or too serious.Predator is a bastion of epic glory, a must for anyone, regardless of your creed, age or political affiliations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original Predator film is a film that I hold close to my heart. It succeeds on many levels where many similar to it have failed, like it's disappointing sequel. I'd say to begin with it had a more than decent cast to play the roles. The story has them deliver catchy one-liners throughout, but you will thoroughly enjoy it. My favorite, "I ain't got time to bleed", great stuff. But on a serious note, the story actually builds up the characters to an extent that we will actually care when they are brutally slain one-by-one. That is the single greatest failure of hundreds of films like this (like its sequel). There is a terrifying silent tension as well that adds to the atmosphere of it all.The music is pretty bad-ass, and I enjoyed it. The SX were also top notch and the predator was actually scary when I first saw it as scared sh*tless ten year old. I've seen the film hundreds if not thousands of times since, but it never gets old to me. By far my favorite scene had to be the chilling climax as the Predator prepared to kill himself and yet began to laugh quite like a human being. Downright awesome. This is a classic not to be disregarded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly suspenseful, unique sci-fi/action mix!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1987 contains 3 of the best sci-fi/action/horror films of the entire 1980s: The Hidden, Robocop, and this film I'm reviewing PREDATOR. Just further proof that Arnold Schwarzenegger is a film legend. Again, not a great thespian, but definitely a movie star. The man knew how to carry an action film (literally!) on his back. And PREDATOR is so much more than that! In 1987, PREDATOR was just another Arnie action flick. In retrospect, it is a highly involving, ominous, twisting mystery. It's about a band of Army mercenaries on a CIA-initiated rescue mission in South America. In actuality, the men were lied to by their CIA contact/companion in order to get to top secret information and that there was a previous team that was sent, and due to unknown circumstances, never made it back.Schwarzenegger plays Dutch, the team leader and Carl Weathers is the shady CIA contact Dillon and a "friend" of Dutch's, or so he thought. The rest of Dutch's team includes veteran actors Bill Duke (Mac) and Sonny Landham (Billy), as well as former wrestler-turned actor-turned Governor Jesse Ventura (Blain). This early scene of the commandos attacking the foreign camp is among the best action sequences ever! The editing, cinematography, and sound is top notch in this scene as well as throughout the movie. When watching this film, one can really feel the tension and ever-present danger that constantly engulfs this band of soldiers.The team picks up a female hostage Anna (Elpidio Carillo) who may be more than meets the eye and definitely serves a greater purpose. Upon retrieving the information and succeeding in the mission, the team heads back through the jungle to their helicopter transport. Along the way, they find the mutilated remnants of the previous team, the likes of which none of these veteran commandos has never see. This is when PREDATOR switches gears and goes from action to sci-fi/horror! An alien creature has caused all this. The team must now evade and elude this being just to survive. Once PREDATOR changes direction, it turns from just another standard one-note 80s action flick into a provocative and original horror movie. The up-to-this-point macho tough guys are now WAY out of their league! THEY are the prey! The way the team deals with this new development is excellently scripted, acted, and directed and never devolves into parody or silliness. It actually seems like it could happen, making this film an all-time action classic.Also amazingly for an 80s film, PREDATOR does not have a dated look, which adds to it's universal appeal. It doesn't look "80s" at all, mainly due to the jungle setting, classy camera-work, cinematography, costume design, and the brilliant look of the Predator. Effectively combining action, sci-fi, mysticism, and horror, PREDATOR is an enduring 80s standout!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Action Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Predator is a great action film that combines military action with outer space creatures. A group of top notch military soldiers soon find that they are being hunted by a mysterious being. First off I want to say that the cast is really good in this film. Schwarzenneggar gives one of his best performances in a film and definitely one of his most under rated. He has a lot of great one liners ("stick around", "knock knock") as well. Carl Weathers also is great in this film and I think he is one of the best supporting actors in the films that he is in notably "Rocky" and "Happy Gilmore". ALso you can not go wrong with Jessie Ventura in an action film. The Predator in this film is pretty cool. I like how they do not give away what he looks like right away to build suspense. The idea of a creature that blends in to the surroundings and kills is pretty cool. The Predator gets to do a lot of killing in this film and is a pretty good bad guy for a film.THere is no shortage of action in this film. Right off the bat there is a great gun fire battle between Schwarrzenneggars crew and some foreign country, I forget who they are. Then you have the Predator going against the entire group and an epic battle between Schwarzenneggar and the Predator one on one. Of all the Predator films this is the best by far and I strongly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An All Time Great Action Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Think of Arnold and only two images can flash in our minds. One image is the black dress, shotgun and black goggles image of the Terminator series and the other image is that of a Green Beret as we see in Commando and this movie. This movie, The Predator, is a wonderful action movie that showcases Arnold flexing his muscles to the full, holding the meanest of guns and firearms and hunting for something that cannot be seen but is definitely out there. The movie is my personal favorite action movie of all times.The movie is about a team of special commandos led by Dutch, played by Arnold. They head out into the forest thinking that their enemies are humans. And indeed, they find their human enemies and crush them in no time. Little do they know that out there in the forest, there is a bigger and a tougher enemy hunting them down one by one. Meet The Predator, some kind of an alien life form with a very unique set of characteristics. He cannot sense the usual 3800-7600 Angstrom wavelength of light that allows us humans to see the world but he only reads off the heat given out by living creatures. He makes up for this with an incredible array of powerful weapons and the greatest advantage of them all - camouflage! Not just any camouflage but the ability to almost disappear completely. He moves around from one tree to another patiently spotting the team members of Dutch and killing them one by one.The direction and photography of the movie is simply awesome. As we see Dutch and his team wade through the forest, it really feels like we are watching some live coverage of a mission. The scenes are really well shot and at no time do we get the feeling that this is a studio set and the guns are arms are all props. The most remarkable scene of all is when all the commandos fire all their weapons into a direction hoping to shoot down the Predator. The shower of bullets and the firing of the mini-gun is simply breath taking. And considering that the movie was shot back in 1986-7, the overall movie is simply great.The final mano-e-mano encounter between Arnold and the Predator is remarkably well done. This movie is indeed one of the greatest science fiction action movies ever done. A movie that Arnie will be remembered for. Enjoy!</fullReview>

Soon they discover a sneaky alien creature who begins to hunt down the team, it begins to slaughter them one by one as Duke must fight this murderous unseen force.A suspenseful and really violent Sci-fi horror action thriller has became a genre favorite over the years thanks to it's box-office success and fan base. There is plenty of action and gore to please even the most die-hard action and Sci-fi fan but not for the squeamish, but it's action and pacing never lets down the viewer. The special effects are good for it's time and the monster is very unique and different as it has any type of technology designed by Stan Winston.A true 80's Sci-fi action classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must congratulate the cast and crew on the fine job they did on Predator. it succeeds and has become such a classic because it observes religiously important and easily overlooked or in-advisably tampered with rules regarding such films; namely, it doesn't require more then a basic and easily digested premise, with, at best, plenty of intriguing and important sounding back-story hinted at through dialogue (which ties in with the slow exposition of the predator); it doesn't rush said exposition of the main villain, especially in the predator's case, defamiliarising the role of the soldiers in the jungle, camouflaged and stalking the prey that earlier on were the ones taking out the central American/Russian/whoevers and trying to rescue some important sounding figures; it whole heartedly enters into the spirit of the situation and the characters, restricting our exposition to their own revelations as they happen, thus involving the viewer more effectively; and finally the cheap humour is timed and executed to perfection, not overkilled - like, say, bill Paxton did in the sequel in trying so embarrassingly to emulate Hawkins - and delivered with panache and offbeat ease, and the special effects, kept to a premium and revealed in glimpses before the glorious conclusion unfolded, is again not overkilled and used brilliantly in minimalism.this is how to make a good SF thriller. there are flaws, in my opinion, slight ones in plot, and i'll go into them now just to give a sense of perspective; the film is by no means perfect. the predator does a sephiroth, which basically means he is hilariously overpowered, and although that is one of the things that makes him awesome, it also means that his equipment breaks or is discarded out of a warped sense of sport and his complacency and lack of urgency in finishing dutch off leads to his demise, as happens when sephiroth comes to fight cloud. this is all part of the action movie mantra, which must end with a rugged, war-torn and utterly homo-f'ing-sapiens i-just-owned-an-ET-warrior powerful man, Arnie effortlessly breathing the role throughout, surviving beatings that would bring down buildings, a shoulder cannon shot that burned through everything and everyone else it hit in the movie, a damned nuclear bomb and assorted falls and impacts relatively unscathed. he's goddamn dutch Schaefer, that's why. other slight imperfections = the soldiers figure out the predator's game pretty quickly, and are able to predict motivations, why they're being attacked etc. Arnie's forces seemed to discard any worries about the guerrillas swarming the area once it started to dawn on them that an invisible and clearly extra terrestrial warrior was the real nemesis, as well as seeming unconcerned about the chance either guerrilla or said beast would attack them while they built their traps, and the helicopter, which wouldn't cross the border earlier, seemed to have no qualms about doing so once the predator's bomb went off, and with the army chief on board and all.all of those little niggling plot simplicities and conveniences are merely observations of a pedant. they prevent this film from being perfect, but significantly, it would be less fun if it were more complex, intelligent - from a plot perspective anyway - and plausible. it is still one of the elite SF films, reasons given in the first paragraph. it doesn't look dated now, because the wardrobe and the cinematography, the shot selection - example: the predator shooting at the trees after dutch shoots him with his explosive arrow, showing the whole area, the little predator silhouette with missiles of light firing into the trees, example: Dillon and Mac looking looking at the predator through the trees; the setting helped the shot selection pick itself, anyway, but they nailed it each and every time for a feast for the eyes, after all the carefully and minimally revealed exposition - and the style of filming all lend an atmosphere to a setting that can't age quickly and that remains timeless, effective and immersive even now, and it presents a veritable feast of effective aspects of atmosphere and exposition for the budding film maker to learn from, and the viewer to enjoy.and besides all that, the predator was fantastic. bizarre and positively alien motivations and intentions, a hunter for the sake of it, elegant, vicious and deadly, with functional and dirty but effective and sleek equipment and an approach to hunting that denoted graft and perverse machismo, and sheer strength as well as fearsome weaponry. he was played masterfully, and the complacency which led to his undoing and the simplicity in which dutch finished him are tolerable when weighed against his awesome strength, brutality and demonstrated power. a great creation, that was not quite represented adequately in the sequel - compensated with the ending on the ship; not like the 2 AvP movies which relied on sheer idiocy, complacency on a less forgivable or believable level on the part of the predator race, as well as implausible and hard to digest back story and illogically pointless enterprises conducted on earth, unlike the hint given at the end of predator 2. comics, games and movies have created a fan-base who have been largely betrayed by overkill exposition and poorly conceived plotting that has ruined and cheapened the mystique constructed in this movie, only really maintained in the sequel, the game AvP 2 and perhaps a handful of comics. it remains a pleasure to indulge in and be awed by that mystique on subsequent viewings of Predator.it's a visceral, engaging, simple, macho, atmospheric, glorious, intriguing SF thriller about a mysterious alien warrior wreaking havoc in a central American jungle, stalking and butchering an elite unit of American soldiers on a mission, headed by Arnie, a film that presents the optimal SF thriller experience in all facets, that is also cooler then almost anything else you're ever likely to see.mine's as big as a house! oh baby! havin me some fun tonight!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Predator is a great movie, here is why.Characters - They are very lovable. I enjoyed the cheesiness, the one liners, and over the top action from them, it just fit with the movie. You felt sad for Mac when Blain died, scared when Hawkins died, you feared for the characters as they went through the jungle, hoping they weren't about to get attacked. McTiernan did an excellent job making these characters who they are.Setting - The jungle is perfect as the predator's playground, bar none.Acting - The acting in this movie is fine, I don't know why people have anything against it.Special effects - Oh my god, the cloak is one of the finest effects I have seen in my life. The way it fits into the jungle is just perfect. Cloak, uncloaking, the whole nine yards.Score - Haha this is a pretty awesome score, it fits with the movie. Suspense, acting, sadness, horror, etc.The actual predator - A space alien that uses various weapons and comes to earth to hunt worthy prey. Need I say more? This creature is a BADASS, I even think it rivals the alien as best sci-fi creature ever created.In conclusion, predator is one of the best movies to ever be made. More film makers should watch this as a documentary on how to make a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb action film. One of Arnie's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Predator comes from Die Hard director John McTiernan. McTiernan is one of my favourite action film directors. Maybe because his action films are not all slam-bang spectacle. They actually come with a brain attached. Die Hard is an absolute classic of the genre. My all time favourite action film. It was the success of Predator that led to McTiernan netting Die Hard. And Predator's just as excellent as anything else the underrated McTiernan has done.Predator is one of the most ferocious action films to ever emerge from Hollywood. Its such a gruelling experience, you're left physically drained. The idea behind it is simplicity itself. But McTiernan's confident and muscular direction elevates Predator to classic status.An alien hunter arrives on Earth and stalks the jungles of Central America. It encounters a group of commandos on a rescue mission, and picks them off one by one.I suppose Predator has borrowed liberally from recent hits of the time like Aliens and Rambo. But that doesn't change the fact that Predator is supremely entertaining. It doesn't have much in the way of characterisation or plot, and the characters are thinly sketched ciphers, but its impossible not to get swept away by the sheer thrill of it all.It seems inevitable that Arnold Schwarzenegger would be cast in the starring role. At the time of Predator's release he was the most popular action star of the moment. And although Arnie is typically wooden throughout, he's more than in his element here.Wisely McTiernan knows how to play to Arnie's strengths. He directs the action sequences so breathlessly that Arnie's severe limitations as an actor might go right by you. And in the final 25 minutes the film really comes into its own.The whole of the commando unit have been wiped out, and its only Dutch (Arnie's character) and the Predator left. McTiernan stages the final confrontation as a battle to the death between two warriors. And its gripping stuff.Few action films grab with such a tight choke-hold. McTiernan really knows how to milk the scenario for all its worth. Dutch is forced to revert to primal, baser instincts. Stripped of all his weaponry, he relies upon common mud as natural camouflage, homemade bows and arrows, and eventually just his own fists. A conflict that's all the more stunning for being told in almost complete silence. One of the most intense climaxes to ever grace the action film genre.In regards to the Predator himself, played by the late Kevin Peter Hall, he's an impressive creation. For the design work, McTiernan has brought in the great Stan Winston. He's the maestro of marvels when it comes to special effects work. And in designing the Predator, he's really outdone himself.One of the loveliest touches to Predator is that we never actually get to see it properly until the very end. Beforehand, we witness the Predator's capabilities and inhumanity. The special effects work is superb for 1987, but then that's to be expected of the high standards of Stan Winston.The Predator's built in cloaking device is astonishing. Its chameleon ability to blend in with the surrounding jungle is quite amazing. As is its plasma cannon. And best of all, the most inspired touch to the film is getting to see the world through the Predator's eyes. His vision provides a bewildering landscape of hyper-realised body heat and jungle foliage. The Predator is as impressive as any of Hollywood's greatest monsters. From the Alien to King Kong.If the film has any faults they're only minor ones. Arnie can't resist getting in a few cringeworthy puns (that I will charitably suppress). And outside of the action, there isn't much else to the film. But few films driven purely by action provide this much satisfaction. It's a shame that John McTiernan's career has hit a slump. His action films are of a rare intelligence not often found in the genre. I like to watch Predator and Die Hard whenever I can to remind myself of the time when John McTiernan was among the finest and most respected action filmmakers in the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generic action flick with a killer villain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually find this to be a rather generic action movie and, if not for the Predator, I probably wouldn't even enjoy it. There's not a lot to this film other than big explosions and lots of shooting. Now, while that may be all there is, it is very well-done. It never lets up with the action and it's always entertaining. But the characters are paper-thin, the story is very weak, and the dialogue barely consists of more than grunts and yells. The Predator itself is an ingenious creation, though, and that's what makes this film good. All the amazing technology it possesses, combined with its monstrous exterior and angry demeanour - makes for a great movie creature. I love its laugh just as its about to self-destruct. Overall, a good but rather unimpressive action flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has been one of my most favorite movies since I was probably about 5 years old. It's such an awesome action movie, violent and intense.Lets not forget about Arnold, in perhaps his greatest role ever. Who else can enter in fist fight with the Predator and take such a beating? Danny Glover cheated I say!! Sure the movie is completely unbelievable like 'Commando', especially in the early gun fight scenes, but that doesn't keep you from enjoying it. This movie reminds you that being cheesy or over the top can still be fun. And that Arnold's one-liners never disappoint.I don't think they can make a movie with the Predator that will ever be this great. There was an opportunity in Alien vs Predator, but most people believed they failed with that.I can't count how many times I've seen this movie, it just never gets old. If you haven't watched it... you're missing out on a classic!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>RAMBO meets ALIEN.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: Flawed yet exciting variation of ALIEN crossed with RAMBO.I really love this sci-fi/action thriller, definitely one of this best of its kind(next to "Alien" and its sequel "Aliens"). Arnold Schwarzenegger is perfect for the role, the special-effects are awesome and Stan Winston's terrifically designed creature combine to make it an all-time favorite in the genre. Schwarzenegger leads a group of commandos in the Central American jungle, only to get hunted by an intelligent and cunning alien, with weapons unlike ours. The Predator should really astound inventors with its advance technology. The film also has much of the qualities of commando movies like "Rambo:First Blood" and sci-fi terror of "Alien" (hence my review title). Schwarzenegger uses much of the weapons he has, but he's still quite heroic like Stallone was in "Rambo". The Predator looks and acts quite like an "Alien" from the said 1979 film. Slick, unpredictable and fast. The sequel "Predator 2" is also good, but the showdown "Alien vs. Predator" is truly awful. But the original is still a great film, even on today's standards.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neo-classic creature feature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While there is very little science in this science fiction/action/horror flick, it is one of the better monster/alien movies out there. As a neo-classic, it is a classic out of the "classic" period, which generates the same kind of loyalty as does a "true" classic.Riveting portrayals, realistic enactments within the most suspenseful setting I've ever experienced, and cast perfectly, this is one for the collection, regardless of your tastes.This movie relies heavily on the unknown. It leads you down a jungle-dark path into oblivion. It shoves you, step by step, into the awaiting maw of the enemy and only slowly begins to let you see what you are up against. Excellent direction which makes you live the experience of being hunted, marks and colors this production in such a way as to endear it to the audiences for all time. It keeps you glued to the screen until the final sequences play themselves through.I rate it a rousing 9/10.the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aaah the 80s. The decade of the stupid jock &amp; the Awesome action movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nowadays "Big Dumb Action" is not likely to be put on the movie poster, as nothing Big and Dumb could possibly be entertaining, but my counter argument might be what about reality TV? OK bad example, there is nothing entertaining about reality TV.Predator harks back to a simpler time, when anything non-human needed a bullet, or better yet thousands, and the musclier you were the more likely it was you would win.Arnold is Dutch, and he and his team of well muscled meat-heads with names like Poncho, Blaine, Billy and Mack are venturing into the deep jungle with Dylan (Carl Weathers) in tow to represent the brass. This well trained and professional unit are used to this though, this is their job, they actually move through the dense jungle like soldiers not cowboys, everyone moves in unison without instruction aside from a quick whistle and a point or signal where necessary. Moving on, Dutch and co are on a search and rescue mission, only very early on they find there is precious little worth rescuing, and that most traces of those that needed rescuing will fit into a couple of jam jars. There are no tracks and little evidence that the deceased knew what was happening even as it happened... which is a concern to Dutch as the victims were all highly trained soldiers.As they continue on their mission it becomes evident that they are all being watched, Billy their Indian (looking at least) point man seems to twig first, he is Indian after all! After a pretty great gun battle where the good guys slaughter the bad with no casualties aside from a scratched arm (thank the Lord that Blaine "Didn't have time to bleed", that could have been serious!) the crew continue through to the extraction point with a young female hostage in tow. This is where the movie gets good-er-er.The previously unseen onlooker progressively becomes more evident, either he is lazier or they just thought the "clickle-lickle-lickle" sound effect wasn't going to be enough on it's own. In saying that though I guarantee if you play that two second grab to any guy under 50 and 90% of those guys will instantly recognise the origins, the other 10% are re-watching Avatar for the 11thtime and spanking it to the 8ft Zoe Soldana creature. Prove me wrong sticky hands! The Predator tracks the soldiers using a heat registering device, initially he is content just to watch and learn. He apparently has a sense of fairness and only hunts those that might prove a worthy adversary, therefore the unarmed are left alone. The Predator "Ain't ferm around heyre", that much is obvious, it engages sophisticated cloaking devices to blend in with the surroundings, which means that only the audience can see it most of the time for some reason.After the initial kill there is a brief sighting that leads to approximately three kajillion rounds being unleashed, leveling an area that I think now is used to graze the entire MacDonalds herd.From this point the Predator turns serial killer, picking off the soldiers one by one and taking various trophies for himself (think spines and skulls rather than earrings and wallets), he is a seemingly invincible killing machine that appears destined to kill off the entire cast without so much as breaking a sweat.We learn because the female hostage tells us that "only in the hottest years this happens", and that the Predator is essentially a game hunter here on a bit of a safari of sorts. The news that this is simply a lark for him is a sobering thought to the trained soldiers he is toying with, so Dutch decides that they have no choice but to kill it. Bold words, but a few minutes later and it is a 1 on 1 battle between two huge gargantuan looking behemoths, one an alien incapable of discernible speech who communicates in clicks and grunts, the other is the Predator.The Predator itself looks like a rasta-crab complete with dreadlocks and four alternately movable fangs, I'm not sure how the creature effects were done but for 20 + year old work they are pretty masterful and seamless and hold up extremely well today, in fact the effects on the AVP movies are distractingly dodgy or in some cases CG, strange given that technology should make things more convincing.The final fight involves Arnold taking it old-school and eschewing weapons to rely on his wits and primitive fighting methods, that should be a problem but after the biggest preparation montage in cinematic history the Big Dumb Action sequence that closes the movie is excellent and caps off proceedings nicely.Arnold is at his super-buffest and most action-friendly. The Predator itself, a super-cool creation (like the Terminator) that is both scary, daunting and admirable, a worthy adversary and after the Terminator almost the ultimate bad guy. It most definitely helped that the creature design and effects made the character totally convincing and realistic.Often imitated but never bettered, Predator is an awesome action sci-fi experience. Rather than watching the Danny Glover sequel (OK) or the new Predators reboot (also OK), or the excrement that was AVP and sequel, check out the best. First.Final Rating - 8.5 / 10. Big Dumb Action is very rarely this Fun. There's a reason why the Clickle-lickle-lickle sound effect and the washed out heat vision the Predator employs are so memorable to so many guys. They are Awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure action bliss.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The year before he turned Bruce Willis into a bona fide movie star with his hugely successful and highly influential hit Die Hard, director John McTiernan gave Arnold Schwarzeneggar's film career a huge boost with sci-fi flavoured blockbuster Predator, an explosive, testosterone fuelled piece of gung-ho action packed with extreme violence, macho posturing, memorable dialogue, cool one-liners, big guns, and even bigger muscles.In what is arguably his finest film, the Austrian bodybuilder plays Dutch, leader of a group of highly trained commandos who specialise in rescuing hostages. After the team are duped by shady CIA agent Dillon (Carl Weathers) into taking part in a seek and destroy mission in a Central American jungle, they find themselves being stalked by an unseen enemy: an extraterrestrial hunter visiting Earth with the intention of adding a few more human skulls to his trophy cabinet.Aided by a high-tech cloaking device, heat vision, and a shoulder mounted laser cannon, the creature kills the men one-by-one, until only Dutch is left standing, and the scene is set for an unforgettable final showdown.With taut, no-nonsense direction from McTiernan (hard to believe this is the same guy who gave us the abysmal Rollerball remake), a rousing score from Alan Silvestri that perfectly complements the breath-taking action, and amazing visual effects that are way ahead of their time, Predator is a blast from start to finish (quite literally!).The film also benefits immensely from the cool-as-f@%k cast who play Dutch's impossibly tough team (which includes director Bill Duke, ex-wrestler Jesse Ventura, screenwriter Shane Black, and Native American Sonny Landham), the gratuitous glorification of high-powered weaponry (let's hear it for the mini-gun!), plus one of sci-fi cinemas's most memorable monsters, designed by FX genius Stan Winston and played by 7' 2?" tall Kevin Peter Hall (both of whom are sadly no longer with us).Put simply, as far as action films go, it doesn't get much better than Predator.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, I know this is a low-grade simple story, one of those action flicks that oozes with too much testosterone.....but so what.? Every once in a while, it's a nice release to sit back and get lost in a scary movie set in the jungle. I don't know anyone who ever dozed asleep watching this, so it's not all bad. It's actually a fun movie.Despite the moronic and unlikeable characters who uttered some stupid dialog, the movie gets you very involved and is one of the better pure-action movies I've ever seen. The jungle scenery is outstanding to view on DVD. This is a pretty movie for such low-grade material, story-wise. I watched it a second time just for the visuals.The ending, with Arnold Schwarzenegger battling the alien, goes on too long. Had this film been cut to 80 minutes, it would have much better. Still, if you want a fairly short movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat with great suspense, without having to tax your braincells, this is highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised my just how much I liked this movie. It's the apotheosis of American military firepower and 'gung-ho', cleverly pitted against a single, jungle-dwelling enemy. It works brilliantly well.The movie divides into three parts, each with a distinct feel, and this keeps it interesting from beginning to end:1. A US special forces unit attacking an enemy military force. 2. The unit being picked off one by one by a mysterious 'predator' and futilely trying to defeat it with firepower. 3. Hand to hand combat between the predator and the unit's leader, 'Dutch'.Dutch is played by Arnold Schwarzenegger at the peak of his powers - he is iconic in this film. It's hard to imagine there ever being a better action hero.The film delivers on gratuitous, easy-watching violence. The are lots and lots (and lots) of munitions, deployed with gusto by the characters to noisy and visually satisfying effect.But it delivers on drama too. The soldiers are all testosterone-fuelled prats, of course, but they each have distinctive and memorable characters and are given their fair share of screen-time. There is brilliant tension worthy of a horror movie, as the true nature of the Predator is revealed bit by bit as it picks off the other characters.And the Dutch versus Predator climax is just superb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Continuing my plan to watch every Arnie movie in order, I come to his first multi million dollar pay day ($3,000,000) in Predator.Plot In A Laragraph: A special team of commandos on a mission in a Central American jungle are hunted by an extra terrestrial killer.Predator is quite simply one of the best action movies ever made. End of.It starts off like "Rambo" and ends up like "Aliens". It even has shades of "Jaws" thrown in, as the Predator is not actually shown on screen for about an hour, we see everything from then through it's eyes. The likable cast is headed by Arnie with steady support from Carl Weathers, Shane Black, Billy Duke, Sonny Ladham and Jesse Ventura. All the lead characters seem nice people to hang out and have a beer with, and an even better bunch of guys to go in to battle with. As they kick some serious ass in the first 30 minutes. I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here, as they all do an excellent job. Some of the cast were never as good before this movie, and never were again.Black is quite good in one of his rare spells in front of the camera, Ventura does what Ventura does,Ladham is effective as Billy and Weathers gives his best performance outside of the Rocky franchise, Although when he tells Arnie he is "Expendable" I couldn't help but think, if only those movies were as good as this. As for Arnie, who has contributed some tough fisted, hard as nails characters over the years. He'll never be a good dramatic actor, but he is a great action star and he has charisma in spades!! He is perfectly cast here. Behind "Terminator 2" this is his best movie ahead of True Lies. The score is another valuable asset to the movie, it's perfect.In his autobiography Total Recall, Arnie talks about how along with producers Lawrence Gordon and Joel Silver he picked John McTiernan to direct (even though he only had one movie to his name) and when (following the success of this and Die Hard) they couldn't afford to hire him to direct the sequel, and he read the scrip (which Silver wouldn't change) he walked away from the franchise, and never worked with Silver again. He mentions Van Danme (the original Predator being a "relentless complainer" and calls the full experience "an ordeal" Finishing the year, the 12th highest grossing movie of 1987, With a $59 million gross, Predator was a career high for Arnie, and his first movie to break the $50 million barrier at the domestic Box Office. To sum it up Predator is a highly professional piece of work, swift and suspenseful, with a good sense of pace and atmosphere it makes for perfect entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie of all time!!! Rating: 10/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is perfect at so many different levels that I will try to point most of them:First: The beginning of the movie is awesome - simple and powerful at the same time. Second: The music of the movie is thrilling, manly and penetrating which makes the atmosphere exactly like to be in a dangerous jungle. Every scene has it's own music which makes suspense even better. Third: The script: to the point and straight forward for the elite squad who are the hunters, until it makes a twist, and when the Predator came they become hunted. Fourth: The characters are simply perfect and there is no other actors who could play these roles as better as them. The general - excellent, with few lines and exact orders. Dutch - the perfect leader, strong, the biggest of the group, muscular as hell, composed and collected. Dillon - a little smaller than Dutch, cunning and determined to fulfill his own mission, after all succeeded until the moment the Predator came. Anna - great as portraying their prisoner. Mac - the best acting in the movie of all the actors in it, first in the scene where he saw the Predator, second after the shooting and third - his monologue about his buddy Blane. Blane - excluding Dutch, the biggest macho in the squad, and in real life the only actor in the movie who actually experienced war and being a real soldier. Billy - the powerful, big, strange, dark and foreboding Indian with his own code of war. Poncho - tough, almost as the big guys and with great lines in the movie, always helps when it counts. Hawkins - the perfect radio soldier with the sexist jokes to cheer up the others, and he would've been distinctive without his glasses. The Predator - great super tall actor who makes Dutch look small.Fifth - The effects - way ahead of it's time. Great even watching at 2016. May be the best effects an action movie ever made. Sixth - The lines - How can you forget: "Get to the chopper!", "If it bleeds we can kill it!", "Any time.", "I ain't got time to bleed", "Stick around", "You're one ugly mother f&amp;ck&amp;r" and many more. Seventh - The atmosphere of the movie is makes you feel you are one of them or the Predator. Hence: if you're an Action Sci-Fi Horror fan this is the best movie for you. For me it's the best of all time, because I've watched it more than 500-600 times and still watch it today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Predator is about as testosterone supercharged as you could possibly get in a movie. Every actor is pumped up. It has tough dialogue, big guns, and lots of macho action. Throw in a cool alien with amazing special effects and you have pure guy movie nirvana. It doesn't hurt matters that it was the film that John McTiernan directed right before making Die Hard. It established that he could really handle action. The storyline is enthralling and certainly creates interest. The cast of this film was perfect. It was a real ensemble piece with Schwarzenegger in the lead. In fact, I think Arnold was helped tremendously by the additional cast. He didn't have to carry the whole movie on his shoulders and they helped elevate the level of acting and characterization. You had Carl Weathers as the CIA agent. He seems more than a physical match for Schwarzenegger and he definitely acts better. You also had Bill Duke as Sgt. 'Mac' Eliot. His quiet, intense gaze said more than anything else he did. You had Jesse Ventura playing the tough, tobacco chewing, gun toting guy who ain't got time to bleed".Now the Predator himself is amazing: he's tall, silent, tough and armed to the teeth with some incredible otherworldly technology. He's more than a worthy opponent for Dutch and his crew, and every aspect of the Predator is interesting, terrifying and awe-inspiring. The attention to detail on the Predator character is simply phenomenal, and we actually learn a lot about this violent yet intelligent invader through this film. McTiernan has developed and presented believable and interesting, multi-dimensional, complex characters; and the Predator is certainly unsurpassed as a character in the genre of Sci-Fi. It's just total genius!Overall rating: 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Step Forward in the Action Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Predator is directed by John McTiernan and is the story of a group of testosterone fueled men that are sent on a mission in Central America and end up being forced to fight a being much beyond their comprehension and abilities combined. This thing is targeting them all, picking them off one by one. It kills for sport and "decorates" the dead bodies. Dutch, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger must lead his team in this battle of the fates, pitting predator against prey.Predator is easily one of the best action movies ever made. Everything contained in this film is pure masculinity, from a close up of Dutch and Dillon's (Carl Weathers) biceps when shaking hands, to Arnie covering himself in mud so that the predator's vision of him is obscured. This movie screams testosterone, and I love every second of it. However, I feel that a girl could enjoy the movie as well. It's not just a film made for manly men, it's made for lovers of action, whether that be a man, a woman, or a little kid that likes explosions and gunfire.The best thing about this film is the memorability factor. Anyone who is a regularly movie goer should be able to recall the first time they saw this film, just because of how memorable it is. At least two or three lines in this film are everyday terms, including "If it bleeds, we can kill it," to the ever-so-famous "get to the choppa!" This movie is very memorable, and forever will be an icon for the action genre.The direction and cinematography throughout the film are also pretty great. Each shot captures the Central American jungle very well, engulfing the audience in the environment that these men are in. There are a few smaller jump scares throughout the movie, and the suspense is expressed very well, thanks to the camera angles, and any other element that factors into the few seconds leading to the jump, including the rising background music, and the actors' facial expression. This is how action and suspense should be filmed; not shaky cam.This leads into my next and final point, which is the acting. All of the actors, from Arnie to Carl Weathers, to Jesse Ventura (who plays Blain) do amazing. They, like mentioned before, capture the masculinity this film brings to the table majorly, and the viewer can tell they have all transformed in one way or another for their role. Arnold Schwarzenegger actually lost about 20 pounds or so for this film, because he figured that a military man would be muscular and lean, not just a barge, like he formerly was.Overall, Predator is a great step forward in the action genre, and brought many new factors to the table. The film is near flawless, and definitely deserves an A+, or a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

Two sequels, Predator 2 (1990) and Predators (2010), as well as two crossover films with the Alien franchise, Alien vs. Predator (2004) and Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (2007), have been produced.

		<shortDescription>Welcome to the jungle...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a 12 year old back in 1987 and loving action movies, then "Predator" was a movie that was hard to miss, especially since Arnold Schwarzenegger was really one of the biggest action hero names back then.Who isn't familiar with the "Predator" franchise by now? And if you are not familiar with it, seriously? Where have you been since 1987? The whole "Alien" and "Predator" franchise and universe is just great, be it in movie, game, comic book format or any other possible format.The storyline in the 1987 classic action Sci-Fi is a group of commandos are brought into the Central American jungle in order to find and retrieve the personnel of a downed helicopter. But it is not just the heat and the jungle that is a threat to the commandos; they find themselves being hunted by a deadly extraterrestrial hunter.The ensemble of actors in the movie was quite good for an action Sci-Fi movie, and people were well-cast. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Carl Weathers really carried the movie quite well. And there was a great line up of support actors as well. And lets not forget the memorable predator itself, portrayed by Kevin Peter Hall.There is a really good mood to the movie, and you feel like you are right there in the humid, dense jungle with the commandos and having to look over your shoulder all the time because of the predator.For a late 1980's action Sci-Fi movie, then the entire movie is just crawling with one-liners, and of course the most epic of all being Arnold Schwarzenegger's "get to the chopper".The effects in "Predator" were quite good and did help the movie along quite nicely. Special effects and creature effects are essential to a movie such as "Predator", and the special effects team really outdid themselves with this movie. I love the design of the predator, it is just a timeless piece of work."Predator" is an action Sci-Fi movie that you can watch again and again. And if you haven't seen this entertaining movie already, time to get in gear and get to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predator is the single greatest Sci-Fi Action-Adventure of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John McTiernan's masterpiece came about in 1987 and it stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Kevin Peter Hall and a few other actors. Whilst in the Central American jungle, an elite team of Soldiers are hunted one by one by a highly-skilled Alien warrior.The film is absolutely brilliant due to its action and mysterious concept. The Predator, is by far one of the most awesome looking villains out of any movie ever made. At first when you see the Predator he is in his rather invisible-like shield/camouflage. You then see him later on in the movie, and he is fully out of his shield-flage and is wearing a silver helmet/mask, and you can see his body. Then towards the end of the film you see his face and it's so awesome. I really enjoy watching this movie because it was one of the very first science-fiction and action movies I remember seeing years ago. Its dialogue is actually pretty good too, considering there's only a handful of actors and one actress in the entire movie. Schwarzenegger nails the role as Dutch, the leader of the elite team. This, alongside Terminator, is Schwarzenegger's greatest movie role. Well, maybe add Jack Slater, too.Great weaponry was created for the Predator to use, and it's all very technologically, futuristic like gear including a plasma cannon (caster) and expandable wrist blades. He also has nets, smart-discs, a self-destruct sequence and a combi-stick (sphere), but they're not used in the first Predator movie, but rather the later ones.I really enjoy the ending of the film when Dutch, the sole male survivor of the elites, is up against the Predator on a one-on-one battle, in which he uses mud to block the Predator's heat vision. Smart-thinking. Of course this backfires when Dutch jumps into a waterfall without remembering that his mud will come off in action with the water, leading the Predator, after being beaten in a set of games by Dutch, to furiously grab him by his neck, and then try and intimidate him by removing his mask and showing is extra-terrestrial face. The movie as a whole is amazing, but it starts getting even better around an hour into it. Predator is one of my all time favorites and I always enjoy watching it. I have lost count on how many times I have seen it, but it's definitely always remained relevant and never gets old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best brilliant original action Classic film of all time, and NOT because of the CGI.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Predator is a 1987 American science fiction action film directed by John McTiernan and distributed by 20th Century Fox. Starring: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers and Kevin Peter Hall. Predator was written by Jim and John Thomas in 1985, under the working title of Hunter. Filming began in April 1986 and creature effects were devised by Stan Winston. The film's budget was around $15 million. Released in the United States on June 12, 1987, it grossed $98,267,558. This is the finest action movie of all time. And, yet, believe it or not, it's not the action in the film itself that makes this be the case. This is the best action film with multiple huge explosions, with thousands of bullets fired, and scores of stuntman used. Predator (1987) the original film and far more superior of the sequels, it is more brilliant, smart, genius, amazing, fast paced and highly entertained fantastic movie ever made. It is an Epic Classic Sci-fi Action flick movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers and the rest of his team, that are all the time in the jungle hunted by an alien Predator,that's what makes this film and the story so fast paced and brilliant interesting. This one is even short and very fast paced, you never get bored or you fall a sleep. My favorite best Action Sci-Fi Flick movie was always Predator and It always will be. Is my number 2 best Action Sci-Fi Epic movie. With Terminator 2: Judgment Day I love this movie to death! Of all three Predator movies my favorite and best one ever it is Predator with Arnold Schwarzenegger best action movie ever. This one was my first movie in childhood that I watch it first. The story is set in the Amazon Jungle, "Jesse Ventura was wearing (MTV t-shirt) during the filming of this movie" Cast was wonderful and they made a terrific job. When you watch this movie you completely forgot about your worries you just enjoy this movie and you just fall for this movie. Predator (1987) is my personal second favorite best Arnold Schwarzenegger movie out there that it is. The Terminator (1987), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) and Predator (1987) are Arnold Schwarzenegger iconic films that made Arnold in to a star today and he become one of the most memorable heroes of all time. His characters are more famous today than they ever were. I can't think of any action film from the 1980s more masculine than Predator. It's called Predator, which, let's face it, immediately calls to mind hunting and, well, serial killing?typically macho occupations. Soldiers are found skinned alive in the jungle, Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) sends a generator-powered truck into an enemy camp, blowing it to kingdom come, and Billy (Sonny Landham) wields a giant machete that he uses to rake a jagged wound across his own chest, this is a bad ass amazing scene. Predator is dreadlocked, mandible-mouthed alien with a pulse cannon fantastic. A team of commandos on a mission in a Central American jungle find themselves hunted by an extra-terrestrial warrior. That's your basic plot. Deep in the jungle, several bodies have been discovered skinned and hanging from trees - although who or what could done this is a mystery. Military covert specialist Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his team are called in to eliminate the threat, but once in the heart of menacing jungle, they discover something far worse than they could ever have imagined - the Predator - an alien which has come to Earth with cloaking technology, extensive combat skills and a desire to hunt humans for sport. The now-iconic creature design nearly steals the show?the "predator" is scary, bad ass, tribal, and high-tech all at once?but what really makes the film is how fun it is. This is a movie that has no delusions about what it's supposed to do: entertain. The action certainly delivers?the film has a kill count that almost hits 70?and the interactions between the characters are, if a bit campy in retrospect, frequently hilarious. This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and CGI Without the vision. The special effect creating the creature - predator are fantastic. The action sequences and combat battles in the jungle with the creature alien is the bad ass mother of all awesomeness ever. The film switches from the horrors of war to the horrors of, well, being stalked through the rainforest by an intergalactic hunter with infrared vision, a cloaking device, and sci-fi weaponry. One by one, the soldiers get picked off?you could call Predator an action/slasher?and each successive kill ups the gore quotient. With these players set in motion, it's up to the script to deliver the real substance of the movie. (One often sees great performances in mediocre films... here the story transcends the performances -- an impressive feat.) The script delivers. The film is absolutely filled with great, classic moments (I counted TEN all-star ones during my last viewing), and they're evenly spaced through the movie. The gunplay is delivered in perfect McTiernan-Schwarzenegger style (as opposed to the slo-mo John Woo-style) - you'll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons, and you'll see them used well. The film is violent, bloody, but ALL of the mean-spirited violence is dealt by the evil alien creature character - predator.10/10 Score: bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: 20TH Century Fox, Silver Pictures Starring: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers Bill Duke, Jesse Ventura, Kevin Peter Hall Director: John McTiernan Producer: Lawrence Gordon, John Davis Writer: Shane Black (Uncredited) Rated: R Running Time: 1 Hr. 47 Mins.

		<fullReview>What a pivotal film for me. The cast (although excellent themselves) are almost secondary to the excellent cinematography of Don McAlpine, the hauntingly apt sound track from Alan Silvestri, and the masterful direction of John McTiernan.With a plethora of memorable lines, "If it bleeds, we can kill it", "Get to the Chopper!", "I ain't got time to bleed"...and a macho kick ass cast featuring Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke, Carl Weathers and Arnie...but it's so much more than that. It's clever, with a great tempo, a thrilling and suspense filled storyline, and an enthralling ride through the Jungle.Predator stands alone in its genre. A worthy 10/10 from me. This film still holds up today, almost 30 years on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When I was like 10 a friend told me there was a movie where this alien hunts down dudes and kills them one by one...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Predator is an epic, primal adventure; a fight between man and beast, hunter and prey, a tale of survival of the fittest. The Predator is a creature with neon green blood, thermal vision, an invisibility cloak. Its prey are a bunch of bros with guns, including classic parts for Carl Weathers and Arnold Schwarznegger. If not for all of his other career-making role in The Terminator, this would be my first exposure to Arnie, as we called him then. He represented, in this movie, the absolute best a man can be. He's good-looking, strong, makes decisions, and says things like "get to the chopper" without a shred of irony. He also says "if it bleeds, we can kill it," and "Do it, do it now!" which are just fun to drop into any dinner party. The movie is a masterclass in pacing for action films. It works equally well as an action and horror film. In fact, it is the originator of a structure that I have come to think of as the Predator Structure, where people are hunted down and die one by one until only one remains. Its standard blu ray release has incredible sound quality, but just a passable picture. The film was shot with a lot of low lighting, and that doesn't tend to pop on in definition. Its murky and grainy, but still looks better than the previous DVD release. The only thing that has not aged well are the special effects related to the alien technology: the Predator's heat vision and invisibility cloak always looked bad, but they look positively silly in high def. Once you're used to them, you can easily look past.Who am I kidding, my love for Predator and Arnie in this movies goes way beyond the measured art of reviewing. This was a childhood favourite of mine and yes I had an awesome childhood. I first heard about it on the handball courts in primary school from this description "an alien hunts down a bunch of marines and kills them one by one, its awesome." I instantly wanted to watch that movie as soon as I could, and I loved it then and have loved it ever since.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite a different role for Schwartzenegger here, he is not the focal point of this action/ sci-fi/ horror hybrid. Film initially doesn't favour any one character over another. All six men have nearly equal presence felt in the first half, as they find themselves hunted by unknown individuals in a Central American wilderness. Their number is slowly whittled down, one by one, as is their arms and weaponry, by an unseen enemy using the jungle as camouflage, using the treetops to move undetected. When revealed, the most formidable enemy is an eight-foot tall alien, trophy hunting on Earth. In the final act, Schwartzenegger is left alone to ... face the creature, or to run from it? Kill it, or escape from it, if that's even possible?One of the most memorable villains ever put on film, in a clever and unique, original story, mixing several genres quite well together. Clever joke at the end, after we've heard the Predator mimicking or repeating a couple lines of dialogue spoken by Schwartzenegger and his men during the film, Ahnuld takes one last look at the fatally(?) injured Predator and says, "What the hell are you?", only to hear the Predator immediately throw those exact same words back at Ahnuld. I've always thought that was just the Predator mimicking the sounds coming from his potential prey, without even comprehending language and what those sounds and words meant.But, could the Predator ever have been killed, if it had not basically committed suicide by blast? Or was there nothing on Earth which could ever have stopped it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Predator (1987): Dir: John McTiernan / Cast: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weather, Elpidia Carrillo, Bill Duke, Sonny Landham: Science fiction thriller about who really is the hunter and who really is the hunted. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Dutch Schaefer who leads a special unit into a jungle to perform a rescue only to discover that the enemy soldiers are the least of their worries. They find victims hanging in trees skinned and an unseen force seems to be picking them off one by one. While most of the characters are one dimensional director John McTiernan cranks the tension when this unseen presence seems to be tracking them. Arnold Schwarzenegger leads the cast and when it is learned that some sort of alien warrior is the enemy, they make a failed attempt to trap it. Riveting third act has Schwarzenegger masked in mud for concealing and combating a game of cat and mouse showdown where the hulking creature is revealed. The only other remotely broad role is Elpidia Carrillo as a female hostage they take during an invasion whom becomes the one person who fears what they're up against. Effective cast include Carl Weather as a former friend of Schwarzenegger's, and Sonny Landham as a tracker. Easily compared to Alien and both are intelligent films involving humanity in a lock for survival against an unknown force that demonstrate what we've only glimpsed on wildlife programs. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Huge guns, Huge tough guys, macho dialogue, funny banter, One liners and an Alien. John McTiernan's 1987 classic 'Predator' is a action fans dream and a true guys film. What's not to like? Quick setup. Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his team of bad-asses are sent to the South American jungles to rescue a group of POW's from an enemy hideout. Simple enough, but that's before they start getting picked off by a hunter from another planet. The rest of the movie relies on suspense, an over the top macho atmosphere and a entertaining team.John McTiernan's style of creating a believable atmosphere shines out through the characters and dialogue. Every member of the rescue team is memorable and likable due to their humorous dialogue and over the top macho-ism. Dutch chomping on cigars, Blain wielding a mini gun, Mac shaving with his own sweat and Billy's huge knife are all examples of the manliness portrayed in the film.The Predator is great in its first portrayal, brought to life thanks to Stan Winston's incredibly lifelike effect. His gadgets and weaponry stay cool and interesting right until the end. One of the things that make the film interesting is watching the team come up with new ways to kill this creature that's picking them off like flies.The film is filled with memorable quotes and scenes that will linger in your mind any time you think of masculinity. Any fan of action or Schwarzenegger will know this is a must see and one of the quintessential 80's flicks. A true guys film that teaches us that 'If it bleeds, we can kill it' and Guns + Muscles + One liners + An Alien = Manliest Film Ever. Highly Recommended</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is so lean, so exciting and so imaginative that you can watch it every month or two, year in year out, and never get tired of it. A team of US commandos, sent to eliminate gun-running in South America, find they are being targeted by a deadly alien.Predator is an action thriller that more ore less dispenses with human interaction completely, and concentrates on chases, combat and special effects. Still, director John McTiernan keeps the tension ratcheted up efficiently. The soundtrack was composed by Alan Silvestri, who was coming off the huge success of Back To the Future in 1985. In 2008, Empire magazine ranked the film 336th on their list of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a premise reducible as 'Schwarzenegger vs. superpowered alien in jungle from the director of Die Hard', it would seem a given that Predator could hardly be less than a rip- snorting good time. And the film is more fun than one could ask for, natch, but its real surprise is that, rather than simply a guilty pleasure, it isn't half bad in any regard, boasting enough of a brain and thematic backbone to, in combination with its combustible mayhem, easily cement it as a genre classic. Boasting one of the most impressive genre resumes in cinema history, director John McTiernan certainly knows his salt in terms of hard-thwacking, supremely satisfying action and Predator, one of his earliest offerings, consistently fires on all cylinders. McTiernan is wise enough to concentrate on the minutiae within the bombastic, dwelling as much on details such as exactly how the team members strap on their weapons, cock their heads to listen for threatening sounds or sing songs to themselves to quench nerves coming away as just as memorable as any explosive showdowns. Such an attention to detail is what truly elevates the film from the chaff, with a painstakingly creeping sense of peril and dread leaving the audience constantly scrutinizing background trees, the soft crinkle of ferns, the hiss of breathing and any unexpected movement as the film stalks away from the familiar comfort of civilization into the horrific isolation of an alien jungle. For its use of sound alone, the film should be considered a classic of horror as well as action. With its claustrophobic arousal of tension, the film is unquestionably indebted to Spielberg's Jaws, the Predator's infra-red POV fittingly substituting for the lurking underwater shark cameras, yet in many ways the film eerily foreshadows aspects of Spielberg's Jurassic Park, bringing the cycle of influence (whether conscious or not) full circle. To mention McTiernan's film in the same breath as such classics is no accident, as he cannily utilizes such established conventions to bend viewer expectations and sympathies (it is worth noticing who the audience is 'watching' at what point during the film, alternatively aligned with Dutch or the Predator, making traditionally black and white sympathies murky) to draw them in all the more. While the film may lag a bit near the middle, with several 'apprehensively wandering through the jungle' scenes feeling extraneous, to say nothing of the genre clich unapologetically yet clumsily speckled throughout ("Stick around!" smirks Dutch as he fastens an enemy soldier to a door with a knife), it is exceedingly rare to see such astute talent and focus dedicated to a film which could easily have been written off as an "expendable" B- feature. Of course any good 'creature feature' would be nothing without its antagonist, and the Predator itself is a spectacular creation. An ingeniously inventive design, from invisibility- yielding chameleon armour to sinister clicking call to its fusion of the organic and technological, the Predator is a force of almost every antagonistic nature combined, and, chillingly enough, in the fleeting segments the audience is left alone with it, shown to be a more sophisticated extrapolation of the testosterone-pumped yahoos of Dutch's team that it hunts. Though it may be a stretch, the Predator can be seen to represent the essence of 'manhood', the masculine ideal, steadily overcoming all other semblances of machismo represented by Dutch's team and absorbing them into itself, taking skins, spines and heads for the sake of proving itself. As odd as it may seem to consider Arnold Schwarzenegger an example of progressive masculinity, Dutch, while introduced in a flurry of cigars, bulging biceps and one-liners as just as an example of the same kind of cocky manhood as his team, is the only male in the film willing to depart from the usual role of hyper-physical masculine, privileging running from the Predator for the sake of protecting his men rather than pursuing it on a macho vendetta like the rest of his team. McTiernan's introduction of Anna, the only female in the film is particularly interesting: reduced to a nearly nonexistent role, she serves primarily to articulate the attitudes of the men around her. While the majority of the team instinctively try to repress or conquer her (the Predator outright ignores her, opting instead for fellow machismo to overpower), Dutch is the only one to give Anna her say, trust her and release her. It is only through these departures of traditional masculinity that Dutch can defeat its epitome, the Predator (complete with an ironic, mockingly vaginal face), which, fittingly enough, destroys itself when Dutch demonstrates mercy towards it, unable to accept its defeat by a less primal form of manhood. In terms of performance, apart from said occasional one-liner, Schwarzenegger is refreshingly reserved, delivering, in spite of himself, a performance of credible steely focus and rough compassion, a fitting emotional anchor for such a grisly film. Similarly, Bill Duke is excellent as solemn soldier Mac, as adept at delivering a grim whisper as a heartbroken sob, and injecting the film with raw compassion and heartbreak. Jesse Ventura also stands out as the most gung-ho of the pack, his brazen tobacco spitting ("This stuff will make you a goddamned sexual tyrannosaurus!"), minigun-toting Blain providing the definitive final word on good, old fashioned, macho posturing. Whether appraised for its underlying sociological group interactions, gender politics, or simply the volume of gasps and explosions, Predator proves difficult to beat on the action/thriller front. Impeccably constructed and fun as can be, McTiernan's film is a must- see for all those capable of stomaching exploding heads and/or Schwarzenegger's sizable biceps. -9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The people who produced "Predator" imaginatively superimposed a science fiction saga about an extra-terrestrial intruder with a commando hostage rescue mission movie. Just when you think that you are locked in the middle of a gritty, realistic, hell-for-leather military melodrama, the filmmakers whip out a science fiction alien to end all science fiction aliens. Future "Die Hard" director John McTiernan helmed this nimble, profane, exciting, and often suspenseful actioneer penned by the Thomas brothers Jim and John who later wrote the Kurt Russell, jet-hijacking thriller "Executive Decision." Unfortunately, they also wrote the story for the ill-conceived Will Smith western "Wild Wild West." "Predator" takes place deep in the jungles of Central America and pits an elite military team commanded by Arnold Schwarzenegger against a "Predator" from another galaxy. Our heroes are recruited for a top-secret rescue mission by the C.I.A. to recover a diplomat whose plane crashed in hostile territory. As it turns out, the C.I.A. lie to Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) about the identity of the man that they are supposed to rescue. Our heroes wind up blowing a guerrilla camp to smithereens, but they don't arrive in time to save any hostages. As they traipse off to the rendezvous point for their helicopter extraction, they encounter something like nobody has encountered. The eponymous monster's appearance remains singular in the annals of sci-fi. Essentially, the predator resembles gigantic Jamaican dude with dreadlocks and a turtle shell for a helmet. The alien's face is ghoulish. Four small horns surround its ugly mouth and it has yellow years with huge claws for hands. Indeed, it is the perfect embodiment of a 1950 space creature. The alien enjoyed one major advantage over its victims. The predator can cloak itself so that it is well-nigh invisible to the naked eye. Further, the predator sees everything from a heat sensor perspective. He fires beams of energy that create fatal wounds. He can deploy twin razor-sharp knives. Most of all, the predator looks for trophies. He collects skulls and has no qualms about stripping the flesh off his human victims and hanging them upside down from tree branches. What sets "Predator" apart from the usual creature feature is that the Predator is a hunter and it refuses to slay and fillet the innocents who display no pugnacity. The commando team takes a woman hostage but the predator never attacks her. Inevitably, Arnold must go toe-to-toe with this extremely aggressive adversary after it has exterminated his entire team. The predator literally gets in Arnold's face. Our hero finds himself truly between a rock and a hard place with his alien foe. Arnold is reduced to relying on his wits and his fists so that he can triumph over the alien. Some might say that "Predator" is "Escape from N.Y." criss-crossed with the original "Star Trek" TV show episode "Arena" where Captain Kirk fought with the murderous Gorn captain. Jesse Ventura co-stars as one of the commando team. He totes around an impressive, fully automatic Vulcan mini-gun that can cough up 200 rounds in the blink of an eye. Of course, there is no way that this weapon could work as a portable, hand-held firearm under the conditions depicted in "Predator," but Ventura is such a massive fellow that he makes it look credible that he could handle this weapon. Incidentally, the Hawkins character to spouts the bad jokes to Billy (Sonny Landham of "48 Hrs") is none other than Shane Black. Black achieved greater fame as a scenarist with "Lethal Weapon," "The Last Boy Scout," "Last Action Hero" and "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang." "Predator" boasts colorful characters, narrative surprises, quotable dialogue, and good computer-generated effects. Bill Duke's character has a habit of shaving his largely clean shaven face with a disposable razor. The elaborate booby-traps that our heroes set to capture the predator look like a Rube Goldberg contraption. This 107-minute sci-fi actioneer never wears out its welcome.</fullReview>

This film is a 10/10 masterpiece that you simply can not miss. If you haven't seen it yet, I suggests you get your car, drive to a store and buy it straight away.

I have loved this movie since I was a kid. Plus it is definitely is the best of the series the other movies in the series do not match up in scope or plot. The recent avp movies are a far cry from the original. The effects and action are also great for its time. This movie is a must see for any person that calls themselves a movie buff. I think it is Arnold's best work. The jungle setting is the best place for a movie of this scope. It sets the people up to be the best "game" for the predators, and only Arnold can defeat him. This movie brings back fond memories of my childhood and watching "R" rated movies with my dad. Great movie to watch with your son.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this way back in the early nineties, and since then have seen it on numerous times, i always have my predator days when it becomes a must to see this AWESOME movie. Great special effects, predator is the best killing machine or alien I have seen in cinema history, PERIOD!!!! Its innovation surpasses the alien in aliens franchise, reason being the alien doesnot have anything in comparison to the predator, such as the predators heat vision, and array of weapons, I have given the alien franchise a chance on numerous occasions, but it reminds me of some slow star trek type movie with a dinosaur type monster who doesn't have anything amusing about it, in this case I would have been better of watching Gremlins or something.Predator is the benchmark of how scifi movies should be made, I try thinking if Hollywood can create a monster as good as the predator. This movie is highly recommendable, it never will age, like the cartoony first alien movie, and will keep you watching over and over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If survival gets anymore brutal than this, it's an all out war! A mission in the jungles of South America goes bad when the team players are brutally slaughtered. Dutch, a military man and his men go in to find them, and they get more than they bargained for when they stumble on, the predator.Arnold gives an outstanding performance in this high energy film of cross fires and steak outs. The jungle itself nearly becomes a character because of it's massive foliage and nooks and crannies where the predator can easily hide.The second half of the film takes off once they discovered they have been targeted.Once the audience gets pulled it, it's a mile a minute and you'll soon discover that the sequel is worth a look considering there's a lot of information to process about the predator. Not only that, but the chase gets more exciting once you realize he's hunting for sport and it becomes a deadly game of survival.I'll give it two thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Sci-Fi films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the new film is coming out this year I've decided to watch the original again. And I have realized how original this concept is. Simply put a group of soldiers in a Central American jungle carrying out a mission are stalked by an extra terrestrial game hunter. It switches from the clich alien visitation concept of "Are we alone in the universe?" to "What the hell could have done this? There is something out there." I like it how the characters themselves are not innocent, but you must sympathize for the lesser of two evils. I love how it transitions from a brainless action flick to a very suspenseful sci-fi horror-fest. Yes the action is brainless as I said, just like Shwharzenegger's previous film Commando, where he's a soldier firing from the hip surprisingly hitting every target while his enemy are unloading and missing him. Arnie is not without his stupid one liners although I do really like two of them which are "You're one UGLY motherf***er!" and "What the hell are you!?". Since the story, concept, effects and creature design are so original, makes it excellent even for a Schwarzenegger film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Schwarzenegger must have thought it was his birthday when the script for Predator landed on his doormat. Having already enjoyed the benefits deriving from the simple but brutally effective Terminator showcasing his simple but brutally effective talents, here came another high-concept property which played directly to his strengths and to audience response.And there is a great deal to be enjoyed here, from the gradual realisation that the mission they are on isn't the mission they thought they were on at all, to the relentless suspense and action, to the brilliant establishment of the characters of all the men (and hence an emotional investment in their individual fates), to the excellent special effects and costuming for the Predator itself, to the revelation of a highly convincing and extremely alien Predator face.... the list goes on.There are flaws, but they are few and minimal. This is one of the very best science fiction action adventure movies, and one of the very best Schwarzenegger movies too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is how action should be done.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by John McTiernan of "Die Hard" fame, Predator was made in 87. The plot focuses on a team of special force ops, led by a tough but fair soldier, Major "Dutch" Schaefer (Arnold Schwarzenegger). Dutch and his men are ordered to assist CIA man, and Dutch's old Army buddy, George Dillon (Carl Weathers), who needs them to rescue the survivors of a chopper that has gone down over remote South American jungle. Not long after they land, Dutch and his team discover that they have been sent in under false pretenses. This deception turns out to be the least of their worries though, when they find themselves being methodically hunted by something not of this world.Predator takes its cue from Jaws by not fully showing the creature until the third act. This a was a smart move, as leaving the audience to let its imagination run riot is always effective film making. But when you keep your audience waiting you better have a big pay-off for them. Believe it or not, Predator came close to ignoring this golden rule.The original creature design for the Predator was so pathetic it bordered on comical. It was so bad, in fact, the film had to be shut down. It was only after McTiernan consulted Stan Winston that he was able to get the ball rolling again. Winston had provided the awesome Terminator effects for James Cameron and took up the challenge with vigor, giving us the superb creation we see on screen today.Some of the set pieces in Predator are amazing, particularly the big combat scene where the team attack the guerrilla base. The final showdown between Dutch and the predator is a worthy ending too, and the payoff doesn't disappoint. I want to give credit to unsung star, Kevin Peter Hall, who was the unfortunate guy in the bulky predator suit. Though he does appear briefly at the very end of the film as the black rescue pilot.It's important to get the characters right in a film like this, and I think they succeeded with Predator. It's obvious the writers took their cue from the classic Vietnam films, and it shows in the banter and camaraderie between the characters. I especially like the helicopter scene at the beginning ? it's a great device for introducing the personalities of the team without being too obvious and methodical. The Dylan and Dutch relationship is nicely done, and I was impressed by the amount of emotion Carl Weathers was able to put into some of his scenes. It's a shame his career never really took off.The music for Predator also warrants a mention; the score by Alan Silvestri (Back To The Future) is amazing for an action film, and it adds an overall touch of class to the picture.Now I can't do a Predator review without mentioning the mini-gun that Sgt Blain wields throughout this film. Watching as an exited child, the absurd impracticability of taking such a weapon into a jungle combat situation never occurred to me. But this is Predator, so it gets a pass. And let's not forget poetic license...which no action film can do without.Predator is rightly regarded as an all-time classic, included on many "greatest ever" lists. It's a wonderful cross between a war film, sci-fi, and an all out action movie. It's definitely one of Schwarzenegger's best films, right up there with the Terminator and Total Recall. Every self respecting action fan should watch it at least once every couple of years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arnold Schwarzenegger plays the character Dutch who runs his own team of soldiers that are hired by the CIA. The CIA sends his team and CIA's own man Dillon who is played by Carl Weathers, into the South American jungle to retrieve a Cabinet minister and an aide. They all discover there is something else in this jungle when they find passengers of the helicopter hung upside and bloodied. The plot thickens very quickly and Dutch's team members start getting killed by something not visible to the naked eye. Finally Dutch's remaining team members realize they are being hunted by a Predator not from this world and they must do everything possible to stay alive and escape the jungle. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good sci-fi action flick and likes movies done by John Mctiernan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i thought predator was a fantastic movie and a complete blast of the 1980's, this movie was made the year i was born (1987). I think Predator is so cool because he is so strong and powerful and can easy kill someone, i am looking forward to the 3rd movie with a versus with alien. I think that movie will blast again of the 2000's, it's going to be one hell of a good movie, i hope it pulls out well with lots of people telling themselves and others what a fantastic movie it is, The movie is coming out in August. I think Arnold Swarznegger is a fantastic actor, he played a fantastic part in predator and has done other fantastic movies besides predator, movies such as Conan the barbarian, The Terminator, Commando, running man, twins, terminator 2: judgement day, total recall, kindergartan cop, Eraser, collateral damage, end of days, terminator 3: rise of the machines, Now theses days i think he would done great movies because his time i think has now passed as he is the governer of california. Overall i wish him all the best in the future and i do hope he will make some movies that will kiss ass, thank you arnie for the great, fantastic movies you have made for us to watch, thank you so much. I give this film 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arnold delivers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get ONE thing straight about this film: This is for MEN! This is a MAN'S action flick. There is no cheesy love story to keep your date cuddled up with a pillow at night, no sub-plot about boyhood friendships, and no breaking down and saying, "I can't take it, Sarge, I can't go on!" Nope, this film is about standing up, walking tall, and fighting to the end.The great Schwarzenegger gives one of his best performances ever as "Major Dutch", we've got Shane Black showing what he does when he's not penning a Lethal Weapon script, Carl Weathers being anything BUT Apollo Creed, and Jesse Ventura spouting out uber-cool lines like, "I ain't got time to bleed." Guns, guts, glory, and an alien with special effects that are still pretty sweet in today's "CG-overkill" world.My one problem is that we never get to see what happens to Billy. It looked like he was going to go all awesome and then what? A scream? Whatever though. This film "makes trophies" of other films attempting to do the same. If you're tired of hearing the TITANIC song everytime your girl asks you to watch a movie with her, sit down and enjoy the testosterone with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the great Arnold action films of the 80s pits everyone's favorite Austrian and a team of rugged, machine gun powered commandos and a Hispanic chick, Anna, against a killer alien the size of a basketball player (played by the late Kevin Peter Hall, who was also big foot in "Harry &amp; The Hendersons"). Chaos and mayhem ensues...What starts out as a shoot 'em up slowly becomes a thriller/suspense chase movie as Arnold's men are picked off one by one until the climax between Arnold and the Predator. Arnold delivers his usual performance as a wise cracking hero and his fans will not be disappointed by this entry. One can only imagine that had he returned to the sequel, there would still be thousands of these being made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best 80's action movies - period</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**CONTAINS SPOILERS**Certainly one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best, perhaps only second to T2: Judgement Day.The plot is solid, full of suspense as well as kick-ass action. The fact that the Predator is not revealed until 3/4s into the movie prevents this movie from becoming too cheesy. We don't see what's hunting Arnold and his comrades and it's the engine that drives the film. Acting and dialogue is very 80's style; lots of classic one-liners and tough-guy macho behaviour. We would expect no less, wouldn't we? The action is also what we expect from a film like this: Lots of explosions, flying guerillas and a guy hunting for an invisible Predator in the middle of the jungle with two submachine guns; one in each hand *grin*. You can't go wrong with this one.Verdict: The typical 80's action movie with that little extra which keeps you at the edge of your seat, at least the first time you see this movie. A big fat explosive 9 outta 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even after all these years, I still find Predator to be a movie I love to watch. Sure, the acting in places is corny, sure some one liners are bad on the ears, but you cannot take away the fact that when the fireworks start and the action starts, you forget everything and just get drawn into the movie. The double DVD collection is also well worth checking out as the Interviews on the second CD are very good, and do make you have a genuine chuckle or two.To the people who look upon movies to have reality and realism, come on! This is action and fantasy all rolled into one.. and with Arnie in tow, you know what to expect... don't you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Along with its great showcase of action, and special effects Predator also brings some vintage Schwarzenegger to the table.The movie follows the story of Arnold and Co. and they go into an African jungle to rescue some pows or something like that. However that isn't important as the real plot shows up soon enough as we learn that an alien is hunting the solidiers for sport. Not exactly Shakespearian but decent enough.Arnold is definetly in full tough-man ass kicking mode here. The supporting cast gives strong enough performances, despite any terribly signifigant lines for any of them.Predator is definetly a great choice for a bit of mindless action fun, with great special effects for its time, and with surprisingly good laughs to go along with the action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great suspense film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my favorites!John McTiernan at his best. I first saw this film back in '88 and it scared the hell out of me. Partly in due to its suspenceful plot and visual effects, and the fact that I was only eight years old in 1988.Recently reviewing the "Special Edition" version released in 2002, on Region 2 DVD format. The two-disc DVD package of "Predator : Special Edition" is the most current up-to-date version of the film. Disc 1 features the theatrical release of the film in 1:85:1 aspect (enhanced for 16x9 screens). A rather dull but interesting commentary by John McTiernan, as well as interesting text commentary. Subtitles in 14 different languages, and an easter egg. Disc 2 features some excellent stuff such as featurettes, trailers, documentaries, etc. Interesting stuff!!"Predator" begins in the fashion of "Aliens", space! But quickly changes to the classic Arnie like war flick (anything before 1987), and even resembles aspects of the second Rambo film. The Plot : Arnold and his team of special forces are hired by CIA agent Dillon (Carl Weathers) to rescue American hostages deep in the Central American jungle. While all seems to go well and is looking good, WE begin to see what something else SEES (which for an eight year old was a little freaky). The team is being watched from the trees by something invisible.The team reaches the village where the hostages are being kept, they quietly blow it to pieces only to find out that they were setup by one of their own. Pissed off, Arnie &amp; team decide to leave without a trace, or should I say a trace of their own words. WE begin to see (through its own infrared heat imaging vision) that something is stalking them.As the team is trying to get to their pick up point they are being killed one by one be something unknown, and unseen.......... I'll leave the rest up to you!!!"Predator" is a classic popcorn film, and one of the best action films of the Twentieth Century. It was the film that turn Arnold into a plausable actor. A fine performance by Kevin Peter Hall (he will be missed). My only wish that didn't come true is for a better sequel, that is a different story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not only my favorite action film, my favorite film ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Warning: Contains minor spoilers.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When I think of movies that I enjoy, and movies that really flow well, none compare to my all-time favorite movie, The Predator. There are several reasons why the predator is just hands down the best movie ever, ranging from the cast, the visual/audio splendor and the overall feel of the film.Obviously, someone put in some serious time behind the scenes to make this film what it is. The visual effects of all of the human-only fight scenes makes this a worthy action film, and when you couple that with the predator's visual effects, it stands head and shoulders (just the the Predator itself) above all else. The sound on this film is excellent. Dialogue is understandable, gun shots loud, and ooooh the creepy noises the Predator makes.The cast...what can be said about the cast? Quite possibly the best possible cast ever assembled for any movie.Arnie played Dutch like a fiddle. All of his one-liners were timed the way only Arnold can time them, and every time I saw him he looked bigger and bigger. The Cool-guy beard, the cigar, the messed up war-paint...it's so perfectly macho that you don't know what to do but stare.Carl Weathers was perfect as Dillon. You liked him, but only as far as you could throw him. Sure he may have lied about a few things, but I think everyone makes different truths at times. He got his job done at least. In Rocky, he looked like he was in good shape. In Predator, he looked like a mammoth (if only his muscle scenes weren't next to Arnie's...shame shame shame)Hawkins was good for comic relief, but he also gave you a character that didn't need to be there for the entire film. You liked him, but they made him just nerdy enough that you were okay with him "hangin out" instead of going on with the rest of the group, if you get my meaning.Elipidio Carillo gave me pleasant dreams when I was younger because of the scenes in this movie...not your typical blonde bombshell, but enough spice to be just nice.Billy was very, very well done. Sonny Landham is a cinematic formula for successful action: Good-sized + crazy eyes + cool knife = perfect action tough guy.Bill Duke did such a good job as Mac that I do a double take every time I see him in anything else. If I see him in another movie, I expect him to say "Anytime..." or his more hysterical "gonna have me some fun....gonna have me some fun..." Plus you gotta love a guy that can enunciate so well under stress: (SPOILER) When he and Dillon are preparing a flush-and-shoot to get the beast, he says "Out there...past them treeeeeeeeeeeeees" you can totally hear every syllable being drawn out like road map.Poncho was a good guy to have as a stabilizer. He didn't have the gruff toughness all of the muscle-head actors had, but his quips were timed as well as Arnie's, and he seemed to have some determination. I especially like his quip to Mac about "Think you could have found something bigger?" Another good one: "Strap this on your sore rear-end, Blaine (he actually didn't say "rear-end", just to let you movie review people know I DO actually know the movie)Gov. Jesse Ventura was something else entirely in this film. I will simply list his awesome characteristics, and that should be enough. His big hat. His M-TV shirt. His BIG gun (methinks he was the first of many action stars to use a helicopter "mini" gun as an assault rifle.) The fat cleft in his chin. The chewing tobacco. Plus, he had the three absolute best lines in any movie ever: Line #3 "Old painless is waitin" (it loses some points since he was saying it to a goofy opossum-porcupine-hedgehog or whatever it was). Line #2 "I ain't got time to bleed" and Line #3 (which I think he should have used as his campaign slogan when running for governor): "You're a bunch of slack-jawed FA_ _OTS...this stuff'll make you a god-damn sexual tyrannosaurus...just like me"The Predator...well played, despite notable lack of dialogue. No real good on-liners from him, but we'll let it slide. Very sad the Kevin Peter Hall passed away in '91, but his performance as The Predator was perfect. He sort of loped around. He never seemed to be in too big of a hurry. If I was 7'2 with that gear, neither would I.Even the auxiliary characters were well done. The General seemed just the perfect amount of strung out and nervous. The long-haired South American who jumped into the ill-fated truck (that Arnie lifted in first major battle scene) seemed pretty jovial, which is realistic in rebel camps. I say that as if I have experience in rebel camps...well, I have seen several in Hollywood films, so that makes me expert enough.&lt;&lt;FAT SPOILER&gt;&gt; One thing which I would like to point out that SO many people have seen as a "goof" or an editing error was the Predator's vision (Pv). At the end of the film, when Arnie gets whooped by the predator with all of the Predator gear, the predator takes off his mask to make it a fair fight. Initially, his vision is horrible. Almost a flat red-screen with little or no definition to anything, then it miraculously becomes heat-seeking vision like, 37 seconds later. I believe this is not an error. It's called adjusting. Turn off all of the lights in your house, be in darkness, and run around trying not to bump into anything. Then, wait 37 seconds, and try again. You'll notice the second time, you didn't hit that stupid chair that shouldn't have been in the pathway. Well, this is similar, I believe, to the Pv. His vision takes a few seconds to adjust to the lack of mask, but once he does, he can see heat. Whereas we gain visual definition, he gains heat definition. Not that complicated when you think about it. So I'll shut up about it. Oh yeah, one possible reason for his vision being all red again after Arnie drops the huge log on him: He just had a huge log dropped on him. Give it a try, I guarantee you will see things differently.This film was so amazing. It wasn't the massive assault of aliens, like some movies, with mindless creatures being killed by twelve year olds. It also wasn't one creature taking a group out one at a time. It was a creature CHOOSING to take them out one at a time. It could have been a ten minute movie... Blaine could have said his best line ever (gotta keep that dialogue in there no matter when) then they drop out of the chopper, run around in the dirt and leaves for ten minutes, then all get one solid blast of laser to the head or heart, with a few of them getting the wicked claws of death. But no! Not this movie. They decided "Hey! Humans like to toy with things, play mind games even when they're not necessary! What's to stop an alien from doing the exact same thing!" En Garde, all of the "Alien" and "Aliens" fanatics...I love those films also, but these are my reasons for this film receiving preferantial treatment.The infrared was pretty awesome. The Predator mask looked cool. But, above all else except Blaine's line, the two key factors in this movie was DREADLOCKS. You gotta love an alien with dreadlocks. How many times in this movie did it become infinitely cooler when his swooping and loping was augmented by dreadlocks. The other key factor? Billy's laugh. A loud powerful laugh that lets you know someone truly thought something was funny.Plus, how many times do you see something bigger than Arnold, and how many times do you see Arnold get the doodoo kicked out of him?This movie gets two thumbs up, four stars, 10 out of 10, and if you watch it, you too can become a sexual tyrannosaurus, just like me. And Blaine. And Elipidia Carillo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A simple movie but executed with style and a flair of direction has exalted this to a cult status along with the Alien. Predator is infused with elements of sci-fi, horror, and action adventure and primarily is the sole reason why it is still a beloved among hard-core action fans. The inclusion of mega star Arnold Schwarzenegger and vivid supporting casts definitely adds to that.The best thing about this film is that there is hardly a single dead moment in it. Every scene builds on the previous one and raises the stakes; keeping the pace of the film on its momentum. The tension is initiated there among the characters once they discover the wreckage of the crash and the gruesome sight of the dead body in the tree. The fear of the unknown has begun and sustains throughout their hunt.Not many films can capture such a rich tapestry of action, suspense, comedy and just plain old popcorn fun in one film. The special effects at that time were top notch and well deserved of the Oscar nomination and even today it still has the contemporary look and feel. The atmosphere of the film sets it apart from the other action oriented by being unpretentious and accepting at face value that this is purely action driven.The ultimate display of creativeness of vivid imagination from the effects crew is the Predator when revealed in full glory. A sight to behold! The imagery has now become an instant classic in similar veins that did for the Alien creature.Downright, the Predator is a thriller that entertains while being slick and fun with rousing tension.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Schwarzenegger's best!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can honestly say that the idea behind "Predator" is one of the coolest Sci-Fi stories I've ever heard/seen. I absolutely love the idea of an alien being coming to earth, not to meet new life-forms, but to find a good hunt! Brilliant!!! I like the idea of the hunter becoming the hunted!The cast is superb in this film. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays the perfect Dutch, Carl Weathers plays the perfect Dillion, Jesse Ventura as Blaine, Bill Duke as Mac, and so on an so forth. Everyone is great in this film!!!The look of "The Predator" is just perfect too! I can't say enough about how much I like the look of "The Predator". Stan Winston did a fantastic job with the design. Kevin Peter Hall did a fantastic job playing "The Predator" as well!Not only does this film have a great cast and a great creature designer, but it has one of the best directors around, John McTiernan (Hunt for Red October, Die Hard, Die Hard: With a Vengeance, 13th Warrior, Medicine Man, and more). John really did a great job directing.Well, if you haven't seen this film yet, I really think you're missing out on something great. I would definitely recommend seeing this film and I really, truly hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Thanks for reading,-Chris</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Arnold flick ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Superb! From start to finish, this movie left me on the edge of my seat. Arnold S. was perfect in this movie and I don't think any other actor could have pulled it off better. As I watched it, I was just as bewildered as the guys in the mission. Things were happening, and they didn't know what, and niether did I! It was so cool to know my heart was pounding to their rythum. Eventually, when everything was exposed, it got even better. The action was very well plotted and the soundtrack matched perfectly. Carl Weathers was a cool sidekick, giving complaints here and there and turning out to be a mole. My only complaint is Arnold's invincibility. I mean, he died like 5 times in that movie. Either way, that doesn't harm my rating for this movie: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arnold VS. The Predator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dutch(Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his team of commandoes go off into the South American jungle to rescue some hostages. His team includes Dillon(Carl Weathers), Mac(Bill Duke), Blaine(Jesse Ventura), Billy(Sonny Landham), Poncho(Richard Chavez) and Hawkins(Shane Black). They go in and encounter their enemies but soon discover something more terrifying: the Predator.This is one of my favorite Schwarzenegger films to come out during the 1980's. The action is tight and director John McTiernan's direction is slick. The Oscar nominated special effects are cool. One should take into consideration about the violence in this movie. The violence hear is quite gory, yet hardly of the supergraphic kind. The skinless bodies of two men are found hanging from a tree, a man's arm is blown off, another man has a hole the size of a basketball blown into his chest, and another man's brains are blown out. Last, but not least, a lot of praise should go to the towering, late Kevin Peter Hall for his excellent portrayal of the Predator; the silent, invisible hunter from another planet. He literally has all kinds of weapons up his sleave which include a shoulder blaster, a blade, and a powerful self-destruct weapon. Kevin Peter Hall returned to do the highly underrated sequel Predator 2 with Danny Glover and Gary Busey. 10/10 </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True Fear in a fascinating movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, this movie deserves a place in the list of the best action/sci-fi movies ever. But what I think is what makes this movie faboulous is the ambient in which its played: The Jungle. The claustrophobic ambient a jungle provides, specially if youre being hunted by an Alien with cloaking abilities and the most advanced weaponry known, is what gives the movie its TRUE FEAR. McTierman did an excellent job. But Arnold was in his best. As some critics said, I think Predator (and his character Major "Dutch" Schfer) was his best action movie. But, as Arnold said, he wasnt acting... there was real fear there! One more word to say that Stan Winston made one of his best jobs ever. WInstons a genious. This movie deserves a place in the top. And it can be linked to other wonderfull creations like Alien and Terminator. Welcome to world of the Predator, fellas.</fullReview>

Arnold is superb in this film and what makes this film so memorable is that as a viewer the 'narcissistic scopophilia' comes into effect. In other words, one wishes that they were Arnold accompanied by his mercenaries fighting against this "monstrous thing" with dreadlocks! any way this thriller, this suspense movie, this extravagant, this step-mother of all movies is one to watch and if you haven't seen it then i suggest you do.by the way...the death scenes are cool!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can anyone possibly doubt the awesome quality of this film?! This was a landmark film of the 80's, a great combination of crackling, kinetic, bravado direction from McTiernan and balls-out, "ain't-got-time-to-bleed," gun polishing, bullet-fest lunacy. Carl Weathers has never been better (no, I will not hear it, Rocky fans) and I cannot recall such a great array of weaponry ever being on display. It's tense, claustrophobic and as a team-of-marines-going-berserk type film is matched only by Aliens. Watch it, love it, quote it!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Arnold (and J. Ventura) gem.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a classic! Jesse Ventura, a seasoned special ops soldier, wears a MTV t-shirt while armed w/ a mini gun in the jungle. That was quite hilarious to me. I mean this guy could deforest half of the South American jungle with that gun and he's wearing a music television t-shirt (underneath the flak jacket of course).The best part of this movie is: The creature is real! Not some computer animated bs like in the new star wars movie which i so much hated. Don't get me wrong, I love the original Star Wars Trilogy. Comp-anim worked for dinosaurs in JP but it fails miserably at humans and "humanoids." It sometimes is convincing on mechanical things and backgrounds.Good plot keeps you on the edge of your seat. Multiple camera angles, good scenery, and a good cast gives this movie high marks. Predator was way ahead of its time and still holds onto its high replay value today. This whole movie is a rare gem.Rating 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern classic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw Predator, I was immediately struck by the genious way in which the director had presented this movie. Unlike what you might have presumed, this movie was not another B-action movie.The entire concept, they location, the actors and the special effects, all make this film an equal to the Alien movies. But one of the movie's biggest assets is undoubtedly the music. Alan Silvestri was cut out for the job and the thrilling military theme in the music is perfect for the enviroment in which the movie is taking place.The sequel was obviously not as good, but who would have expected it? However, it had a great movie to rely on, thus making it fairly acceptable, I would say.Although the characters had relatively small roles, they invite to memories past, and I sure would like to see a movie where we get to now what Poncho means when he says; "Remember Afghanistan?" and Dutch replies;" Trying to forget..." . Obviously that is never going to happen, heheh, but who can blame me for dreaming...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never been a fan of action flicks, though The Predator stands above the rest. It builds suspense perfectly, leading to an awesome battle between Arnie and the 'unmasked' Predator (who is damn scary).The direction is exceptional, and the use of the jungle used brilliantly. This isn't a conventional action movie, but a chilling and frightening romp through thick foliage and intense heat. Predator II was most dissapointing, almost absolutely shocking. But this film remains with me to this day.One of my favourite movies of all time, and I know others who strongly agree. I can not pin point exactly what makes this film so good, maybe it is just the setting and the cast. Though trust me, rent or even buy yourself a copy to see for you self. Wait for the part where he hides behind some roots covered in mud... very exciting, very heart thumping.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Greatest Action Movies Of All Time And An Excellent,Unforgettable Classic. Arnold Schwarzenegger And John McTierman At Their Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Predator is one of the greatest Action movies ever made that mixes Action,Sci-Fi,Adventure and Horror and is not only one of my favorite Action movies,but one of my favorite movies period. Filled with brilliant,non-stop Action,great direction and amazing special effects Predator is an excellent and unforgettable Action classic and is Arnold Schwarzenegger and John McTierman at their best.Set in Central America,Predator tells the story about a group of commandos who have been sent on a rescue mission. While they complete their mission the group discover that they are being hunted by a lethal alien. Now Dutch(Arnold Schwarzenegger)and his squad have to figure out how to stop this alien and stay alive.What if the character Rambo faced off against the Alien in the Alien franchise? You get Predator,an intense,Action packed film that is one of the greatest Action films of all time and an unforgettable classic that never slows down and is a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. One of the things that I love about Predator is the way that it's set-up in the first 40 minutes. During the early part of the film we assume as the viewer that this is going to be just another Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle,but the film cleverly turns you on it's head when the alien attacks and kills and you know that this is not going to be your regular Schwarzenegger film,but a tale of survival and staying alive. The concept of Predator is original and brilliant because the alien is looking for big game hunting and skinning humans and wanting trophies the same way humans do when humans are hunting animals and in this film the concept of hunting is turned on it's head. The use of the Central American jungle is great and adds to the films dread and dark atmosphere because when the characters are in the jungle you'll feel like it goes on forever and that there is no way out and it's the end for the characters. You feel that none of the characters are safe. The hot temperature and sweating adds to the film as well because it's very realistic and you will feel like you're in a hot oven or heater and want to get out and scream at the top of your lungs. And speaking of the characters,despite their strong arms and toughness they a little depth and you feel for the characters and the plight that they go through whether it's dealing with the heat,the Predator,getting out of the jungle or trying to stay alive. The Action in the film is excellent because it builds up thanks to the suspense of most of the scenes and the tension element involved and when the film's tension stops the Action explodes like a bomb and the Action comes fast like a quick punch in the face and you never know what hit you. It's some of the best Action scenes in the 80s and of all-time. The Predator Alien is one of the greatest creatures in the history of cinema and I think one of reasons he's a great Alien and creature is because he's not like other Alien creatures. The Predator isn't trying to take over the world or possess a human body,he's just a hunter and a dangerous killer looking for trophies to take back to his planet. The Predator stalks his prey with smarts and a great use of his weapons. What's also great about the Predator in this film is that we don't see much until the very end which is a smart thing because it adds to the mystery of The Predator and I think makes the Predator more frightening. The Predator is such an amazing creature and when you first see him you will never forget him. The final 30 minutes of this film is a powerful and truly flawless execution of Action and white hot Suspense and is so intense that you will probably want to watch it again because the ending is very exciting and explosive. It is a truly amazing,thrilling and brilliant conclusion to this amazing movie one of the many reasons Predator is a classic.The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Arnold Schwarzenegger is excellent as Dutch,with Schwarzenegger bringing depth and charisma to the role. Carl Weathers is wonderful as Dillon,Dutch's friend and army buddy. Elpidia Carrillo does a great job as Anna,a girl that's captured by the commandos then helps them out. Bill Duke is menacing and intense as Mac. Jesse Ventura gives a fun and entertaining performance as Blain,the tobacco eating,big armed soldier. Sonny Landham gives a great,intense performance as Billy,a man of few words. Richard Graves is wonderful as Poncho. Shane Black does a good job as Hawkins,a guy who tells a good dirty joke. R.G. Armstrong gives a fine performance as General Phillips. The late great Kevin Peter Hall is brilliant as The Predator,using excellent body language and movements with his eyes and head. His performances in Predator 1 and 2 will live on forever. R.I.P Kevin Peter Hall.The direction by John McTierman is brilliant,with McTierman constantly moving the camera and using great angles,giving the film a excellent energy and fast pace. McTierman also does an amazing with the Action scenes and does with great intensity. Great job,McTierman.The score by Alan Silvestri is masterful,intense,dark and suspenseful and definitely adds to the greatness of the film. A great score. There's also a great use of the classic Long Tall Sally by Little Richard.The special make-up effects with The Predator creature by the late great effects artist Stan Winston is amazing and iconic and right next to the Terminator films this is his best work. R.I.P Stan Winston.In final word,if you love Action films,Sci-Fi films or Schwarzenegger films,I highly suggest you see Predator,a landmark Action classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie when it came out. It held me in suspense then and it still does now (i just watched it again) - hence this review. An excellent outstanding movie.. that sneaks up on you. Outstanding cinematography, continuity. This movie succeeds despite lackluster acting. This movie is a strange event film-wise.. the movie itself supersedes the actors! Now that is rare. And here is another rarity this movie keeps getting better as I watch it over the years. When you keep going back to a movie every now and then as the years traipse by, that in itself says something. So yeah.. definitely a teetering 10 but a 10 nonetheless. I have to concede that as I learn more about the Vietnam war (a.k.a. the Vietnam/china/Russia war) u.s. lrss and sog recon units - adds a unique dimension to this movie. This movie shares the company of 'apocalypse now' and 'platoon'. I hope somebody, someday tops this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arnold in fine form!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>C'mon now, can you really say anything bad about this movie?? If you don't like Predator, you don't like action movies.Predator starts off not all that differently than many other action movies of the 80's. You have a U.S. military group sent into the jungle of some South American country on a rescue mission. Two points, set this movie apart from those others. The first is the idea of bringing in a unique alien that hunts these soldiers and picks them off one at a time. The "Predator" is unlike anything we had seen before. It's no wonder that this franchise continues to remain so popular today. The second point that makes this film so memorable is simply Arnold Schwarzenegger. Arnold is the master of action movies, the king of cheesy one-liners. He's the one guy that you could put in any movie, and you know he'll kick some serious ass. You're almost left feeling sorry for the alien in this movie, knowing that it's going to have to go up against Arnold. Predator has a great jungle setting, which enhances this suspense and the mood of the film. It is a superb blend of action and science fiction, and is enjoyable to watch anytime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a team of commandos are sent into the jungle of Latin America on a rescue mission they discover that the enemy they face is nothing they could have expected.Even after all this time, 'Predator' is one of those movies that I truly love. Yes, the plot is nothing groundbreaking. Yes, the acting is a little wooden. Yes, some of the optical effects are looking a little dated. But, this is one of those classics that just never grows dull even after multiple viewings. The story is quite thin, but is fast paced and when the action does happen, it happens with bells and whistles on! The characters are all well defined and likable in a macho "muscles and guns" kind of way. And of course there is the Predator itself, which is a true classic of monster design. The creature effects are just outstanding, especially the unmasking sequence which is going to be one of those movie clips that will be shown in many years to come. Even though this is an Arnie vehicle, he just plays second string to the title character, and it does make a change to see him get the absolute crap kicked out of him. All in all, this is a stand-out movie, and if by some small reason you have never seen it, you really need to go and buy it on DVD now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot think of another movie the Terminator has made that is as good as this."Predator" is so amazingly good that some tend to overrate it. It is, no doubt, an excellent film, particularly when compared to many of the films in its genre, but that hardly makes it the 'flawless masterpiece' it is often called by its devoted legion of fans. Though the film is professional and of good quality throughout, the script can hardly be called perfect, featuring some of the most unintentionally hilarious moments in A-movie history. Also, though some of the acting is excellent, Schwarzenegger, even in action hero terms, is hardly the greatest actor to ever walk the planet. He is simply incapable of producing a performance similar to Sly Stallone in "First Blood" or "Rocky", or similar to Bruce Willis in "Unbreakable", or for that matter McTiernan's masterpiece "Die Hard". The cinematography and score more than make up for this however, and the action scenes are absolutely superb. McTiernan also makes the wise decision not to show the Predator in full for quite a while, saving the monster for the final sequences and adding a lot to the film in terms of tension and atmosphere.All in all, rousingly entertaining blockbuster action!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The planet earth is home to a plethora of savage, vicious and lethal killers. However, they dim in comparison to the most dangerous hunter of them all, . . . . the Human animal. Thus it is incredible to discover, despite all of his creative weapons and intelligence, this Human Hunter itself has come to the attention of a new menace. The story itself was created by John and Jim Thomas who with director John McTiernan offer this incredible and fantastic film called " Predator. " It tells the tale of a planetary visitor who's ancestors have been visiting earth for generations hunting the most dangerous animals on Earth. It's challenge is to confront a special squad of professional soldiers in a duel to the death. R.G. Armstrong plays General Phillips who with C.I.A. Operative Dillion (Carl Weathers) invite the finest American team leader available lead by Major Dutch, (Arnold Schwarzenegger) their operation's commander to seek out and rescue a special cabinet minister from enemy hands. Taking the elite members like Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke, Shane Black, Richard Chaves and Sonny Landham as Billy, Dutch begins by dropping into a dense South American Jungle and discovers the gorilla rebels are low caliber soldiers and nothing compare with them or their real enemy. What begins as an exercise in jungle combat, the special Team suddenly realizes it's up against a sophisticated alien (Kevin Peter Hall) out to not only defeat, but to kill and display them as trophies. Elpidia Carrillo is Anna, who tries to explain, the strange killer has visited earth many years before. This movie is terrific in it's inception, violent in it's delivery and wonderfully graphic in it's confrontation between Earthmen and their Nemesis. Schwarzenegger will no doubt go on to make other great films, but this dramatic movie will nonetheless become a sci-fi Classic for all time. Superb! Recommended, for the strong at heart who seek a military adventure from out of this world. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This piece of cinematography deserves its special place among the Hall of Fame but you already know that (for those who watched the movie). But the strange thing is people get mislead reading comments on this classic.First of all, this movie is a complete masterpiece in terms of balancing components such as : plot, actor play, ideas developed , sense of atmosphere to thrill, to experience, to entertain , to make you want more of it. From the original joke-idea (read trivia) through all the shooting of the movie to its very this is an instant classic.Secondly, this movie is not about some hardcore veteran soldiers on a deadly mission who occasionally got stuck in a deadly situation becoming prey of some deadly alien stalker. This movie is all about the classic action/thriller/horror ? recipe. Something the genre has lost over the years. It is all about the enthusiasm this movie was shot with thus becoming a legend. You who read this : Do you know anyone who disagrees this movie rocks and doesn't remember a single line from it ? The squad. Perfect in its simplicity. Everybody has his/her own story presented in a gentle way not to be too much of a drag in the plot. Colorful personalities as long they survive in the dangerous flora and fauna. Yes they are machos. The setting does not assume sissies with guns. From the josher Hawkins to the mysterious Billy. The leader of the pack (Dutch) loses all his men and as the soldier prime he gets to avenge his fallen brothers thus ensuring his own survival. Classic ! The predator. The "man of few words" in other words "the Beast". The e.t of modern cinema just to hold the highest score...Created by men to become a legend.Are there still people who didn't see the movie ?</fullReview>

Watching the same "girlie men" that star in a Hollywood movie these days in a movie like this, would be hilarious! The film follows a group of soldiers on a rescue mission into the jungle. Deep in the jungle they soon find themselves battling an "invisible" enemy from another world.Predator has a simple but interesting plot. The whole atmosphere in the movie is great. The cast is perfect for a movie like this. The action is wild and mindless but not too over the top, like in a lot of movies nowadays. To sum it up I would recommend this movie to all who like good action movies with elements of science fiction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Predator, one of my Sci-Fi favourites. To be honest with you, I'm not a Sci-Fi fan, apart from The Terminator series, Sci-Fi's like Aliens, The Thing and all those type of movies have never been compelling to me. Predator doesn't feel like a Sci-Fi, they're not in a space-ship or involved with some sort of high-powered unit, its set in a very wide, featured environment: the jungle. This movie created a very rare, and predatory villain that was then featured in comic books, and in future released movies. Its got excellent effects (nice use of CGI), a great ending and some good acting. Predator is your one source for a 'different' theme in the genre Sci-Fi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Action + Great Dialogue + Arnie = Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my all time favourites, Predator is all you want out of an action flick. It combines elements of action, sci-fi and horror to create the ultimate entertainment beast! Throw in some insanely violent action sequences staged with aplomb by John McTiernan, some great special effects courtesy of Stan Winston and Joel Silver and some easily quotable dialogue for the pub and you have the ingredients for a great film. Although Arnie's marines, the symbol of 1980's muscular American foreign policy are the driving force of the film and spar of one-another, the star of the film is without doubt the Pred, who not only looks the part but sounds like a complete nutter too. Watch in awe as he takes out Arnie's platoon with a vast array of sadistic intergalactic guerrilla tactics, most of which on multiple viewings become hilarious after Mac, Dillon, Blaine and co's macho posturing. But the Pred didn't count for one thing...The big Austrian guy!9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is great fun. Predator is really one of the best bad-asses in the movie history. Maybe he doesn't act much but he has the moves all bad-asses need. He has a bad-ass face , bad-ass moves, bad-ass humor (who the hell are u) and a lot of charisma for an alien! Yes maybe Arnie is not the best actor but this roll is written for him and him only. As far as the macho things go Mctiernan does it very slick.. The part where Arnie and Carl meet and the camera shows the muscles i mean hell maybe is a little too much macho but hell u know its meant to be that way and hell they really have muscles.The story itself is not complicated but its doesn't need to be. Its pure action and the tempo is high and all the 1 line jokes are funny (i don't have time to bleed, it ain't no man) Overall great fun, great action and Predator at its best!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is classic cult</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is extremely well put together and acted in my opinion. I feel that it's just a really good action/horror movie were you can relax and watch some mindless violence. No, seriously I feel like the predator or "yautja" were really well put together and were very realistic. I also found the actor very good, even Arnie who is not one of my favourite actors helped raise the tension with his acting. the fact that the predator is always watching yet you cant see him is a great scare factor and helps to get you on the edge of your seat as you don't know when he's going to attack. All in all an excellent cult classic that will please anyone who wants to watch a great film which will raise your adrenaline levels to the max.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Predator (1987, Dir. John McTiernan) Dutch and a small group of commandos and sent by the CIA to a Central American Jungle, to rescue capture airmen from Guerillas. But it's not the armed terrorists which are the problem. Something hidden in the jungle, something invisible to the naked eye, something not of this earth is the problem. As Dutch and his men had back to transport, they are slowly targeted one by one.If you enjoy the Alien series, then you are going to like this. No questions about it. 'Predator' is just a amazing classic sci-fi film. The actors all give amazing performances, with this being one of Arnold's best roles. Each character has their own identity. The special effects are amazing and although the story is basic, it really keeps you hooked. The Predator when fully revealed has an amazing look and really gives an amazing feeling to it.

		<fullReview>If you have not seen this movie before, I strongly recommend it. Here's the idea: 7 members of an elite rescue team are sent into the jungle to rescue some very important people. But, as soon as they come there, they realize there is some kind of force stalking them... and it is picking them off, one by one.Basically, this movie is the ultimate sci-fi horror there is, next to Alien. The acting is superb, the action is great, and the score is quite simply the best you'll ever hear.NOTE: I don't recommend this if you have a very weak stomach, because there are some intensely gory scenes. Aside from this, it is still nonetheless a great masterpiece. Although Predator 2 got an NC-17 rating, this is still pretty gory... Highly Recommended11/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie dozens of times and it's still a thriller, even though I know what will be happening. The cast of characters is totally awesome and rarely have competitive action movies included so many unique and compelling personalities. I was really disappointed when the "Governator" did not reprise his role in Predator 2 and also that a Predator 3 hasn't been delivered yet. I realize that Kevin Peter Hall (the Predator) died after the second movie, but they made an Alien vs Predator, so get someone else. This original Predator movie is #1 on my list with the Terminator series a close second. I really hope the powers that be come around and do a "final" sequel where we can get back a little revenge on these inter-galactic lizards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Predator has to be one of my favourite movies since it has action, gore, great acting, a great music score and one of the coolest creatures in history. The Predator looks so cool with the weapons, mask, the roar, the dreadlocks, the face and the characteristics created by Kevin Peter Hall. The plot sees a crack team of commandos sent to the jungles of South America to rescue some hostages and once they get there they discover that it was a cover up, they was just sent there to stop a major invasion. As they try to get to the pick up point they find themselves being hunted by the Predator that is blending itself with the jungle. I won't give out too much of the film otherwise it will spoil it.Predator is a classic 80's action/ sci horror movie that has to be seen. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rate Predator as one of my all-time favorite Sci-Fi/action movies. The plot is totally believable, the acting is very competent, the action is non-stop, &amp; the "predator" is a real class act of costuming &amp; SFX. I have always been a fan of Arnold's, but this one is one of his best, along with Conan, Commando, Terminator, &amp; of course, The Villain (a hilarious hoot of a Western parody!). This film is one I never tire of watching when I need a fix of fright &amp; testosterone soaked heroics. The only Sci-Fi film I like as well is "The Thing" (the John Carpenter version), for much the same reasons. The music adds a lot to this movie too...perfect for an "army meets the monster" flick. True, as some folks have pointed out, there are some errors in it but just watch it for the fun of it &amp; you'll probably never notice the goofs they allude to. My wife even likes this film &amp; she's not big on gore &amp; bad language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfectly Made Action Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First to dispel the inevitable confusion about the above rating. How can a film about an alien killing marines in the middle of the jungle afford a "eight"? The answer is not a question of whether the film's premise is worthy of this rating, but whether the film itself is nine worthy. 'Predator' most certainly deserves to be praised. It is one of the best action films ever produced.This is because within the confines of the action-film genre, Predator fulfills every criterion faithfully.The first rule of action films, entertain the audience. Predator passes this test with flying colors. It is very watchable and is bound to keep any action fan happy. This film is simply never boring and maintains the tension the entire way through.The second rule, don't try and overload a story, focus on its execution. This is where the magic of Predator comes to the fore. The audience is kept entranced not because of the film's inherent charisma, but rather the way it is put together. The cinematography and sound is used for suspense rather than spectacle. The film oozes atmosphere and mood to the point where you feel as though you are stuck within the "world of hurt" on screen. This is why this film is just so much fun. It strips away the aspects that make some action films unbearable. 'Predator' is perfectly made. McTeirnan's direction is faultless.The third rule; have distinct characters that people can still relate to. This is another area where the film strikes gold. The characters are masculine, macho and muscular. They tell dirty jokes and kill things. Yet despite their obvious similarities the entire ensemble seems unique. They are given plenty of screen time before things inevitably start to go wrong. As a result, it is much easier to connect with the marines and the unfortunate situation they find themselves in.The fourth rule; stage terrific action sequences. The action sequences in this film aren't grand in scale but are dazzling in execution. Completely entertaining despite the film's budget.Predator is beautifully made from start to finish. It follows every convention within the action genre but is so tightly directed it is still very much worth the effort. Movie Makers take note when producing the next brainless, adolescent-fantasy action romp. If more film's followed McTeirnan's example the action genre wouldn't be so rampantly dull.</fullReview>

Taking place in deepest darkest jungle of Cambodia, this film takes you on a journey that will make you stand up and cheer at it's conclusion. Arnold Schwarzenegger give the performance of a lifetime, and Carl Weathers shines with Excellence. Gunplay, knives, mischief and mayhem are all involved in this 80's classic.

		<fullReview>Wonderful action film! Really enjoyed it!Predator is a film which can easily be enjoyed as a piece of entertainment. It isn't edgy, it isn't subtle and it doesn't give us much to ponder on but for a two hour roller-coaster ride I can't think of many films which can match this.The acting in general is quite good, the actor who plays the PREDATOR does so very well as well as Carl Weathers. Many people have criticized the film for being a kill fest but there is depth here, it might not come from the characters but it certainly does from the plot.The script is excellent and must have evoked a lot of imagination when first reading it. The films interpretation of the PREDATOR is very impressive, with very good special effects definitely deserving its academy award, indeed there is a lot of innovation here especially in CGI effects. This combined with John McTiernans great direction gives the film a brilliant visual look with steady cinematography which lets the story flow easily. However I couldn't help but think that the world was a bit too stereotypical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a crew of specialists is called in to trouble-shoot a problem and fix it, nothing could prepare them for what would follow. For me this is a hard-hitting solid, cold calculated role for Schwarzennegger. Not over thrown by one liners, not lame special- effects, over dramatization of the story, just a master work, done by John McTiernan, the same director that made Bruce Willis a house hold action character name. This was astounding!! The story as it starts, when they land and go into action, taking some guerrilla fighters out. Guerilla forces that have captured some American soldiers and are killing them, attempting to take over that area and occupy the territory. As Dutch (Schwarzennegger) leads his team in with cutting skill, they find surround and move in and take out a large number of fighters that have A few American soldiers with them. Then, after they have put it together and wrapped it up, they realize something is not right. There is unfinished business. They move out again after a soldier holding a woman is brutally killed, with no explanation, and the woman has seen the attack and is not making any verbal sense of any of it. This is where the terror is just starting in!So with the native Indian guide, a 'Tracker' (Sonny Landham) who's skills are honed and highly in demand for this type of work. Leading the crew of 'Specialists' including Jesse 'The Body' Venture, and Bill 'The Killer' Duke -(from many different roles)into a mission that is not what it was 'sold' to them originally. Carl Weathers, who was not so straight with them, ends up as sort of a sacrificial lamb anyway. Very well-fit considering, he was part of the original 'information' problem.The team, finds their objective and neutralizes the problem, only to find, that there is something else waiting in the wings...for them. Hunting, the expert hunters, as if it's nothing, at all. The film, is haunting, in the daylight. But when the night comes, nothing is as it seems, for this band of military brothers...Shane Black, who wrote and co-starred in this picture was right on it, all the way. This film, grips you, and pulls you into a terrifying situation, that keeps you guessing, unsure of the outcome! I rate this a ten for ten, because it rocks you and rolls all the way through. Riveting, I recommend it highly for Arnold fans or even if you don't like him, so what this one delivers it all.(****)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have only just seen this film recently and I wasn't expecting too much from it. But after seeing it, the only thing I can say is 'wow!' this is such a cool film, with good old Arnie in the role of the hero giving the great one-liners that have become expected of him. But this is much more than just another brainless action film. Although the film is based around the action, there are also strong elements of horror, sci- fi and thriller, as well as some very funny moments and utterly cool lines. I know that not every one will like this film, and many will dismiss it as brainless and shallow, but the fact is that it was not made to please everyone. What it is, is a macho movie, made by guys, for guys, and I recommend this film to every red-blooded male out there. it may not be a cinematic masterpiece (although it certainly has its moments) it is a hugely enjoyable film to watch.

One of the few movies that I can watch every couple years, and still be engaged until the ending credits roll onto the screen. Also one of the few movies I honestly feel was done perfectly, in the sense that I could not find anything through out the entire movie that they could have done better. Original story (for the time). If watched for the first time today, could almost still be current (made almost 20 years ago). Great cast of believable characters. Arnold in his prime. I've always felt it perfectly encapsulates the type of box office action hits of the 1980's. To me, it's the Ode to the 80's action movie's ... shooting everything and everyone; the one liners, my personal favorite from this movie ... "Stick around" Arnold says after impaling a guerilla from across the room with a 2 foot blade :) Very little dialog, but when there is, it sets the feel of the movie and story perfectlyIn short definitely a Classic</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Arnold Schwarzengger and his rescue team are coerced into rescuing a cabinet minister from the Cuban jungle, they find mutilated corpses and are eventually hunted down one by one by a vicious alien who's only pleasure in life is that of hunting and killing for sport. Schwarzenegger decides that running is not an option anymore and wills his men to fight back against the creature. When his entire team is killed in ever more gruesome circumstances by the unstoppable extra terrestrial he decides to take the fight back to the alien and a muscular bout of action ensues.Director John Mctiernan has crafted a very streamlined and muscular action film here, and as such the film moves at a breakneck speed without pausing to ponder some of the implausibilities on show. The action is frenetic and nicely edited, and as the film progresses the tension begins to become unbearable. Here is one of the best action movies of the eighties, with some of the best effects from the pre-cgi era.Shcwarzenegger proves one of his best performances here as the leader of the aforementioned rescue squad, and as well as obviously being very physically able he presents just the right mix of hard edged authority and wide eyed vulnerability when he realises that for once he is fighting against something that could best him in unarmed combat. The rest of his squad is split into the usual mix of stereotypes. There's the Indian chappie with the big knife who naively believes he can take on the predator and succeed, there's the cowboy who refers to himself as a 'sexual tyrannosaurus' and carries an extremely large mini-gun. And then there's Carl Weathers, who despite seeming to be an established military soldier manages to mess everything up on a constant basis, and willingly accepts a berating from one of Arnies men despite being ranked higher than him.Plot wise, we don't gain much information on the Predator. Seen arriving in a spaceship at the beginning we know its an alien and we gather from the way it stalks the team and kills them one by one that it is a hunter. We see it rip the spine out of one of its victims and attach the skull to a belt around its waste, which again signifies a hunter celebrating a kill. When it is revealed that it only kills those who are armed we know it is killing for sport and in a fair kind of way. This is a link to a possible 'honour system' for the predator, although this is of course just as guess. We don't need to worry about specifics because when the team starts being killed one by one all we worry about is how the predator is going to perform a kill next.The setting is probably the strongest part of the film. The huge and expansive jungle is suitably foreboding and provides a stunning atmosphere of dread to the film. Forget the romanticised jungle that is present in the hit TV show 'Lost' because after the soldiers spend five minutes in this jungle you already know that you wouldn't want to do the same. The enormous trees, bizarre sounds and threat of death by a giant alien is enough to put anyone off jungles for life.The effects are top notch, with the Predators invisibility defence mechanism providing some impressive shimmering effects. The laser gun it has mounted to its shoulder might look puny in appearance but when it punches a huge hole in one of the marines' chests you'll treat it with more respect. On this note, it is fair to say that the combat in the film is some of the best around. The feeling of power is incredible, and it comes early on as the team single handedly destroys a base that seems to contain the entire Cuban army. The huge explosions aren't just superfluous as they seem to hit the audience with ferocious energy, and when the rescue team spots the Predator and opens fire you'll have to resist the urge to duck. All seven men open fire on the jungle in an awesome display of firepower that not only destroys a large portion of the jungle but in reality should really alert the entire country to the teams' presence considering how much noise is being made.On a final note, the mano-a-mano conflict at the end between Arnie and the Predator is superb. Although people might be tempted to laugh at Arnie when he makes his impressively primal scream into the night, but considering his team is all dead and he's about to fight a heavily armed alien with nothing more than a bow and arrow and some mud for protection you realise hes got nothing to lose.Overall this is one of the best action movies ever made, and the presence of only one female means that the masculine feel to the film isn't tainted and the action doesn't have to be softened or dumbed down (indeed, some of the gore is disturbing.) Forget the sequel and its poor quality because this is a superb film!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, this is a great movie!! One of my favorite Arnold Schwarzenegger classics. I never get tired of watching it over and over again even though I have first seen this movie when I was 8 years old. At first, I thought that they were only fighting some guerrillas or something but as the movie goes on, here comes the alien with vulnerable abilities, killing them one by one. Arnold Schwarzenegger (Dutch) and Jesse Ventura (Sgt. Blain) -- use their muscled intellects to pursue a force more sinister than state budget crises. It's an otherworldly creature deep in the jungle adept at slaughtering our best-trained fighters, and worse yet, it's practically invisible. Special effects, dizzying camera work and a sci-fi bent elevate this gory horror-action, making the 1990 sequel a given. However, in the end, man is still the survivor. Aliens are not invited. Good job to John Mctiernan and his crew. I love the special effects. Now that I'm on 26 years of age, I still love this movie. I like the it's original and unique concept. I think that even future generations will like this movie as much as I do. Predator is no match for the Terminator: Arnold Schwarzenegger</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a cast like this, who knew it would be a hit? "PREDATOR" is the ultimate movie of a very stealthy killer. A top commando team lead by Dutch(Arnold Schwarzenegger) who meets Dillon(Carl Weathers, Rocky 1-4, "Action Jackson") who can't out-muscle one another. So when they go out into the jungle, each soldier have their own weapons: Blaine(Jesse Ventura, WWE wrestling legend) has the Gatlin gun, Billy(Sonny Landham, "48 Hours") has the M-16 w/shotgun, and others go to the Central America jungle who take out the renegade army, but encounter something more deadly, The Predator! After Mac(Bill Duke) caught and kills a scorpion, why would the Predator be curious about a dead scorpion? Then after every commando are picked one-by-one, Dutch does his best to outmaneuver this sneaky alien killer. To me, this killer makes all other snipers, look like complete amateurs. I've enjoyed this movie from the start, it was never a letdown, the action was always there, and Arnold is always at his best! Rating 5 stars.</fullReview>

I can only think of one other film that had the same impact on my generation, and that was Aliens. I defy anyone who saw it in the 80's to say they didn't run around school, knocking out the one liners and chatting endlessly about Blanes big chain gun.Of course Billy was spooked, who wouldn't be when a dreadlocked rasta alien appears out of nowhere and is hard enough to take out Jessie 'the ace' Ventura. 10 out of 10, i would have given it 100 out of 10 if i could.</fullReview>

The film was entitled 'Predator' and I remember the catchphrase of the film being, 'nothing like has be seen on earth before' which was quite fitting seeing how I had never seen a horror film before (I was only 8!). Little did I know but by watching this film I would be creating an expectation in me that I would use to benchmark other films, of a similar genre, for years to come. As it happens I am still waiting for a film to better 'Predator' of course the Alien series comes close, with maybe Aliens coming in on an even par, though with 'Predator' being my introduction to sci-fi horror it still has a slight edge.One of the things that impress's me the most about this film, is the direction given by the director, John Mc Tiernan. Within the action movie genre there is a tendency for the films to rely heavily on the gun fights, explosions and violence to provide the audience with the gratification they need to enjoy the film. Things like plot, script and character development are usually neglected or in some cases ignored completely (anyone seen DNA!!). This is a complete contrast in the film 'Predator', which I feel is the driving force of the movie. For example the character Hawkins, the funny guy, who is continually telling jokes. This character is much smaller then the rest of the group and also looks less threatening, which is maybe why the predator kill's him first. As a result Hawkins uses his humour to gain acceptance from the group. This is portrayed in the scenes where he is telling Billy his jokes. In relation to Billy here is another interesting case, his Indian American sixth sense is used to fantastic effect, within the context of the film it is used to create tension and fear amongst all the other characters. This can clearly be seen in the conversation between him and Poncho. Billy say's that he is 'scared' and Poncho replies 'you ain't afraid of no man'. Emphasising that Billy is one tough mother and is scared of know body, but when it comes to the thing hunting them, he knows that their days are numbered.As I have already stated this film set down a bench mark for me and probably for this movie genre in general. The whole concept of the film, the action, suspense, horror and originality makes this film not just one of my best films of all time but one of the classic sci-fi horrors as well.

		<shortDescription>Schwarzenegger's Best Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I truly believe that this is Arnold Schwarzenegger's best film to date. I know that's saying a lot, but I did like it better than The Terminator, which is a close second.Predator follows a group of commandos who are hired by the CIA to go on a rescue mission and take out terrorists on the way. But they encounter a problem after all the bad guys have been taken down. It seems that the people they were going to save have been slaughtered by something unknown.One by one each member of the team becomes the prey for this thing that no one can see and no one can kill. All we know is that it can bleed, which means there must be a way to stop it.The film keeps you on the edge of your seat from the moment the commandos arrive to the end when we finally get a good look at the Predator.I highly recommend this to any action or sci-fi movie fan. Fans of Schwarzenegger already know how great it is, so I'm sure they're wondering when he'll make another film as good as this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"If it bleeds, we can kill."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those pictures where Schwarzenegger actually got lucky. The film's strength is that it can stand on its own without him. Of course, he gives a good performance in all but how demanding could the role really be? This film is great on so many levels. First, director John McTiernan does a phenomenal job here. As far as I'm concerned, this is his best work. Next, you've got an amazing score by Alan Silvestri - a musician who needs no introduction. Lastly, there's the creature itself. However, the thanks for that is a somewhat vague mixture of the Thomas screenwriters and the horde of special effects designers brought into the project. Apparently, there was some trouble with the "look" of the creature once production started. Nevertheless, the result was the true star of the film - a real marvel of science fiction and horror.Although this film may solely be for action fans (there's a number of one-liners), I argue that it achieves much more in credibility. This is actually a well-crafted suspenseful adrenaline rush of horror. Easily, one of the best films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than a great action flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I managed to avoid seeing Predator for at least 10 years after its release. I figured, "Another Die-Hard but with Arnold instead of Bruce", so why waste my time? Then one night I caught the last half of the film on cable and began to realize there was more going on than just great special effects.Arnold and his band of commandos seem a bit hokey at the beginning, although the tension between A. and Carl Weathers (Rocky) builds nicely. But the whole opening act is merely build-up for the main event: we see this elite "black ops" group take down a much larger rebel group in fine style, only to discover something really ugly and a bit scary. Then, one by one, each member of the team is picked off by something they can't quite see, until only Arnold is left. Anyone who's seen the final 30 minutes of this film can tell you that it's worth the wait, but I've discovered that getting there really is half the fun.The alien Predator is a sort of "big game" hunter who apparently sees our little planet as the best game preserve in the galaxy. "He" has all the advantages, both physical and technological, and he's even more arrogant than the humans he's hunting. That's the real hook to this story: the Predator is super-macho personified, and by all rights no human should stand a chance. Arnold's character only survives by using stealth and trickery, something rarely seen in most AS flicks. Even at the end, when he has the Predator seemingly at his mercy, the creature turns the tables on him one last time.This is an action flick with a heart and some real intelligence behind the special effects and explosions. Even today, having seen it many times, I still get drawn into the story when it shows up on late-night cable. Definitely worth having in your library.</fullReview>

Set in the jungle with a small armed forces team there is only one outcome! John McTiernan absolutely nails it in terms of raw action and plot. Who cares why they got sent in to the jungle, all that matters is that from start to finish there are great one liners, incredible action scenes and tense moments. I never get bored of watching this epic and any MALE that rates it less than 10 should go and get his Gender checked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the greatest action movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure most movies have explosions, and intense car chases......but few lack depth. Sure you have your Clint Eastwood flicks in the 70's that can provide that aspect....but the re-birth of Sci-Fi in the early 80's brought about an incredible concept, among tons of muscle action films that were brought about in that era How can you not have a better idea, an alien life form is sent to earth, deep in the south American jungle, who's soul purpose is to hunt humans, much like men hunt deer. But wait a minute, here come a group of body building bad asses, who are probably the best trained killers on the planet......what more could you possibly ask for in an action movie? Or should i say, how could you have a better setting for an action flick? I mean come on, its the classic tale of the ultimate hunter fighting for good, against the ultimate hunter fighting for evil......it has been shown in many aspects, mainly in western films, and especially in Jaws......but never in a Sci-Fi action epic, and never with a better painted picture, or setting such as this. Overall, i cannot think of a better pound for pound action movie that is packed with everything.....explosions, adrenaline filled action sequences, fantastic cinematography, and a story that isn't just plain black and white like most action films. In my opinion, it is the best action film ever......and if you say it isn't, then you can easily say that its pretty damn close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ahh! The heyday of Arnie's movie career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yep, that's what it felt like when I recently re-watched this on DVD. Those were the days when you didn't need character development and meaningful looks into the camera. You didn't need flowery dialogue or unecessary story exposition. All you needed for a blockbuster was Arnie, and a load of big guns.I specifically use the term heyday, since it now appears that Big Arnie may well be winding down his film career in favour of a political one. Recent releases like T3 show he can still do the action, but he isn't getting any younger. I'd hate to still see him doing action when he is no longer capable of it. That would bring back too many memories of Chuck Norris........perish the thought!However, Predator was one of his early greats. No real plot, as such, just a bunch of soldiers with Arnie as their leader, facing off against an alien menace. In those days, you knew that Arnie would survive. Death was not a contract option for him. Spouting his corny (sometimes so corny that you couldn't do anything but cringe as he uttered them, though in a delighted, warm fuzzy feeling way, not a "god that's awful" way) Arnie bulldozed his way through enemies, plot, dialogue coaches teaching et al as he made movie after movie with nothing more complicated at its heart than action, action and yet more action.Predator was also the first movie that I can remember that, in the tradition of having big guns in Arnie flicks, had a man-portable mini-gun in it. Even more astonishing, or perhaps purposefully done, is the fact that Arnie never uses it. Perhaps the implication behind this was that he doesn't NEED to. He's tough enough without it!All in all, Predator satisfies the action requirements of any Arnie film. There's not the humour of later films, or Commando, for that matter, but it is still one of his greats.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, it's that fu..in' alien that started it all, in another super dooper fantastic box office smash Arnie movie. These were the years, like all those other flexing meatheads we loved, when they did better movies. In this original, the best of course if only stacked up against No 2 (as I haven't seen the others) we see much more of the alien, some nice ones in CU- who is as Arnie quotes, "One ugly son of a bitch". The story starts off pretty much as Rambo, where an elite team of commandos go into the jungles of South America, to take down an army of rebels who have hostages, where this part of story eases beautifully among the great shootout sequences, with Arnie, popping in a few one liners, and then the other more graver part of the movie, the predator. Much blood is spilled, more here than the second, where one by one, they are taken out by this beast who moves with beautifully agility in camouflage, until he's down to one man. Have a guess, who? The last twenty minutes, is a much grueling due between two adversaries, with Arnie baiting the monster, and it's a greatly shot and thought out sequence. Remember, the predator is no push over, none more a hell of a challenge. Elpidia Carrillo, as the only remaining hostage, is given more dialogue, than you think she would be given. She's very good. Arnie's Arnie. Weathers, looks like Action Jackson at the start, indeed a worry, while the supporting and very familiar connected cast, including a lucrative screenwriter, give better performances, Ventura, an acting revelation, while it was Sonny Landham's performance which got me. A very well made sci fi horror, and another notch on Arnie's blockbusters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic 80's action movie that is still popular today.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Predator is one of those 80's action movies that still stands as a classic movie. It is also one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best movies in his blockbusting career. This is pure alpha male testosterone at its finest. It's got it all: explosions, big guns, violent action, huge biceps, larger than life personalities, no nonsense story lines, and plenty of one-liners that still hold a special place amongst movie geeks. Director John Mc Tiernan has also struck gold with this classic gem of a movie and would later go on to establish himself as a reputable director with movies such as Die Hard (1988) and The Hunt for Red October (1990).Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is the leader of a special ops rescue team sent in by a CIA taskforce led by General Phillips (R.G. Armstrong) to spearhead a rescue operation of political officials and military personnel held hostage by insurgents in an South American rebel camp situated in Val Verde following a helicopter crash. Dutch maintains that he is solely a rescue team, not assassins. Dutch's team includes Mac (Bill Duke, Commando), Billy (Sonny Landham, 48 Hrs), Blain (Jesse Ventura, The Running Man), Ramirez (Richard Chaves) and Hawkins (Shane Black, screenwriter of Lethal Weapon). Also assigned to the rescue operation is an old friend of Dutch's CIA agent Dillon (Carl Weathers, Rocky). Not long after insertion, they stumble across the horrifically skinned bodies of three soldiers believed to be at the hands of the rebels. Following the successful all out assault of the rebel camp in which the insurgents are successfully taken down, Dutch takes prisoner a female guerrilla named Anna (Elpidia Carrillo). Dutch also finds out that Dillon set up and used Dutch's team as expendable assets to take down the rebel camp in revenge for the deaths of the military personnel and its hostages. Unbeknownst to the rescue team, an extra-terrestrial alien with superhuman strength, advanced weaponry and thermal imagery has come from another planet and is hunting humans for sport. One by one the rescue team are being hunted down and picked off by this unknown predator which leads to an inevitable confrontation with Dutch.While this is one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best roles, it also feels like a who's who of the 80's tough guys with Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura and Sonny Landham who featured in numerous action movies throughout the 1980's and these men were a welcome addition to the cast of Predator. Shane Black was also notable for going on to establish himself for his work as a screenwriter with Lethal Weapon (1987) and The Last Boy Scout (1991) as well as a director with Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005) and Iron Man 3 (2013). Producer Joel Silver was well known force behind an assortment of many blockbusters such as 48 Hrs (1982), Commando (1985), Die Hard (1988) and Die Hard 2 (1990), the Lethal Weapon series, and The Matrix series.Composer Alan Silvestri (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump) always produces fantastic work and his orchestral score keeps Predator exciting to watch as well as the movie's ability for shock and awe.With Arnold Schwarzenegger's quirky one liners, Predator is still a popular 80's action movie that is still well liked by many fans. Predator is one of those movies that they just do not make like that anymore. I believe that the sequels and the Aliens v Predator spinoffs do not hold a candle to the original Predator movie and this is THE movie that still never gets old 29 years later.9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Predator, when you sit down and think about it, is a great deal more thoughtful than most of Arnie's brainless, all guns blazing action movies. The film is less sympathetic towards its military protagonists. Rather, it shows them up. Juxtaposing Schwarzenegger and his fellow cast spending the first half of the film measuring each other's manhoods, we spend the film's climax with an excellently designed creature seemingly built for battle. While the Predator is born to fight, humanity chooses to. Ooh. That's probably a deeper analysis than the filmmakers ever intended. Aside from all that, it's loud, quite fun and it's got lovely violence all the way through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enter the memorable handshake, cue the music; classic 80's in a nutshell and masterfully done at that. This is the height of not only Arnold's career but also action movies in general. Seeing tons of action stars and pre-mayors is tons of fun and eerie, and the inclusion of a sweet alien hunter from another planet is the cherry on top. Wait till the end and I promise you won't be disappointed, plus there were an incredible amount of famous and quotable one liners I hear time and time again, such as "I ain't got time to bleed" and "your one ugly motherf*****." The fight scenes are memorable and seeing the psychological impacts of the hunter taking on the prey is a great experience. The suspense slowly builds throughout and the mood carries the film strongly upon it's back, as you witness the group slowly picked off by the universes greatest hunter. And I must say I love the predator, so much detail was given to his design and he looks truly sleek. I must say he is one of my favorite monsters/ hunters in cinema. I give this a 10 out of 10 for the predator alone. "There's something out there waiting for us, and it ain't no man. We're all gonna die." -Billy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This original Predator # one is extraordinary, even in repeat viewing, for Arnold fans. Its sequels are OK, especially number two with Danny Glover but this one is the best. For first viewers it has a great, slow reveal to terror. Two future state governors worked on this one and both are interesting to watch, both former athletes with large bodies. The only two issue I had with this one is ? A) In one scene it shows Arnold going for his knife only to discover it has fallen out of his sheath somewhere, back perhaps during his two long falls into water. Later, we see that he has magically found it, somehow. B) In the final scene, he has escaped the predator. The predator has set up what appears to be a nuclear explosion in attempt to destroy his adversary, who has dealt him a lethal dose of heavy timber. A helicopter shows up on the scene. Inn the middle of the jungle and after the explosion, the helicopter magically locates Arnold. Giant gaps like this work against my suspension of disbelief. What also works against the grain is that something like that gruesome monster, a brutal hunter, has managed to create the technology for interstellar travel. It's akin to believing that a wild boar has accomplished rocket science and all of its ramifications.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the remote jungle of a Central American country, an elite group of commandos led by Major Dutch Schaeffer (Arnold Schwarzenegger), embarks on a CIA mission to clear out a guerrilla stronghold and rescue the remaining hostages. However, the hunters become the hunted when a highly intelligent, otherworldly being slowly and methodically starts killing off members of Dutch's team. Possessing a chameleonlike camouflaging ability and a deadly alien arsenal, the creature tracks down the soldiers one by one.Since the movie Predators is going to be released next week, I shall be watching Predator, Predator 2, Aliens vs. Predators and Aliens vs. Predators 2: Requiem so let's start where it all started, with Arnold Schwarzenegger. The story is great and well written, it really kept your attention throughout the movie because you really wanted all of the characters to escape or kill the Predator. The characters were also done well as each of them had their own personalities and you cared what happened to them, which is fantastic in a movie. The acting was brilliant however there were a couple of parts that were mediocre but it doesn't spoil the film in any way. The direction is great, the writing is well done and the special effects were done well, considering this movie is from the eighties. Overall though, Predator is a winner.The last time I saw this movie, I was eight years old and it was on the television one night and I vaguely remembered it but after watching the movie again, it's a mystery to me how I didn't remember it because it's such a brilliant movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger was brilliant as Dutch and the rest of the cast played their parts great, even if there were a couple of shaky moments. I just loved how you really cared for the characters and how you cared if they lived or died. The special effects were great and it was good to see a bit of eighties' special effects, it just shows how much times have changed. I also liked how the movie was set in the jungle where you could easily get Now, judging by the review I've just written, you'd say that there was hardly anything wrong with the movie, right? Wrong. There were a couple of scenes that bugged me but I'm pretty sure wouldn't bug others and I can't say what they are without spoiling however, this kind of spoiled the movie for me a little but I doubt it would for you. That's my only negative about it but this movie did have some great memorable scenes. If you like science-fiction horror movies, you need to pick this up because this would be a must-watch!

		<fullReview>Like ALIENS and TERMINATOR 2, PREDATOR is a timeless sci-fi action classic. Made in 1987, it hasn't aged one bit. Ah-nuld leads a team of commandos into a dense Latin America jungle on a mission that soon has them being hunted by an alien armed to the teeth and with the ability to make himself virtually invisible. One by one, Ah-nuld's boys are picked off until it's down to Ah-nuld versus the creature. We get no explanation as to why the creature is on Earth, nor does it really matter. We know through Ah-nuld's actions later in the film that the thing clearly is on the hunt for armed warriors as a test of its prowess, obviously a rite of passage where this thing comes from. Great overacting by the entire cast, especially Jesse "I ain't got time to bleed" Venture, great location photography and great music. It must have been very expensive to make, and no "Predator" flick since has come close in terms of production quality and tension and thrills -- no matter how much any of the many sequels cost to make. Special mention should be made of the actor, now deceased, who played the Predator, Kevin Peter Hall (who also plays the chopper pilot). Done up in tons of makeup and loads of costuming, he nevertheless manages to give the creature real personality. One of director McTiernan's best films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Several reviews ago, I had written that the 80's was a good time to start introducing high-profile action films. Well, here's another example of an action classic that almost everyone has seen. This is a true classic starring the 80's favorite, Arnold Schwarzenegger. This movie also introduced another alien character who movies are still being made about today(AVP, Predators) This is about a group of elite macho men who are assigned to go to Central America and rescue some people from guerrillas. But they encounter something much a worse, a killer from another world.The Predator is made well. He looks scary especially his hair. The visual effects are good compared to other movies from the time period. I think this is a good, modern action film. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the very best Predator has ever looked. Some fan-boys/geeks what have you are criticizing the release calling it too polished, too cleaned up etc. I didn't see any of that. This is a much superior version of Predator over anything I have ever seen so far, including the Theatrical release. I had Predator in VHS, DVD at least twice and now Blu-ray twice. This is even far superior to the previous Blu-ray release that was essentially bare-bones with the exception of some HD Trailers. This has loads of extras that you can get lost in for hours (when you include commentaries as well). This is all without including how great fun the movie is. When I think of Arnold Schwarzenneger at his best I think of the period from the first Terminator, Predator and T2. Predator is underrated if anything. One of the best movies of all-time and people forget it was essentially a low-budget film.To read my review of Predator Ultimate Hunter Edition Blu-ray - www.movie-vault.com/reviews/predator-ultimate-hunter-edition-bluray/ and type in the title or joecooler2u and you can find the movie listed on my name (which you can click when you see a review by me) there as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A team of commandos find themselves hunted by an extra-terrestrial hunter?John McTiernan directs the perfect cast including the likes of Carl Weathers, Bill Duke and Jesse Ventura who are just right in this action orientated alien film. Arnold Schwarzenegger is armed with some great one liners but packs in a good performance with some subtler moments.Apart from The Thing like shot at the very beginning, it's and original piece that deservingly started a franchise. . To be picky only some of the editing and effects let the film down. Those aside, the music by Alan Silvestri is fitting with it jungle beats building up apprehension and suspense throughout the film. This film could have easy fallen into B movie territory, but the great Cinematography, creature effects and costume design keep it grounded. The film builds up in true monster fashion by holding back the Predator's reveal. Not since Alien has there been such hand iconic creature which Kevin Peter Hall wonderfully brings to life. John McTiernan notches up the tension in the final showdown and writers Jim Thomas &amp; John Thomas give us a brave bold ending.One of the most enjoyable rounded sci-fi films ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Action films rarely are more than just explosions, violence, and incredible stunts. This isn't necessarily a bad thing if you enjoy that sort of movie, which I do. Don't get me wrong I also enjoy films that challenge us and change the way we see things, but sometimes it's nice to just kick back and enjoy the ride. Though certainly not the first if it's kind, 'First Blood' really set the standard for many Action films in the 1980s, a lot of which are nothing more than rip-offs. In 1987 came a film that would cross two genres, something that's not always successful. In this case it was Action and Science Fiction, but fortunately things worked out and we got one of the better examples of the genre.Pros: Great performances, and unlike in most films like this the characters aren't interchangeable. Good score. Lost of beautiful, lush jungle scenery. Moves at a roller-coaster pace. Great sense of humor. Every type of effect on display is excellent. Lots of great action-packed sequences. The titular creature is a memorable one and is excellently designed.Cons: Wafer thin plot. Aside from the Predator itself there's really nothing here you can't find in a lot of other movies. Goes on a bit longer than it needed to.Final thoughts: After two disappointing 'Alien vs. Predator' films it's nice to go back and experience the originals all over again. Not that 'Predator' is equal to either of the first two 'Alien' films, but it's a solid film in it's own right and is deserved of it's status as a great Action/Sci-Fi flick. It's purpose was to excite and blow us away and it does just that.My rating: 4/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>predator is something about a group a elite special forces soldiers who went into the tropical rain forest to execute a mission secretly. Before them there had been another team who went missing. Now its up to them to carry out the task and also to sought out the mystery about their counterparts. Although they successfully destroyed and eliminated a guerrilla gang but they don't know than now they are about to face a far worst nightmare. Their new enemy is silent , invisible , invincible. Nothing like it has ever been seen on earth before. It hunts for sport kills for passion.they cant see it but it can see the heat of their body. the hunt has began. but this time it also has chosen the wrong man to hunt. Now the team is led by Arnold Schwarzenegger that includes Carl weathers of Rocky, Jesse Ventura and Sony landham. First they don't understand what they are facing when some of them are hunted in very bizarre and mysterious manner while the killer is extremely elusive. Than somehow Arnold managed to get away with some one other, he understood the tactics and strategy of their pursuer. The reason was when the creature saw them first he started to thoroughly examine them with hi-tech devices. After witnessing them crushing the mercenary's there he is really impressed by their valor and is after them because killing them will be like becoming the best warrior with honor as a ritual. He is an extra terrestrial life organism that s why its difficult to be traced. This movie first scared the hell out of me but later some few years its one of my best sci fi favorites and the creature is the best. It had little bright side it never wanted to slain some one helpless innocent and defenseless unlike human beings. Arnold was really good and at best in this movie. Nicely executed sci fi adventure, which led to alien vs predator saga.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great action/sf title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great action/sf film, undoubtedly one of Arnold best, along with Terminator and Therminator 2.The story, not very complicated but very intense, takes place in a central American jungle, the perfect surrounding, for a man slaughter. I liked the fact that it wasn't all non-top action, the first half of the film, was observative and miseryous. The scenes were violent but nonetheless enjoyable, at least for me, i didn't feel disgusted in any way. Another aspect which i've appreciated is that the characters worked as a team, they all analyzed the situation and came to the same conclusion, that they were facing the ultimate killer, and the only way to kill it was to work together, as a team - not your usual sf/action experience.As i already said the atmosphere of this title was very special, very negative, it inspired death, and that was of particular interest for me, cause I prefer fear inducing atmosphere rather than blood and gore, when it comes my perfect horror/sf/action experience.As far as Arnold performance was concerned, he genuinely, succeeded in showing what I never thought possible, especially from an actor well-known for his roles as a natural hero : fear, or better said panic.All in all it was a great film to watch, I liked it in almost every aspect, because it was frightening without lacking intelligence and creativity. And that is quite an outstanding accomplishment. I rate it **** out of ****** (8/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Violent and Fantastic 80s Sci-Fi Action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Predator" of 1987 is probably one of the most famous Sci-Fi/Action flicks of the 80s, and my choice for Arnold Schwarzenegger's second-greatest film after the 1984 masterpiece "Terminator" (with "Conan The Barbarian" and "Total Recall" on close third and fourth places). "Predator" follows a quite simplistic plot, and, in this case, this is a good thing, as the story is executed in an ingenious manner. Directed by action-expert John McTiernan, who is probably best known for "Die Hard", "Predator" is an incredibly entertaining and highly suspenseful blend of typical 80s-Action and gory Sci-Fi Horror which doesn't cease to be exciting for even a second.A group of commandos led by Major Alan 'Dutch' Schaefer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) are sent on a rescue-mission to the jungle of Guatemala, where a minister is supposed to be held hostage by Guerillas. After discovering the skinned corpses of another special task force, the elite soldiers find themselves hunted down by an unknown and invisible fiend..."Predator" is an action film that succeeds in all regards. The film is fantastically shot in a great, menacing jungle setting. The effects and action sequences are made with perfection, and the violence is very gory, probably the goriest in any Schwarzenegger film. This is not the kind of film that calls for brilliant character performances, and Schwarzenegger fits perfectly in his role as do the other members of the cast. The commandos include Schwarzenegger's fellow actor-turned-governor Jesse Ventura as well as the always-imposing Bill Duke and Carl Weathers (who is best known for the role of Apollo Creed in Rocky). The ravishing Epilarda Carillo is very beautiful in the sole female role; she doesn't have a lot to say though. Without giving away too much, I can say that the highly memorable eponymous villain is truly menacing. Basically, "Predator" delivers everything one can hope for in a good-action flick: great cinematography, great action, great suspense, very gory violence, and, simply put, 100 minutes of pure testosterone-driven entertainment that is stunning and intense from the beginning to the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Thomas Brothers has done a good job to create another breed of Alien species to compete with the original "Alien" designs created by H.G Giger,it was obvious that when the Predator emerged that these two species had to be put in a Film (Aliens Vs Predator) due to all the debates about who were the more superior species.I think this is were Aliens vs Predator failed i thought they went off the original seven foot something muscular Predator from this film, and replacing them with 'Teenage' short stumpy Predators.i thought by making them small in AvP it took away there agresiveness in a way.Mctiernian has equally done a good job to put these well designed creatures into a great movie,he employed a good recognisable cast of actors too, including Arnold Schwarzenegger.The is a good storyline as well,A team of commandos led by Major Dutch Schaeffer (Schwarzenegger)is sent behind enemy lines secretly by the C.I.A to rescue a group of soldiers who are being held hostage.Unfortunately for 'Dutch' and his team of commandos they get more than they have bargained for.It is time for the Predators Annual hunt and they've picked the exact spot where 'Dutch' and his troops operation is taking place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*some spoilers*I saw Predator for the first time back in the late 80s. And I must say that it scared me half to death. It was so effective and, at that time, unique that I could hardly believe my eyes. Hold in mind that I was about 14 at the time but still, the memory lingers on. Since then the film has been shown over and over again on tv so I really cant judge whether it has aged well or not. You really cant be scared when you know whats coming.I suppose that like with everything else there has come so many other films copying the style of the Predator so that anyone seeing this for the first time might not be as impressed as I was some 15 years ago.And just a comment for the guy who thought the scene where one of the marines chooses to meet the predator with his knife, instead of using the very weapons that have been totally inadequate during their previous encounters. I dont claim to be an expert but it seems to me that the guy knows he is going to die a horrible death. So he challenges the Predator to meet him "mano a mano". To go out like a man so to speak. This is a macho film so it sounds reasonable to me. Or maybe he just lost his mind? Who knows, its still pretty good stuff.Sure its trash, made on a low budget and so forth. But still, its pretty good trash.</fullReview>

Plus, it's good to know that if Predators landed in Cal-ee-foh-neea that Arnold could deal with them. Think of Arnold as the Kindergarten Cop in the classroom fighting off the Predator. Classic. But I'm getting of topic. A great movie, and the DVD looks good. Plus, it offers a free movie ticket to see Alien Vs. Predator. I hope the Predator kicks the Alien's arse! VIVA PREDATOR! Too bad Predator was followed by such a dumb sequel. If Arnold had been in it, it would have been better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like the movie so much. However, a question concerning the overall logic of the movie has always haunted me: How come predators build intergalactic space crafts when they can't see things in detail as humans do? (they sense beings only through the heat they emit). The predator can't recognize Arnold covered in mud and perceives him as a part of the scenery in the runaway scene. Eventually, how can they build microchips and all the tiny technological stuff when they are literally "half blind"? They travel through the universe at light speed, they reach the earth from a galaxy that is perhaps unidentified by earthlings and they do all these things using super technology space crafts but they can only sense the heat emissions?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well blow me! In my opinion, this will go down as one of Arnie's best films, along with Terminator 1 and 2. What i love about this film is the fact that this Elite Commando Team, which can take out a whole South American Guerilla camp in 2.67 minutes, is in the middle of this huge Jungle, which must span for hundreds of miles, and the feeling of claustrophobia grows ever more, after each member is hunted down by this invisible, stealthy, incredible fast and strong warrior. I think that must be the scariest feeling I can think of. To know that something is out there, waiting for you, and you don't know when it is going to strike, even when it is standing right next to you! It sends shivers down my spine (wey hey, a cliche!). I mean, come on, YES, it's cheesy, but that's what makes it fun! Corny one liners, Testosterone levels spiralling out of control, explosions, it has the complete makings of an Eighties film, just without the bad Hawaiian flowery shirts, and the mullets! ok, maybe a couple of mullets! Jesse Ventura springs to mind! But that's what makes this film just FANTASSSSTIC!! It's great fun! 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is one of my favorite guilty pleasures. A bunch of steroidal pro- wrestlers...I mean, a small group of special forces soldiers (and one pro- wrestler) are sent into the humid depths of the South American jungle on a top secret mission. A bunch of cool explosions and one pretty prisoner later, the mission is accomplished...but the movie has just begun. Something is stalking the unit through the green hell of the steamy jungle, something not human.Predator doesn't waste time with character development, or even much in the way of plot. It's basically a chase film, but that's fine. I don't always want a brainy, intellectual film...sometimes I want cinematic junk food, and this film fits the bill perfectly. The self-camouflaging, tarantula-faced, green-dredlocked monster is really very cool, standing well over 7 feet tall and blasting the crap out of the overly confident and testosterone drenched soldiers with some pretty spiffy weapons. Even Arnie gets the crap kicked out of him... a guilty pleasure in itself, considering the fact that I live in California and paid full ticket price to watch the crap-fest that was "True Lies." Seriously though, this isn't a GREAT film, but it's good fun, a sort-of bare bones "Alien." If you like nasty, scary monsters and sweaty soldiers getting slaughtered, have a few beers and watch "Predator." You won't regret it in the morning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I own the DVD of this movie and watch it on a regular basis. It is one of the best "sci-fi/horror" movies I have seen. The hunter that is know as the Predator is one of the scariest beast on film. It is a true classic. And the storyline behind each of the characters is deep enough to be convincing. It has only a few slow scenes which is basically "plot building". Aside from that the movie keeps you in suspense till the end. The only lacking part is the special effects, but considering the time frame in which the movie was made, and the budget, it actually is quite good. In my opinion Predator is a movie that you should show your wimpy girlfriend so that she will be scared half out of her mind and come to you for comfort. This movie is a definitely a thrill ride and you should go out right now and buy it.</fullReview>

What amazes me about these movies(Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, The Terminator, The Abyss) is the fact that the SFX still look so real compared by today's standards. If anything, SFX nowadays don't look real and take away from the realism factor which is what draws an audience to a movie The best part has to be the nearly 20 min finale scene with hardly any dialogue, but just man Vs. predator. The music, the stalking, the concept, the action(Mac with the big-ass gun), the cinematography, the director(what was he doing making Rollerball?!!) are all top-notch.

He's got chameleonic/invisibility technology long before the Jem'Hadar in Star Trek Deep Space Nine. And he steals an entire film from Arnold Schwarzenegger. The sequel is also good, by the way, but doesn't quite come up to the class of the original.

		<fullReview>I hadn't seen 'Predator' for a very long time, and as the new movie 'Alien Vs. Predator' draws closer, I thought I'd revive my experience of this movie. And boy was I amazed at how much I better it was this time around. I understood the dialogue more and the little details kept me interested.The characters were all unique and enjoyable to watch. Blain, played by one Jesse Ventura, was my favourite of all the team, followed closely by Mac. As the story goes on the characters develop their own personalities, you start to care about them and, from personal experience, as they start dying one by one, you feel sorrowfulness.One particular scene plucked as heart-string: when Mac stares at his fallen comrade Blain, he takes a swig of his hip-flask and places it on Blain's neck. The score that accompanied it brought a tear to my eye. `Goodbye, bro.' uttered the mournful Mac.The Predator itself looks awesome and totally original. The idea to have the enemy invisible until the end was a stroke of genius because it makes you wonder what sort of adversary Dutch and his men are up against. This Predator is the perfect foe against the Aliens.****/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although in many ways your typical 1980's blow-em-up movie, I found the storyline to be refreshingly different. It starts out as a movie about an "elite" team of macho mercenaries on a covert rescue mission in South America (typical crap), but then weird things take place and pretty soon the hunter becomes the hunted. If I hadn't already been aware of the story when I first watched it, the plot twist would have taken me by surprise.

		<fullReview>Basically an action version of "Friday the 13th". You have your leafy-green surroundings, brains splattered on the camera lens, arms detached from bodies, and chests opened up (this got pretty good reviews in its time, which always amuses me: critics beat up horror films, but when it's presented in another format, it's a good movie. Whatever). For an "action" film, most of the bullets are wasted on trees and plants of the jungle! Doesn't mean it's a bad film. Scwarz and several other buff dudes venture into the jungle to find some baddies, only to discover some sort of wacko alien has shown up to disembowl people. The rest of the film---again in Friday the 13th fashion---consists of the soldiers being stalked and blown apart. When only Arnold is left, the film slows down a little too much for its finale. Scwarzeneggar pretty much takes the place of the final female in a horror film to do battle with the sicko killer. Unfortunately this wraps up disappointingly---with a suicide! But along the way are some good scares and effects, so it should provide enough for action-adventure....and horror fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Predator, and it's (okay) sequal, are the most original idea's I've ever seen in my life. The movie's cast is wonderful, and so is the score, action, special effects, location, and most importantly, monster. (MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS) An american military force is called down to the central american jungle to free allies from guerilla terrorists. After the mission is done, they suddenly relise that they are not alone. Another hunter is present around them, and won't stop till they are dead. With an array of new technological, yet primitive weapons, it hunts them all untill Schwarzeneggars character (Dutch) is the only one left. Dutch uses his skill and cunning to defeat the 'Predator', instead of his military weapons.One of the most memorable parts for me is at the very end where Dutch traps the Predator, and is about to spare his life out of pity. (at least it's what I observed). He says "What the hell are you?" and the Predator says in his own wounded voice "What the hell are YOU?" And he presses a few buttons...and begins to laugh. As Dutch relises it's a trap, he begins to run. As he runs the Predator's alien laugh begins to sound more human untill he sets off his trap, which was a seemingly small nuclear explosion. (SPOILERS END) I give this movie 10/10. By far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Laugh now, but this movie has the distinction as being the only one to feature two future U.S. Governors as actors. First, Jesse Ventura in Minnesota, now Arnold Scharzenegger in California. If Elpidia Carrillo wasn't born in Mexico, she could be the first woman president of the USA! Anyway, the original "Predator" is a pretty standard film for Schwarzenegger and McTiernan. A lot of stuff gets blow'd up real good, and and there is plenty of carnage. Better than "Collateral Damage" or "The 13th Warrior", but not nearly as good as "The Terminator" or "Die Hard". Fans won't be disappointed, all others should look for ironic humor in its over-the-top violence or stay away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You might be thinking, why did this guy give Predator a 10? Because most people never would! You can not compare this movie to other "great" films like Amadeus, Schindler's List, Titanic, etc because it's in the action department. For a sci-fi/action movie, it is tops and of course, it is full of memorable lines like "Stick around" , "I ain't got time to bleed!" , "You are one ugly mutta ------ !" or my favorite "Get to the chop-pah!"One of my favorite blow-it-all-to-hell scenes, is when Mac (Bill Duke) fires the entire pack of the mini-gun and the rest of the gang just unloads just about everything they've got at the alien and end up leveling a good portion of the jungle.This movie is full of intense action, a little of horror and some sci-fi as well. Too bad the sequel wasn't as good (where's Arnold?) but this movie is a must-have if you like Schwarzenegger and or action movie fan!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw Predator when i was about 12 or 13. It appealed alot more to me then, Most of Arnold's action movies are the same old thing, lots of action and little storyline. But don't get the wrong idea, i still enjoy Predator and i have the DVD amongst my collection, it's just not one i watch that much because all it has to offer is the thrill of the action. If you like action movies you would love Predator because it's high on action but if you like good storylines to keep your interest, give it a miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most original films ever made, the idea of the invisible camouflage that the Predator uses is unique and well done. Good special effects for a movie from the 80s.**##SPOILER AHEAD!##** Along with The Terminator, this is Arnolds best action movie. He portrays Dutch, a leader of a special rescue team. John McTiernan actually succeeds at making the forest a really claustrophobic place, increasing the sensation of suspense and fear. As the victims go one by one, the feeling of "death around the corner" increases more and more. Best line in this movie: "If it bleeds... we can kill it!" Sincerely I was expecting more from the ending, but overall a good movie. The best character in the movie IS the Predator. Some gory images in this one, specially that scene where the Predator takes the skull from a soldier. **##END OF SPOILER##**Good Sci-fi movie, deserves a 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monster movie of the millenium</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Predator. Possibly the greatest monster movie ever made. I'll explain why. Having just wrote a mini dissertation on the film, i think i stand in good terms to give my opinion on this film. First of all, the plot to the film is quite complex. Dutch and his band of commando's are brought to a military base somewhere in south America, where they are given orders to rescue a team of cabinet ministers who have been captured in foreign territory. This is in fact a ruse, as Dillon, Dutch's former team member who now works for the CIA, actually wants Dutch and his team to go in and destroy a guerilla terrorist camp who have vital government information. Dutch, unaware of the hidden agenda accepts and the team, including Dillon are whisked of to the drop site (somewhere in south America). So, the film starts off with the genre of Action Adventure film. This quickly changes however with the introduction of the predator. It has no physical presence in the film at first, it just takes the role of observer. John McTiernan (director) created a stroke of genius when he let us see through the predator's eyes. This is where the genre of horror is added to the film as the monster stalks them from the trees.As the film progresses Dutch becomes less trusting of Dillon as situations arise that don't fit Dillons story. Eventually, they reach the guerilla camp and so ensues a great action war sequence. The commandoes take over the base and Dutch quickly realizes that he and his team been set up by his own government. he challenges Dillon about it who admits that they had been set up, but says that they were the only people who get the job done. The scene between Dutch and Dillon is quite intense and this adds to the tension of the movie. They decide that its time to leave and begin their march to the pick up site. This is where the Predator makes a full introduction into the movie as one by one he picks off the members of the team. It's classic horror as each time the creature takes out a member, he reveals himself a little more. Each death scene becomes more elaborate as the film progresses. The remaining members of ther team try to mount a fightback, but to no avail. The monster kills of the last members of the team, predictably leaving a showdown between itself and Dutch. This is a great section of the film as the predator is finally revealed in all its glory. Dutch realises on escaping the monster that he can camouflage himself using mud and this sets up a interesting finale. They battle for a while using weapons until it eventually comes down to Man against monster. The scene where the Predator takes off the mask is one of the best in movie history. Stan Winston did a great job on designing the monster and it shows in the final scenes. The death of the Predator results in a mini-nuclear explosion which is a little unrealistic (as is Blain's ability to hold a mini-gun and all the ammo needed to fire it). At the end Dutch emerges from the jungle as the only survivor and is picked up by a military helicopter. The end to a great film. The film works because of it's multi-genre definition. It's a Action, adventure, sci-fi, horror, thriller, war movie with elements of western genre mixed in as well. its narrative structure is extemely complex. trying to apply Propp, Toderov and Branigan to it is difficult but do-able. The film is excellently directed, masterfully shot, with great detail given to camera angles, point of view shots and special effects. The Predators camouflaged effects are magnificent and add greatly to the mystery surrounding the creature. The cast all act very well and gell cohesivley. Schwarzenegger is surprisingly believeable as Dutch and this doesnt feel like just another Arnie flick. All in all its a great monster movie and easily competes with the likes of Alien. In my opinion it's a better film than Alien. It takes place on earth, so the threat seems more real. I could go on for ever about this film, but instead, I'll leave it there and wait for someone to reply with their view. Chris Tunstall (aka trickflipper)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**** out of ****Despite boasting a very simple story and a cast that isn't exactly high-caliber, Predator remains one of the most effective thrillers ever made. The film is a mixture of sci-fi, horror, and action, but it's execution isn't too different from a slaher. You've got your small group of characters trapped in a desolate environment with some unknown terror in the jungle killing them off one-by-one.Arnold Schwarzennegger plays Dutch, head of a first-rate commando team that's been sent to the Central American jungles for a rescue mission. When the assignment is over, that's when the horror begins, with the alien (aka "The Predator") hunting down Dutch's team in frighteningly quick and gruesome manners. Finally, the survivors decide to stand their ground, determined prove the winners in this deadly game of cat-and-mouse.Though most people bill Predator as a Schwarzennegger testosterone fest, I've always viewed the film equally as a wonderful example of the horror genre. This is easiliy one of the most viscerally terrifying films I've seen, with shocks that don't come cheap and bursts of violence that truly startle. At the center of it all is the Predator, a ruthless creature whose simple motives prove more frightening than all else. It's out to hunt these soldiers, and it won't stop until they're all dead.Predator's action is relentless and thrilling, though an early shootout with Central American rebels is a bit on the outlandish side. But all the scenes afterward with the Predator, they're about as heart-pounding as action sequences get. (moderate spoiler here) The film eventually boils down to a face-off between Schwarzennegger and the Predator, which leaves the alien unmasked, with what is a truly creepy as hell face. The final half-hour is a series of well-executed showdowns between the two, with cleverly set traps and plans (end spoiler).Predator doesn't have a great cast, but no one else could have fit these roles. Schwarzennegger is Schwarzennegger, meaning he's likeable and has got a few snicker-inducing one-liners. Everyone else also gets to act real macho (and eventually, act real terrified, which Carl Weathers actually does a pretty damn good job at). This is not a sophisticated bunch, but they're loveable tough guys who are easy to root for. The only female in the cast is Elpidia Carrillo as a (pretty cute) rebel chick, whose only purpose is to give some audience members a relief from all this testosterone.The plot and its execution is simple, but undeniably effective. While I was never in question of the Predator's motivations, I was curious as to how long it'd been on Earth and if it even had the means to leave the planet if it wanted to. Such questions were sort of answered by the sequel, which I remember thinking it lacked most of this film's charms despite a ton of bloodletting and boasting the same awesome score from Alan Silvestri. Magic can't always strike twice, which is why Predator should be cherished as a one-of-a-kind thrill ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'You know bro' whoever did this to you is gonna' comeback, and when he does I'm gonna' cut yo' name into him. I'm gonna' cut yo' name into him.'If you find yourself struggling to find a good sci-fi action pick this weekend on your weekly trip to Dave's Video or wherever the hell it is you rent your movies from, allow me to make a suggestion. Why don't you try renting an Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1987 classic, Predator. I mean you cannot go wrong with that.This is a movie I watch maybe once or twice a year. It has a few signature '80s action movie touches. There are the one-liners, all pretty good and every body seems to shoot from the hip. Also there seems to be a lot posing oil handy, which is a good thing I suppose as our team of skilled commandos just can't seem to keep their shirts on. Director John McTiernan wanted us to know, to have absolutely no doubt, that our heroes were absolutely, 100% badass. Well trust you me, we get the bloody picture. The films '80isms are not excessive though, and on the whole a little bit charming.Predator is a sci-fi flick that starts out as if it were going to be nothing more than a standard action film. (I must admit there is a neat little scene in the beginning that lets you know that it won't be) It begins with the arrival of a crack rescue team at a tropical U.S. military installation in dark bodied Hueys. The team is lead by a man we will know only as Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenenegger). The arrival of the rescue team is truly great film-making. The scene essentially establishes the intrinsic toughness of our heroes and their cohesiveness as a team of shooters. They arrive on the island and man they walk like the own it. They don't talk. They move like a highly coordinated unit, speech is unnecessary for men such as these, they know what they are supposed to do, they almost know each others thoughts. These guys have been together for years. And we the viewer understand all of this from just few quite scenes and remarkably good acting. It's all in the blocking of the shots and the carriage of the actors and it is all perfect.The teams mission: save three U.S. diplomats whose chopper has been shot down. Dutch thinks to ask why this Cabinet Minister's chopper was traveling on the wrong side of the border. 'They got off course.' Says Gen Phillips. The diplomats also seem to be carrying information mighty sensitive to the CIA, because Dutch and his team are going 'in country' under the authority of a guy named Dillon (Carl Weathers). He is an old friend of Dutch's but our hero is a bit uneasy about having his authority pulled out from under him. Dutch even delivers the most famous of 80's action hero lines, well a variation of it anyway. The line typically goes something like this, 'I always work alone.' In Predator the line is, 'My team works alone.'This is all standard action movie stuff. Well done to be sure but still material we have all seen before. What is great about this stuff though is how well done it is. The movie was filmed some where in South America, and it looks like they are moving through a real jungle. This is jungle with a capital J. They are not on a soundstage and that adds a lot to the movie. It is also during this material that we see that there may be more in store for them than just guerrillas. I won't say what they find, but it is unsettling. The other thing that is established during this material is the way the team is really one unit. Everyone is important. During the rescue operation for instance, while we see them dismantling their opposition the camera doesn't just follow Arnold around, but it kind of keeps a running tab on all members of the team. My only real problem with these scenes is the way everyone is always shooting from their hips all the time. I mean it is okay for Blain (Jesse Ventura) he is carrying a big gatling gun, but everyone else? Come on! Just a minor complaint.The rescue doesn't go as planned, and instead of affecting the rescue (the 'diplomats' are dead), they pick up a prisoner, Anna (Elpidia Carrillo), and have to hike twelve miles to their extraction point. It is at this point that things begin to go terribly wrong for our heroes. The team's skill at killing has attracted the attention of different kind of hunter. And one by one he begins to pick them off, until finally there is just the Predator, and Dutch. Moreover it is a Dutch with out many of his modern weapons. He has his knife, a couple of rounds from is grenade launcher, but no launcher, and his wits. This is classic stuff.The showdown between the Predator and Dutch is quite a pay off. It is a tense game of cat and mouse, with the roles of hunter and hunted changing more than once. Predator is maybe not a great action-sci-fi movie, but it certainly is one of the most fun. Rent it and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that made the word 'Predator' infamous.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Mctierman and company have laid claim to the word 'Predator'. They have created the ultimate hunter/killer roaming the universe looking for worthy prey and this time it's Arnold (Dutch), and his able military team. This movie is fast paced enough to please action fans but also skillfully creates suspense by keeping their stalker in the shadows so that the predator feels ever present and is just cautiously eyeing and selecting it's prey. Bit by bit it is revealed to us until it's full horror is unleashed in the climatic scene.The casting of this movie is near perfection, except for Shane Black who was offered a bit part when he was not needed for screenwriting duties. Arnold is the ultimate screen superhero. He is seemingly invincible and his overbearing confidence makes his casting as a leader natural. His muscles, thick austrian accent and powerful name have helped him permanently claim roles as his own - Conan, the Terminator and of course this one. Without Arnold in the sequel, it was always going to pale in comparison. For the screen superhero it was obligatory to have an adversary from outer space. Only in this way was Arnold going to have to use all that he had to overcome the invader. This is the match - up that moviegoers will want to see - the world's superhero trying to save us from a threat from outer space. Although this sounds reminiscent of the 40's and 50's when Hollywood capitalized on people's fears of a threat from outer space, this movie far transcends those B grade movies.His crack unit is composed of some of the most outlandish characters the action genre has to offer. There is Jesse Ventura, the loud and attention seeking ex - professional wrestler. His gun says it all - everything is over the top with him. Sonny Landham is the indian with a sixth sense. It is this contribution that adds to the movie's suspense - he senses the Predator and quickly comes to realize that the team is up against something stronger than them. This unnerves the others since Billy is always the calmest and is able to access the enemy and give his team the advantage. Then there is of course the seasoned screen professional, Carl Weathers. He is always in top physical condition and this along with his smoothness, is ideal for his role as the ex - ops boy who becomes a collar and tie agent - a job that requires different values and he now uses the men he used slog in the trenches with. This grouping together of such strong personalities must have created a very competitive atmosphere which would have translated into better performances. Notwithstanding this fact John Mctierman must have had a big balancing act on his hands.Arnold's contribution to the movie was not just that of the leading character, he also recommended Stan Winston after the first Predator creation was curtly rejected by John Mctierman. His creation embodies all one could imagine that the alien predator could have. It has missiles, spears, blades as talons, camouflage, infra - red eyesight and can deftly move within any environment. Of particular note is how the predator looks. It is the personification of our nightmares. Our fears tend to exaggerate our monsters and they are endowed with unnaturally long claws, glaring evil eyes, excessive mandibles ending with unusually long teeth and they are of immense size and strength. This is spawned by Stan in his alien predator creation. Undoubtably he is the man best able to create these monsters that haunt us at night.Although there are scenes that remind you of the 70's slasher flicks, it is never done for the sake of it. These scenes show us how deadly the predator is and how it can swiftly attack and disappear without trace. The fact that highly trained team members are being killed in this way makes the rest feel vulnerable to the point of cracking. Unlike these slasher films the acting is better, no - one is helpless and these scenes fit into the story and are not the excuse for it.The climatic encounter is fantastic. Dutch uses all his capabilities to overcome the predator, but when facing his end the predator sizes him up as an opponent worthy enough to face unarmed. It had found a prey that by facing in unarmed, pure combat, it would prove itself as the true warrior. It's drive to be the ultimate warrior is it's undoing since it affords Dutch the opportunity to lead it to a trap.Also worthy of mention is the powerful military soundtrack thus setting the tone for a meeting of two great forces where one will stand and one will fall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An utterly unique and superb film on many levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In most of the commentaries given on this film people have cited many of the aspects of Predator that make it one of the best action/horror films ever made. SPOILER!! The aspect of the film i like the best is that it is almost two films with two distinct plots and themes that blend almost seamlessly into one another. In the beginning there are these well armed, well trained commandoes on a cut and dry mission to rescue hostages taken by a guerilla force. They go in, find the hostages dead, eliminate their captors and complete their mission. They are then in a rush against time to evade more guerillas who are hot on their trail. Now, it becomes a different movie, and the Predator aspect of it comes into play. The commandoes are killed one by one in a way that is unpredictable and wonderfully directed. Then it's down to Dutch, Billy, a severely wounded Poncho, and Anna. You think they might just make it to the chopper when in several quick scenes everyone is dead but Dutch and Anna. Anna goes to the chopper and the film evolves again into something wonderfully unique. Dutch vs. the Alien. He has none of his weapons but a knife and his cunning and the Predator is still running at full force. He makes some weapons and metamorphoses into a primal warrior, creating a bow and some primitive explosives from leftover launchable grenades. He sets off to stalk the stalker and it begins with that incredibly memorable war-cry of Arnold's and his rippling, mud covered body holds that massive torch in the air and issues that chilling war cry, inviting the alien to battle. Using not much more than his cunning and his natural surroundings, he traps and kills the physically and technologically more advanced Predator. What a wonderful progression and evolution in one perfect, neat film that certainly shouldn't have been ruined by a sequel. This movie is an A+</fullReview>

For those of you who aren't aware of the Slasher Formula, it usually looks like thisUnstopable Killer + Pointless Gore + Body Count = Slasher MovieNow I'm not pointing at any bad slashers...(Jason, Freddy, Michael...) Its just that too many movies spawn 7-8 sequels that just don't have what it takes to make a good movie.This one is by far one of the best Slasherlike movies. The main storyline is you're basic Elite Force team led by Dutch Shaefer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) under the supervision of Dillon (Carl Weathers) is sent into South America to investigate the loss of american soldiers. Once they get to the Enemy's base, the remaining survivors are gunned down. The Elite Force then disposes of the enemy and starts heading back to a rendez-vous point, to meet with the chopper. Its on the way home that an Alien Humanoid Hunter fights the worthy Elite Force, Killing them 1 by 1.The Visual Effects are very well crafted, the Predator Creature itself is stunning, and well done by Stan Winston's Wizardry (Stan worked on The Terminator [1984] and Aliens [1986] before Predator)John McTiernan whom we all know from Die Hard is definetly a winner at this stunningly well realised above-average picture.</fullReview>

Eh? How cool is that. How often is an audience duped in an action movie? I really am pushed to fault this movie - the score is perfect, cast, drama, lighting, location sfx, humour etc etc, all excellent. First use of handheld minigun to my knowledge, Bill Duke, Arnie acts! Jesse ventura on a combat mission in MTV tee shirt, alien with a culture and so on.

		<fullReview>There are these films between which I always seem to feel a connection. I mean Alien and Predator... First was the alien. Then was the predator. And I guess we'll soon see the alien versus the predator. I have to laugh when I think of a movie with the aliens hissing and the predators growling at one another.Predator is a good action movie. That is a fact which can hardly be negated. You could then ask how far this "greatness" goes. I'll want to write that as a conclusion at the end. The predator is quite an interesting creature. Ferocious, strong and smart...but the smartness of the predator is not to be compared with the smartness of the aliens. They are much more amazing. What impressed me most was how the predator looked: so real...I must say it was one of the best scenes in the movie. SPOILERThe story is quite superficial, but the action covers the gaps of the story. One of the great scenes, from my point of view, is the scene where they start shooting after the predator...and they shoot down a huge part of the jungle. It looks mad! Probably is. Which I consider though the best scene...the end battle I would say. The situation changes then. The hunter does actually become the hunted. Schwarzenegger versus the mighty beast. We get to see fighting techniques and tactics, which by themselves can steal the show away.At first, the whole fight is a huge unknown for the humans. But as the action develops, the humans learn its qualities, but also its weak points. With these Schwarzenegger actually defeats the monster which is much stronger than him. With brains, not only with brute force. Very good...something different.It's not worth talking about the actors or anything, as I personally don't put much importance on acting in an action movie. I guess I could try to compare it to "Aliens". The difference between the two movies remains though as huge as the distance from earth to the moon. "Aliens" is action, but with plot and with horror. The actors go along smoothly and the movie lets you enjoy real action and shooting. "Predator" though, doesn't succeed in as many ways as "Aliens" did. It's only action, not as interesting as in the other movie, and it's in no way fear. I'd say Predator is what results out of the mixture of "Alien" and "Aliens". Only one creature(same as Alien), a lot of action though to kill it(Aliens) and knowledge remains more important than human life(Alien/Aliens).I'd say it's worth to see the movie. It's a good way to relax. As a mark, I'd say 7,5 maybe 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

Combined by special effects, the art work on the costume of the predator is amazing. Gory scenes are shown which should not be shown to younger viewers. Predator's sequel is terrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By far the best Arnie film, This film doesnt try to be a film that it isnt and this makes it good. Altough this is and always will be overshadowed by Alien and Aliens, this film is as entertaining, stands well on the test of time and will be remembered for a long time to come.***SPOLIERS****I watch this film everytime its on TV, Ok the plot is a little like Alien (sort of), A team of Mercenaries (and they are) are asked to rescue some hostages, and on route find a team of ex-commando's (who they knew), questions arise, what are they doing there and why have they no skin ?. Later in the film we find out the hostage scenario was a ploy and they're actually cleaning up the dead soldiers mission: killing the alien,(or have i got this all wrong?) Any one-by-one they are killed until arnie is left to battle the beast to the end.This is a good, entertaining film and should be enjoyed by all. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Alien" on Earth?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of commandos is sent into the South-American jungle on a rescue mission. Soon they find themselves picked off one by one by a sadistic alien creature.Putting the film in the context of the time, it is pretty obvious what it was trying to be: a fusion of Alien and Aliens, swapping out Sigourney Weaver and space for a dense jungle and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Subtlety then, was not viewed as an essential ingredient.Notwithstanding a stupid title and a "cast" consisting mainly of overambitious bodybuilders, this is a success in more ways than it had any right to be, and in hindsight we can credit one person: director John McTiernan. The man who later reinvented the action blockbuster with Die Hard made the best of a very surreal assignment, and turned it on its head.You might not expect Arnold to deliver more than a substandard effort going in. You'd be wrong: the Austrian Oak is at his most primal and, interestingly, in the last fourth of the film, at his most human and mortal. You might expect to have trouble believing any space critter could be a match for him. You'd be wrong again: the monster is one of the finest sci-fi antagonists ever created, a fascinating counterpart to Giger's Alien, and just as mysterious. It comes with an impressive bag of tricks, a malevolent intelligence, and a messed-up sense of humor.Time has been less kind to Predator than to Alien, by association with Schwarzenegger and because of certain stylistic choices. There may not be any neon lights or fog machines in sight, but this is almost as 80s as you can get, in all the right and wrong ways. The biceps and dialogue on display clearly hark back to a different era of cinema, one that, on strength of Predator's many pleasures - be they guilty or pure - you would be right to miss.If you can make yourself overlook these elements, this is the finest that decade's mad brand of action has to offer. Arnie's showdown with the creature is a triumph - one in which he for the first time shows real and justifiable fear - the deaths in the unit are grizzly and surprising, and a mini gun-assisted deforestation can, once seen, never be forgotten.Best enjoyed in a group.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A re-watchable action flick that doesn't try to be something it isn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're looking for a drama that makes an important social statement, just keep looking because you won't find it with 1987's Predator. What you will find, however is a winning combination of action, great characters, memorable quotes, guns, blood, and loads of testosterone. To this day, it remains Arnold Schwarzenegger's best action film outside of the Terminator movies.The great thing about Predator is how easy it is to re-watch. The pace is fast, and the acting is outstanding. Sure, there's plenty of "tough guys showing off" spots, but they don't detract from the enjoyment in the least.You can probably pick up the DVD version relatively cheap now, and I hope that a special edition version is in the works because I'd love to see how it was made and hear comments from the film's stars and director John McTiernan.</fullReview>

He may not be the worlds best actor, but he can entertain better than anyone, and especially in an action film of this calibre.

It's the journey, and the loss of men, one by one. The atmosphere is great, the choice of actors wonderful, and the one-liners fly about with reckless abandon?and you end up loving every one.

		<fullReview>For action, entertainment and suspense, PREDATOR is the way to go. It is a fun, enjoyable movie that is one of Schwarzenegger's finest. If the movie itself does not draw you, than the other 'star' will, the Predator itself. Cardboard characters were never treated as kindly as the way the title character does to them.A military rescue team get more than they bargained for after finding out their recent mission was more than meets the eye.The effects: excellent. The makeup: exceptional. The action: well worth the money. The movie is sharp, it plays a crazy idea with a sense of realism but yet a total comic book atmosphere. The Predator was a top-notch villain and everyone deserves praise for pulling off a blockbuster with quality written all over it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Real Tough-guy Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Predator" is an excellent film for science fiction fans and action fans. The story focuses on a team of commandos sent to South America on a rescue mission, but they find out that they're being unintentionally pitted against a more dangerous adversary than a group of guerillas.The movie opens with the commando team receiving their orders for the mission, then quickly changes location to their insertion in South America. As the group makes their way toward the guerilla camp, the camera occasionally changes view to an infra-red lens, hencing toward something else spying on them. As the crew completes their mission, the men begin to disappear one-by-one, and the remainder of the team slowly becomes aware of the presence of a "predator" of humans among them (pun intended).This movie moves really fast, and keeps a first-time viewer on the edge of his or her seat. The special effects and gore add to the quality of the movie; the story itself is not dependant on them. The shocks and jumps come in at appropriate times to keep a viewer's attention, and a member of the audience can really notice the relaxment of the end of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...and that is by no means a bad thing.'Predator', once seen as the cheap and cheerful bastard son of 'Aliens' and a like, is now picking up speed on its way to becoming regarded as something much more, and can now be mentioned in the same sentence as Jim Cameron's film without fear of the standard cine-(il?)literate snob mockery. Its about time.'Predator' is such a huge success for the same reasons as McTiernan's other 80's masterpiece (Hey! Deal with it), 'Die Hard'. Firstly, McTiernan (the most underrated Hollywood film maker by a country mile) knows how to crank up tension and suspense like nobody else. Secondly, the film is suitably ridiculous, and everyone involved is in on the joke. Thirdly, Schwarzenegger is easily at his most appealing here - attitude and pure charisma dripping from his every word and movement. Fourth, the editing is truly superb and fifth, the predator itself is an all time great movie monster. Oh, and the script isn't too shabby either, for what it is.And thats it. Besides PERFECTLY epitomising 1980's Hollywood product to an absolute tee, 'Predator' is nothing other than what it is supposed to be - a wonderfully entertaining Saturday night rollercoaster.The term "classic" has been used to describe far lesser works.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arnold is one of my favorite actors and this is one of his finest movies. If they only made more movies like this now a days instead of worrying about making James Bond rip offs with sexy people, just stick to action please! This movie doesn't have much action in it besides the part where the Americans kick the terrorist butts! There's some nice explosions and fighting there. After that they discover something is still in the jungle waiting for them and it's not human. They never tell you what this thing is or where it came from but it's oviously not of this world. It can change colors and become clear, not invisible so it can still be seen but very difficult to see. It's huge, ugly, can repair itself. It's pretty much like an alien hooked up with a machine able to shoot out laser beams and other weird stuff. But anyways this is a pretty cool movie plus it has Jessie the Body Ventura in it! he rocks too. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*small SPOILERS*Predator is about a group of commandos sent in to the South American rain forest looking for survivors of a downed US government plane. After landing, then are stalked and killed one-by-one by an invisible alien hunter.From the get-go, Predator borrows various elements from "futuristic commando" movies, the partnership between the soldier, the teamwork, and the unity they gain when they are hunted. However, about an hour into this film, it all soon revolves around Arnold. Now, I'm not saying that that's a bad thing; chances are that this movie would have been ignored had it not been for the muscle-bound hero. Back when this movie first came out, Arnold was the action hero, and nobody could top him. Not Van Damme, not Willis, nobody could match his wit and cool demeanor like he could. After the Predator kills his entire unit, Arnold must now fend for himself and outwit the alien hunter.If you're expecting a violent-fest like this movie portrays, then you'll be somewhat pleased, as you'll witness a guy getting his gut burst open with a pulse laser and another guy getting his spine and skull ripped out from the Predator. None of this detracts from the experience, as survival soon depends on the fittest. Predator features some of the most original things I've seen in a film yet, such as the whole "thermal vision" thing, which I feel is one of the creepiest weapons the Predator has. The invisible shield thing I too felt was a nice touch, but since you can always "see" the blur of the shield, it makes it somewhat noticeable (not so when the Predator is jumping through trees).Overall, a fine action movie with all the elements it needs to thrive on. This movie could have developed into a very profitable franchise like Alien and Die Hard did. But after one average and disappointing sequel, this series went down hard. A shame, since it showed so much potential.7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah. I ask the question to you people out there. I have asked myself that very same question many times, without coming up with any result yet. Apart from his role as machine in another well known movie, I really do believe that this IS this man's finest hour so far.This is the type of film that has the same effect as old wine. It becomes better as the time goes by. I have seen this film so many times, that I should probably have my name in the Guiness Book of Records. And I do believe I know almost all the words by heart.The suspense is just as high every time the hunter from another world is about to reveal himself for the first time. This is the type of enemy who has the best defense system you can have in combat. Being able to seem invisible to your enemies. It is totally amazing.The final battle between Dutch and the Predator in the end of the film is unforgettable. When this ugly lizard removes his helmet for the first time, Dutch's comment on his looks, and the struggle for survival to follow. Relentless to say, there are only one survivor, but I bet you already knew that, didn't you.Buy this movie as DVD - COLLECTORS EDITION. You will not regret it. Watch it over and over and over again, just as I use to do. If there is nothing else to do around the house, I load my DVD-player with PREDATOR, sit back in my chair, relax and watch one of the greatest actionpacked movies ever made.Enjoy!!!!!</fullReview>

The film takes place in the deep jungle of South America where a small elite team of heavily-armed American commandos sent on a mission to rescue hostages that are held by local rebels. What the team nor its' confident leader (Schwarznegger) recognize is that they're being sought after is a wily yet meancing creature from outer space instead of a sniper. The movie benefits not only from magnificent performances and directing of then-unknown John McTiernan, but the beautiful camera work of Donald McAlpine and the creature design by the legendary make-up master Stan Winston.

That reaction alone -which I'm sure was common in theaters across the nation- would have been enough to let the film makers know that, as far as the audience was concerned, they'd really done their job.Unfortunately, Schwartzenegger seems to haver "lost it," in my opinion.

In the end though Arnie takes one hell of a beating but still manages to kill the Predator and escape, the only man in his team to escape. Great Music Great Action Best Action film</fullReview>

Then we suddenly we see what the Predator sees but we just don't know what is going on. One by one the team is hunted and killed. They try to use their imposing weapons to fight against the predator but the predator is to smart so far. Then the teams ammo starts to run out...When Major Alan 'Dutch' Schaefer the only survivor he happens to get into the water followed by the predator when he crawls out of the water trough the mud he turns around and stands to the bottom of the tree watching where the predator is. When predator's cloaking device seems to fail due to the water you get your first glimpse of what he looks like. Covered by mud Major Alan 'Dutch' Schaefer goes unnoticed by the predator wich is being exploited by Schaefer. To finally kill the predator, Schaefer makes primitive spears, and logs, and covers himself with more mud, eventually defeating the predator...This movie is like a Sci-fi epic but on the other it's a kick-ass commando action/adventure.

		<fullReview>This is ONE of Arnie's best flicks but not the all time best. I would say his all time best is 'The Terminator', which is quite ironic seeing as though the elite team in the jungle is being hunted systematically by a machine like hunter with incredible strength and deadly accuracy, which is similar to Arnie's role in James Cameron's sci-fi classic 1984 blockbuster.Nevertheless, 'Predator' is a fantastic movie, successfully combining terror with great action sequences and unbearable suspense. The predator itself has an unbelievable arsenal of state of the art weapons from outer space, and from the beginning of the movie when it makes it's first kill, it looks simply invincible. That is, until Arnie gets to grips with it's infra red vision, quite by accident. Schwarzenegger is great too in this film and successfully shows off his variety of huge muscles. The supporting cast is also impressive, with Richard Chaves and Carl Weathers (Rocky series) along with my favourite of the supporting cast Jesse Ventura. His Rotary cannon kicks ass, but there is no way any human being could fire that gun just by holding it. More realistically, he would need to place it on some kind of stantion or support. Regardless, who cares?!, he looks cool with a gun like that!.My only question of the film is how the hell did the character 'Hawkins' get into this elite team of commandos. Everyone of them looks in great shape and has great physical capabilities except 'Hawkins' who looks like a geek and a wimp. I must assume that he must be part of the team because he is some communications expert or something relevant to that. Surely he couldn't have qualified to be a fighter?!.Fantastic film, one of my all time favourites, highly recommended.Rating 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, plain and simple</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie too many times to count - for one simple reason. It is the best action movie I have seen in my life (and that's a big list of action movies).The story is pretty simple - an alien is hunting a group of commandos for pleasure and they have to fight back or die.Everything works in this movie - the characters, the plot (although far fetched, it is believable the way it is presented), the special effects, the music, the predator, the suspense. As far as action movies go, it's brilliant.For those of you who have not seen it and have weak stomachs, you might want to avoid it. Be prepared to see skinned-corpses, guts, bloody-fleshy skulls and detached arms.This movie is a MUST see for action fans.10/10 (action genre)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predator and the relationship between man and technology.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: SPOILER!! I liked this movie. I believe that it is Arnold's Schwartzenegger's best movie. The tension and suspense are excellent. This movie effectively combines horror and action-adventure. The movie starts out with a raid on a military camp in some banana republic. I was taken in at that moment with the victory over the guerillas by Arnold's special forces team. It seemed as if the movie would be about a campaign against corrupt and possibly communist Latin-American military forces. Americans with their excellent combat skills, training, and technology would win out in the end. But that is what makes this a good movie. On the moment of their greatest victory, a seed of doubt is planted. We see what the Predator sees but we just don't know what is going on. When Billy squishes the scorpion, it is symbolic of the fate of the special forces team. One by one the team is hunted down and killed. They try to use their imposing technology to fight against the predator but to no avail. The high technology fails. When Blaine's gatlin gun runs out of ammo and is humming impotently on, this is symbolic of the utter futility of their high tech gadgets. To finally defeat the Predator, Arnold must give up the empty shell of high technology. Arnold makes primitive snares out of rope, sticks, and logs, and covers himself with mud. The mud is symbolic of the main character being one with nature, shedding the trappings of civilization, as the only way to survive against the ultimate of hunters. This movie reminds us of our primitive roots and the importance of being one with nature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John McTiernan's first big movie is also his second best (well, maybe that's a tie with Die Hard) but Predator trumps everything he's done in the last decade. Continuing the Ah-nuld genre of roaring action and Mr. Obvious statements (otherwise known as "no duhs"), Predator is probably Arnold's best human performance after True Lies. See it for the action, the plot, and--above all--the cast. Definitely robbed at the Oscar in my view. This is a fun movie to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Predator. My mom loves Predator. Everyone loves Predator. Predator is one of those great and genuine movies that simply entertains. In fact, it's one of the most entertaining films ever made. When watching the movie you're really watching two movies; a Sci-fi epic on one hand and a kick-ass commando action/adventure on the other. And there's never a dull moment. I don't have one complaint about the film. The cast is perfect. From the sexual Tyrannosaurus Jesse "the body" Ventura to Carl "Apollo Creed" Weathers to 70's porn star Sonny Landham, they're all great. This is one of Arnold's best roles, no doubt. And I can't say enough about the predator itself. But the design they used was not the original. I saw the AMC backstory about the film and caught a glimpse of the original monster (played by none other than Jean Claude Van Damne). It would not have worked, believe me. It just would not have been scary. My hat is off to Stan Winston for saving the film. He created one of the scariest, and most creative monsters in recent film history. A brilliant cast, an excellent score, fast-paced direction, and a memorable creature make Predator a true classic.Note for horror buffs: Shane Black who plays Hawkins wrote the Monster Squad.</fullReview>

No stupid dialogue, no "deeper" meanings, nothing but the bare necessities. Arnie is great, as well as Carl Weathers, who should have starred in more movies. For some reason I find the scene where the alien blows off his arm very memorable. Well, anyway, the climax between man and alien is satisfactory and delivers the "goods".

Led by Schwarzenegger, and accompanied by CIA correspondent Weathers, they soon find themselves being targeted by a merciless, high-tech alien that makes trophies of man. Takes time getting started but once it does hang on! It's a macho, energetic, edge of your seat thrill ride with non-stop action, suspense, and sophistication.

		<fullReview>Ah, the 80's! The decade of action films!!! This is a great film. It deals with the mission of elite commandos who go in search of some hostages. After their initial mission is over, I must say, they deal with it very quickly, they are slowly, one by one, killed by an unseen force.A great pitch for a film and probably the greatest alien enemy ever imagined! Only the 'Aliens' can compare to this 'Predator'.The 98% all male cast do what they do best - swear, shoot big guns, and flex their muscles. And if you want tension, explosions, and a great mano-a-mano for a climax, then this is your film!Arnie's best movie - he was the box office draw in the 80's - alongside films such as The Terminator and it's superior sequel.The Predator itself is an alien that is obviously not from the same planet as E.T. He has technology that us humans couldn't even begin to make for another 100 years. He is very agile, leaping from tree to tree silently and gracefully (like Tarzan just without the yodelling!!). It is the ultimate killing machine. Highly intelligent, and it can even learn our language within seconds! And he wears what is most probably the best costume I have ever seen on an alien!All in all, a damn good film showcasing that Arnie was once a formidable action hero, and reminding us that some aliens ARE out to kill us - just for the fun of it!As the Predator does with the skulls of his victims - collect this film!!Rating? 9/10Enjoy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>O.K, so I'm not a big "Arnie" fan, but Schwarzenegger does have two standout films in his reportoir. The Terminator(Obvious) and Predator. Predator isn't just your garden variety blood and guts shootem up. It's an action film sure , with a very interesting premise. As we all know man is at the top of the foodchain and basically has the power to destroy any creature in the animal kingdom. Whether it be for food , survival or sport. But what if a life form existed which was more advanced than humans?.In this case our villian quietly lands on Earth, with no master plan for invasion or conquest. He has merely made the journey for a spot of hunting, he even takes parts of his victims as trophies.( Not all of them only the good ones) It is this that gives Predator its cutting edge and distances it from various other films of its genre. Overall it is entertaining , action packed and offers food for thought. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a big Schwarzenegger fan, he is not a great actor, he knows no martial arts, he's not pretty (not that that matters to me but for the ladies) but he has been the no 1 action star since he first uttered the line "i'll be back". He now has competition from younger stars such as Vin Diesel and Mark Dacascos people like that and even Brendan Fraser and Tom Cruise all of whom have acting ability, looks and a certain charisma he lacks and with the rising standard now needed in action films he is looking like its game over for his action crown. No longer is it acceptable to be purely beefcake in a mass destructive movie. I cannot really watch his 80's films besides this and the Terminator as I feel 80's action films are all about damage and violence instead of acting and plot. The Predator though is great, sure it has moments that are very overly macho and typicle of 80's action but Mctiernan also incorporates a tense and chilling atmosphere and adds to that Arns best performance bar End of Days. THe film is not to plot orientated but more about the situation, and there also features an amazingly destructive action scene when Arn and his troops infiltrate an enemy base, there must have been a lot spent on that because it was superb. Arn delivers his lines well in this and is given a character who is required to be fairly stoic without being given too many cheesy lines and it seems Mctiernan may have given him guidance as to what he wanted from the character which you feel lacks in films like commando and running man and if you have seen running man you will know that the Austrian Oak was terrible in that especially the Helicopter scene which made me want to vomit. Predator is a classic and the big man steals the show without having to rely purely on flexing his pecks and snapping necks.</fullReview>

Everything was appropriate for the tone of this film. The actors (especially Schwarzenegger and Weathers) played their roles superbly. For the time, the effects were cutting edge and setting was so fitting that it was spooky. Now to the show stealer of the movie -- the Predator itself. Kevin Peter Hall was a perfect choice for the headhunting alien. He was tall but well-toned, massive yet graceful. He made the Predator look so real! I can go on and on about this movie, but I will spare you my ramblings. In closing, what really sold me on this movie was at the end, after a fight sequence that would make Mohamad Ali cringe, when Arnold looks over the dying Predator and asks "What the hell are you?" To which the creature squawks back, "What . . . the hell . . . are YOU?" Goosebumps every time!Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Predator ranks as one of my favorite action films of all time. One of my major gripes with action films is the dialogue. Dialogue seems to suffer at the expense of big action and dumb set-pieces. Predator does not. I'm not for one minute saying that Predator has a script like a Shakespearean play, but it certainly doesn't have (m)any cringeworthy moments. The acting is also suprisingly good, with Arnie given only the bare minimum to say and does so with suprising dignity. But of course all this talk of acting and script is rather unimportant to the average joe viewer, who wants to see things blown up, and boy does John Mcteirnan know how to do that. High points for direction and editing come with the attack on the camp, where the action comes thick and fast. (note much of this scene has been censored for the recent UK and Australia DVD release, however the R1 (USA) is uncut as are all other European versions)All in all Predator is a great movie, its not clever and doesn't try to be. It's what I would call a "tasteful action film".</fullReview>

Arnold Schwarzenegger, although not the true star, is excellent as Dutch, the leader of a team of commandos who fly into the Central American jungle to take hold of a hostage situation. The other actors delivered fine performances and marvellous action scenes. Billy seriously kicked major butt with the mini-gun, despite all those critics who say he'd need a lot of aid in holding onto it while firing. The others were all enjoyable, including Anna, who provides a sharp intellectual contrast to Dillon, who refuses to believe that a monster is the true killer. and Kevin Peter Hall. My my my. He was the best person to play the Predator- plenty of moxy, a strong, assertive stance, and perfect timing. It saddened me to learn, quite long ago, that he died. No one could ever play another Predator quite the way he did. A true classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Predator is one of the best action movies I have ever seen. The acting is great, the music is great, the atmosphere is great. Action movies don't come any better than this. Whoever did the casting is a downright genius. Arine doesn't say much in the movie but he surely is a great leader for this team of commando's or speical forces or whatever they are. Sonny Landam gives a great performace as the native amercian commmando who can feel the predator's spirit inside of him. Bill Duke brings a little bit of drama to the movie and Ventura plays a great tough guy. Carl Weathers (Apollo Creed) also is very excellent in this movie. Personally my favorite character in this is Billy (Sonny Landam). I like his guts and brains. Predator has some great scenes that will live with me forever. The team completely destroys an entire village in the middle of the movie, Arnie and the Predator square off in a hand to hand combat scene that last for thrity minutes, the team shows off their strengh by pulling down huge trees and using them as traps, and finally the team levels an entire rain forest trying to kill what is ever out their. The only reason why I didn't give this movie a 10 is because they don't teach us enough about the Predator. On well if your a fan of bigs guns and a great action film with a brillant story this is the film for you. 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Character of Predator -- acting of Kevin Peter Hall -- make movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has a number of strong elements: great soundtrack, crisp editing, and solid visual and sound effects. What really makes this movie work for me, however, is the character of the Predator himself. A number of reviewers have commented on the creature suit but have failed to acknowledge the fine work of Kevin Peter Hall inside. Hall had to create the character of the Predator working only by gesture and body language and did so magnificently. In many ways, the Predator -- and Hall -- upstage Arny.The action in the movie builds to a final confrontation that bears more than a passing resemblance to the various cinematic treatments of the classic short story, "The Most Dangerous Game" in which a big game hunter hunts humans (the most dangerous game) for sport. We are introduced to the Predator -- the extra-terrestrial big game hunter -- a piece at a time. We assemble these pieces -- sounds, POV shots, shots of the Predator tending a wound, and so on -- to begin to form an impression of who the Predator is. This way the movie reveals the Predator to us is nothing short of brilliant.For instance, the Predator has a distinctive percussive, guttural trill sound that it makes periodically. If one is paying very close attention, this sound will be heard the first time in conjunction with the sounds of other jungle fauna. There is no suggestion that the Predator has anything to do with it. It is only later, when the sound is directly associated with the Predator, that you'll realize that the Predator was stalking the team from early in the action.The Predator also has a refined aural mimicking ability -- think duck call. Early on we hear the Predator practising imitating the speech and even laughter of various members of the team. In particular, I direct your attention to Billy's laugh, which the Predator mimics. Listen closely for the number of times you hear Billy laugh, and then notice how often that he's not part of the group that is laughing.(Spoiler)At the end of the movie, Arny refrains from delivering the killing blow and says to himself, "What the hell are you?" The alien mimics Arny, repeating the same statement. Was it just the mindless duck call-like lure, or was the Predator acknowledging his adversary?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie introduced the world to the predator. The meanest, most kick-ass movie alien of all time (followed very closely by the alien from Alien movies).The movie itself is high-paced, and arnie does a good job of being a 1-dimensional marine.

		<shortDescription>There's something out there and it ain't no man, we're all gonna die</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That one line from Sonny Landham sums up the entire movie - there is something out there which isn't a man and they are all going to die (with the exception of Arnie.)Schwarzennegger is at his best here and even manages some semi-good acting, had he stuck to movies like this instead of trying to move into comedy (Jingle all the way ring a bell) he might not be the memory he has now become. (best scene: standing on a rock with a flaming torch and yelling)Carl Weathers has always been one of my favourite actors since I first saw him as the infinatly charismatic Apollo Creed in the Rocky movies and he comes off excellently here as the mistrusted outsider. (best scene: fighting the predator just before his arm is blown off)Elpidia Carrillo was an actress I had not previously encountered before seeing this film but she does a superb job with the small part she is given, but some sub titles would have been useful when she lapses into Spanish or Mexican (also she is gorgeous which never hurts) - I believe they also made a good choice by not putting her in a position to have to play the weak women who needs rescuing all the time as this would have been completly unrealistic and very annoying. The actress herself deserves credit also for taking this part since a lot of women would not even consider taking part in a movie such as this and for being able to avoid her character being more or less terified than the men in the film. (best scene: kneeling the jungle with the soldiers and telling them of her peoples legends surrounding the predator - in english!)Bill Duke brings a certain level of intensity and emotional impact as the man who loses his best friend and sets out to avenge him, along the way he uses more ammo than the entire soviet army, kills an innocent boar and works his razor to death. (best scene: chasing the predater through the jungle singing long tall sally)Jesse "the body" Ventura the future governor of Minnesota shines in his role as the sergeant with an attitude and though he dies early on has possibly the most emotionally pivotal role in the whole film as he sets up Mac's actions for the rest of the film. (best scene: spitting tobacco on Carl Weathers shoe in the helicopter.)Sonny Landham gives the most wideranging and suspensful performance as the one who knows there is something wrong but does not know what, his character is also the one responsible for most of the revelations about the killer i.e. it being a hunter and killing them one by one as well as finding Harper's body. (best scene: cutting his chest and standing with knife ready waiting to die.)Richard Chaves displays the most emotion in his role as Poncho but does well to balance this by not going overboard and ruining the feel of the film, he also acts as the translator for Anna. (best scene: asking Billy what he knows about the predator.)Finally Shane Black the future author of Lethal Weapon another of my favourites has possibly the smallest and least vital role as it is obvious he was just included in the film to insert some of those terrible pussy jokes and once he ran out of those he was cut - ha, ha. (best scene: the first pussy joke in the helicopter when he turns back to his map in embarrassment.)A fine film which unlike many of its kind in the nineties doesn't pretend to be something it isn't.</fullReview>

This movie was directed by the guy who did "Die Hard" if that tells you anything. I actually rated this movie an 8 and bought the DVD because the character design, back story and special effects were so good. The "Predator" was Stan Winston's best creature work.

		<shortDescription>Arnies best film to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deep in the South American jungle, a cabinet minister is held captive by guerillas and it is upto Major Dutch (Arnie) to lead a group of mercenaries on a rescue mission to save him.Straight from the off on the chopper, we get a sense of uncertainty over the mission, is it what it seems, who needs rescuing etc. On the chopper, Long Tall Sally is blazing in the background as we get our first glimpses of the team in hand. We have Billy (very clever and guts of steal), Poncho (Confident, good friend of Dutch), Mac (Focussed and a Brute), Blain (Beefcake), Hawkins (The intellectual one) and Dillon (The outsider with a secret).As the team accomplish their mission they discover that they are not alone in the jungle. One by one they discover the presence of the alien that can only be described as the perfect 'Predator'.The scenario for this film is perfection for the suspense that is generated, you actually ask yourself the quesion of what would you do in that situation. The scene where the jungle is being gunned down was a classic moment, the fact that the team didnt even know what they were shooting at, pure tension in abundance!!!!I cant express how much i love this film, i just cant!!!, Arnie plays the part to perfection as does the entire cast in this film. Silver went on to do better things after this film in The Matrix and Romeo must die which are both very good as well. But he'll look back at this film and think this is where it all fell into place.It was just a shame that the sequal couldn't live upto its predecessor like many other films (except Aliens) have. So if your bored one night, rent this film.......no no BUY this film and enjoy time and time again....its an instant CLASSIC!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this installment of Arnie vs., we take a look at him against the alien foe called the Predator. Not only does Arnie have to take on one bad ass alien, he must also deal with bad editing, the rainforest, an army of South American do gooders with hostages, many buildings to blow up, and an all out duel with Carl Weathers AND Jesse Ventura in a no holds barred one-liner competition. I have to say that in this ruff and skilled competition, Arnie and Carl get bested by the governor of Minnesota, Mr Jesse Ventura with classic lines like "I ain't got time to bleed" and the infamous "Sexual Tyrannosaurus" line...classic. Very suspenseful movie that concentrated on mood more than the easy big budget cop out of over using a great special effect. Through everything Arnie still prevails and presents a kick ass movie.

		<shortDescription>Terrific rumble in the jungle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thirteen years ago, this rumble in the jungle became an instant smash, spawning comics, model kits and an engaging sequel with Danny Glover.It also made The Matrix producer Joel Silver even more wealthy thanks to its heady mix of humour, action and special effects. The fact that it starred one of the world's biggest box office draws of the time did little to harm the project either.Back in 1987, Arnold Schwarzenegger was piping hot property. With a couple of Conan movies and The Terminator under his belt, the Austrian Oak proved that he could make millions at the box office by flexing his pecs and sneering out a series of one-liners.Arnie teamed up with director John McTiernan for what at first looked like just another Aliens clone. However, while the first half is another tale of kick ass soldiers decimated by a savage ET, the second half turns into something quite stunning.Schwarzenegger is great when he keeps his mouth shut and gives a terrific performance as the man mountain clashing with what can only be described as a Rastafarian crab-faced monster.As ever, make-up guru Stan Winston delivers a stunning foe, and while Arnie may usually be a force to be reckoned with as the buffed super soldier, Dutch, he is practically eclipsed by one of the big screen's most exciting alien creations.As you might imagine, making this 1987 classic was far from easy. It was shot on location in Mexico at Puerto Vallarta, miles from anywhere.The cast got up at 6am for breakfast and then ran four or five miles to get into condition. There were another five hours of working in the jungle on skills training - climbing trees and handling weaponry, among other things. Another two hours of weight training left them exhausted, by which time McTiernan was ready to rehearse.It's a pity the script wasn't as well honed as the cast. The dialogue by Jim and John Thomas - who wrote Executive Decision and this year's woeful Mission To Mars - is far from subtle. There are also a few dodgy moments such as the scene in which one poor troop has his arm removed, yet you can see the real limb strapped behind his back.It scarcely matters. If you can avoid the often absurd diplays of macho heroics during the first half hour and the fact that the eponymous villain seems to use a 50p paint pallette as his wrist detonator, then what develops is literally out of this world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Motion Picture Classic!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To all those people out there who have not seen "Predator" yet, this is my question for you; I'ts been 13 years, what are you waiting for?! Seriously though this is probably the best Schwarzenegger vehicle yet. It has everything that fans of this genre will love-action, violence, gore, even a few comic moments and definitely suspense. (Which the imposing soundtrack certainly helps to build.) Most of all it is a film that is entertainingly watchable which considering the cost now to go to movies is what we appreciate most. Arnold is fantastic (he almost always is), and he actually seems to succeed more here with the supporting muscle around him-maybe in not having to focus on just him for a good portion of the film, we tend here not to be so analytical of his acting deficiencies. The supporting cast is excellent as well. First off the talented Carl Weathers who even through some moments of adversity with his character, certainly exudes the confidence and toughness that made his portrayal of Apollo Creed in the "Rocky" series such a likeable faction of those movies. Secondly the now Governor Jesse Ventura plays role perfectly with just the right mix of machoism and fearlessness. The rest of the cast including Elpidia Carrillo, Bill Duke, Sonny Landham, Richard Chaves, Shane Black, R.G. Armstrong, and the late Kevin Peter Hall as the Predator make a nice and diverse mix in keeping the plot moving at what is sometimes, a frantic pace. A great film with a great cast acting out a great storyline to a great ending. What more could you ask for? I promise you won't be disappointed!!</fullReview>

Sort of like a mix between "Alien" and "The Most Dangerous Game", Arnie and the gang are out busting Latino guerillas while a sly extra-terrestrial armed to the teeth are picking off are heroes one by one, until he meets the big Austrian, who really picks a good fight with the galactic and more violent version of Elmer Fudd! "Predator" is a great flick, with great effects and cool lines ("You are one, ugly, mother------," and "Anytime"). The actors are great, too.

		<shortDescription>An exemplary action film for others to learn from</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen many, many action films in my time (and I'm only 15) but this one truly takes the cake. Predator, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger in his best role to date, really should be a teaching tool for upcoming action/suspense films. It's about a special forces rescue team that goes into enemy territory to locate and salvage soldiers from a downed helicopter in the jungle. But soon after the seven-person team arrives into the jungle, they are hunted by something so original its scary even to watch. The formula it uses is great for entertainment, high energy, and nerve racking suspense, and I personally have never seen it done better. If you were to list all of the imitation Predator films out there, the list would be full of boring, ugly, poor attempts at cheap scares and lame action SFX. Predator is the one and only sci-fi/action film of the 80's that captured my imagination (when I watched it at 9) and put millions of questions into my head. Not because the plot was full of holes, or people made stupid decisions, but because the FX were so top notch, even for today's standards, and the acting was so realistic. It even gave me nightmares it was so good, and I'm definately not prone to bad dreams, never have been.Director John McTiernan really out did himself with this one. The direction is perfect, the casting couldn't be better, the writing amazing, the acting surprisingly well played, make-up FX are outstanding, and costume design . .. what I would say is Action-Oscar worthy. The one and only thing I would change about this movie is to have Jesse Ventura die later in the story. Super action, horrendous deaths, but overall a masterpiece. Classic. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Schwarzennegger in his prime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the mid to late eighties it seemed as if Arnold Schwarzennegger could do no wrong. Practically every movie he made was successful, people loved him, and things were good. "Predator" is typical of the movies he was turning out, just enough schlock and humor to add some fun, serious enough to get your attention, and gobs of special effects and action. Carl Weathers and Jesse Ventura complement rather than compete in the drama, and there's enough shoot outs and one-liners for everyone. (Bad Idea, Stick Around.)What's always stuck in my mind about this movie was where the final battle took place, a forest with huge trees and an almost primeval look to it. I've always felt the director was trying to symbolize going to the basic instincts of survival and conflict; when the identity, race, and origin is stripped away, and all that is left is two beings fighting to the end. Maybe I'm just reading in too much.Most people would agree that "Terminator Two" was the peak of Arnold's acting talent, but "Predator" is a sample of what he did when making hit movies was his bread and butter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is KILLER!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a great movie!! This one is Arnold's best, like, for sure! This is another one of those movies that is fun to see over and over with a group or by yourself. It's non-stop action and suspense and all that good stuff, and it's packed full of great characters. Oh, and GORE GORE GORE!!! I also admire this movie for its BLOOD AND CARNAGE!!! Yeah! I don't think I could have done it better myself. Well...unless I was given the same cast and crew and a couple extra million. Maybe then. But given that it was never offered to me, let me just say that this movie is top notch for GORE and SPECIAL FX and FUN! It's right up there with Robocop and Total Recall, so if you liked those and you haven't seen this, what's wrong with you?! Remember to rent Predator the next time you're at a video store. Trust me.</fullReview>

His comment on being "...a god damned sexual tyrannorsaurous, just like me." serves to summarize our society's feelings on sexuality in one line. Brilliant.

If an E.T astronaut with much more advanced science and techs landed on earth by accident and he has to hunt for food, he may hunt human beings and regard us just as inferior animals, just like we human beings hunting wild animals. The problem is whether we can defeat them at this situation. Arnie played a good role of his classic style, adamant, never surrender. And, of couse, at last he will win. To gain some confidence for our human being. But what if E.T really invades? This film may bring you some thoughts.</fullReview>

Great USE of special effects, this movie did not have to have them, they were great icing to this cake, unlike other movies where they are so based upon special effects and visuals the dialogue and characters are really hindered (example: Titanic,1997). I do recommend renting if you haven't, I own it because I love it. Even if you don't like Arnold Schwarzenegger and hate action flicks, give this one a try, it's definitely worth the price.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something VERY Different for Arnie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Something different, indeed, as THIS time, at least initially, rather than Arnie chasing after something, something is after ARNIE, something at least as strong or stronger and at least as lethal. Of course, Arnie turns the tables, if just barely, but here is one of few times when he is very evenly matched with his opponent. This movie isn't just about action; it's about well thought-out action, and while the antagonist is out of this world, the procession of events is VERY believable.This was also my first exposure to the musical handiwork of Alan Sylvestri, whose musical dynamic ranges from the potent main theme to a trumpet voluntary, heard over Mac's eulogy to his buddy Blain and just before the close of the movie. Good stuff, which has had me looking for more of his handiwork.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different kind of Sci-Fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most interesting part about this movie is that it's not a hi-tech sci-fi. It's a down to earth movie with a sci-fi creature brought into the middle of it. Arnold Shwarzenegger potrays the main character, Dutch, in this film. He's the leader of a special forces team assigned to investigate missing army operatives. After completing their mission, they find themselves in the Central American jungle being stalked by an intergalactic hunter that collects the skulls of his kills for trophies. Awesome acting, storyline, and non-stop action. A definite must see. Very different from any other kind of sci-fi and is pretty much uncomparable because there's nothing to compare.

With Terminator 2, Robocop and Jurassic Park, Predator is simply one of the best movies i never seen. The story : the best soldiers in the world versus the best hunter in the universe. Big guns versus plasma canon. Everything has been said on Predator, but if you have never seen Predator, you missed this wonderful movie and you have to watch this. I can't see an imperfection in Predator. I have watch at least 50 times and i am happy to know that there will be a 51 soon. The dialog, the FX, this is made by genius. And the OST, it is simple, Alan Silverstri come up to John Williams and Basil "god" Poledouris. John McTiernan + Arnold = chef d oeuvre</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predator in a Jungle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of commandos go into the South America jungle on a mission. There they encounter an alien that hunts the army men for game. It has powers that enable it remain elusive, track people in its vicinity and kill them deftly. As the men are being taken out one after another, it falls on the lead of the team, Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to out-wit the predator at its game. The character of Dutch is tailor-made for Schwarzenegger. It is the tough guy kind of role that does not require a lot of acting chops. He has some memorable lines like, "If it bleeds, we kill it" and "Payback time."This alien is different from most other movie aliens in its personality and characteristics. Its design was unique at the time in was made, but tentacles/mandibles on the face have been used many times since then. The story is simple but gripping nonetheless. The action is good with lots of gun-fire and explosions. The effects still hold up and its good to see a non-CG monster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Title: PredatorCondensed Storyline: A team of commandos go into a jungle to retrieve a captive. But they find themselves being hunted down by an alien, one by one. Notable Acting: Cast of good to semi-good actors working to make the commando squad seem realistic, you get to see the tension build between them before they have to fight for their lives. This is one of those movies which almost all the cast are known for, be it Arnold, Bill Duke, Richard Chaves. All of them bar Shame Black, but that is because he is the first to die. Noticeable Camera work: I didn't hold much hope out for creative angles, as this is an action movie and I keep that mind set for most action movies made before the millennium. I am generally right as well for most of them. We get POV voyeuristic shots from the Predator, but those only last so long in-between the standard panning and tilting shots. Costume: The costume is iconic, it has the mixture of technology with tribal working towards the overall hunter theme of it. Incorrect Science: Mac is seen shaving during some scenes, no man or soldier would shave in the jungle due to the guarantied risk of infection which would result in death. (Doesn't really matter as he dies later, but still) Dutch covers his body in mud to hide from the predator's infrared. His whole body is covered in it, except his eyes. Eyes still produce high amounts of heat, so his eyes would have shown up to the predator. Overall Feel: When this movie first came out, people were comparing it to 'Alien' which came out a decade or so earlier. People were disappointed because the movie didn't have the horror or suspense that Alien did. Once people saw that the movie had Arnold Schwarzenegger in it, they should have known that it would be an action movie at heart. Up to the point, Arnold had only ever done action related movie, with the odd comedy here and there. So the fact that people were slightly disappointed confuses me as this movie turned out to be one of the greatest Arnold movies there is, same can be said for the rest of the actors in the main cast. The movie is a great action thriller when it all boils down to it, the acting is solid. The camera work is watchable and the story is pretty damn cool, so there isn't much to not like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can't go wrong with Arnold, Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke, Sonny Landham &amp; company as a special forces squad that gets hunted down one by one in the jungle by an unknown predator.The special effects were unique and especially well done, and not just for the time period. We seem to forget that special effects magic has been around for decades, and talented movie makers were able to do a great deal, even before everything became computerized.It's action from start to finish as the alien hunter takes out Arnold's team one by one until Arnold's final, last man standing confrontation with the creature.This movie goes full-tilt on gun play, that's for sure. It's impossible to count how many rounds they cap off in this movie. You'd have to have an ammo truck following you around to give you that kind of firepower.The Predator concept has been used numerous times in sequels, creature mash-ups with Alien and video games. I think it's one of the more successful new horror/sci fi characters to come out of recent history Hollywood.The 1980s had several great sci fi flicks- Terminator and Aliens easily come to mind, and Predator is right up there with them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Schwarzenegger's Best Film Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge die hard fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger and for me this no doubt 100% his best film ever (even better than The Terminator Franchise, sorry about that) . The very first time I watched this film was when I was 8 years old and I still can watch this film over and over again and not get bored with itThe story was interesting and not that all typical. I was really waiting for one of those soldiers (expect Arnold that is) to turn humanoid and turned out to be the one who attacked all those commandos but instead what I got was better. The predator with all of his mandible claws looks on his face, stealth kills and battle cries were really terrifying to watch and above all apart made the movie more scary (apart from the last 30 minutes of the film) was seeing him stalk him victims in while in his stealth mode and killing them one by one. The last fight with Schwarzenegger was one of the most best fights ever. Intelligence and guts beats technology at its bestThis movie is definitely my favorite movie of all time and Schwarzenegger's best film of all time and a perfect score for me. There didn't seem to be anything wrong for me from start to finish. A very flawless script. Too bad the sequels went downhill after this one but Predators for me did redeemed back the series a bit</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Epic movie. Six American commandos led by Dutch aka Arnold Schwarzenegger are sent on a mission into the JUNGLES OF CENTRAL America accompanied by a CIA agent to rescue the crew of a downed Ministerial aircraft believed to have been kidnapped by guerrillas. What they end up coming across is a terrifying fight for survival and whole lot of pain.This movie made in 1987 is classic cinematic gold. Very little talk but this is made up for by excellent fight scenes and the graphic nature of machine gunfire against a Predator capable of cloaking himself. One by one the Commandoes lose their abilities to resist the creature hunting them until the leader and protagonist must finally take him on alone.The Predator and Commandoes are perfect rivals. They cancel out each others skills. All of the team lack the weapons, armour and physical strength possessed by the Predator yet at the end we see expert knowledge and the determination shown by our protagonist is strong enough to slay the over confident creature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very enjoyable. The movie played it straight, no romance and no twists (except the minor one in the beginning i guess). Which was refreshing because you did not have to think much, and i do not mean this in a bad way but instead you could just sit back and take it all in as it came, focusing on the moment. The characters were memorable and Arnold was awesome. The predator is probably the most unique and interesting alien i have ever seen. I found it so interesting that i even read the comics and played the games, they have really managed to create something spectacular. It is not just a rabid beast or a hyper intelligent, big- headed dude trying to probe our asses. No instead it is a hunter. A being with great technology but a very primitive culture were it comes to our planet, not to study but to hunt and take trophies. A real safari were we are the prey. Anyway the pacing of the movie was great and they really built up the suspense by limiting what we see of this predator and they do not reveal it until the very end and what a reveal it is. To bad the cover of my blu-ray case spoils it but that is my problem.For me this movie is a 10/10 i also liked the sequels (except the AvP ones). Go watch it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another title that everyone's seen which I just had to review. But why not? This will always be a new movie for someone. First time I saw it - in VHS format - I was about 12. Now I watched it on blu-ray, so here goes.One of the best action movies of the 80's and it doesn't even feel like an 80's movie too much. A true pioneer, introducing us a fantastic, all new alien species and quite a few memorable scenes, characters and of course some one-liners from Arnold.The jungle is an excellent environment, and it's used well. Cinematography and camera-work is usually very impressive. The story is clever enough and moves forward at an enjoyable pace. There is action, suspense, comic relief and of course sci-fi all mashed into one unforgettable movie in a manner that is hard to surpass. This movie starts just "okay" but gets better with each passing minute, climaxing wonderfully in the end. There are no significant flaws for me.Before I get to the "little disappointing" things, I'll list some things I love about "Predator":- Location. The jungle isn't only "cool", it also serves the movie well in a way that still feels fresh and ageless. Imagine if this film was set in a city in the 80's. - The Predator itself. Not only how it looks (good), but its behavior, background, the whole concept. It is a real character, not just an enemy in an action film.- Arnold. I can't help it. He's the most entertaining action hero ever.- Muscles and guns everywhere! The whole commando squad is a well-cast, enjoyable group of different personalities.- Satisfying violence. PG-13 just wouldn't cut it. - Jesse Ventura with the "Old Painless". Yes, this had to be mentioned separately.- The awfully hilarious female genitalia-related jokes. - 1st, 2nd and 3rd act are all wonderfully different from each other, yet somehow still fit together as a whole.Now, to the nitpicking. Sometimes the editing is a little off to me. Only a few scenes where it's noticeable, but it sticks out a little. Sometimes during intense action the "big picture" gets lost and it feels like people are just running wherever and explosions just happen without much established geography, and that takes just a little out of the experience for me. The effects, well...most of them have survived the test of time. Quite an accomplishment. Some effects still look very cool. Some of them sadly don't and I was taken out of the movie at times, but after 26 years that's more than understandable. But if someone's reading this and hasn't seen this movie, don't be discouraged. You'll love it, and you'll find plenty of stuff here that you won't find from the majority of action films today.The blu-ray picture quality is surprisingly good (I got the "Ultimate hunter edition"), considering how much they had to do. There are a couple of shots that are not re-mastered for some reason, but they're only 2-3 seconds long each and didn't bother me that much.I was about to give this a score of 8/10, because I might've just seen this movie too many times to fully appreciate it anymore. Then I slapped myself in the face immediately. If I had a Top10 list of action movies, "Predator" would be in it. For the originality, overall quality, certain agelessness, pure entertainment value and also nostalgic value it gets a respectable 9/10. Truly a classic. If you ever meet someone who says "Predator" is his/her favorite movie, do not think you're dealing with an idiot. You just might be dealing with a genius of the highest caliber. Not bad for John McTiernan's first big studio film! McTiernan's next movie after this was "Die Hard", not a bad combo.</fullReview>

But when they get to the island they find out that it is nowhere close to what they have expected. The Predator is a well thought up and original character that just gets more interesting throughout the film and Arnold once again relies on his one liners and and testosterone action to make this a very entertaining action film.

		<shortDescription>Compelling and timeless Sci-Fi Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best sci-fi/horror science fiction films ever. In many ways it is like James Cameron's eighties films, Paul Verhoeven's Robocop and Total Recall, a real example of the emergence of the action auteur. Also like Cameron, director John McTiernan has come from basically no-where to make a real impact with a mainstream Hollywood film.The film takes a fairly simple plot populated with stereotypical super-fit soldiers, puts subtly unique personalities on some of the characters, drops them in a jungle on a mission where they are the 'Predators', and then pulls a clever twist and makes them become the hunted by the titular 'Predator'. This works mainly down to an incredibly effective atmosphere and pace from director McTiernan, who patiently sets the plot up by taking the story in one direction, then cleverly working up to switching the genre from an action film to sci-fi horror, which plays out brilliantly for the rest of the film's running time. What is particularly impressive is the flowing camera-work in tricky jungle locations that strikes a balance between helping keep the films pace, dynamism and suspense without drawing attention to itself. Kudos have to go to both McTiernan and particular veteran Australian cinematographer Donald McAlpine.The actors all give broad, theatrical performances with some corny one liners that nevertheless have amazingly become part of popular culture over the last twenty five years. All the characters are good value, and Arnie is entertaining as the leader of the soldiers. As the film's climax builds, his character has less and less to say and it is in this part of the film, which is pure suspense, sees Arnie delivering action through silent physical performance. This is his strongest part of the film.However the best performance of the film is without doubt Kevin Peter Hall as the Predator. Together with truly fabulous and ingenious non digital visual effects by R. Greenberg and Associates, and Stan Winston's truly amazing costume design and animatronics and prosthetics work (the film has its gory moments, but doesn't dwell on them), his physical performance is remarkable and he brings life and an engrossing and compelling personality whose values are clearly otherworldly. This is all the more amazing as he was in a very difficult costume, working in oppressive conditions. He certainly displayed a great deal more commitment than a well known actor who was originally cast in the role! He also has a'blink and you will miss it' cameo as a human character! The film hugely benefits from great technical support. Good production and costume design help contribute the a great atmosphere for the story to play out in, as of course does the aforementioned photography (The film's original cameraman was replaced by Don McAlpine a few weeks into production) and the visual effects (which also saw Stan Winston Studios replace another company after production has started). Editing is solid but the film also benefits from Alan Silvestri's fantastic score which create a fabulous atmosphere;it brilliantly accentuates the visceral impact of the action sequences and helps heighten the tension in the more suspenseful scenes. In fact Silvestri would follow this film with two further outstanding scores in The Abyss and Predator 2 in what has become a long and successful career for one of Hollywood's A list composers.In summary a seminal action/sci-fi/horror film that is still great entertainment even today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Along with The Thing, this is one of the only films to come out in the wake of Alien that stood it's own ground. While much more macho and more action-oriented, it provides plenty of suspense on it's own, and is right up there with Alien's sequel Aliens, which it shares many similarities to.The first half of the film has Arnie, as 'Dutch', leading a team of mercenaries on a rescue mission, given to them by CIA field agent Dillon - Carl Weathers - an old comrade of Dutch's. As they make their way to their designated target, they discover signs that another team of soldiers has been in the area. This is confirmed by the horrific discovery of skinned corpses, and amongst the offal laying around on the ground, are dog-tags confirming them to be US Army Special Forces troops - 'Green Berets'. They believe the local guerrillas are the cause of it - but the real culprit is watching them silently, with only Billy - Sonny Landham - sensing they're not alone.As they attack the guerrillas in an awesome action set-piece, it becomes clear Dillon has lied to them about the true nature of their mission - to take down a Soviet-backed guerrilla force. Given that Predators places this as happening in Guatemala, it is likely they were intending to cross the border into Belize, which they have long held claims to. Dutch realises his old friend has had them perform the CIA's dirty work, and neither he nor his team can trust him anymore. With a female guerrilla taken prisoner, they had back to the LZ......And then the Predator makes his move, hunting them like animals. Dutch and co find themselves battling for survival as their unseen foe proves to be a most formidable enemy, equipped with high-tech hardware that enables it to appear virtually invisible, and with a cool visor that enhances its vision, enabling it to track the characters by their body heat.After the gun-ho antics of the first half, the second gives way to claustrophobic tension, the Predator using the jungle to it's advantage. The jungles that the team proved to be so effective in, now becomes a foe in themselves.As the Predator picks them off one by one, it becomes clear the creature is hunting them for sport, showing mercy to their prisoner only because she was unarmed. It eventually culminates in a showdown between Dutch and the Predator, and the climax provides a great series of cat-and-mouse scenes as Dutch reverses the situation when he discovers how to make himself invisible to the Predator, resorting to primal instincts, and old-school survival tactics against the more technically-advanced alien foe.Almost up there with the monster's entrance in Alien, is when the Predator takes his mask off, revealing one ugly mofo who, like Alien, became an instant icon. A vicious, imposing, relentless foe, it is the Predator who is the real star.An excellent sci-fi thriller, a perfect macho alternative to Alien, and right behind Terminator 1 and 2 when it comes to Arnie's best films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The quintessential Schwarzenegger film and an action franchise classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beauty of Predator (which other reviewers pointed out) is that it truly is a B-Movie type monster flick but made inherently better by a solid director and the incredible star power of Arnold Schwarzenegger. It truly was brilliantly made given the budget for the time and they managed to jump start an iconic series that has lasted almost three decades! Honestly, the first part of the film, the first hour is really a 6/10 B movie shlockfest that is entertaining but really nothing spectacular. Then, the Predator makes himself known, and the last twenty minutes or so when its no holds barred Predator vs Arnie it just amps this film up to action film legendary status. The setting for the film is perfect, the thick lush jungle giving way to the ideal place for all the insane kills and violent war scenes. They even manage to open the film with a battle against soldiers that has essentially nothing to do with Predator and yet makes the film even more interesting and fun and sheer entertainment. I think for its time the special effects are pretty decent, and hold up even now. And of course you can't ignore the iconic one liners "Stick around!" and my personal favourite "Get to the Chopper!" No matter how you shake it, this is an action film classic.Much can be said about Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting. The thing that can't be denied is his incredible screen presence. He is larger than life and has this chemistry when he is on screen. Predator also solidifies Arnold's status as a complete bad-ass. His roars of war and his campy line delivery and he stills looks like the meanest SOB and the only man who can take on this alien monster. While the supporting cast are really mostly just fodder for the Predator the writers actually gave them some solid personality and characters. 80's sidekick legend Carl Weathers is his usual serious and glaring self as Dillon. The scenes between him and Schwarzenegger are perfect and the side story of their long time friendship and the betrayal is well placed. Bill Duke, Jesse Ventura, Sonny Landham and Richard Chaves are all good rounding out the rest of the team. The one character I would have liked to have seen more from was Sonny Landham whose character Billy seemed to have a lot of depth and a back story that would have been interesting to explore a little bit. Elpidia Carrillo plays the only female in the film and she does alright. I think she was basically put into the movie to have a female presence but its mostly unnecessary. There is no romantic story between her and any of the characters (which is good) and her performance is okay but un-needed ultimately.Whatever happened to John McTiernan? How did this guy start two of the greatest action franchises in history plus a handful of other top notch action flicks and then nothing else for almost a decade? This was McTiernan's second film and his talent is obvious. He knows how to tell the story and utilize the characters perfectly. The man is an action genius. Predator might not have been the first film to combine distinct recipe for action with a horror flare but its probably one of the best. The special effects are decent as I mentioned but the Predator, that's where the money shot is. He is impressive and disturbing and overwhelmingly awesome. In one of my favourite all time scenes when the Predator throws down his weapons and removes his mask to challenge Scwarzenegger's Dutch...his appearance is simply outstanding. It actually made my skin crawl and as only Arnold can put it "You are one ugly..." If you love 80's action, if you love Schwarzegger and sci-fi and horror...this is truly one of the greats!! 8.5/10</fullReview>

Arny can not really act but this movie he is not saying overly much he does what he does best and stands around looking menacing. This movie is intense action from pretty much the start to finish and it was really ahead of its time.This movie is about a group of special ops soldiers who go to south America to go on a mission. While on the mission they start going missing one by one and soon discover they are being hunter by something not of this world.This is a great classic action movie and its one of Arnies best for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alas, Predator...just the name alone will strike fear into the hearts of men wandering in jungles. And that's exactly what it does in this movie.I have so many compliments and praises for this movie.1) The story-The story is very interesting as it begins with a ship in earth orbit, launching something to the planet, which obviously is the Predator, then Dutch's (Arnold Schwarzenegger) team is commissioned a top secret liberation of a camp in the jungle, but then end up being hunted and killed one by one bye the Predator until only Dutch is left.2) The suspense-Oh yeah, what is going to happen next? When will it happen? How will they die? The suspense is everywhere once Hawkins gets killed.3) The special effects-The plasma caster, the camouflage of the Predator, and the self destruction of the Predator.Anyways, I highly recommend watching this movie! It gets a 10/10, or in my personal scale, 1,000,000/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to the Jungle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Arnold Schwarzenegger created a secret family out of wedlock, before director John McTiernan was smothered by legal woes and before Jesse Ventura donned a tinfoil hat, there was "Predator." A tough-as-nails action epic, this little flick from 1987 added to Schwarzenegger's repertoire as the go-to guy for action flicks at the time and kicked open the door for McTiernan who would go on to direct other classics such as Die Hard, The Hunt for Red October and Last Action Hero (?).A group of mercenaries led by Dutch (Schwarzenegger) are dumped in the Central American jungle on what they believe to be a rescue mission. Almost immediately upon their arrival, it appears something is wrong. Dead bodies -- apparently skinned alive -- are dangling from the trees and all the while, Jesse Ventura won't shut up. It seems there is a much more dangerous enemy lurking in the foliage, one which can mimic its enemies and blend into the scenery much like a chameleon. This enemy is not of this planet, means serious business and is absolutely famished. This, of course, means it's "Game on!" for Arnold and the Predator."Predator" is essentially the perfect action flick. While latter day efforts like "Rollerball" may indicate otherwise, McTiernan is (or was) a genuine master of his craft. The film is perfectly paced, the effects are solid (if admittedly bit dated by now) and not overpowering and the characters are brought to life by larger than life personalities. Schwarzenegger and Ventura are joined by the likes of Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Sonny Landham and Shane Black. Black, who wrote the script (as well as another action classic from the same year, "Lethal Weapon") brings the characters to life with so much testosterone it oozes out of the screen. Not in a gross way, but in the sort of way that makes you feel like you are hanging out with a group of good ol' boys, shooting the breeze and laughing at one inane joke after the other ("See, 'cause of the echo..."). That is, until carnage ensues and the gang drops off one by one. You'll be laughing one minute and be perched on the edge of your seat the next. Brilliant.While not quite in the same league as, say, Ridley Scott's "Alien," "Predator" delivers the goods in spades. It has a fresh and original concept, a great cast and enough thrills to make it worth watching again and again. McTiernan's Hollywood debut boasts a significant amount of replay value, something which the dreadful "Alien Vs. Predator" flicks lacked and which most modern films of its ilk lack as well. So grab the DVD/Blu-Ray/VHS/Laserdisc/Hologram/Brain-implant, get to da choppah! and get ready for a good time.</fullReview>

It's one of those cult films which will always be entertaining because it's timeless. It's not too obvious and it's not all about goore which mist films are today.

		<shortDescription>A perfect mix of Alien, Commando and Rambo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This, my friends, is a silly action/scifi film done correctly. Because let's face it, the idea behind this film is ridiculous. A team of black ops commandos being double-crossed by their own government is pretty basic, but when you throw in an alien big game hunter, the silliness levels skyrocket instantly. Sure the alien in question is kind of cool and dodges most of the worst clics, but it's still an alien trying to hunt down Arnold Schwarzenegger, for sport. I still can't believe that this movie didn't fail.And it doesn't. This movie is a fantastic action film, with intense battle scenes, memorable characters and pacing that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. It's smooth, gritty and knows what it's doing. It treats its characters and plot points with respect, yet never forgets what it truly is. The balance between realism and silliness is as thin as a knife, yet this movie walks it perfectly.There's really not all that much more that can be said about this film. It requires you to suspense your disbelief, sure, but when the whole movie just works, you can easily do so. In my opinion, one of the best Arnold Schwarzenegger action movies out there and easily worth watching by everyone that enjoys combat, slaughter and tough-as-nails characters.</fullReview>

Tons of action, good acting, and a really cool alien. And the predator is just, well, a predator. It kicks but! it hunts, it has cool weapons, it's just an awesome alien! And the plot is good, very cool, and very fun, though not the best kids movie, a LOT of cussing is in it. Not much blood though. Either way, I still watched it when I was nine, haha.

		<shortDescription>The best Ah-Nuld movie EVER!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe "Predator" is Arnold's best movie of all time.Don't get me wrong, I love all movies starring Arnold Swarzenegger, but this one is my favorite. This movie has some of the best action I have ever seen and the characters are all great. The plot has a few dozen people from the Marines in a jungle come across an alien creature from another planet. Arnold's acting is top notch and the suspense is sunning and terrific. This is one of the best Sci-Fi movies I have ever seen and will always be one of my favorites. The climactic scene will always be one of the best ever and the movie will never be forgotten as one of Arnold's best films that he has ever starred in. It's follow ups don't even come close to the success of this film. I can safely say that any Sci-Fi fan would find this movie a pleasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Predator having never seen it from beginning to end and having just re-watched the original Alien. I am currently in the process of re-watching both series', for obvious reasons. One thing that I notice about both of them is the way they take their time in introducing the enemies which, in both films, are aliens. Predator doesn't waste much time dwelling on the origin of the alien, we pretty much assume it came from a space ship that flashed across the screen at the opening of the movie. Alien, on the other hand, went into remarkable detail about where its alien came from. What Predator does do, very effectively, I think, is that it has the guys fighting some very human enemies, which allows the movie to later take its sweet time in having them realize that the new enemy is not human at all. This is also, incidentally, weakly rehashed in the sequel, using the secrecy of this mission and team as an excuse to have more guys who don't know what's going on.The death scenes are actually pretty tasteful, given the genre. They are just gory enough to illustrate the violence of the enemy without being gratuitous. Just enough is shown to show how vicious the alien is, and there are some strange things done to and with the bodies that make you wonder about the alien's intentions or needs. The first deaths suggest vengeance if not some sort of ritual, but later ones suggest that the alien may be feeding off of his (or her) victims. Oddly enough, it is not until the awful Predator 2 that we learn that it kills for sport.Yes, the movie occasionally gets embarrassingly macho, but the skill with which it is put together far overshadows any tough-guy goofiness. Consider, for example, the ease with which the movie switches from showing the guys hunting the alien to their realization that they are the ones being hunted. In some cases, this transition takes place during a single shot and with virtually no movement in the shot at all except a change in someone's expression. It is truly a fight between a group of predators, which we understand because they are human like us, and a single predator whose powers and weaknesses are unknown. It's not Oscar material, needless to say, but it's a great action movie in part because it already knows that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers and Kevin Peter Hall star in this 1987 sci-fi film. A team of commandos are hunted in the jungle by a mysterious alien lifeform. This begins in space with a spaceship traveling to Earth. We then meet Dutch Schaffer (Schwarzenegger), a special forces Major who gets sent on a rescue mission with his team to the jungle of South America. He works with colleague and friend, Dillon (Weathers) who's now a CIA operative. Dutch and his crew head to the jungle killing the captors of hostages and find a General's team that has been skinned alive. Soon, Dutch's team becomes hunted by a mysterious predator and the remaining members discover it's not an ordinary man, but a creature (Hall) from space. Dutch becomes the only survivor who wages his own battle with the creature before he's killed next. This is a good sci-fi/action flick, Arnold is great as usual, Kevin was creepy as the Predator and Alan Silvestri's score is excellent. I recommend this 80's classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dutch and a team of commandos have been sent into a Central American jungle to track down some missing airmen that were kidnapped by terrorists.By the time they get to the camp, the airmen have been butchered in a very violent fashion and the commandos retaliate on the terrorists' camp.After that's over, they wait for a helicopter to pick them up, but something strange begins to happen in the woods.It isn't long before the commandos start getting killed off and Dutch and a girl from the camp, Anna, are the only people left and fighting for their lives.But what they discover is too shocking for them to imagine.What's been killing them is the Predator, an alien that hunts rare species and make his trophies out of their skulls.And human beings are the new species he has discovered....When people mention great films of the Eighties (fun ones) this movie must crop up several times. It's easily Arnolds most fun movie where he isn't a cyborg, and the film has dated really well.It's the perfect example of can't fail cinema, by splitting the film into three parts..Part one..The recovery of the missing troops, AKA First Blood: Part 2 done in 20 minutes.Part two..The hunted, AKA the bit in the film where you and your mates guess who will die first, and it gets sentimental.Part three..The showdown AKA Arnold has a fight with an Alien, the bit that sold the movie. The High Concept.The film cannot fail, it doesn't fail, it delivers what it promises, and the first ninety minutes is just (albeit excellent) filler for what people really want to see, the biggest action hero in the world beat up an Alien.How could it be better? The answer is it cannot. And no matter how many sequels, side-quels, crossovers this film has, it will never be tarnished.All the cast are great, and the film is endlessly quotable.If you haven't seen this, I beg you to see one of the finest Sci-Fi/Action movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than Alien (and it's impossible not to compare)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently I've watched all the Alien movies, in order to catch up with the Alien vs Predator series. And since my reviews about Alien quadriology didn't ended up as I've spected, lucky o'my Predator is much more funny to watch.I've remembered when I was a kid I saw a horrible scene when there was people hanged upside down in a three without they're skin, and that scared me so much I could barely sleep at night. Haha, now I've faced one of my worst memories.Predator has its fails, and things could be improved, but its still amazing. Every scene Gran master Arnolds appears has the capacity to make the movie interesting, because you know his about to kick some asses. And better than that: Dutch personality ain't just like a juggernaut, his smart, combining muscle and mind at the same quantity.Carl Whethers does a pretty good job either, since you don't get flash backs of Rocky every time his character, Dillon, appears.Im not intend to talk about every character in this movie, but just to know: there ain't no similarities between one and other, what makes them remarkable. I'm pretty sure you'll get to the same conclusions after watch it.Along history goes, you'll feel the intensity of a great soundtrack presented in Predator (composed by Alan Silvestri), what is better than Alien (composed by Jerry Goldsmith). That happens because Predator it's more intense and the music continues along the action scenes. Like I said in review title, it's impossible not to compare one to other, but in soundtrack matter: Predator is better.The story line happen into closed forest, and I liked, because it changes from day to night what helps to "renovate" movie atmosphere, it doesn't get boring like Alien and that Black and Blue along the whole thing.So, from the massive destruction to the chilliest scenes, Predator looks like a bipolar movie that captured my attention all along.But now a little bit of what could be improved.I really feel special effects could be better on this one. When predator appears, his silluet it too much "offensive", and easily distinguishable. And His/It's lasers and shoots looks like paint made. Even if it's 1987, I know it could be a lotta better, and if you think it couldn't, take a look on Star Wars - Return of the Jedi (1983) and you're going to get the message.Predator is really an amazing movie, even better if you haven't enjoyed Allien. Definatelly a Must See!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It picked Arnold to hunt?big mistake. My Fav Arnold Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arnold stars in what would become one of the best sci fi action movies of all time. The movie begins with a shot of space and small craft jettisoning a pod to earth. Flash to a small base somewhere in Central America, a helicopter arrives with a group of soldiers for a mission. Their leader "Dutch" (Arnold) is briefed on the mission by Dillon CIA (Weathers) and General Phillips (Armstrong), that a cabinet minister went down in hostile territory. Just for fact it's the fictional country of Val Verde, not Guatemala. Dutch smells trouble but has to go along and then we meet the characters on the helicopter ride. Blain (Ventura) packing a mini gun, Poncho (Chavez) special grenade launcher, Billy (Landham), Mac (Duke), Hawkins (Black), all with distinct personalities and weapons. Billy picks up the trail, Dutch is suspicious and more so when they come across Green Berets he knows, who have been killed, skinned and strung up. They take out the commie guerrilla base, and take a female guerrilla Anna (Carrillo) captive. Dutch finds out Dillon double crossed them to do the mission, time to go home right? Wrong. Soon one by one his men are picked off with seemingly no enemy to fight back at and weapons never seen before. Eventually they make a stand against what seems to be something not of this world. After his men are killed, Dutch virtually unarmed makes run for the jungle telling Anna to run and "Get to the choppa!" Dutch by accident learns the creature can't see him while covered in mud. Using this to his advantage he fortifies grounds for a final showdown. After a lengthy fight Dutch is forced into a hand to hand fight, which becomes a route. Beaten to a pulp he crawls to his main trap. The Predator smells it and thinks he out smarted him only to have Dutch kick the trap and smash the Predator with a massive log, immobilizing him. Dutch gets up and is going to lay a rock to his skull, but just asks "What the hell are you?" The Predator repeats it, then reaches for his wrist sets a bomb and starts laughing. Dutch gets the, message and runs for his life before a small nuclear explosion takes out the area. Standing tall at the end, ravaged by battle he is picked up by Phillips and Anna and taken off into the sunset.This is my favorite Arnold film and basically the perfect male flick. There's virtually nothing in this film a female could like. The only one in the film is there for some info and nothing more. No nudity, senseless character development, or any garbage to slow it down. You get a little here and there on some and that's it, we don't need to here about the characters stupid kids on weekends, short and sweet, no nonsense. Recent films bog down in character development.Where the movie really shines, is probably the cast. Its one of those films that's just perfect. It happens rarely but there are some. Arnold, need I say more? He is the ultimate leader from the start arm wrestling with another great Carl Weathers. No skinny boys from new films, these are guys you actually believe could kick ass. Other greats, Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke, Sonny Landham, Richard Chaves and even Shane Black, the smallest guy manages to be good, just on his stupid jokes. Even if you hated the film, you remember the guy telling the gross jokes. Arnold is needed to take on 7 ft tall Kevin Peter Hall (RIP) who, in costume made Arnold look mortal. It just doesn't work having a guy who can't match up to a big guy, see "Predators", an obvious miscast.The characters are another strong point. Almost all have a unique weapon and personality. This helps you to remember them. The obvious one is Blain carrying around the mini gun, pointless yes, but in a comic book type film it works. He chews tobacco, curses and just wants to slaughter the enemy. Some of those classic lines "I ain't got time to bleed" are his people. Dutch all business and bicep's, Dillon devious, Billy spiritual, Poncho underrated toughest to the end, Mac loyal friend looking for revenge and Hawkins the comedic guy. But the other star is the Predator itself. Thanks to the great Stan Winston (RIP) who created this creature that has become an icon of sci fi fans everywhere. With KPH's performance it just jelled perfectly and became a classic. This movie does contain lots of memorable one liners from many of the characters that also makes it great. You can't put these in other films and expect them to work, this is why this is a classic. You get bits a pieces of what the creature is that is flushed out more in Predator 2.As far and direction and special effects, it all works. John McTiernan takes the cast and delivers a solid action flick as he would with another classic Die Hard. Stan Winston's creation probably delivers the film in then end. The original design was bad, so call in Stan to save the day. The obvious active camouflage has become a staple of the predator series along with the heat vision that the predator sees in. All work out while keeping the enemy basically hidden till the end. The Special DVD has plenty of stuff behind the scenes, effects, interviews and commentary that should not be missed by any fan. I've been watching this since being a kid in the 80's, overall a big 10 out of 10 for one of Arnold's greatest films and top 80's action flick. Followed by a worthy sequel Predator 2, anyone who remakes this should be hunted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Predator is one of my favourite science fiction thrillers of all time. There is a lot of action and a lot of humour. And it also has a lot of heart. Their is also a lot of suspense. I like the fact that you do not see the predator a lot in this movie. That is what makes it more shocking. Arnold was just absolutely brilliant in this movie. His best movie along with Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The visual effects and special effects were very well done. And it is very fast paced. This movie is about a special forces team sent to the jungle to rescue hostages. But instead they have to fight for their own lives. Predator is a good time of a science fiction movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great 80's Action Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is, in it's raw form, a cheesy 80's action movie. Yet, Predator has managed to expand in to a franchise, resulting in a sequel and a prequel. Now why is this, is defiantly is not classic piece of cinema, however there is a certain joy one finds watching Arnold blow crap up. And this movie is filled this material in it's finest form. An "Arnold Schwarzenegger Flick" has become its own sub-genre and this little gem is probably the best. The dense rain forest is the perfect setting for the predator to be stalking his prey, this film makes you feel the heat of the jungle and the suspense never lets go. No one on planet earth should ever get tired of listening to Arnie's "witty" remarks and catch phrases. So what it all boils down to is this movie is a blast to watch in all it's bloody and violent glory. The only negative thing i can think of is the Hollywood ending tagged on to the end, but we were all expecting it anyways. I highly recommend this movie to fans of the action genre, shooting sh*t genre, stabbing sh*t genre, blowing sh*t up genre, and the punching sh*t genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rescue team encounter a deadly alien</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first installment of the saga that still continues to this day.Six agents are sent into the jungle of Guatemala on a rescue mission. Unbeknownst to them, a deadly alien also chose the same spot to go out on a hunting season - for humans. Rather young Arnold Schwarzenegger stars in this horror/sci-fi/action drama. Stan Winston studio designed Predator also makes it's debut in this movie. The movie has a real feel to it and has become the favorite of the fans of this series.Also in this movie is the young future governor Jessie Ventura. His motto was "Do like Arnold to succeed" and switched from professional wrestling to the big screen. Maybe Arnold thought "Do like Jessie to succeed" when he ran for the California state governor's seat.The mission was actually a con sprung by Dillon (Carl Weathers) to infiltrate the guerrillas and collect information. Dillon thinks he's got one on Dutch (Arnold), but he's the one who stepped into a big dudu not knowing the danger that awaits him. It's fight to the end for all of them once the hunt begins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably one of the best films of 1987</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My dad and I both love this movie because for probably all the action and suspense or something.This movie is for sure on my top 10 favorite movies.The film takes place inn the actual year 1987, not like Alien in the year 2037. A squad of army guys go to a jungle in Central America probably to take out another enemy squad. on the way they come across an alien hunter known as "Predator" and pretty much most of the squad is killed except or 3 or 2 of them.I give Predator a 8 out of 10 for unknown reasons though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic battle between Man and Alien</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dutch is a commando whose sent to the jungles of Central America to find a cabinet minister, with his old friend Dillon and his team. But on arrival the team discover the remains of an entire USA army sent earlier to do the same job. Something has skinned them alive! Now the team must get to safety as something begins to pick them off one by one.As a child I loved this movie and still to this day, it always brings fond memories, its basically a battle between man and alien in the jungle, a fantastic concept that works brilliantly. The director does an amazing job, in building tension, for the longest time the audience does not see what lurks in the darkness, only an outline of the creature. The action is just fantastic and the end battle is well worth the wait.The second greatest Arnie movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seen this movies over 20 times already - it is that DAMN GOOD!!!A John McTiernan masterpiece!!! Just look at the superb, solid casting, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Jesse Ventura and Sonny Landham.Good script by Jim and John Thomas (Hard Time on Planet Earth 1989, Mission To Mars 2000) coupled with good special effects by Stan Winston and visual effects by R. Greenberg. Plot: Dutch is conned by his ex team-mate Dillon into a rescue operation in a Central American jungle. They land by helicopter and soon finds the bodies of General Hopper and his men who have been skinned alive.They then discover the rebel base camp where Dutch sees a prisoner being shot though the head. And so extreme measures are taken and the rebels are exterminated. They find no hostages and Dutch realizes he's been fooled by Dillon and he immediately pins Dillon to the wall and demands to know why he's been used in this manner, since he and his team are a rescue team and not mercenaries. Dillon quietly tells Dutch that he had no choice and if he had told him the truth he wouldn't have gotten so far.Now they painfully make their way back to be picked up. And it is here that they are stalked by an creature that uses a form of light refraction as camouflage and is armed with high technology weapons. For Dutch and his team the race for survival has just begun..... Keep and eye out for Sonny Landham, Bill Duke and Richard Chaves who all give awesome performances. Jesse Ventura in his first big role is an instant hit. The only female presence is that of Elpidia Carrillo and she gives her best acting.The star of this film is Arnold Schwarzenegger and this IS HIS BEST AND MOST IMPORTANT FILM (apart from Conan The Barbarian, Commando, The Running Man, and The Terminator). The best scene if the film is when he is beaten up by the Predator and crawls his way into a cavity and as the Predator approaches him - he yells "Come On! Kill me ! I'm here !!! Come on kill me now!!!".Score 1 Trillion out out 10.Continue the good work John McTiernan - make Predator 3!!!Whopeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!PS: why didn't J.M direct Predator 2 ?????? A mystery I'll never know...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Movie, one of my all time favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw this movie for the first time, it literally scared me to the point I had to keep a light on at night. Of course I was way younger then. In my opinion this is one of the most brilliant, well thought out creatures I have ever seen. We are given a full scale setup of the lifestyle of this monster. John McTiernan did an excellent job at building tension for this creature. The way it killed people was something new and it all seemed to serve a purpose. Stan Winston defintately delivered on building this creature. Kudos to the late Kevin Peter Hall for delivering an excellent performance in a suit. When looking at the rest of the movie, you have to consider what it is and why this movie works so well. The commandos led by Arnold Swarzenneggar are true 80's action stars which shows in the gun fights. They can shoot at the hip and seem to hit there targets no problem. They barely ever reload, and seem to all come out without much harm. Now this seemed like it was done purposely to deliver on the Predator turning there world into a nightmare. Suddenly they are dying one at a time in a sick toying matter. The gun fight where they all had to reload and pretty much level a Forest without killing anything pretty much took the movie out of the typical 80's action movie style. It was great! This is one of Arnold's few 80's action movies where he didn't dominate. He got lucky and still had to run for his life to make it out alive. How many times did Arnold really have to do that in a movie? Not many. When looking at the making of this movie you cannot help but wonder what would of happened if Jean Claude Van Damme was still playing the predator and if the original design still took place. Makes you think doesn't it? This movie could have been very very bad. I mean look at Commando. Sorry guys it just wasn't good lol. This movie is definitely worth buying the 2 disk DVD. You can see the full documentary making of this movie, plus a look inside Stan Winstons work and the creature. Some really good stuff. A classic in my eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ultimate Predator, battles the Ultimate Prey: Man.This is, in the smallest nutshell physically possible, the plot of the 80's sci-fi, action, horror film "Predator", from "Die Hard" director John Mctiernan. Now wait a second, from the director of "Die Hard"? then how come nobody ever seems to give this film a second thought? Sure everybody knows about the not-so-amazing Alien vs. Predator crossover, but the original Predator? Nah, you'd have to dig pretty deep to find somebody who remembers that.For somebody who has never seen or even remembers the release of Predator, may be shocked to here that it earned a pretty good box-office and general critical reaction to the film was positive.To be honest, I think that Predator is an overlooked gem that brings back some of that 80's, action film nostalgia that so many people subconsciously strive to find. Though not on the same level as say "Terminator" or "Aliens", "Predator" is a classic in it's own right, many more recent films have borrowed a lot from this movie. Many images, which have become iconic in modern cinema, actually have roots in Predator.Predator is also one of those films that improves with age. It's almost refreshing to see an old style action movie that doesn't feel like a clich, simply because it's one of those movies that has actually created those clichs to begin with.If you're an action movie fan who loves Terminator, Die Hard, and Aliens then this movie is for you. If you're not really that type of moviegoer, I think Predator works well enough to actually make a space in your heart for this kind of film.Well crafted action flick</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Predator.If you are at home in the sci-fi universe you have probably already watched or at least heard from this movie. Predator is considered a classic must-see in it's genre. And I agree with that.So what is this movie about? A team of special commandos are send into the jungle to rescue an ambassador from the local rebels. However, when they get to their base they find out that it was all a set-up. Apparently, a different team was send to that area before them, but they all mysteriously disappeared. Soon, the commandos find out that something in the jungle is hunting them and that it's not from this Earth...A very good cast makes this film far from boring. Arnold as the lead adds his usual share to the movie. It are the other actors that deserve more credit, if you want my honest opinion. There's good chemistry between them and it makes the film more enjoyable.The story develops at a steady pace, with the strange plot twists now and then that make Predator famous. You will see things that will make you uneasy, so don't watch this if you're under-aged or can't handle some gore. Predator ain't a movie for kids.That brings me to the real star of the movie, the Predator. At the time, I had no idea that this alien species would ever cross blades with a different, just-as-famous alien race, called the Xenomorphs (or Aliens). The predator is a true work of art. The way it moves, thinks and hunts is unique, to say the least. The effects on the creature are also VERY well done. There isn't a single moment in this movie that I found the creature unrealistic (if that makes sense, since it IS an alien species). The laugh at the end of the movie is perhaps the only thing that's a little out of place though.I'll be very interested to see how the remake (or reboot) of this movie is gonna turn out. Hopefully they won't ruin too much of the magic of the original film.Predator is a must-see for Sci-Fi fans and certainly watchable for fans of thriller/horror movies too! I give this movie 8 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"If it bleeds, we can kill it." - Dutch Before turning from celebrities to politicians, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jesse Venutra starred in John McTiernan's "Predator." In the high-energy action-film, a special forces team, lead by Schwarzenegger, are thrust into Central America on a rescue mission. What starts out to be just another high-risk job for the crew quickly takes a turn for the worse, as the group find themselves being hunted by an alien who can blend into the environment and whom, despite all their fire-power, can't be stopped.As McTiernan's first effort (he would later go on to direct "Die Hard"), "Predator" still holds up as an effective action-flick/monster-mash to this day. With plenty of quotable quotes from Arnie ("Get to the chopper!") and a supporting group of macho-stereotypes, it's a full-on, action packed ride that doesn't let up for one minute -- logic be damned! The Predator itself -- although looking somewhat hokey by today's standards -- is an interesting and challenging villain, with a face that only a mother (or Stan Winston) could love. Before he descended upon L.A. and did battle with other "Aliens" in a couple of mediocre cross-over films, he was giving The Terminator himself a run for his money. Schwarzenegger is pretty much playing the action hero as only he knows best, and the final act that finds him engaging in war games with the deadly creature is among his most entertaining work. Overall, "Predator" hits all the right marks, with it's sense of humor, sense of camaraderie, and overall assault on the senses. If you like non-stop gun-fire, lasers that blast holes through heads and alpha-male posturing, this may be the flick for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched this movie at least a 100 times. Could watch it again tonight from start to finish. In my opinion, almost a perfect movie. The only thing I would change would be the attack on the rebel camp. Everything in the movie is so realistic, but some of the short range machine gun kills by Dutch and Dillon look ridiculous. I would have much preferred that they stayed on the hill and took out the whole camp with grenade launchers. There was no need to have so many point blank machine gun kills. But I wouldn't change a single scene from the rest of the movie. And if you don't agree, "I'll bleed ya, real quiet. Leave ya here. Got that?".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arnie once again dons his self destructing shirt and large weapon for a brief spot of jungle warfare. After Dutch (Arnie) and his team are sent on a rescue mission, joined by Dillon (Carl Weathers) things get a bit hairy. As usual Arnie has been lead into a scrupulous situation filled with Rebels armed to the teeth with all manner of explosives and ballistics and some nice skinless corpses to decorate the trees, like Christmas baubles. Fortunately, Arnie (as usual) is prepared and flexes his biceps while firing more one liners than bullets. The film then takes a sci fi twist, and the team of elite soldiers are pitted against an alien warrior who finds hunting muscular strong men a form of sport.The balance of tension plus all guns blazing action work really well, and the use of some decent (yet a bit dated) special effects top off the experience. Although Predator isn't exactly artistic, it delivers its narrative effectively nevertheless. You certainly get all the bang you could want for your buck here, as usual with an Arnie film.The rest of the cast were also really enjoyable to watch and the subtle blend of humour and at times drama came across brilliantly. The characters weren't over developed nor were they linear and pointless. Each character had a role, unlike most action films in which the supporting cast are cast aside like a used tissue after a certain cinematic event.Overall, Predator kept me interested for its running time and unlike most modern action farces, didn't trail off in the last half hour, reducing me to a tearful and bored wreck. The soundtrack worked well with the events and the setting was well planned and coincided beautifully with the narrative.Action and Arnie fans should enjoy, yet if your after a more serious sci-fi horror/action try Alien/s</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is it about this sci-fi horror film that's so appealing? All I know is that every time I come across it on cable, I almost have to stop what I'm doing and watch it.Governor Arnold leads a platoon of commandos into the jungle to face off against a malicious alien. There's your plot. It's an even more uber-macho version of the previous year's "Aliens", the only difference being the location and the particular characteristics of the alien. This one has dred locks and can make itself invisible -- all you can see is a sort of ripple in the air when it wants to make itself unseen. It picks off the platoon members one by one in increasingly grisly fashion, until Arnie flexes his pecs and nukes the place.To be followed by numerous sequels, none of which I've seen, and all of which I'm sure were unnecessary.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why, you ask? At least that's the question I assume is on your mind, since you decided to read this, instead of skipping it. I'm not entirely certain. Let me assure you, I am a fan of the creature. The same goes for Arnie(no, I wasn't calling *him* a... never mind). In fact, claiming that I am one of the director, as well, wouldn't be stretching it even a little. *And* I dig tension, horror and thrillers(not to mention the genre The Governator commonly stars in, and science fiction). So by all means, I should be of the same opinion about this as the majority seems to. Maybe I was spoiled by the first AvP game, and/or seeing the sequel to this. Perhaps I just don't buy McTiernan's attempts at suspense. It isn't impossible that it's how the first couple of scenes of this set it up to be the typical Schwarzenegger flick to such an extent that if it had been cut immediately after, it would simply be known as the shortest of such ever, with a few brief things that have nothing to do with the rest(you'll know them if you ever do view it, or have). In the end, I don't really know. Could be all, maybe only one, heck, doesn't have to be any of 'em. With that said... there are good things herein. Hall did very nice(R.I.P.). The acting is mostly great(with only a handful of exceptions), and the characters are cool. The special effects hold up fairly well, and there are some nice moments in them. Cinematography and editing tend to be quality stuff. Like Alien, this works well to introduce the title being. I recommend this to fans of the people involved in making it. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Adrenaline Pumped and Testorerone Driven Action Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arnold Schwarzenegger is Dutch, the ultimate soldier, and Kevin Peter Hall is the Predator, the ultimate hunter species in the universe. This film is the result of these two fighting machines meeting up in the middle of the dense jungle of Central America. It is adrenaline pumped and full of testosterone driven action and simple characters. I mean that in a good way. There is not much doubt about the plot. It is a simple mission of extraction for the government with the usual red tape of it being something else, but what makes the film unique is the addition of the curve ball of the alien being who is invisible and slowly stalking and picking off each of the highly advanced commando unit.It is here that the film has it's greatest strength as Arnold, at the peak of physical prowess goes up against the biggest and among the ugliest aliens you have seen. To have to highly powerful characters go at it fantastic for the film as it gets the most action as possible out of these two large hunters. The Predator relies on stealth for the majority of the film which give it the advantage for the ? of the film, but when Arnold is on his own and figures out the Predators weakness the roles are reversed for a bit of the ? part of the film where the playing field is evened.John McTiernan does a great job balancing the views as he creates some suspense for the first half by not showing the creature itself but his silhouette in the jungle foliage behind its cloak of invisibility. He even shows quite a few shots from the point of view of the Predator who seemingly only sees in infrared which gets even worse when he takes off his mask toward the end.The film is an action packed thrill ride, which has plenty of action and plenty of one liners from the ever marble mouthed Arnold who can say the line, "Get to the chopper!" like no other. None of the sequels can match this film for its action or even storyline as Predator 2 has a weaker hero and seemingly weaker Predator.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember when I first heard about this when I was a kid, and what stuck in mind was that it featured humans that have been horrifically skinned by an outer-space visitor. Well my eyes lit up, but at the time my parents wouldn't let me watch this, despite my constant begging. I even played the video game (that was on the old-school 'Nintendo') before seeing the movie. So when I got around to seeing it. I was totally wrapped by it, that it became one of my favourite films. Maybe I don't hold it up that high now, but I do enjoy getting it out and reliving the fun of that nostalgic period. There are no pretensions here. What we get is a no-brainer, punishing sci-fi action joint that relishes in its gripping intensity, barnstorming violence, macho performances and vastly superior alien design by Stan Winston.The stereotypical story is minimal and rather unimportant because it's all about big guns, little words to lead on to the inevitable match-up between the Predator and Arnold Schwarzenegger. What a perfect choice it was to have Arnie involved, also where else can you see him cover himself with mud. Around this time he was at his prime (where many of my favourite Schwarzenegger efforts originate), and surrounding him was an appealing, and well fitted cast featuring Carl Weathers, Bill Duke and Jesse Venture. They weren't the greatest of actors, but nonetheless were convincing in their chemistry and delivering on the action. In the Predator suit was the towering Kevin Peter Hall. This outstanding design was unique, from the ability to camouflage to its thermal imaging POV shots and the collection of weapons made this one unforgettable Hollywood monster creation. Everything about the special effects still stands up today. What this boils down to is the flow of action and well-timed suspense, and there are many commendable, almighty sequences that go hand-to-hand with the stinking hot and thickly lush jungle terrain. The location does grow tighter, and superbly alienates. Alan Silvestri's atmospheric music score is filled with scorching cues, and a foreboding presence that pierces the humid air. Testosterone fills the script, with constant one-liners, which are quite memorable. Only his second feature at the time, director John McTiernan's vigorously upbeat and confident style would go to feature prominently in his career. This man knew how to get the blood pumping, and cook up effectively powerful visuals and thrills from nothing all that special.Satisfyingly fun, brash and macho 80s action / sci-fi that doesn't wimp out on you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its always been Alien vs Predator. I have never seen any of them at all. So i thought i would watch the original movies. I watched Alien and Aliens. Then i watched this. It was good but i would go with the Alien series.Predator was a good sci-fi action movie. But there was a problem. It was the same thing over and over. It gets old hearing the sound of twigs breaking and the actors saying "what was that?". But that isn't all that happens. There is plenty of action and gore to enjoy. Arnold Schwarzenegger is as good as he has ever been. The thing that makes a movie like this is the monster. The Predator was pretty cool. He has the mask on for most of the movie but when he takes it off you may say "WOW".Something that rarely happens in a movie is when you start watching it and it doesn't feel like something is going to happen. When i started watching this it didn't feel like there was going to be a monster in the jungle. This adds a lot of value.I recommend this if you are an Arnold fan or want to watch it because you are a fan of monster movies. I also recommend it if you have seen the Alien movies. Not a bad movie but it has some dull moments. Next on my list to watch Predator 2.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching Predator tonight, I was reminded of what an awesome decade the 1980s were for mindless, over-the-top, fun action. Predator is easily one of my favorites from the decade. Over the past few years, I've re-watched a number of my old 1980s favorites and none of them have withstood the test of time as well as Predator. The movie quite simply has it all ? the guns, the explosions, the biceps, the jungle setting, the quips (used sparingly, thank goodness), the blood, and the unstoppable enemy. But most importantly, it's got Arnold. In my mind, Schwarzenegger IS 80s action.The plot isn't overly complicated or doesn't get in the way. It's there to set up the action. The movie begins with a band of mercenaries going into an undisclosed Latin American country to rescue a couple of hostages. But there are more than the enemy guerrillas in this jungle. A strange being from another world is using this particular jungle as a base for his hunting expedition. His prey ? humans.Predator has held up over the years because of the superb and unrelenting action. It's a testosterone overload. In addition to Schwarzenegger, guys like Jesse Ventura, Carl Weathers, and Bill Duke fit nicely into the jungle setting. Every imaginable hand-held type military weapon is used at some point in the movie. No scene illustrates this quite like the one where Arnold and crew fire indiscriminately into the jungle as limbs, brush, and entire trees are knocked down from the sheer volume of their fire. Awesome stuff! Another big plus is the actual creature. The Predator design is fantastic. From his glowing eyes and blood to his use of camouflage to his array of weapons, he's one bad dude. I also appreciate the fact that a lot of time wasn't devoted to the alien's back-story. He is what he is. The only real weakness I can come up with in the entire movie is the acting. But really, who watches a movie like Predator expecting to see Oscar caliber performances?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arnold Schwarzenegger (Terminator) stars as Dutch, a soldier sent into an American jungle with a group of his best soldiers. But as time unfolds, they slowly learn they are being hunted by an evil alien warrior.Arnie plays the role of Dutch very well in this fast paced and mysterious Sci-Fi thriller. This is one of his more recognized and appreciated roles from his film career. His intelligent and authoritative character gives the film extra sophistication and tension as the film unfolds.It's a tense film and a very exciting watch. Being in unknown surroundings and with something out there, the film is an on the edge of your seat thriller with good action, good effects and great direction.Slightly confusing and a bit dull to begin with, but when the action scenes begin the film becomes alive with engaging fast paced scenes and reasonable dialogue.Personally I would have liked to have seen more depth to the characters. There were quite a few characters encoded but by the end I didn't feel I knew many of the characters too well to make a judgement.The villain was especially exciting. The "Predator" is kept quiet until half way through which makes it exciting and gives a feeling of danger and control, which justifies the position it is in, to make the film even tenser.The final scenes are very exciting to watch and the way the film ended was clever.The use of the jungle and the trees in particular are used to great effect with a feeling of claustrophobia around the setting.Its very fast and energetic and much watch for all Sci-Fi lovers.</fullReview>

In the lead, Schwarzenegger as "Dutch" is classic Arnold. Here he seems completely at ease in his character with good dashes of humor, "What's the matter Dillon? CIA got you pushing too many pencils?" This is probably my favorite role for Arnie.The story here is simple but effective, the filmmakers settling on a "less is more" strategy in almost every category. A special forces team on a central American jungle mission are tracked and killed by an alien hunter. While some of the scenes are lacking not due to dating, or technological constraints - surprisingly the elementary special effects still do the job - but more obviously budget constraints. The guerilla camp raid action scene feels a bit limited in this respect and I think budget had a lot to do with it. The sequence is also probably in line with other slam bang type 80s action movies also.Other flaws and smudges? I think there are some idiotic death scenes in the movie belying the intelligence portrayed by members of Dutch's group. Sonny Landhams last stand with his big knife is stupid, even though you just hear it. Authenticity is also a question with so many recent movies going mega realistic on military tactics. I just hate seeing so many people shooting automatic rifles from the hip. Put that gun to your shoulder soldier.The music score is fantastic, and memorable. The predator is judiciously revealed, a tactic that definitely adds to the suspense factor of the movie. McTiernan's pre Die Hard direction is awfully good. He keeps everything at a simmer and when its time, the movie goes to full boil.The script's subtlety comes to the fore with a great final showdown with the wonderfully menacing Predator. Dutch uses the cunning of a hunter, and largely, his own two hands and not guns to win the battle. This is a rare thing in modern action movies. On the subject of sequels, I am a fan of Predator 2, but anything that followed, including the new AvP Requiem was trash. The only stand out criticism, in Predator 2 and AvP R being a clear escalation on the part of the filmmakers in the gore department, and the others, the overwrought special effects. I'm not squeamish or against good computer effects, but I think the real strength of the first movie has nothing to do with blood or bombs, it is that there were strong characters and in the gore and effects department, less was indeed more. Its not hard to find why all the sequels of Predator were such failures. That and most of them were just crappy movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Predator is my favorite movie of all times. It is a great movie in it's simplicity. Movies that try to explain what's going on , the history behind the plot and try to justify the reason why this is going on, just end up spoiling the mystery for the viewer. "Predator" does not try to explain where the alien came from or for what reason. It just leaves to the viewer to wonder why! The characters are quite good too. I like Arnold's character in the sense that he is vulnerable unlike any other movie of his, in which he portrays an unstoppable killing machine! He is actually scared. The audio effects add to the suspense of the movie and really help it take off. The sounds of the jungle and of course the sounds the Predator makes( "crrrrrrr")are great. Really spooky! The plot is simple yet brilliant... the hunters become hunted by an extremely dangerous being... which cannot be seen, thanks to its genius camouflage (visual effects unsurpassed even by today's standards)!!! Let us not forget, this is a 20-year old film! Need I say more???</fullReview>

The characters are big but not OTT and Arnold Swaz. shows us how to carry a movie as a leading man...it is truly a brilliant performance from the Austrian come Republican senator.The film's length is also great and does never drag. I love this film! "If it bleeds...we can kill it!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Predator" stands as probably the finest exponent of testosterone-fuelled action cinema. Within the first five minutes, we get the usual close-ups of Arnie so that the audience can gape at how big his muscles are. Soon he's backed up by a team of assorted other tough hombres, but together are even they ferocious enough to take on a heat-seeking alien head to head? Let's just say they give it their best shot, but more than brawn is needed to outwit this creature...What saves this movie from devolving into your standard 'stalk n slash' is both the directing and Stan Winston's input into creating a fearsome nemesis for these macho men. By the clever design of those involved in the creative process, you actually feel genuinely scared for these guys, despite the largely menacing and hulking figures that they appear to be. If a foe can vanquish tooled up commandos with ease, then it's clearly a force to be reckoned with!If you want to see a thrilling movie where for one of the only times, the hero and villain seem well-matched, then you must track "Predator"...</fullReview>

When they find the camp they unleash hell! After the fight, they discover they've been used into taking out the rebels. They grab a woman who may be useful and head to the extraction point. This begins the muck of the film when the alien hunter begins to play...The rebel attack sequence is still one of the most memorable scenes of all time. The entire cast is great including wrestling legend Jesse "The Body" Ventura and Carl Weathers. The movie is still one of the greatest sci-fi classics of all time.I give is a 5 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Predator(1987) Review: Arnold continues to rise in the 80's. This is different from the norm, This is Predator.Predator is a landmark in movies. Out in the South American jungle, a group of commandos on a mission wind up dealing with a fearless alien. That's the setup. This is easily one of Arnold's best. This is not your one-liner action flick, this is a suspense horror movie.What works is the violence. We get to see the fury and rage of the Predator. The violence is gruesome, but helps tell the story. Another is the soldiers wind up rather paranoid after some quick killings and grotesque findings. The casting is really good and the acting is pretty strong, for Arnold's standards, he really did well here.The action sequences here are well done. This is not a straight action movie, but we do have some well done action here that has realism to it. The good guys do not always hit the target. The Predator attacks with precision and force.The FX are good. For 1987, it's good. There is however a few drawbacks here, First, we never understand the Predator's intentions. The other is one of the best characters here is dispatched quickly. The fight is over before it begins.The Last Word: Suspenseful and awesome. Despite a few drawbacks, Predator delivers excellent horror and suspense. One of Arnold's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) leads a team of commandos (Sonny Landham, Richard Chaves, Bill Duke, Jesse Ventura and Shane Black) hired by the CIA to rescue hostages in the central American country. But they find themselves hunted by a mysterious invisible alien hunter. Which they attacked and killed one by one.Directed by John McTiernan (Basic, The Hunt for the Red October, Last Action Hero) made an strong action-thriller with elements of science-fiction. This is one of Schwarzenegger's best films. Carl Weathers has a good supporting role as Dillon. Probably the most memorable work in the film is Oscar-Winner:Stan Winston's (The Terminator Trilogy, Jurassic Park Trilogy, Aliens) creative design work. The late Kevin Peter Hall plays the Predator. Since he's also best known for playing Big Foot in "Harry and the Hendersons".The two disc of Predator, the first DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an strong-DTS 5.1 Surround Sound (Also in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound). DVD has an running commentary track by the director, text commentary by the crew. Second Disc has plenty of featurettes, photo galleries and more. This is certainly one of the most memorable movies of 1980's. Don't miss it. Written by Jim Thomas and Johh Thomas (Predator 2, Executive Decision). Followed by a sequel, a spin-off titled "Alien Vs Predator". The spin-off also has a sequel coming out later this year. (****/*****).</fullReview>

With Arnie sparing us the one-liners, it turns out to be an entertaining yarn about a small band of crack commandos up against God knows what in the Central American jungle."Predator" also starred Carl Weathers of "Rocky" fame (he played Apollo Creed). Director McTiernan delivers something of a different action film with this one, and I personally really enjoy these sort of departures.We never do find out what the Predator actually is, but perhaps the sequel will tell us.

		<fullReview>This is in my opinion one of Arnolds best movies (ofcause after Terminator and Terminator 2), it is packed with action and big muscles from start to finish, and I like that about it, because we do not have that kind of action heroes anymore. No one is as big as Arnold or Stallone was in the 80's and 90's. Besides that the movie is exceptionally done, the music is great, but the sound editing is on top level. All of the sounds from the jungle can be heard all the time and the director gets the best out of it. The Predator is one of my all time favorite aliens, I simply like everything about it, it looks cool, it has personality and it even kicks ass in a cool way! The special effects are actually surprisingly good for its time. All in all just a great original action classic everyone should see at least once. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies, the plot is well written and this is perhaps one of Arnie's best performances. At the end of the movie it is really shocking to see the predator grab Arnie and hold him with one arm in the air, that if you consider Arnie being tall. I think there was no need of a sequel (at least one without Arnie). Other thing worth mentioning is that the special effects of this movie don't look dated even now if you take into account that this is a late 80's movie. The actors picked for the army squadron really made you believe they were part of the us forces. My favorite quote of the film "If it bleeds we can kill it!"</fullReview>

The Predator creature is a great idea, much better then watching Aliens. The Death scenes are amazing and very entertaining. Arnie does a brilliant job as the main lead, Glad he never made the boring Sequel. My favourite death scene is when Carl Weathers gets his hand burned off. I was looking forward to Alien V Predator, but was hugely disappointed. Part One was far more greater the the Second. This is one hell of a Entertaining movie and worth the price. The Second best Schwarzenegger movie after Terminator 2. Overall, a Must See for Arnie Fans.</fullReview>

What I think is so great about it is the fact that before 'Predator' there were films like 'Rambo' and 'Commando' which don't get me wrong weren't to bad but then they decided to make an upgrade, they added a killer alien predator.The actual predator in the film is also very well thought of, it's like the alien from the alien films but a lot smarter and with a lot more cool gadgets. Arney is also very good, he is like Rambo but with a lot more style and stronger.What made me think that 'Predator' was really good was the fact that they were a bunch of army men who thought that it would just be an easy, they just had to be the Predators hunting down a bunch of drug dealers which turned out that they were to become the pray. All of a sudden guns are blasting everywhere with no hope of predator which slowly kills each of them one by one.In conclusion, if you haven't seen 'Predator' then it is a must see for you and if you like real entertainment them you will love this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome To The Jungle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most popular sci-fi/military movies ever, Predator has stood as a crowd favorite for many years. By combining a great cast, awesome action and effects along with an interesting feeling of suspense, Predator has earned itself a place among classic sci-fi movies that has, with a bit of help from the Alien movies one way or another, inspired many movie directors and producers but has been tough to top.Predator is set in the place that the military are best suited for: the big, vast and deep jungle of Central America. Major "Dutch", played by Arnold Schwarzenegger leads a squad of commandos into the jungle to investigate mysterious disturbances, and being set up for another mission along the way. But they quickly realize that they are being hunted by what they cannot see, what they fear is the death of them, the Predator.While the plot of Predator may not seem much more than what you'd get out of your typical action flick it actually keeps you interested. This is all done thanks to the real star of the film, the Predator itself. The viewers, along with the commandos slowly learn what exactly the Predator is, how it acts and what they plan to do to stop it. Deaths are lost along the way however, until only Dutch and a young female hostage are left alive.Before the viewer gets the awful pleasure of watching each commando die one at a time they get acquainted with that very commando. It's how the viewer gets some form of connection with each of these beefy and dirty commandos that gives the movie a unique kind of feeling to it. Part of the connection that the viewer will get with certain actors varies from how they love the way they create humor or how they are impacted from the loss of a friend in the jungle. I might make the movie sound cheesy and sleezy but you have to watch it to understand what I mean.But it's not just passion for commandos that Predator tosses at the audience, no, it's more than that. There is a good share of action sequences in Predator to kick up some excitement for the audience. Most of the action in Predator involves our friend the Predator himself, and mostly as the commandos hopelessly attempt to mow him down with their guns. By the time the Predator does show his true form the viewer might be a little freaked by how ugly his face is, but glancing into his face can be frightening at first too.Not everything in Predator is perfect though. For one, some parts in the movie do drag on a bit and do diminish some of suspense gained in the movie. There are also a couple of moments the movie could've gone without, like the girl in movie could've been cut for some more assassination kills among the commandos. But Predator does its job in making these flaws seem less serious to its real score and they don't do much to flaw the movie.The love that this movie has received is well-deserved. By the end of a long struggle through the jungle against the Predator one has to wonder what it could've been like had they been Dutch fighting the Predator and fighting for his life. Fortunately that's what movies are for and Predator comes as good as they should be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen too many good action films to make a top ten list, but if I did, I'm sure this would be in there. Predator tells the story of an elite military team that goes into the jungle on a mission from the government, but they end up fighting for their lives against an intelligent alien creature that hunts humans for sport.The story and concept behind this movie are just awesome. Making a sci fi film into a hardcore action film is the coolest idea there is, which is why I like Aliens so much. There is non stop action in this film, and for action fans, it's a really fun ride. The Predator has to be the coolest otherworldly creature in the history of movies. The technology the Predator uses represents movie magic at it's best and most creative. Another cool part of it is that Arnold is in it. I mean, no matter how many times I watch this film, I'll never get over the fact that this movie is not one you'd expect to see Arnold in.Listen, the simple fact is if you're an action fan or a sci fi fan, this is definitely the film for you. You will love it. It's just one of those great American classics with great scenes and great quotes that will never go away.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never been so terrified of a "sci-fi" movie before or since. It borders on horror territory not only because of the gore and violence but the thrills and excitement leading up to each killing and following them. The writing and action sequences are damn good and each scene is packed with intensity and suspense. You wonder every minute, "Whose gonna get killed, skinned, and ripped apart next?" This may be Arnold's best performance after The Terminator. And the supporting cast was perfect. These guys (and girl) were money. They worked so well together and fit like a glove. Special effects are off the hook. For a 1980's film they were light years ahead of their time. It looks so realistic. And the fighting scenes are too. If you haven't seen this run down to the video store and get it or better yet just buy the new DVD version.</fullReview>

This film is scary, exciting, and possibly one of the best action sci-fi films ever made, along with others including aliens and independence day. The acting is tight and the predator sleek, foreboding and original in appearance. Which all make this a solid piece of cinema and not just a predictable sci-fi romp with a rubber alien. If you enjoy this then check out Predator 2 (Just as good), Alien vs. predator (Predator make-up not as good, but still solid) and aliens (What a movie).</fullReview>

After a while hell breaks loose, and I promise you wouldn't like to be in between there.Definitely one of Arnold's best efforts ever.

		<fullReview>For an action/horror film it has a pretty great plot. Basically a team of special forces (lead by the one and only Aronld S) gets into the jungle, and after completing their mission they find out that the enemy is not just the drugged up dudes they where sent in to kill. Its actually a 7.2 ft badass dreadlocked alien who comes to earth to hunt humans as a sort of 'becoming a man' trial who is tooled up with state of the art weapons and equipment.Not only is this movie great because of the directing (some scenes like will blow you away) but it has superb special effects, great acting and did I mention that the PREDATOR itself is sooo cool it hurts? I far prefer the PRED movies over the ALIEN ones but if your a fan of either, than watch this. Its better than the second (but in the second the pred gets some more ass kicking weapons)so watch them all if you want. Stan Winston has made a true monster that has terrified audiences for years.But whatever your taste in films is, watch this cause you will be shocked. A top notch film that has everything you could ever want from a film. Watch it thats all I can say, if you still don't know if you want to watch it, than sit through it at least once just to see the awesome predator fully at the end of the film; its one of the best scenes ever were the pred takes its mask off and you see the predators face in all its glory,it truly is awesome to watch!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie I was frightened, I couldn't speak after that. A true Hollywood thriller with a dark sci-fi action dimension.Predator (Spoilers******) Scripted by Jim Thomas and John Thomas tells the thrilling story of a rescue group who were set for tracing down a chopper which was shot down by the Guerrillas in the Central American jungles. During the mission they met with some strange happenings in the jungle. Finally all the members discovers that beyond their targeted enemies there is someone else behind all that strange incidents. What happens when that UNKNOWN starts to HUNT them all, brutally.Originally titled as 'The Hunter', director John McTiernan marks his first big budget movie venture in 'Predator'. A dark horror adventure thriller with the tone of science fiction. McTiernan did his best as a newcomer in Hollywood, by molding a new chapter in cult movies. He made a great balance for telling the struggle of a human against an alien. Arnold did a tremendous work for portraying the helpless mission leader. I like him especially on the last half, huh, seemed like he actually struggling for a help and this convincing aspect of the actor's performance helped maintain the film's awesome cult status.Predator's soul was created masterfully by Alan Silvestri. His score really add tensions to the storytelling. Also the great effort for giving life to Predator came from the late Kevin Peter Hall. Huh his expressions, those swift turns, that body language, that force full movements,I must say, He really lived in that character.Lastly how can any one forget that face of the Predator, the credits goes to one and only Stan Winston. I never see or even imagine such a face in my life, he did a masterpiece work by creating that animatronic ART. Those flickering teeth, sharp eyes, tied hairs, green blood WOW what a creation.All in all it's a great action-adventure thriller, a must see for young males like me. Yeah, if IT BLEEDS We can KILL IT ! I give this movie 8 out of 10. Predator = Exhilarator</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Predator; starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Shane Black etc, etc...Predator has got to be one of the best action flick that has ever hit the screen.A team of commandos are sent to Central America to rescue downed airmen from guerrillas. The leader, Dutch, and his team begin a successful mission, but soon... strange things start to happen. Something is not right.

The soldiers do not have a clue of what they're up against until one soldier of the team is slaughtered by this unfamiliar creature. Located deep in the jungle, the commandos are being told that they can't be evacuated anytime soon, which leaves the team nerve-racking. Things get worse when this intelligent hunter strikes back. The team now realizes that they're the ones that are being chased and then decide to capture the creature. When the plan fails, they run for their life. Eventually, Dutch is the only one left and he knows in order to survive, he has to face the predator... and now I'm not going to say anymore and let you enjoy this outstanding action movie.Rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Predator" is definitely my favorite film and I'm sure a lot of other people. I remember the first time I saw this film and my mind just like exploded because it was so well done and so action packed I became a HUGE Predator fan and kept watching it over and over. This movie was directed by John McTiernan and it was made in 1987. It takes place in the deepest parts of the Jungle where a group of commandos goes to retrieve US airmen who are being captive by gorillas/terrorists. they take out the terrorists and go to return back to their pick up location, but they are being hunted by an alien creature. The whole team has been killed by the monstrous Predator and only Arnold is left to finish off the beast and return home. Esepecially the Predator is my Favorite because he has dreadlocks, tons of weapons, he makes Arnold look like a midget, and he can turn invisible, and there are A lot more reason why I like the Predator but I'm sure a lot of you already know. I loved the whole end fight with Arnold and the Predator from where the Predator comes up from out of the water all the way to the credits. This film is definitely better then Predator 2 in my opinion because I liked the story plot a lot better and Arnold is like my favorite actor and to see him in a movie with my FAVORITE CREATURE is way beyond my belief. I also liked it much more then Alien vs. Predator but I did love the look of the Predator in Alien vs. Predator because of all the armour he had on and all the other different weapons he they had. But the Predator in Predator 1 by far had the best face out of all the different Predators. Stan Winston did an AMAZING job on the facial feature of the Predator and all of the designs to create such a magnificent creature that is now my favorite of all time! This is BY FAR John McTiernan's best film and I hope he feels the same way about it and I just was BLOWN away by this film and how well it was done. I have to give this movie a 10/10 because it is absolutely phenomenal and I love watching and I like every single bit of it and I suggest for those of you WHO HAVEN'T seen it, go out and rent it and you will have one of the best THRILL RIDE of your life!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is my all time favorite Arnold movie i like it better then the terminator movies. In this movie Arnold look like a Solider. He had the look the height and of course the muscle. Anyway this movie takes place in the jungle where Dutch (Schwarzenggar) is sent with his crew to destroy a gun camp. On the way they find some dead bodies that have been skeined. They think that the people from the camp did it so they go to the camp and destroy it. But on their way back all of a sudden a unseen cloaked creature starts killing the crew 1 by 1 they all go until Arnold is the only one left. I won't spoil the ending but what Arnold does to trick it is cool. This movie isn't worth renting its worth buying. to watch it over and over again.I give this movie 10 out of 10 because it's the best Si-Fi i've seen and has a few gory deaths.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of The Best Alien Hunter Movies Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One word AWESOME!!!!!!! Before I rave about this movie I'll give you the lowdown. A team of commandos (lead by the Governator) is lead to a South American jungle to rescue a downed chopper crew from guerrilla rebels. When they kill the rebels and take a girl prisoner they realized that the chopper was a surveillance bird spying on the guerrillas. On the way to their rendezvous point an unseen force is killing each of them one by one in horrible ways. When Dutch (Arnold)sees this "being" it is just a blurry outline. As soon as Dutch is the last one alive he shows himself as a masked alien warrior with dreadlocks. In a final climactic scene when Dutch seems to have the Preadator beat it removes its mask revealing it as an ugly lizard like creature with 4 mandibles. The predator activates a self destruct sequence creating a mini nuclear explosion nearly killing Dutch. Overall this movie is amazing. With action and suspense around every corner this movie is for every action AND sci-fi fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Action Film Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is the simply the greateset action movie ever. It fully embraces the idea that plot is secondary to muscle, machines, explosions, and excitement. Set in the jungle it takes the storyline of one person versus an unbeatable foe to the next level. It also captures Arnold at his finest: lots of action and little talk. In fact the whole second half of the movie has hardly any spkoen lines, but it still keeps your attention and inspires you to take on anything. The movie also has many now famous quotes like "I ain't got time to bleed", "Dillon!", "Old painless is waiting for ya", "Stick around", and "If is bleeds we can kill it". In addition to Arnold, Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke, and Carl Weathers all have career performances and many notable scenes. In all, this is one of the greatest movies ever that everyone who is a fan of action movies must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John McTiernan's Predator is a slick, gory thriller with a strong villain and an effectively played hero. Dutch Schaeffer (Arnie) leads a team of elite commandos into the Central American jungle to rescue a cabinet minister. Before long, his team discovers that it is being hunted by a mysterious alien--a being that has travelled to this planet to kill for sport.Pros: Gorgeous photography (helped in no small part by the beautiful Mexican locations); A brilliant creature design by Stan Winston; Nifty "cloak" effects; Thermo-vision; Tight, energetic direction by McTiernan; and a great score by the underrated Alan Silvestri.Cons: Highly irritating, overly macho commandos, entirely too convinced of their own "bad-assness"; Poor dialogue; Merely average acting; Jesse Ventura; Jesse Ventura; Some dated effects; Jesse Ventura.7/10 Good fun, but no match for the superior Alien series</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although "Predator" is by no means the best action movie of the 1980s (that would be "Aliens") or Arnold's best movie of the 80s (I'd have to say "Terminator"), "Predator" is still an excellent piece of work, and the blueprint for the focused pure action film. No time is spent on a meaningless romance (the downfall of many an action flick), or with long monologues or discussions. The film alternates fairly regularly between two types of scenes, suspense and action. As it progresses, "Predator" spends more and more time on the action scenes, but there is actually quite a long period in the beginning with no gunshots and no fistfights, only suspense setting up second and third portions of the movie: the attack on the guerilla camp and the ensuing attempt by the team to "get to the chopper," and the section from the waterfall to the end, where Dutch must fight the Predator. All the performances in this are more than adequate. Weathers is good as the former-soldier-now-businessman, Arnold portrays the limited array of emotions required--fear, anger, confusion, and resolution--just fine, and the rest of the players perform reasonably well in non-demanding roles. No commentary on "Predator" would be complete without a mention of two more things. First, the dialogue produces some amazingly quotable gems, usually said by Jesse Ventura. Statements like "I ain't got time to bleed" lend themselves to everyday conversation exceedingly well. Second, "Predator" has a scene in which more munitions are expended than perhaps any other movie not featuring D-Day. At least an acre of the jungle is just completely decimated, and that's just damn cool. In conclusion, if you're in the mood for an action movie, "Predator" will fit the bill in just about every way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A creature with a toothed vagina for a mouth is on the hunt.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Predator is one of those guy movies that I grew up on, so naturally I have an affinity with it despite it's minor short-comings. And the funny thing is, as I'm sure others have noticed, is that it features not one but two future US governors! What a great formula for an action film: Great characters that can actually act and not just sit there looking stupid, a beautiful and claustrophobic setting, mood-inducing score, and one of the coolest creatures ever created as the bad guy. Yes, the dialogue in spots is laughably bad but is to be expected in just about any film in the same genre that I can bring to mind. Luckily though, this is really only contained in the beginning. A decent script and excellent direction is really what sets this apart from most other action films, including some others that Arnold stars in. Had it not been for that, this could have been a real stinker, even with an amazingly cool antagonist.Stan Winston is a genius for coming up with the Predator design and effects. Although this film is not as good, the character itself has reached almost the same status as the "Alien" character designs. Everyone who's seen a few movies knows what the Predator is or at least can recognize it. I've always wanted to be a Predator for Halloween. Too bad the suits cost as much as a used car.Predator succeeds because it keeps it simple and to the point, while keeping you on the edge of your seat and by not asking for your forgiveness very often. Pop the popcorn, bust out the beer and enjoy. Classic action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predator in-depth comment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the great movies of the 80s in My collection that I think about all the time.May contain spoilers.In this second comment It will be an in-depth edition.The Predator films are awesome! It is extraordinary that such films were created about an alien monster that is a hunter with such a unique personality! I like the Predator movies because of the fact of what I mentioned above, the great stars that the movies consist of which a lot of the actors are really big men, the action is incredible, the special effects are phenomenal, and the music is just tremendous! In My opinion this score by Alan Silvestri is a classic and is one of the greatest ever! Below is an in-depth review of the characters in Predator!Arnold Schwarzenegger as Major 'Dutch' Schaeffer - Dutch is an intelligent muscular man. He has fought in other wars and this Guerilla battle that he and his team fought was no simple task. After the deaths of Hawkins and Blain and what Mac described to him what he saw Dutch knew to take this situation with extreme caution. Carl Weathers as Major George Dillon - The muscular Dillon is one Dutch's best friends. He joins Dutch and his team. Bill Duke as Sergeant 'Mac' Eliot - Though Mac maybe a nice guy but he also is no body to mess with. After he saw what killed Blain he lost it and from that moment on he made his own mission to kill what killed his best friend.Jesse Ventura as Blain - Big, tough, and strong is what Blain is all about. With his huge gun nothing stands in his way. Unfortunately what killed Hawkins shot Blain from behind. Sonny Landham as Billy - They don't come any braver than Billy, a muscular Native American Indian. He knows that something not human is lurking around in the jungle. After most of the commandos are slaughtered by the Predator Billy confronts this huge alien being one on one with his large razor sharp knife. Even with one hundred percent courage he is no match for this extraterrestrial beast.Richard Chaves as Poncho Ramirez - The smart commando is really handy at things. He speaks more than one language and can handle guns very well. When he got shot by the Predator's laser he was gone instantly.Shane Black as Hawkins - After chasing Anna through the jungle Hawkins found her but something found him and he just disappeared without a trace!Elpidia Carrillo as Anna - Anna was the lone survivor in the Guerilla camp. She is kept prisoner by the commandos but since she knows that something superior killed Hawkins right in front of her and that his body has disappeared she is asked by Dutch what happened and she tells him in English and is untied by Dutch.R.G. Armstrong as General Phillips - General Phillips, a long time friend of Dutch. He is an intelligent individual. He lets no man back talk to him! Sven-Ole Thorsen as Russian - This big Russian Guerilla is no body to mess with. He can handle just about any kind of fire arm with ease. He shot a prisoner that was tied up after kicking him hard in the stomach. Little did this large man know there was going to be a big surprise in store for the Guerilla camp.Kevin Peter Hall as The Predator - This being and his kind are one of the most intelligent life forms in the universe. The Predator is a giant reptilian humanoid. His visions infrared as he hunts unexpecting victims. He has great fighting skills and can be invisible. His laser mounted gun on his left shoulder is deadly and his right wrist blades are extremely sharp. The control panel on the other wrist is his most deadly weapon of all! I believe that there is other life in the universe. In fact, there's so much that we have yet to discover on our planet which a great example is Cryptozoology but when it comes to extraordinary things such as these subjects the planet Earth is a world of doubt and with that it can't know squat. This is all My opinion. Thanks for reading!Movie Nuttball's NOTE:If you like alien movies and/or the subject of aliens I also recommend the following films: The Thing from another World, The War of the Worlds, The Day the Earth Stood Still, The UFO Incident, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, John Carpenter's The Thing, Krull, Time Walker, My Science Project, Howard the Duck, John Carpenter's Starman, Mac and Me, Explorers, Invaders from Mars, They Live, Total Recall, The Abyss, Communion, Suburban Commando, Fire in the Sky, Independence Day, The Arrival, Mars Attacks!

		<fullReview>SPOILERS WARNING:This Scifi/action/horror/suspense is personally the greatest movie I have ever seen.Carl Weathers is fantastic.He went from being the slimming, and lean Appolo Creed. To a 6'2 behemoth body builder. Who's body comes in second only to the irrisputable king Arnold Schwarzenegger. Although some critcs doubted his acting and although I think (along with many others) that it was captivating. Who needs acting with muscles like those. Schwarzenegger was brilliant, the perfect commando. With muscles that could make any other actor look like a piece of French cheese cloth,And Jesse Ventura was classic as Blain.A typical testosterone charged tough guy.And was most people don't know about his famous one liner-"I ain't got time to bleed" was that it was actually the title of a book written by this former Navy seal. Bill Duke is terrifying,And plays the magnificent role of a soldier slowly losing his mind. Which eventually leads to his demise. But those aren't the only reasons this movie is cool.That fact that the first time I saw it,It was late at night all by myself in a dark room.I was nine years old and had just been allowed to start watching rated R movies.And it shocked me senseless.Upon seeing Jim hopper and his men skinned I nearly fainted I jumped out of my skin,And my heart nearly stopped when I watched Mac (Bill Duke)slaughter a boar with his bare hands and a Knife. I also liked it because it's the type of movie where anything go's. In other action flicks all the good guys always win. everybody go's home alive and well. But not this movie, In this movie you can't tell who will live and who wont. You Know that at any moment the character you've taken a fondness to could be slaughtered.And thats what keeps first timers on the edges of their seats. That and Elpidia Carillo who's presence and innocence slowly allure you into a false sense of security. And then theres the character of Poncho. look how much smaller he is than the other men and yet how much farther he gets. Even after nearly being crushed by a log. And one no bigger than the one that took out the Predator or Yjuata. And thats why this is the best movie ever. (And for those of you that are saying "He forgot Hawkins" I didn't-I'm just worried about exceeding my word limit. Although He was awesome to).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man, this is the most underrated movie on this database. Truly is, this is probably the best Science Fiction movie dealing with Extra Terrestrials there is. Arnold put's forth his best acting job in his best movie. The role required depth, and Arnold delivered that. Dutch if you really look at it, was a character who went through every emotion possible in this movie.The plotline, is absolutely unique, and classic Sci-Fi. I first saw this at 1 1/2 years old. And have been captivated by it ever since. An alien hunter venturing into the jungles of Central America to hunt humans. A Delta Force team going to rescue Hostages from a guerilla camp. Once Dutch and his men complete that objective they move onto the Rendezvous Point to get picked up by chopper and return back to their base. But instead the Predator (Yautja in proper terms) has different plans and slowly stalks the men 1 by 1.The movie is scary, has more then your fair share of classic one-liners, action sequences and special effects that even today are still amazing. This movie epitomizes Arnold Schwarzenegger, and is without question the most forgotten movie he has made. But yet is the best he has done.The end battle scenes and how Dutch "dupes" the Predator (I won't give that away) is just amazing. The kill scenes with the Predator, are also just breath taking!If you haven't seen Predator you must rent it. No don't rent it, BUY IT and save yourself the time and cash. I gauruntee you, that if you rent it, you'll just go out and buy it. Save yourself the effort. This movie didn't crack the TOP 250 or the TOP 50 Sci-Fi's, both of which are atrocities. This movie gets a 10/10 from me. ***** (5 Stars), I don't even have enough thumbs to give it as much thumbs up that it deserves!</fullReview>

The Predator is also in a number of video games, including "Aliens vs Predator" and its sequel. This is where the monster got his break!Also look for Jesse "the Body" Ventura.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why "almost" ? Because the first shot of the movie, showing a spaceship approaching planet Earth should be removed. It gives a key to the audience that spoils half of the suspense. I am not a war movie and a Schwarzie fan. I first watched this on TV, and I fortunately missed the 5 first minutes. I was sitting in front of my TV set watching what I supposed to be a Schwartzie war movie, saying to myself "hey man ! you are going to watch this flick until the end". But after ten minutes I was glued ! This is amazing how the movie turns slowly from stupid action to fantastic. You NEED to know more about this creature ... The suspense and action grows crescendo until the awaited duel. Excellent job. Very unexpected mood when you only refer to the title, the cast and the poster ...

		<fullReview>This film in many peoples eyes can be seen as your averige action film with an old idea of having an Alien killing them, but I for one see it as much much more. Predator`s plot is explained in the name, but it isn`t the big strong, gun loaded Arnold that will be doing the hunting, oh no its the technologically brilliant Predator, one by one this savage yet inteligent monster kills one of the members of Arnold`s team for sport, good thought was put into the making of this alien as it will only attack people that pose a threat(a weapon) (shown in Predator2) so if you see the sequel alot can be explained adding longetivity to the series. Perfomances are solid enough with a good share of acting to the team throughout, character development is good seeing as how the Predator rarely kills more than one, so the squad goes through encouragement, confidence, fear and yes death... The novel thing is Arnold Schwarzenegger is commonly known to have a high powered Rifle with a underslung grenade launcher, grenades, pistols, knifes etc etc.. and yes he does, but only through the first 1/2 of the film and is then made too make use of the jungle much like the Predator. throughout the film Dutch(Arnold) learns the predator only is able to view in heat vision! due too his mask, so Dutch gets in water to cool his body and smears himself in mud to appear no-where in it`s vision, then using spears, arrows and spike`s he battle sit out in a contest of wit and strengh. This movie is very speical too me because of its different view of a action film, though it may not be the next Silence Of The Lambs or Pulp Fiction it is a classic of this particular genre.overall: 9/10If you like either Predator, Predator2 or the Alien saga (or even if you dont) buy the games! it represents the two memorable speices very well and is fun (Predator2 featured an Alien skull that triggered a ongoing story between the two, a film is being scripted!.</fullReview>

Followed by a sequel. I think that the DVD release for this movie needed way more bonus material, because it sure grossed enough money, but the DVD transfer is quite good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A quality Schwarzenegger flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John McTiernan's (first real film) Predator is quite a quality action flick that is a lot like James Francis Cameron's Aliens (though Aliens and Predator have little to do with each other besides being outer space) by having a story that might not be the greatest, but when the action starts it is a grabber. Arnold and his team go into the jungle in this film as hired by USA and find themselves in the midst of beastly mayhem. Quite a thriller indeed, and one of Arnold's better popcorn flicks. Jesse "The Body" Ventura stands out as a soldier with little patience for blood shed. A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite nightcaps.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie for the fourth time yesterday, and it is now one of my "personal classics". My personal classics doesn't have to be great or classic, they just have to mean something to me, and the first time I saw it has got to me memorable.PREDATOR is such a movie. I always watch it late at night, since the first time I saw it I was 7 years old at 11 p.m (I was scared as hell).In action-terms, PREDATOR is a classic, compared to other movies in the genre it ranks high, and as an actionmovie it is a 10/10. But the rating can't be based on the fact that it is an actionmovie. If you love actionfilms this is your call. It's entertaining, trigger-happy and violent packed in a suspensful and mysterious enviroment. It has got special effects and Arnold. Now I'm not the hugest action-fan, but I still liked this movie and my rating is 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Predator is one of those films where if you haven't seen it for a while you really look forward to it, but are slightly disappointed after viewing. The suspense level is excellent and you can almost share the characters fear but there are a number of faults that break the films atmosphere and make you realize that it IS only a movie. For example, when Dillons arm is blown off and he turns around you can see his real arm sticking out of his jacket, and when Dillon and Mac are spying on the Pred and you can see the boom at the top of the screen. Nevertheless, Predator is definately one of Arnolds best and it uses excellent visual effects to achieve this. The man himself is also excellent and the end is a fantastic battle. Rent this if you like sci-fi, but don't make the mistake I did and pay good money for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the all-time classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Schwarzenegger redefined the action genre, owned the action 80s, and this may be his finest.It doesn't have as much campy fun gore as, say, The Running Man or Total Recall, but somehow manages to come off a little less serious than Terminator.But that said, it has remarkable tension, such that, years after the unknown element is removed, it still keeps you at the edge of your seat.As you may have read from all the other reviews, shortcomings aside, this is one fun flick. I liked the fact that the creature, which was the focal point of the film, was totally unknown to the "bad guys" who tricked Dutch and his team into going; the creature turned out to be a very unpleasant surprise even for Carl Weathers' character.I also liked the sinking feeling of doom as the team founditself in grave danger of an unknown, unseen threat -- it was a very good interpretation of what Vietnam might have felt like for those who never experienced the psychological terror of an unseen enemy in the thick of the steamy jungle.One thing that bugged me was that Dutch missed the creature when he had him in his sights -- I mean, crack commandos don't miss a life-and-death shot like that, do they? They should have directed an alternate reason for missing, like a little jungle animal behind Dutch causes the creature to turn his way or something...But, nonetheless, see it. Predator is one of the greats. Predator 2 is decent also, in terms of clarifying the purpose of the alien creature -- as much as we may feel hate for the alien creatures, low and behold, they show us what we, as humans, might look like to other creatures here on earth, when we hunt for sport. - should we hate ourselves as well?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are always movies that each of see while growing up that make us say "wow" and make us think that we are a part of something special. Sure "Star Wars" blew my mind as a kid, it still does today. But I have two words to say, Arnold and Predator. I remember the first time watching the film in theaters, I was about 9 years old and I had to beg my mom to take me. But that's enough about me, onto Predator. The movie is loaded with explosions, a kick-ass cast, and the coolest creature from beyond earth, ever. You know the usual stuff any 9 yr. old boy digs. We all know the story of Predator and some would say the "lack of story". There are a few what if q's about the plot, which are mostly answered in the lack luster sequel. But then again we're supposed to leave the theater wondering what if, right? The cast headed by Arnold does an outstanding job and the personalities of each character fit their look perfectly. The dialogue is harsh and to the point, in other words it's not for church girls. There are the usual Schwarzenegger one-liners and quite a few hysterical lines. The action in the movie builds up to a sensational ending that one will never forget. So, overall, Predator doesn't quite generate the type of buzz worthy of oscar nominations, it isn't as creative or overwhelming as "Star Wars", but it came out at the right time in my lifetime, when GI Joe was cool and when Arnold was at his prime, to be considered MY favorite movie of all time. And it probably always will be. Oh yeah, Arnold is the best actor of all time, well at least the coolest in my book.</fullReview>

Carl Weathers is the only character I don't care for - for some reason he's just not convincing as "Dillon" to me. The story line is basicly spelled out in the IMDb intro. The characters (less Dillon) come across as pretty believable to me, and the tension builds up pretty early and keeps building. You pretty much get the impression there's nothing Dutch &amp; Co cannot handle, up through the rebel camp (early on, this isn't a spoiler). At least nothing of this earth they cannot handle...Some of my favorite lines are "If it bleeds, we can kill it" and "Do you think you could have found something bigger?"</fullReview>

The movie goes into a litle depth about the characters, especially Arnold Schwarzenegger and Carl Weathers. But the best part of the movie was they didn't spnd 90 minutes trying to figure out what the alien was. All they wanted to do was get out or kill it. It was a very simple plot. That was what made the movie so good. They didn't waste time with trying to figure things out. They just did them. The dialogue was pure and simple. A simple action movie makes the best action movie.

It succeeds because it's a simple action thriller but every element is polished and used to perfection. The effects hold up beautifully. The suspenseful music score is a true classic and it's a shame that it hasn't been released on CD yet. The actors, even Arnie, are perfect for their roles. Director John McTiernan's shooting style and editing are dynamic and effective, still looking very very modern. In fact, in that respect McTiernan was ahead of his time. How many other movies from the 80s look like this? It's paced and shot like any modern 1990s/2000s film. Terminator 2 is a great film, but the dialogue, fashions, and effects have already begun to look dated. Sometimes, keeping it simple is better...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is, always has been, and always will be, one of my favourite films of all time. The concept of the film itself, the concept of hunting as a "sport" instead of a survival necessity, is very thought-provoking. It's been turned on its ear because for once, HUMANS are the prey, and not Bambi's mom. Save for a few technical discrepancies here and there, the film is extremely well-done. The plot and character development progress smoothly, and the cinematography is simply breathtaking at times. I don't care what anyone else says about the special effects; I still think they look pretty good, even by today's standards. The air of mystery that is maintained around the Predator itself is very effective in adding to the tense atmosphere of the film. No-holds-barred action and gunplay, relatively smooth dialogue, and good effects make this one for the ages. One of Arnold's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I watched Predator, 13 years ago, all I can remember is thinking it was a pretty decent film. Having, for the second time in the last couple of years, caught it on the TV, I feel now it is one of those forgotten, under-rated classics. It's timing was unfortunate, coming in Swartz's career just after his most memorable film Terminator. As such it will always be eclipsed by this previous classic. However, I would rate this movie as an easy 8 out of 10. It's not the classic that could get a 10 or a nine. The final part to the film is pretty cliched. But the atmosphere and suspense building up through the film sets it way above nearly all movies of its genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I am not usually a sci-fi fan, I did enjoy watching "Predator". I had no idea it was so old - maybe that's why I enjoyed it ! As other users have commented, we see the space-ship coming from the universe, but don't ever see it again. If it could get here, why can't it stick-around ?? AND - after all that gun-play at the camp where the "minister" is supposed to be prisoner, what actually happened to the other members of his party? Did I miss that ? The scene where they shoot-up the camp is good, although one wonders how did they have all those weapons AND enough ammunition to continue to fire thousands of rounds in the jungle, at something they couldn't see ?Director John McTiernan kept the suspense high and his actors busy, from Jim and John Thomas' script. Arnold ("Dutch") actually looked good, orange hair and all. Carl Weathers ("Dillion") was excellent in his role, although they could have left-out that arm-wrestling scene in the beginning. I suspect they had some phonies glued on Arnold's arms. Elpidia Arillo ("Anna") did what she could with all those macho guys. Bill Duke ("Mac") played his role well. Jesse Chaves ("Blain") also was good, as all the others were. Jesse Ventura was pretty good, too. The "creature" (Kevin Peter Hall) was imposing with his height and agility, but I DID see some human elbows between some of the plates.Camera-work was excellent, as were the locations. They added to the tension as the film progressed. I agree the cast did a good job showing the terror of being hunted, after so much gun-play as hunters. I don't think the writers could have put in anything else to show Arnold in all his splendor.Story-wise, not too bad. Because I waited so long to watch "Predator," and seeing the other sci-fi films mentioned herein before, I suppose it was no surprise to catch-on that "Dutch" would be the one to fight him face-to-face. I WAS surprised to see the 'copter was still in the jungle, after all that action. I remember, now, that I saw "Predator 2" first - I agree with all who liked "Predator" better.....it was better."Dutch" was right - "Predator" was not too pretty.....and he was smart. I must agree that he existed on the carnage he provoked; I was surprised there were no bananas hanging on the trees.This movie was well-done, considering when it was released. Not too many special effects......but I saw a long list of stunt-people. All-in-all, I enjoyed watching "Predator" - I had no idea it was considered to be a "classic".....gave it 10.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Schwarzenegger Entertainment!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Predator starts off not all that differently than many other action movies of the 80's. You have a U.S. military group sent into the jungle of some South American country on a rescue mission. Two points, set this movie apart from those others. The first is the idea of bringing in a unique alien that hunts these soldiers and picks them off one at a time. The "Predator" is unlike anything we had seen before. It's no wonder that this franchise continues to remain so popular today. The second point that makes this film so memorable is simply Arnold Schwarzenegger. Arnold is the master of action movies, the king of cheesy one-liners. He's the one guy that you could put in any movie, and you know he'll kick some serious ass. You're almost left feeling sorry for the alien in this movie, knowing that it's going to have to go up against Arnold. Predator has a great jungle setting, which enhances this suspense and the mood of the film. It is a superb blend of action and science fiction, and is enjoyable to watch anytime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a trailer doing the rounds on youtube at the moment for Alien versus Predator 2: Requiem that looks set to readdress everything that went wrong with the Paul W. Anderson directed first installment. Relentlessly gory and violent, it features exploding heads, children under attack from face huggers, a man's nose being burnt off by acid and absolutely masses of blood, guts and bad language. Aside from bringing worry to every puritan mother who lets their kids browse the web unattended, it also shows that with this new movie, a different approach has been taken. For one thing, the producers aren't throwing ideas across the board room table about how to update it for a new audience by making it suitable for children. It also seems as though the director has bothered to watch the originals before he set about making it. In short, it's just the sort of promotional material that gets anticipation building and is precisely why now is the right time to go back and watch Predator, the muscle bound and ridiculously violent rumble in the jungle that became one of the most loved action films of the 1980s.Considering that the film sees an elite commando team being hunted down and killed off one at a time by a ferocious alien monster, Predator's lineage is quite blatantly obvious. It's almost a missing link between the two Alien movies; blending the stalk and slash monster mash of the first with the Vietnam era machismo of the second. However, it also has enough individuality to stand on its own two legs, thanks to the appearance of two iconic individuals.First and foremost of these is Arnie. Good old reliable Arnie, doing what he does best; playing a really big guy with lots of guns who specialises in killing people. Dutch Schaeffer isn't a big step up from any of his other characters from the era: he has no convoluted back-story, no dark secrets in his past, but he is a professional and the absolute best of the best. How do we know this? Because Carl Weathers says so. And then he shoots a bunch of people. He's ably matched against the other icon: the Predator itself. Taking on a more humanoid form than the xenomorphs of Alien, the Hunter is a formidable presence. It stands at seven feet tall, dresses like a cross between a bodybuilding Samurai and a bondage model and its favourite hobbies include ripping the skin from its victims bodies and collecting skulls as trophies. Hell, it's so bad ass that it seems like the only opponent Arnie has ever faced that could conceivably kick the living daylights out of him. Not even the Devil managed that.They're backed up by a colourful cast of supporting characters, among them Carl Weathers, Sonny Landham and Jesse 'The Body' Ventura. Each is unrestrained machismo taken up to boiling point, especially Ventura, who spends most of the film striding around with a ludicrously big gun in his hands, chewing tobacco and reeling off swear words. Best of the bunch though is the character actor Bill Duke as Mac; the imposing man mountain driven mad by the heat and the violence.But there's a third hand at work in the proceedings who isn't so immediately visible: director John McTiernan, his generation's answer to Michael Bay. Considering this was only his second directing credit, he handles the project with remarkable skill. The explosive battle with the guerrillas is a barnstormer of the highest calibre, McTiernan filling the screen with massive explosions and a ludicrous body count. With that out of the way, he changes gears and the whole film shifts naturally into a chase through Central America. He may have a reputation for being most at home with chaotic gun battles, but the second half of the film is remarkably tense. As the commandos are pursued by a foe they cannot see, their bid for survival is packed with suspense.No surprise then that this film is so loved. It's ridiculously silly in every aspect. The men are so macho they're barely a step away from appearing in a gay bar's cabaret act. The violence is so outlandish that shooting people isn't enough, half the time they have to be on fire as well. And the guns are so big that in real life, some can only be used if mounted on the side of helicopters. It may be the Friday night beer and violence flick of choice, but it packs more iconic characters, quotable dialogue and downright cool sequences into it's 107 minute running time than Van Damme managed in his entire career. It's even got a few nods to the ambiguities of the Vietcong apparent in the unseen, alien enemy for cultural studies students to get their teeth into. The second round with the Aliens is due at the end of the year, but my money's on this guy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent action film; tense, suspenseful, and atmospheric</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the hands of a lesser director, "Predator" probably would have been another cheesy eighties sci-fi/action flick and it probably would have been remembered as such. However, in the hands of director John McTiernan (Die Hard, The Hunt for Red October), it is a sci-fi/action classic that nobody will be forgetting anytime soon. It is simply a better film than most that are similar to it, and it sets itself apart by being both technically more proficient, and far, far smarter than your average action film, and as a result it is one of the most entertaining films of all time. Though it can be enjoyed simply for what it is- a high octane, fast-paced, thrilling action film, "Predator" contains several references to other stories, in particular 'The Most Dangerous Game', which it could be called an adaptation of, and 'Beowulf' (the director's obvious interest in the story of 'Beowulf' led to him directing the feature film adaptation of Michael Crichton's Beowulf reworking 'Eaters of the Dead', known in its film version as 'The 13th Warrior'). It is creative and original in its reworking of these stories, as well as in itself."Predator" is so entertaining that some tend to overrate it. It is, no doubt, an excellent film, particularly when compared to many of the films in its genre, but that hardly makes it the 'flawless masterpiece' it is often called by its devoted legion of fans. Though the film is professional and of good quality throughout, the script can hardly be called perfect, featuring some of the most unintentionally hilarious moments in A-movie history. Also, though some of the acting is excellent, Schwarzenegger, even in action hero terms, is hardly the greatest actor to ever walk the planet. He is simply incapable of producing a performance similar to Sly Stallone in "First Blood" or "Rocky", or similar to Bruce Willis in "Unbreakable", or for that matter McTiernan's masterpiece "Die Hard". The cinematography and score more than make up for this however, and the action scenes are absolutely superb. McTiernan also makes the wise decision not to show the Predator in full for quite a while, saving the monster for the final sequences and adding a lot to the film in terms of tension and atmosphere."Predator" is a lot better than many people are willing to say it is and most certainly better than most films similar to it. It's atmospheric, tense, action-packed, and well directed. Though "Predator" can't be mentioned in the same breath as say- "Terminator" or "Aliens", it is one of the better action films of the eighties, and the Predator itself is a great, simply unforgettable villain.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Predator" may be one of the greatest, if not THE greatest, science fiction movie ever made, and there have been some really great science fiction movies. The idea of an alien being hunting not just defenseless civilians, but heavily armed mercenaries, and hunting them for pure sport, is, to say the least, original. To the alien, these mercenaries are nothing more than playthings to be toyed with and then transformed into trophies. First the mercenaries are baffled, then nervous, and then outright terrified as they come to the realization that their weapons are useless and their bravado a waste of energy against an entity far more merciless and powerful then they could ever imagine. And when the alien finally reveals itself, it's appearance is as gruesome as it's behavior is lethal. Why the alien is there is never answered, nor does it have to be answered because it's entirely irrelevant to story. The fact is the alien has arrived and is wreaking havoc on a group of heavily armed men whose efforts to respond are repeatedly thwarted. It's not as if they are defenseless; to the contrary, they WANT to fight, but this time they are up against something that they can't figure out and that is not afraid of them. How they deal with this situation and it's ultimate resolution is what this movie is about. It's nonstop action from beginning to end, and you can't expect any more than that from a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Major "Dutch" Schaeffer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) runs a ragtag commando troop that specializes in difficult search and rescue missions. They're called in to assist in finding an important diplomat in the Central American jungle, but there may be more to their mission than meets the eye. As if a human-fueled plot twist isn't enough, there just may be something not quite human and not quite friendly waiting in the jungles, as well.The first half of Predator is a fairly standard actioner/war film. The second half veers more into sci-fi/horror/thriller territory. It's an interesting combination, and succeeds in the end, but a few flaws keep getting in the way.At times, the script is self-consciously cheesy (how about those gratuitous Flex Magazine-styled shots?). Although I'm usually a fan of cheese, it doesn't always work here--it's both too overt and too infrequent. Another problem is that the script is occasionally too weighed down with mumbled jargon that's meant to situate the characters in a "real world" with an extensive history, but which viewers would be hard-pressed to make heads or tails of. There are also a number of plot developments, including character decisions, that make little sense if you think about them much, but on the other hand, the film is basically an excuse for an extended game of hide and seek, punctuated by explosions, dismemberment's, and so on. There isn't much of a political subtext, despite the fact that the film features not just one but two future governors blowing the crap out of various people, buildings and trees with high-powered weapons and frequently calling opponents "m-f'er".Also, the film works best initially if the viewer doesn't expect the developments of the second half. But director John McTiernan spoils the surprise to an extent with repeated "heat sensor imaging" cinematography. Many viewers will wonder what the heck those shots are supposed to be--it has a tendency to pull them out of the film. The film probably would have worked better with a more abrupt change of genre ala From Dusk Till Dawn (1996).But, believe it or not, I liked the film on the whole (although I have to say that I wanted to like it even more than I did). McTiernan very effectively builds up suspense as soon as our team of rag-tags enters the Central American jungle, and the first big action blow-out is exciting, even if I couldn't tell who was shooting at who or why half of the time.And that's nothing compared to the suspense created during the hide and seek phase with the predator. Everything is amped up enough in this section that I didn't usually care if our characters uttered dialogue that made little sense or took actions that seemed ridiculous. I was just geared up to see more stuff blown up and disfigured. The predator itself was superb, from its look and accoutrement's to its behavior, thanks to actor Kevin Peter Hall. Even the predator's "music" was great--that rhythmic sound accompanied by a synthesized drone--it reminded me of the musical theme of the Master of the Flying Guillotine (1975). By the climactic showdown, I had pretty much forgiven the film of any and all flaws--I was with McTiernan all the way.The film is really only worth watching if you're in the mood for a somewhat clunky auctioneer/horror flick with little in the way of comprehensible plot development, but most of us get in the mood for such fare frequently enough, and at those times, Predator just might hit the spot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hunters Become the Hunted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie begins with a helicopter carrying a unit of 6 mercenaries into Guatemala for a meeting with an American general who wants to use this group to rescue a high ranking diplomat who has been kidnapped by revolutionaries and taken to a secret jungle hideout across the border. Although the leader of the group, "Major Alan 'Dutch' Schaefer" (Arnold Schwarzenegger) doesn't particularly like the fact that an outsider by the name of "George Dillon" (Carl Weathers) is assigned as the leader of the team even though the two have worked together in the past. His suspicions are further raised when he learns that some of the things he was told during his initial briefing weren't necessarily accurate. However, his suspicion turns to shock when he discovers that someone?or something?is hunting his group and killing them one-by-one. Now rather than reveal too much of this movie I will just say that this was a decent science-fiction film for the most part with the action being definitely showcased above everything else. Admittedly, the suspense wasn't sharp as it could have been and the script was quite basic as well. But then, considering the cast I suppose this shouldn't come as a complete surprise. In any case, this movie was still enjoyable enough as far as action films are concerned and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Predator is a really good film and me being not the biggest Arnold fan he done a good job with the film and is one of his best. The movie is a good attempt at a science fiction styled action film and the acting is alright not brilliant and what about predator he has a good and yet scary feel to him. The setting was prefect in the middle of a jungle and seeing Apollo Creed and the Terminator fight predator was cool and that's how I watched this film. The characters were good you feel bad for them when they start getting hunted by the predator.The plot involves Arnold and a team of soldiers going to the jungle to get some women then they starts getting killed by the predator but most of the film is kinda boring to see Predator stalk them for an hour then kill them in the last forty minutes.It is a basic action script mixed with science fiction elements and I would give the movie a try it's good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start with Predator is one of the most well known and loved action movies of all time and it was even nominated for an Oscar! To be honest for a bit silly macho flick is awesome and after seen it, I understand the reason for that. Simple put is a movie made for Men, which have became an endangered specie nowadays.Apart from the usually prays I want to give you guys a lesser known fact about the way Predator came to been.To keep it short ,in 1985 after Rocky 4 someone, as the story goes, joked that in Rocky 5, Rocky would have to face an alien because he had run out of opponents to fight with and the producers of Rocky 4 Jim and John Thomas took this abused idea and made a movie out of it. For real this is the true story. This in my point of view the definition of a fantasy of one man is the reality of an other. Now go spread the word and use this story as a tool to silence everyone who says that ideas don't work in real life.</fullReview>

There was no political correctness back then, and Jesse "The Body" Ventura could say whatever homophobic comment that occurred spontaneously to him, with impunity, even though even then it made him look like a macho piece of trash. You shall enjoy intentional close-ups of Arnold's impeccable pecs, unabashedly Native American stereotypes (Billy's medicine bag and tracking abilities), African American assumptions ("gonna have me some fun, gonna have me some fun"), and even the token Asian from First Blood Part 2 ("You no expendable Rambo"), and still you will cheer Arnold as he fights the Predator. And finally, in your White, privileged, entitled and presumptuous world, you will undoubtedly endlessly repeat the choice sayings to your White friends and family members: "Do it, kill me I'm here," and, "Billy, what is it, what's out there?" And as you lay on your deathbed, you won't wonder about the racism and sexism you've promoted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't count how many times I've seen this movie, which I first saw about five years ago and I still haven't gotten tired of it and it's still up there with my favourite movies of all time. In fact, to me, this is Arnold Schwarzenegger's best film, next to Terminator 2: Judgment Day and the best film John McTiernan ever directed even though I still think Die Hard was brilliant as well. I'm surprised that this movie, when it was first released, got negative reviews from critics but apparently it was popular with audiences and is now considered an action/sci-fi classic. In fact, I think this film deserves to be on IMDb's Top 250 list. I know it has some similarities with the other sci-fi movie, Alien like a creature from another planet kills off the characters one by one until it's up to the main protagonist to take it down but I don't really mind that. But not only has this film have great action sequences but it also has good characters besides Schwarzenegger's Dutch, but also like the silent and mysterious Billy (Sonny Landham), the tough mini-gun commando, Blain (Jesse Ventura) and the psychotic Mac (Bill Duke) and of course the deadly hunter alien (Kevin Peter Hall, RIP). The film also has a lot of memorable quotes like "Any time", "I ain't got time to bleed" and of course "Get to the chopper!". It's just a pity that this film didn't get any decent sequels like Predator 2 or the Alien vs. Predator movies (which I haven't seen thankfully) but the most recent sequel Predators was good enough but it wasn't anything special and sometimes you can't beat the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An alien pod lands on earth. Meanwhile, a special ops team is brought in to rescue a cabinet minister on a downed helicopter in a remote jungle rebel territory. CIA agent Dillon (Carl Weathers) calls in his friend Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger). Dutch's team usually works alone but Dillon insists on joining the group. As soon as they reach the crash site, it's obvious to Dutch that Dillon isn't giving them the whole truth. They find mutilated bodies of Green Berets hanging upside down. They attack the guerrilla compound and take Anna (Elpidia Carrillo) prisoner. However Russians with the guerrillas are the least of their problems.This is simple 80s action fun. It's got the prerequisite great campy lines but it's not only Arnold that gets to deliver those lines. Jesse Ventura has "I ain't got time to bleed." It's also a great start to the franchise. There is one thing that critics seem to miss at the time. The title of the movie is predator. The alien is a big game hunter. It's not a war or else the predator would just nuke the place. He skins the Green Berets like somebody on a safari. The plot is super simplistic. This is all fun and all action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If it bleeds, we can kill it..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Predator is regarded as one of the most well-known action movies of the 80's &amp; certainly one of Arnie's best performances. It has everything you would expect from a classic 80's action flick, explosions, guns, blood, suspense &amp; classic one-liners from Arnie! Arnie and his team of commandos are called in to assist with a rescue mission in a Central American Jungle, a helicopter has gone down and they are sent in to locate any survivors. Before long they become targeted themselves by an alien hunter which starts killing them off one by one.The scenes before we see the Predator are very iconic and it is at that moment that you realise it is not your standard action flick. The first time we are introduced to the Predator is from its point of view. The crew of commandos will be down on the floor of the jungle and then it will switch to an infrared point of view from a birds eye location, watching them from the trees. You are shown the predator watching the humans, whilst making quite disturbing noises and breathing sounds. They are very effective scenes that add suspense and a nervous feeling to this movie. One thing which is done very well is that the Predator is not revealed too early, it is not fully seen until around half way into the movie. This does a great job of adding suspense and a 'we are more scared of what we can't see' effect.The gore is just about right also, there is enough gore to show you how vicious the Predator is but it is not over the top. There are no real stomach turning scenes. Arnie does a good job, as does Bill Duke, other members of the cast can be quite annoying or simply drift into the back ground and aren't really cared about once they start getting picked off by Predator.The story line is Interesting and it adds something different to a standard Arnie action flick. If you like this genre then you have probably already seen it as it is regarded as a classic. It's not really a genre that I have a large interest in and this is why I haven't seen it until now! 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And if that day comes then I'll be very happy. Nearly 25 years on and 'Predator' is still as fresh and gripping as it was in the eighties. Simply, everything works. If you don't know the plot (then you've probably been hiding in the jungle trying to avoid head-hunting monsters) it's about a team of commandos (lead by Arnold Schwarzenegger at the height of his fame) who get stalked by a particularly nasty alien hunter.Put simply... if you're a fan of either/or action or science-fiction then you'll love this. But what makes it work when so many similar films have come and gone and been chalked up as nothing more than glorified copies? First of all is Arnold - an actor not always known for his acting abilities, but, when it comes to looking tough and firing guns (let alone mud-wrestling aliens) there can be no one better. His team, although never really given much screen time to really establish their real personalities, are also equally likable. Then there's the plot. There isn't really one. It's so simply, it barely needs explaining, i.e. alien vs soldiers in jungle (there are some sub plots about deceiving and male bonding, but they're over before you realise they're getting in the way of things). The creature itself is impressive. It was the first on screen baddie to really make use of 'invisibility' and its movements are all very 'alien' and different to anything ever before it. Then you have the action: it's pretty relentless. The direction is simple and effective all the way through. It doesn't need today's flashy 'MTV' style editing to make it look cool. It is cool all by itself.The film's marketing tagline was, 'Nothing like it has ever been on Earth before...' and, in some ways, that could describe more than just the movie. There has never been a sci-fi action film as pure as Predator and anything that follows it will always have to pay homage to this - the original. Its successors (i.e. Predator 2, Alien vs Predator 1 and 2 and Predators) are all reasonable, but, even though they're about the same alien, they will never truly match up.Like sci-fi? Like action? Then you've probably already seen Predator. If you haven't - then do it, do it NOW!!!</fullReview>

I'm referring, of course, to Arnold Schwarzenegger. (Yahahaha. Just joshin' ya.) Like the Sword and Sandal movies of Old, PREDATOR features a bunch of muscle-bound men versus an even larger Monster. Testosterone doth ooze from the very pores of the players as they glisten their way through the jungle to their varied Ends. The title Monster himself is one of the Great Ones, and director McTiernan makes excellent use of him/it. Beautifully shot, with some truly great action scenes.

		<shortDescription>Often Imitated But Never Duplicated, Predator Stands In A League Of Its Own.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most enjoyable, quotable, entertaining, exhilarating &amp; testosterone-filled action extravaganzas of all time, Predator is a strong shot of adrenaline that fuses action, adventure, science-fiction, horror &amp; thriller into one and is delivered with such remarkable finesse that even after two decades &amp; countless imitations, its ass-kicking experience has never been duplicated.Set in the jungles of Central America, Predator concerns an elite special forces team of six who are ordered in to assist a CIA officer on a rescue mission which ultimately turns out to be a ploy. But the deception soon becomes the least of their concern when, on their way out of the jungle, they find themselves being stalked &amp; hunted by something that's not of this world.Directed by John McTiernan, the film opens with a brief prologue after which it travels the road of an action-adventure feature for a while but over the course of its runtime slowly, steadily &amp; seamlessly transitions into an impressive sci-fi horror that ends up succeeding on all fronts. The idea is incredibly original, the premise is highly intriguing, the setting is absolutely fitting &amp; the casting is pitch perfect.The screenplay may not have that immense depth of characterization but the simple basics of it is able to provide each character their distinct personality without causing any distraction when they're working as a team. Cinematography expertly uses the atmosphere of jungle to its advantage and with its controlled panning shots manages to pull the viewers in as, just like its characters, we also try to look harder for something lurking somewhere in those trees.Explosively paced from start to finish, it never lets the viewers settle down for a moment &amp; gets busy with its main plot as soon as all its characters are introduced. Add to that, editing wonderfully arranges the predator's point of view shots with those of its characters without ever stepping over the line. Visual effects still holds up pretty well, sound is cleverly used &amp; Alan Silvestri's spectacular score effortlessly adds a sense of impending doom to the whole narrative.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke, Shane Black, Sonny Landham &amp; Richard Chavez, led by none other than Arnold Schwarzenegger. The lean &amp; muscular bodies of these actors ends up being an impressive entity in itself for it adds more meat to the badass characters they play while also improving their physical presence in the picture. And their overall interaction with each other is simply flawless.As for the creature itself, it's cleverly imagined by the writers, expertly designed by Stan Winston &amp; wonderfully mimed by Kevin Peter Hall on the screen. On an overall scale, Predator is one of the finest examples of quality filmmaking in which each aspect works in perfect harmony with the other to deliver a cinematic experience that's damn satisfying in every manner &amp; retains its high quality no matter how many times you watch it.A genuine classic, a genre masterpiece &amp; one of my favourite films of all time, Predator is a must for every action, sci-fi or horror fan out there. One hundred percent recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is hard to see how this action sci fi treat could possibly be improved. 17 years after it's release, and it has not dated AT ALL. It still stands out as a masterpiece of the genre. Action sci fi today should beware of being compared to this gem. I think it is the best work Arnie has ever done. Yes of course it is a simple role. Not much nuance here. But given this range to play with, he is utterly convincing. Nobody could have replaced him. He was perfect for it. If you had to pit one human being against a deadly super advanced sadistic alien hunter, who better than Arnie as a ruthless world class mercenary? Also, This is a real film, not a cartoon, despite the subject matter. The scenes in the jungle are highly atmospheric, the dialogue perfectly executed, it's all just exactly as it should be. The music, the special effects, and the battle sequences are delightfully crunchy and satisfying. Just a happy coincidence that it all came together this way I reckon. Right people, right time. It would be ruined if they tried to do it today. Oh wait, they did, and they did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I re watched this movie for the 100th time a few days ago, and I must say it is still my favorite action movie from 1980s. The story is somewhat irrelevant. Marines sent into the jungle to rescue some other marines, just to find out they are being hunted by an alien. The reason why this movie is so great are the cast, the direction and the effects. The cast is a great mixture of different characters that all add to create a great balance between serious military guys and hilarious ice breakers. The marines are lead by Arnold, which in this movie gives one of my favorite performances of his career. The direction is fantastic. John McTiernan probably better known for Die Hard did in my opinion an equal job with directing this movie. I believe that John McTiernan manages to create an action movie with great suspense, a frightening atmosphere in a jungle setting and still makes these actors deliver believable dialog. The effects are probably what this film is best known for. Creating an invisible alien in 1987 was a great achievement, and I still think it looks great today; The movie really ages well in my opinion. The predator is a believable character, and a serious threat to Arnolds character.To sum up this review. This is a great action movie that even after 27 years. The effects are top notch, the cast is funny and over the top in a good way. I will still stick around (pun intended) for another 10 years to watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proof of Greatness *SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Careful, there are spoilers in this review. If one would need to sum up "Predator" in one word then the first word to present itself to me is greatness. This movie single handedly shows the strength and uncanny ability that Arnold had to rain supreme among action stars in the 80's, throwing him up with names such as Sylvester Stallone (Rambo) and Bruce Willis (Die Hard) to clime the charts. Plus, just to top all of this, not only is there one former governor in this movie, there is two! Threw out this movie you are able to see Arnold at his best with a performance so strong it will leave you crying and asking what happened at the end of his current films. As the move pushes on you also begin to see the strength of the rest of the cast with large names such as Carl Weathers and Jesse the Body Ventura. You also are able to relive famous quotes like, "Get to the chopper" and "I ain't got time to bleed." To further proof it's superiority both among the movies of the 80's and of movies in general you will see the popularity it still holds and the strength to create and entire universe around it. And though it spawned some god awful sequels it is still able to bring forth a kind of primal fear that many movies now a days are missing. A fear powered by a creature unseen or unheard that stocks the night and proves his backbone threw taking the lives of Arnolds team. And along with all of this there is also the ending the blows you away. From the Predators laugh that shatters the night to the blood curdling scream that Arnold delivers that shows he's finally tapped into his primal rage. Every scene will keep you one the edge of your seat hoping for more and watching the movie deliver ten fold. This truly is one of the greatest 80's action movies of all time. I give the movie a 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Quotable Schwarzenegger Ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Predator" is in every sense of the word, a 1980's action fans wet dream. Most definitely a lot of one liners spawned from this movie, which has the styling's of a 1950's Sci-Fi classic and a typical 1980's slasher yarn.The film is obviously quite over the top. I find the pacing boring and almost unbearable during the first half. What begins as a movie about a small group of ragtag, testosterone guerrilla fighters, eventually becomes a fight for survival against an alien created by Stan Winston, with input from James Cameron (True story).Arnold is delightfully cheesy as always, and he really is the only reason to see this movie for all his one liners and the final battle. I guess I should mention Carl Weathers as well and the fact Shane Black wrote part of the flick (Uncredited), who obviously went on to great success with "Lethal Weapon", and a string of Hollywood blockbusters.Final Verdict: The "Predator" franchise has always felt no more than classic B-movie serials, but therein lies the charm and the reason they have endured for so long. 7/10. It's a lot of fun when you don't take it too seriously, but I just don't have a lot to say about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Action Classic of the 80's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Predator is a classic film, that is a fact. The franchise is strong, even if the films and games are not the best materials produced. The original Predator is a beautiful example of how action films ran in the "1980's". There is no doubt that this film has left an impact on the history of cinema. The action is non-stop, the suspense is thrilling and the characters are rememberable and spew some of the best one-liners ever. Arnold is himself in this movie, which is given. That those not make the film bad, however. The only issues that I can deduce is the lack of character development. I understand that this certain genre of film does not need a well developed story and character, but it would do the film some good if it had. All in all, it is worth a watch and a re-watch, for its monster and its killer action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is there a more iconic hunter in Science Fiction history than the Predator? The answer for me is, no. The creation of such an original alien species has never been matched. An extra-terrestrial warrior that has the power to kill and flay the skin off steroid filled war marines and use camouflage to sneak up on its enemies. The film takes place in a Central American jungle where a group of commandos are hunted by a mysterious killer. The killer meets its match in the form of Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger)who finds weaknesses in The Predators hunting techniques and tries to exploit them. The film is a true action thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. It is a true Sci-Fi classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania.Gona be short here, you all have probably seen this film, many times, so just wanted to throw my two cents - it's a genre classic. Everything works in this film, effects, characters, atmosphere. Ye, the atmosphere is so good in this movie, you always feel tension, it always there. This movie has aged so well, it's better then the first Terminator, and on two Arnies best movies ever (after T2). The creature is unforgettable example of effects, S.Winstons best. Hope nobody will ever try to remake it - it would be an assault to classic. Watch it again, it rocks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnum Opus!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best action horror sci-fi flick of all time, with everything it had to fail it actually succeeds. This was in the 80's when action stars and action flicks ruled the world. Most of them have now all been forgotten but not 'Predator' which has proved to stand the test of time by spawning a series of other productions from it's franchise.It had a pretty thin plot to start with, an actor who has a terrible accent and cannot act to save his skin in the lead role which all resulted in a lot of negative comments from movie critics. Even so with such uncertain frolics 'Predator' became an all time classic in its own right and this is how.This is the very first and probably last movie where the audience would get to see a terrified and scared Arnold Schwarzeneggar. Despite his marchioness and similar tough guy roles he plays in movies this is one movie where he was actually overpowered and as the audience you actually feel sorry for the guy. Arnold plays 'Dutch' a character ripped straight out of 'Commando' but the difference here now is the movie is not about 'Dutch' but rather about the creature. 'The Predator' itself is an iconic piece of work created by 'Stan Winston' and it deserved that academy award nomination. The monster with mandibles will give you the creeps, horrifying beyond imagination and its design is that of an impressive alien warrior straight out of the comic world. Not to forget the hi-tech weapons, agility and thermal vision, I mean need I say more. This movie spawned a lot of imitations that didn't come a step close to the original masterpiece.The other success of the movie is the fact that there is no horror at the beginning of the movie up until towards the end which was a style later adopted by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez in 'From Dusk Till Dawn'. It works well as it keeps you unsure of whether it is another 'Commando' movie or there is something here really worth watching. Truly the best of Arnold Schwarzenegger movies not because he outdid himself but simply because the movie was about the creature rather than the commandos. It goes straight to the point and there are no background story lines about the lives of commandos; like who they are and where they come from, which is really not necessary because the style of directing that doesn't leave any room for the equation. Moreover it was the haunting music of Alan Silvestri that shocked the critics and the audience, which comes at the perfect time and place and seems absolutely matched well to the 'Predator'. Who can forget the overwhelming presence of Kevin Peter Hall whom now other predator actors are failing to reach his bulk and fill in his shoes in later productions. More and more 'Predator' versions of nowadays seem a bit less bulky and extra skinny as compared to the original 'Predator'.'Predator' does so well with so little and the whole concept of a group of macho commandos in the jungle going against an unknown terror is just mind blowing. This makes Predator stick in your head even after seeing it for many years. It can hold its ground if it's pitted toe to toe with the best sci-fi action horrors of now.Worth a watch!!! Truly exceptional</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that gets better as it goes on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating-8/10Predator is a well known Sci-Fi film that is also a very good film and possibly Arnold Schwarzenegger's best ever film. With some great action and a solid display from actors we thought couldn't do such things, Predator is a film that people can enjoy for decades to come, here is why I thought that Predator was a very good film and enjoyable.The story is fast paced and a testosterone filled thriller that is full of pumped up fighting, giant aliens and a cast that aren't afraid of getting there hands dirty. Yes it is all fun and fun it should be, don't think too much about the acting in this and the story comes alive and by the end it will leave you wanting much much more. Finally if you like a film with a little action hide and seek then this is definitely for you.I felt Arnie does a solid job in this film and is one of his best roles ever, no surprise as his massive frame fits perfectly with the lead character who's strength is tested all the way through the film. The supporting cast are good too and the team get along well although another good thing is they have different roles, like Arnie is the leader obviously and Carl Weathers is the rational voice of the group etc. Finally if you like a super team of action fuelled thrills then this is for you because it is fair to say the entire team are massive guys. The script is pretty average if not poor but the film in a sense isn't about the script really, directed well though and I felt the film has a nice flow to it and everything is put in the right place etc. The effects are poor but what do you expect from a Sci-Fi film in the 80's, they work enough not to be funny but what I like is the costume the Predator uses which is some great work on that, and is generally very scary also, again it makes you want to see more of the beast in a sequel(which it got).The film is very good but parts such as the beginning can be slow and mundane and only into the middle section do we finally get some good action a generally fun film. The acting isn't the strongest and some very cheesy lines are put out there and some really quite over dramatics from Arnie towards the end. I didn't like the effects but as I say they didn't have the technology so I will them the benefit of the doubt with that one.People who will enjoy this I would say action fans, people who like big guns, big muscles and big aliens will love this and could be one of your favourites of all time. If your looking for sophistication then this isn't for you as it is just one big compilation of thump. It is a good length for a movie, not too short and not too long and so the action doesn't get dated, and the story doesn't drag too much either so it is all good.Overall I give it a 8/10 just about a Very Good film, it is nowhere near being a Great film but I did feel it got away from just being straight good and of course was very good. Watch it and savour it, and with a sequel also I think you will want to see more of this series of films and really enjoy the thrill that is Predator the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The hunter becomes the prey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>?Predator" is a classic action/science fiction movie and a worthy rival of ?Alien". It's not as arty as Scott's movie , but it has other qualities. You could say it's a mix of "Aliens" and "Commando" . It's action movie , horror and science fiction in one. It's definitely one of the most popular Hollywood blockbusters in history. It could be very easily a dumb b-class action movie , but thankfully it was done by professionals and remains one of the best movies of 80's and best movies ever.The original concept for this film originated as a joke. Someone said after watching "Rocky 4" that Stallone's next rival in "Rocky 5" will be an alien , because the defeated all human opponents . The mandibles of the predator were the idea of James Cameron ("Terminator"). Interesting thing ? Jean Claude Van Damme ("Bloodsport") was cast to play Predator , but he was quickly fired and replaced by Kevin Peter Hall ? experienced actor who played many monsters in his movie career thanks to his impressive height.It's a true macho movie full of manly men and no love story in it. There is no substance here , just pure adrenaline. Who could forget great one liners such as "I don't have time to bleed" or "If it bleeds , then we can kill it" and . "Your one ugly motherf****r" .The heavy artillery is also cool - ultra-destructive Gatling gun or Predator's blades and shoulder gun. Add to that a great jungle that gives a true claustrophobic feel to the movie. It's probably the best jungle in the history of cinema. Funny thing ? the whole movie was made in studio.Most people remembers Arnold performance here with the classic and incredibly funny "Get to da choppa" and "Stick around" one-liners. The truth is this is one of Schwarzenegger best performances . His low-key performance works really well and he is definitely a man who could defeat an alien hunter. There is also great ensemble cast here that includes : Carl Weathers (Apollo Creed from "Rocky" series) , Bill Duke ("Commando") , Sonny Landham ("48 hours") , Shane Black (writer of "Lethal weapon" series) , Jesse Ventura (" The Running man") and the Predator itself ? Kevin Peter Hall ( "Harry and the Hendersons"). Watch out near the end of the movie ? you will see Kevin Peter Hall without the costume (he plays a black helicopter pilot at the end of movie).Director John McTieran directs the movie with astonishing suspense and brilliant pacing , something he also shows in "Die hard". Alan Silvestri's legendary musical score also helps to keep the tension and makes sure that the audience are on the edge of their seats at all times. . The jungle as I've already mentioned is a very original and great setting for the movie.The Predator's unmasked face is a real accomplishment in make-up effects , just like the whole invisibility trick rightfully deserved the Oscar nomination for best visual effects. The Predator itself is a fascinating creature, scary and full of mystery. A worthy opponent of Alien indeed.The only bad thing is the fact that the movie never really explains what Predator was doing in the jungle and we didn't get to see Predator's ship . The ending also leaves much to be desired in terms of believability , but that's a minor issue."Predator" is a simple movie with simple plot done in wonderful way. It holds very well on repeated viewings . It has likable heroes , great villain , catch dialogues , memorable scenes and overall it's a top notch entertainment. I give it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It gets the job done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is generally a mixed bag. Arnold Schwarzenegger, while not always the best actor, provides a very decent performance and it wouldn't be a Schwarzenegger movie without his classic one liners, "GET TO THE CHOPPA!" And, "If it bleeds, we can kill it." But it isn't just Arnold here, the other squad members do provide some very crude, but funny, humor and actually have some other memorable quotes as well. As a bit of an actor, director, stop motion animation filmmaker, and writer, I can say that this is a solid Schwarzenegger movie. Now would it be completely tolerable without Arnold? Well, maybe but if Carl Weathers wasn't in it as we'll, this movie probably would have faded into the huge cluster of 80s B horror movies. The plot isn't really Oscar material though, I really think this movie was generally focused on the predator, ironically more than the box office machine Schwarzenegger. I admire this film though it is pretty well paced, except I thought most of the squad was kinda picked off quick. I proudly admit that I have this film on DVD and I love it, in fact I have been thinking about making my own little predator movie here using a mask I recently got. So I am going easy on this one cause I have loved the predator since I was a kid. If you watch this it will make you a sexual tyrannosaur.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Predator is one of the best Schwarzenegger films out there!Schwarzenegger plays the character of Dutch, whom is in charge of an elite special forces commando squad consisting of Mac, Blain, Billy, Poncho and Hawkins. Following a visit from former member Dillon, they are asked to embark on a mission to a remote South American jungle to rescue POWs captured by rebels.The actual raid on the rebel encampment is filmed amazingly, with the commandos intellect and strength displayed excellently by the actors, and leads one to only imagine how much the military has progressed since the late '80s! There is a twist, however, as Poncho is assassinated in mysterious circumstances it becomes clear that there is something else present in this jungle, something much more clever and stronger than the commandos!Brilliant acting, Arnie at his best, and definitely great action scenes throughout the movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MY FAVOURITE FILM OF ALL-TIME...........a tremendous, and thrilling Science-Fiction Action; with beyond its time effects and outstanding set designs/locations. TRULY AMAZING!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What more could a Science-Fiction fan ask for? Predator is by far one of the most thrilling, chilling, tremendous and original Sci-Fi's of all- time; it's absolutely incredible. McTiernan does an incredible job as the director - he's truly wonderful. After an alien spacecraft crash-lands on Earth, and enters the atmosphere, an elite team of soldiers, led by Major Alan "Dutch" Schaefer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) enter the Central American jungle to search for a cabinet minister. But the team stumble upon a a bunch of hanging bodies - the people have been skinned alive. The only way they're identified is by their dog-tags. Dutch reads the name of Jim Hopper, an old friend, and someone he worked with. They were skinned alive by the Predator, which came from the spacecraft. The predator is a ruthless, alien-hunter that kills and hunts for sport. The Predator has weapons that are way beyond its time, such as a Plasma caster/cannon and size-changing, double-blade wrist claws. The team must survive as they're trapped with the alien in the jungle - however, the Predator hunts them one by one.....who'll survive? who'll make it alive?With an incredible support-cast, great 80s effects that are way beyond their time, with way beyond time weapons too, great directing, cinematography and action, Predator is the ultimate science-fiction action that will leave you astonished as well as satisfied. Truly an amazing film --- and it's been my favourite film since I was a kid; and it's going to be my favourite film for many, many years....I don't think it's ever going to change. I rate Predator a strong 5/5 stars, 10/10 rating, and 100/100 further- rating. It's way beyond most films in my list, as it's number one, and not many films match it. It has one helluva ending, filled with great, yet chilling soundtrack, from Alan Silvestri, intense action and exciting traps. Predator is an absolute MUST SEE film! P.S. my favourite character in the film besides Dutch and the Predator is Hawkins, he's actually quite funny. Billy's great too. And Mac, and Dillon. ARGH, THEY'RE ALL GREAT! But yeah, Dutch is by far the strongest, most-awesome bad-ass soldier of them all and I love him - and it's especially great knowing it's Schwarzenegger that plays him. OUTSTANDING! CLASSIC! UNMATCHABLE!</fullReview>

Arnold is the star of the show so all other characters are secondary to him flexing and busting out one-liners, you've been warned. Overall:Might as well give it a try, Predator is considered a classic action film for a reason. Notes:If not titled Predator this movie should be dubbed the following: Supreme Boy Scout, Gun Vs Parrot Gun and Get to the Choppa!I like how the credit roll gives Kevin Peter Hall proper recognition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fox tricked the critics on part of the 3D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen Predator in so many ways, VHS, DVD, Blu Ray and now finally in 3D. The reviews were stunning about the 3D trailer that the critics saw and everyone who adored this flick hunted down the 3D predator. But was it all worth the wait was it what we expected from 3D. Being an old flick and never been shot in 3D a conversion was to be made. But Fox did it in a hurry and didn't work years on the 3D project like done with for example The Wizard Of Oz (1939). They used the Ultimate Hunter Release as base for the conversion. But UHR was already under fire by the critics due the bad Blu Ray conversion. So rumours started within the geeks about the 3D release. To the point, it does work in some ways and sometimes it indeed has a 3D look and sometimes it just didn't work at all. The opening sequence was the real thing with the alien arriving from space. The stars really gave depth into your 3D telee. And that's exactly were FOx went wrong. They worked with in-depth 3D in stead of 3D coming out your telee. Nevertheless, I must say that I enjoyed it because it's a hell of a movie. Some effects might see outdated but the suspense is there and the gore is still intact. I'm happy with my 3D Blu Ray but I can understand that the geeks thinking they would feel the predator are a bit disappointed.Just say that Fox went for the money and didn't spend time on the conversion, and just watch the 2D Blu Ray added within the box, it's just the old release with all the extra's but nothing knew to discover. So it's a fifty-fifty, if you like 3D just pick it up, there are uglier conversions to catch...but for the geeks of predator just leave it as it is. I gave it an eight just for the flick itself.Gore 2/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To best describe PREDATOR, think ALIEN in the Amazon. But please don't go thinking this is merely a knock-off. For once, the filmmakers took the same basic concept and ran in a completely new direction. Somewhere in Central America, Arnold Schwarzenegger heads up a team of bad-ass soldiers, who have been sent in to rescue VIPs from a downed airplane. For the first 30 minutes or so, we get treated to some of the coolest action scenes as they attempt to complete their mission. Unfortunately, all is not well. For the only survivor of the crash is a frightened woman, who knows a lot more than she admits. On their way back to their rendezvous point, the team finds themselves being hunted by... something. And that's where the movie shifts from Rambo-style action to white-knuckle horror, as one by one the soldiers are pursued and dispatched in a variety of creative ways. While almost as good as ALIEN or ALIENS, some of the performances are a little uneven. A few characters stupidly put themselves in danger. But the finale is all worth it as Arnold Schwarzenegger and the Predator square off against each other in a sinister game of cat and mouse. So cover yourself in mud and get ready to be taken on a thrill-ride!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is better than 90 percent of all movie I have ever seen! Arnold S proves his versatility as an actor and makes you feel involved from beginning to end. He proves that acting is more in reacting than acting and he gets some great one-liners in. The movie doesn't over do it with sentimental stuff and doesn't get bogged down by being boring or preachy. And this movie is scary! I know I don't want to mess with the greatest film villain of all time (predator) in a dark alley on a Saturday night... unless he's on my TV! Jokes! Really though, this movie is ACTION PACKED! Has great characters, great scares, great dialog.. it has everything that a movie should have! It even has arguably Carl Weathers best film role ever! And really, you put him in a movie and you got a stew going!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling Sci-Fi and Commando movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's more thrilling films, action-packed with a scary and intriguing sci-fi element to it. It's a story about team of commandos, lead by Dutch (Schwarzenegger) on a rescue mission in a Central American jungle, but ending up battling an extra-terrestrial warrior. The alien has a killer instinct, hunting the commandos one by one.The plot is intriguing and fast-paced; you won't see much fillers or subplots in this movie, which give you to-the-point and non-stop action, giving the audience an entertaining edge-of-your-seat feature. Just the part where the commandos make traps to capture the alien provides heart-pounding excitement. There is great directing by John McTiernan and a chilling music score by Alan Silvestri. The setting for the jungle is perfect, giving you an eerie feel along with the mysterious alien. Each character has his dose of dark humor, charm and tough-guy image. The sole female character Anna, played by Elpidia Carrillo, gave a solid performance.The design for the alien is creepy and sure to scare all the young ones off. The special effects were believable, helping give a fantastic final battle between our protagonist and the alien creature. I remembered first watching this movie a few times on TV with my dad when I was younger. Now, I watched it with my younger brother; this movie is timeless! It is one of Schwarzenegger's best films and is a must for any action and sci-fi movie lovers.Grade A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite movie of all-time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen many movies and many I liked. But if I had to remain with one, undoubtedly it would be Predator. A movie has never been done as this one and never will be. Predator is a legendary movie that marked a generation and that has not lost an apex of his value. I have seen this movie several times and I don't get tired of seeing it, you see it more times and continue love it. It entertains through, supports me in tension until the end and does not bore. It has very good photography, a brilliant soundtrack, the special effects are brilliant, also it has very good scenes of action. When I saw it for the first time I finished with a great smile, the end is epic. Predator is going to be always for me the best science fiction movie ever made. A perfect movie, a classic. Predator is a masterpiece, is a movie impossible to forget. It is my favorite movie of all time, is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PREDATOR has become an science fiction /action classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Predator came out in 1987 and after a troublesome shoot it was well received with a modest box office return. Predator would later go on to become a action cult classic on video and DVD. Arnold Schwarzenegger had become a action movie star name after Conan, The Terminator, Commando, and The Running Man. One thing Arnold always did was take chances with original ideas and stories and made them work with his on screen charisma and very large screen presence. Predator is full of pumped up action men on a mission to find some hostages deep in the jungle behind enemy lines. Little do they know they will run into on of the best screen aliens ever to grace the cinema screen. The Predator was designed by Stan Winston with a little help from James Cameron and proves to be a almost unstoppable foe as it hunts down Arnold's team one by one. Predator is well filmed by action director John Mctiernan who would go on a year later to direct arguably the greatest action film ever Die Hard. Predator is fun to watch and filled with terrific one liners by all the cast. Like most films in the 80s the content is graphic and the action never holds back. It is a shame the Predator series went downhill after this first film, the second film has some great set pieces, but something just seemed missing (Arnold) hopefully one day another great predator film will be made with an original plot. I highly recommend Predator for an action / science fiction audience. Arnold Schwarzenegger wet on to star in even bigger Action hits Total Recall, Terminator 2, and True Lies. Cementing his status as possibly Hollywood's greatest action hero.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A delightful tale of a larger than life alien let loose in a tropical jungle with only one thing on its alien mind.......mischief! Predator is over 7 feet tall and can also render himself invisible to the human eye, and what's more he is an expert in mountaineering and outdoor survival making him a very difficult opponent for 'Dutch' the hero of the film played by the affable German 'Arnold Shwarzenegger' The predator is nothing if not well prepared coming to the jungle armed with tent, cooking equipment and a Swiss Army knife, he also has a thirst for self improvement throwing himself with relish into learning to communicate with the humans, indeed he even at one point converses with Arnie asking him 'what the hell are you' in a hilarious attempt at alien humour, sadly the humour is lost on Schwarzenegger who appears puzzled and a little put out. In a unfortunate twist of fate the predator also collects the skulls of humans, putting him at odds with his new friends, and on a collision course with Schwarzenegger. Things come to a head when Schwarzenegger obviously drunk at this point flies in to a fit of rage and assaults the predator in an unprovoked attack, this is the straw that broke the camels back for the predator and over come with grief he takes his own life, bringing a dramatic end to a quite brilliant comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A true action classic of the 80's.Over-the-top super-masculine personalities, bloodthirsty gut-ripping alien, suspense and horror, some drama and a climatic ending - this movie has it all. Not perhaps a "regular" Arnold movie, but one of the best by far. The "actors" are like coked-up bodybuilders, the scenes are over the top, and the killing scenes are like a first person shooter with "god mode" turned on. BUT - this is exactly what this movie is about. Pure, first class show, as advertised.If you just so happen to get the gag reflex watching some or other "transporter" sequel or another modern "die hard" sequel - sit down, grab a lot of snacks and take a head-first dive into a purely entertaining stress relief that is this movie.

And it was original, unlike the sequels they keep making these days. Another thing: back then most films were neither prequels, sequels, remakes or reboots. They were original and they were memorable. I pity the new generations who didn't have the privilege of growing up in the 80s and experiencing all these wonderful films that kept bringing fresh ideas and new iconic figures, like that of Arnold Schwarzenegger.

		<fullReview>This is great looking film and that's only the least of it. It delivers a tension filled manhunt in a dense and forbidden jungle setting that is an ominous outing for the rescue mission gone bad. Along with the stunning cinematography there is an outstanding music and soundtrack to accompany this alien visitor that has become a cultural icon.After a chilling setup the movie delivers a rousing adrenaline rush battle. The eerie tone and galvanic gore are Horror Movie ingredients and are combined with Military Action, a Sci-Fi creature and narrative, and twisting Suspense to make this a most powerful picture with compounds of many exciting entertainments.This is Arnold's best film and he has a good crew along for the thrill ride. Rarely are so many elements of lesser films brought together to create a hybrid of highly stylized sensations. This is one of the best and is a non-stop journey elsewhere, providing some highly charged chills framed in an artful environment unleashing a violent who is hunting who in this "most dangerous game".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Predator" is one of the best ever vehicles for action superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger, and stands tall as an example of just how capable director John McTiernan was during this time, as he moved from this to "Die Hard" to "The Hunt for Red October". It's a slam bang kick ass combination of sci-fi, action, and suspense, with a touch of horror, with its roots in a similar, much lower budgeted film of seven years previous, "Without Warning".Arnold plays Dutch, leader of an elite rescue team hired for a mission in the South American Jungle. Arnold and his men haven't been told the truth about why they were hired, but that's the least of their problems. Soon a stealthy, merciless, and invisible entity will be stalking them and eventually killing them one at a time, basically hunting them for the sport of the thing.Everything comes together very well in this well paced, brutal, and tension filled spectacle with tons of gunfire and explosions, plus some very impressive special effects, especially the "cloaking" effect. The Predator itself is the work of the late, great Stan Winston and a team including people like Screaming Mad George, Howard Berger, and Robert Kurtzman. On location shooting in Mexico is to the movies' credit; there's much genuine jungle atmosphere. Alan Silvestris' propulsive music is superb; when it quiets down and it's just the percussion it creates an eerie effect.The pacing is excellent throughout. It's very deliberate at first, but picks up considerably once Dutchs' team starts being eliminated. THEN things start happening very fast. The final half hour or so when it's just Dutch vs. the monster is the best part, and there's an interesting idea at work when Dutch is obliged to get "primitive" in a hurry in order to try to defeat his enemy.Also, while Arnold is showcased to good effect, the movie doesn't just revolve around him. There's a fine ensemble here, beginning with charismatic Carl Weathers as Dutchs' old buddy Dillon. Bill Duke stands out as Mac; also appearing are Jesse Ventura as Blain, Sonny Landham as Billy, Richard Chaves as Poncho, "Lethal Weapon" screenwriter Shane Black playing comedy relief guy Hawkins, old pro R.G. Armstrong as General Phillips, and lovely Elpidia Carrillo in the lone female role as Anna. Another late talent, the wonderful Kevin Peter Hall, has lots of presence as the Predator (and has a secondary role near the end as a chopper pilot), a role that was originally going to be played by Jean-Claude Van Damme! (Another trivia note: Hall had also played the murderous alien in "Without Warning".)A rousing story from start to finish, "Predator" delivers a lot of fun, and has quite a quotable script (by Jim Thomas &amp; John Thomas) to boot. It even starts its end credits with a curtain call, the kind of thing we don't see all that often. Highly recommended to any action fan.Nine out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better Arnie films out there!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will start off by saying that 'Predator' was an enjoyable film experience to me. I enjoyed the idea of the story and in particular the suspense created by the idea.By far the best thing in this film to me is Arnold Schwarzenneger, who absolutely perfects himself at the role of Dutch, the commander of the Elite troops. Throughout the film, until around the last half an hour the film was extremely enjoyable but then suddenly began to slow down which hugely disappointed me as the build-up to the conclusion seemed as if it would be a fast paced epic battle. It turned out to be more of a tactical ending.That all being said, each actor did a great job playing their troops. One other thing that sorta bugged me about this film was the "creature's" point of view to everything. Those scenes, to me, made the film quite hard to watch.Aside from the few negative aspects, this film is a must see to any action fan and any fan of Arnie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will admit i've seen this film between 70 and 80 times, and it has never got old, not once. I'd like to begin with the Predator itself, the creature is phenomenal and probably the best alien on film. Nothing is more (bada**) than a predator. I should probably tell you I'am a huge fan, and collect what ever I can of the predators. The cast is filled with a bunch of macho tough guys, who get obliterated by the predator. The characters were likable enough and got the job done. The music is faced paced and thrilling, and fits the film well. The predator suit is incredible and only gets better in Predator 2. I enjoy replaying the rebel camp scene because it is entertaining as all he**. The end fight scene is classic, especially when the predator first takes his mask off and lets out that awesome roar.Predator is one of my favourite films of all time, it is the ultimate sci-Fi/action film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a special-forces outfit is assigned to locate a downed US military helicopter in the remote jungles of Central America, their mission takes a lethal twist with the discovery of an alien enemy apparently impervious to their skills and weaponry. One by one the commandos are picked-off by the shape-shifting creature, as the once-cocky hunters become the hunted.One of the great sci-fi movies of the 80's, and in my opinion, the one that firmly established Schwarzenegger as a sci-fi mainstay following his success a couple of years earlier with "The Terminator". The cast of muscle-men assembled includes pro wrestler turned actor, turned politician Jesse "The Body" Ventura, Rocky's old sparring nemesis Carl Weathers, ex-porn actor Sonny Landham and actor-director Bill Duke among others. Veteran R.G. Armstrong has a cameo early in the picture as the military brass who effectively sends the outfit to their doom, while the imposing 7'2" Kevin Peter Hall dons the mandibles and inter-galactic costume to interpret the indestructible predator.Pulsating soundtrack is matched by the loud overall sound, courtesy of about ten-thousand rounds of ammunition expended throughout the picture, while the jungle sets and costumes are first rate production values. Director John McTiernan went from strength to strength following "Predator", first with "Die Hard", then "The Hunt for Red October" and shows the talent for storytelling and suspense here in his second feature in just his mid-thirties. A much less suspenseful and largely forgettable sequel in "Predator 2" followed in 1990.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You think your tough, Rambo? Well, loosen that headband because Arnold can do exactly what you can if thrust into the same garish green foliage! And this time, he's going toe to toe with a space-traveling invisilizard. Although he is covered in mud, Arnold shines like an Amazonian diamond in this cinematic masterpiece. He exudes an unparalleled rockin, Reaganormous centeredness as he leads his team of Marine ass-kickers to the choppah. You get the feeling that he could snap a python in half if given the chance. He might have to say, "snap" as he does it but you get what I'm saying. Predator is the greatest cautionary tale against deforestation by artillery fire you will ever see. Witness the explosion of manimalistic emotion as the marines unleash a ferocious frenzy of bullets against a treacherous treeline. Whether they are doing this to kill a Rastafarian alien or to prepare for a new highway is unclear. But whatever the case, there has never been a more awesome display of ammo ejaculation. The sequence is also revealing of something else. It seems obvious that this Extra-Territorestrial is trying to provoke an inherent jungle insecurity in the egos of the Marines that has been dormant ever since Vietnam. If you listen carefully during the scene where the marines clear cut a patch of the Amazon, you can hear Dillon screaming, "I got your exit strategy! I got your exit strategy, right here, you Viet Cong cock goblins!" For those who don't know, the three epithets of choice for an American soldier to call a VC were "dink," "gook" and "cock goblin."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's got 'action film' written all over it. It's got Arnie in it. It was made 25 years ago. Seriously, how good could it possibly be? Our survey predicted: It will probably be average, at best.You'd be wrong to think that. It's a great action film. In fact, it's the second best film I've seen Arnie in (second to Terminator 2). I don't think people really rate Arnie as an actor. But he can act, and he does action films really well indeed. He was made for a film like this. We all want to see Arnie, Mr. Muscle-Man himself, come head-to-head with a really tough and powerful Alien from another planet. I mean, nobody else can beat him up - but this Thing can!Put simply, it's about an Alien which finds its way to Earth and into a jungle. The best man power is sent in to try to solve the problem of the missing appearance of one of their men. They eventually find themselves alone in the jungle with Something which is anything except human. It's invisible and super powerful. And it's hunting them. Simple enough plot; not so simple when it comes to killing the darn Thing! But surely Arnie can find a way - right?It's just short of 100 minutes; it's full of action and better than half-decent acting; it has plenty of moments which are very intense; it has great special effects (even though they're relatively old now) and it's thrilling. It takes a little while to get to the main plot, but once you do it's a great Friday or Saturday night film (not that it's boring before this). It's an action classic, in many ways. I imagine it was awesome to watch in the cinema. Anyway, if you haven't seen Predator, then grab a cheap copy from Amazon, or something and give it a try. If you like action, you can hardly dislike this. Thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An alien hunter stalks a group of mercenaries in a jungle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of all the predictable, cheesy action movies from the 80s, most have been long forgotten. Interestingly, 1987's Predator has only gotten more popular with age, spawning a huge franchise of sequels, graphic novels, and crossovers. It continues to receive sequels to this day! How did this happen? Well, on the surface, the film appears to be your average, explosion-happy B-movie shoot-em-up, Arnold Schwarzenegger and all. But it's more of a science fiction horror picture, something along the lines of Ridley Scott's Alien eight years earlier. It manages to pull off both genre elements pretty well, and in great style. It isn't perfect, but John McTiernan's Predator is still a smart, solid, and highly entertaining sci-fi flick.There were many factors that led to this film becoming the classic that it is today, but chief among them is most certainly the alien (excuse me, the "Predator"). From its ability to turn invisible to its famous spaceman dreadlocks, the creature has gained considerable repute among fans of the genre. And it completely deserves its status. The suspense for the Predator's introduction is built up in an ingeniously effective way; we get to look at its inevitable victims through its heat-vision eyes. This lets us know that our characters are being relentlessly stalked, and that there is nowhere they can hide from the Predator's wrath. It's fantastic, scary fun. Once everyone but Arnold was killed, the Predator took on a new, less subtle role. It ceased to be a mysterious, invisible killer, and became a straight-up, 80s action villain. But it's a versatile creature, and the new position suits it just as well. Surprisingly large, heavy and muscular, it's even a physical superior (by a great degree) to Arnold himself! This, of course, leads to some great fight scenes, made all the better by the removal of the Predator's mask. Its actual face? Well, as a wise man once said, it's "one ugly motherf#$%er." Now the Predator is great and all, but it's not necessarily enough to make up for the shortcomings of the rest of the cast. Arnold's character Dutch is even more clichd and undeveloped than most B-movie action stars, filled to the brim with terrible one-liners and hackneyed badassery. The same goes for Carl Weathers as Dillon. There is actually a scene in the beginning where the two of them randomly begin arm wrestling, for the sole purpose of focusing the camera on their massive arms. You'll learn quickly that subtlety is not in their nature. Also in the film is fellow future governor Jesse Ventura, playing a very boring, stereotypical tough guy. We find out later that he and Bill Duke's character were close friends, but this relationship was never developed or even hinted at while they were both alive. It's pretty hard to care about the deaths of a bunch of cardboard cutouts. Awful character development aside, the movie is still a great time. Fleshed out people aren't necessarily required when you know from the start that almost everyone is going to die. But before they do get murdered, they give some great catchphrases that many people today still remember with fondness. Chief among them are gems like "I ain't got time to bleed," or "Get to da choppa!" Just for that, it deserves extra praise.Despite being cheesy, Predator still manages to be an engaging, enjoyable movie experience. The Predator itself is a brilliant antagonist worthy of all its praise. The cast is clichd and expendable, but they are classic 80s archetypes with some immortally quotable lines. The resulting mixture is definitely worth your time, and I give it 8 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although it may rightly be said that 'Predator' does not transcend the limits of its genre, it is a film not to be missed for those who enjoy action movies. The cast is very good and richly populated with actors at the height of their manliness. The film itself is an interesting blend of action movie clichs, science fiction, monster movies &amp; slasher flicks. The movie stands above some of its ilk, however, owing to the strength of the titular character. The creature is visually distinctive and possesses more than mere animal cunning. The physical threat is amply present and yet the monster is also an intellectual challenge to the protagonist. It makes the final confrontation deeper than that found in a more standard action movie, and it makes the Predator feel a great deal scarier than the usual 'monster of the week.' A top notch action film, and a classic of the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the better Swarzenegger action films. Arnold leads a team of former commandos turned soldiers for hire (Dutch to CIA agent Dillon, "We're a rescue team.") to recover a diplomat from the hands of the enemy. The CIA agent, played by Carl Weathers of Rocky fame, is lying (told you, he's CIA) and soon the team is embroiled in a fight for their lives against the Predator, an alien trophy hunter who's on safari. Jesse "The Body" Ventura is excellent as Blain, the "shoot 'em all, let God sort 'em out" soldier who packs a mini-gun and has no problem using it. Sonny Landham plays a great tracker, and Bill Mum is terrific as the cold, deliberate man with only one goal, in mind...survival for him and his team. Shane Black is surprisingly good as Hawkins, seeing as Shane is actually a writer, not an actor. The story is good, the plot somewhat believable (if you believe aliens exist, that is) and the acting is up to the film. Since John McTiernan (Die Hard, The 13th Warrior, The Hunt for Red October) directed, you should expect nothing less that an edge of your seat thrill ride that will keep you going to the very end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as movies featuring a pair of future governors go, this one's pretty good. Arnold and Jesse appeared together in "The Running Man" also released in 1987, good experience to prepare for dealing with a hostile press, a lot like fighting aliens in a jungle setting. I was disappointed that Ventura's character was the second to go, I thought sure he would have been one of the characters to stick around for a while.Apart from the creature effects and the creative camouflage sequences, I think I got the biggest kick out of the commando unit using all that firepower to kill a bunch of trees. Especially Ventura using old Painless the way he did to mow down the vegetation. Be warned, tree huggers.Just like "Aliens", this film kicked off a veritable industry producing toys, comic books and related paraphernalia, ultimately resulting in a 'final battle' film, 2004's "Alien vs Predator". The concept for Predator was actually pretty creative, a creature bred for sport hunting (although we wouldn't learn about that till later), with an ability to blend in with it's surroundings making itself virtually invisible. And boy, was he Ugly with a capital U.As with all of Schwarzenneger's films, this is pretty much his showcase after the initial set up. Muscles bulging and face scowling, Arnie has to use his wiles as well as his brawn to face down the enemy in ultimate battle. I thought it honorable that the Predator would face his opponent mano a mano without benefit of armor. Fortunately, old Dutch had the equalizer with that rigged falling timber. Taking a cue from Ventura's character, Predator used the self destruct button because he didn't have time to bleed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond pure obstinacy there is stamina</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film has aged on the political situation behind the plot: the revolutionary movements in Central and Latin America that dedicated their energy to guerrilla warfare and were answered by the US with commando operations. Now the plot has been cleaned of that background, especially after the demonstration that an operation like that in Libya can be successful when it is supporting a real movement in the country and not invading a country like Afghanistan and Iraq. Commando operations have to be limited to commando targets, and even so consequences have to be calculated.Now what remains is a lot more interesting. The plot itself is the fact that a commando who is a meta- and mega-predator, after their operation is finished comes across a predator of another type: a lot more powerful and with means no one can imagine. The fact that it is extraterrestrial does not add one iota to the plot. A predator from out of space, that is to say from nowhere, comes and starts killing apparently what's more for the pure pleasure of killing, like man killed millions of buffalos.Then the difference is that he is maybe not as flexible as man. He is baited and trapped into a man to man fight with bare hands. The human being manages to lead him to the trap he has prepared. The alien is yet subtle enough to smell the trap and he goes around and that's were the man is better because he more or less prepared a double trap. Solution A won't work, so Plan B can work and works, and the alien is still limited in his understanding of the situation, but is it really? The last action of its is funny, laughing like an asshole, a recording of course, and then it blows itself up into some nuclear disaster.You can imagine the state of the field of action after the action and the state of the human fighter is close to hamburger meat and hotdog filling. But not quite. Anyway it is only a film.What's surprising is that ten or fifteen years ago, or even in the 1980s when it came out one could think it was nothing but Cold War propaganda. Yet, after the Cold War is finished and has been finished for twenty years now, the film keeps a wider value about man: in spite of what Kurzweil may think man will always retain some advantage over any machine, because man is able to improvise, do the reverse or some transversal or counter-transversal inverse of what logic says he should do and laugh at difficulties and block suffering. Man knows when he has the time to bleed and the time to suffer. He also knows when he cannot afford that luxury. He does not know it from any logical thinking but only from some kind of deep and surnatural feeling. He knows and that is enough for him. And fear is not a human feeling, rather an animal physiological hormonal reaction that can be absolutely conquered.That film remains a lesson of human stamina.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best movies I've ever seen. Although most other people don't consider this a classic, I do. I was surprised at how gory it was, though. But that doesn't change the fact that this movie didn't deserved to be lost to time like it was. If you want a summary of the creature, it's basically an extra-terrestrial with tons of weapons like shoulder cannons and metal wrist claws. And boy, does it look ugly without the mask! But it's a great match-up between the soldiers and the creature. And don't pay attention to reviews of Predator 2 and AVP, because they are nothing like this movie! This movie is a completely different style than the other Predator/Alien films. I do have to say, the gruesomeness was kinda disturbing. But if you can somehow "ignore the gore" (I like rhymes), this is very, very enjoyable. I highly recommend it to anybody who likes movies with aliens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If only every movie could be a Schwarzenegger 80s movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something to be said about Schwarzenegger movies from the 80s and 90s. They all have that little hint of awesome that's nestled deep in the centre of a colossal, rolling snowball of awesome (yes, that's awesome nestled in awesome... awesome enough for you?) that just make you love them. And Predator is no exception.The dated special effects (not terrible, but certainly don't hold up to today), the campy acting, the cheesy one-liners, the whole 'bro' mentality behind the characters, and the general ridiculousness behind the whole situation just makes movies like Predator worth watching and extremely easy to enjoy. The characters don't have, nor do they need much character development at all. They serve the purpose of acting bad-ass, spewing one-liners, shooting stuff and being hunted and killed. But they're not stupid, in fact they actually behave quite tactically effectively. The squad of men sent into this situation are presented as no-nonsense, professional mercenaries who are the best at what they do, they fulfill that role, and they all have distinctive personalities despite that very overbearing common element.As a pure movie experience, Predator did a great job of giving us these guys, demonstrating why they themselves are a force to be reckoned with, and then completely shattering that when the Predator itself starts hunting and killing them one by one. Even then, these guys can strategize, take ground, and defend themselves - despite the bloodbath, not one of the Predator's victims in the film is simply fodder.I have one criticism of the movie, and that is namely the special effects of Predator-vision. Yes, this was made in the 80s and there are technical limitations to what can be accomplished, but most of the time you couldn't make out a thing that the Predator was 'seeing' - if you watch the trailer, they actually present a much clearer version of the thermal vision that I think would have helped greatly if used in the actual movie.I give it an overall rating of 8/10, and recommend that anybody who hasn't seen this movie yet go out, pick up the DVD for $5 (that's what I paid for it) and watch it right now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Violent sci-fi action in the jungles of Central America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a classic '80s "Arnie" film with plenty of violent action so if you liked previous films like "The Terminator" and "Commando" you are bound to like this too. Once again there is a large body count as our heroes first wipe out a rebel camp then find themselves hunted by the predator of the title.The film opens with a short scene where a spaceship drops off a smaller craft which we see descend to Earth... we are not shown what it contained. We then join Arnie and his team of military experts who are given the job of flying in to a war torn Central American country to rescue a friendly local politician from the rebels. They are joined by CIA officer Dillon, played by Carl Weathers, who seems to know more about the mission than he is saying. It is soon clear that this isn't going to be a routine mission when they find the remains of the previous rescue mission skinned and hanging from a tree. When they find the rebels they kill them all apart from Anna, a young woman who they take with them. It is after this that the Predator really joins the story as it starts to pick off members of the team. At first they don't believe Anna when she tells them that "the jungle came alive" but soon realise that while that isn't literally true there is something out there that isn't human.The action is pretty exciting throughout the film, it is also fairly violent with people dying after being shot, blown up, set on fire or impaled by a thrown machete.. and this is just the early scene where our heroes take on the rebels. As well as Arnie doing well in the lead role as Dutch the other actors do a decent job, especially the always good Bill Duke as Mac. The special effects are great for a pre-CGI film, especially the look of the predator's chameleon-like armour.Even though I don't think this was as good as "Alien" in the space-monster genre I'd recommend this to any fans of '80s action movies as this is a great example of the type.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Predator" offers simple entertainment in raw form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Predator" boasts a few unique claims, one being that it's the only movie to feature two US governors. The "Jaws" and "Alien"-inspired monster attack film also gave birth to one of the most original creatures we've ever seen instead relying on aliens or dangerous animals. But most of all, it's the ability of "Predator" to deliver entertainment on bare-bones plot structure.Arnold Schwarzenegger stars in director John McTiernan's breakthrough action thriller about a team of commandos on a hostage rescue mission in a Central American jungle who on their way back find themselves being hunted one-by-one by some extra-terrestrial hunter with stealth armor. The beauty of "Predator" is that's all for the plot. No sub-plots, no character development, nothing -- just gunfire and guts. Only occasionally does a mindless film like this one come along, recognize that its mindless, and just execute "entertaining" right down to its very definition.The cast is completely talentless, but Schwarzenegger appears to have finely honed his ability to be an action star without distracting us with a thick accent. His recognizability at this point in his career is enough to like him in the film. Jesse Venture adds a bit of variety to the cast and makes for a nice fun fact many years later.It would be one thing if there was no good reason for "Predator" to be devoid of everything but spine, but an alien with hunting gear and dreadlocks killing commandos for good sport needs nothing but some clever action sequences and effective suspense. Like "Alien," we don't see the Predator in full until way into the movie and that's half the excitement necessary to enjoy it.Other movies try and give us back story, romance and clever twists when they aren't capable of delivering them well. "Predator" says "you want blood and aliens but not the same old presentation? You got it." Good film-making has never been simpler. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoy Arnold Schwartzeneggar movies as much as the next guy, and the Terminator films are some of my favorites. Because "Predator" received some fairly good ratings, I decided to check it out. I admit it can be fun, and there are some good moments of humor and action. However, it's far from great, and I'll tell you why. We hardly get to know any of the characters, especially Arnold. In a movie like this, we want characters we can really care about so we can hope they'll get away from the bad guys (and the alien in this case). Secondly, Arnold's movies are usually much more chock-full of funny lines than this, which usually give the movie a reason to stick in your brain. The action scenes are pretty good, although some of the scenes with Arnold and the Predator toward the end go on a bit too long, and they seem to keep on going back and forth. This is a decent action movie if you don't want to think too much while you watch it, but if you prefer something with a bit more depth to it, I recommend the Terminator films or "True Lies" instead.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fast-paced sci-fi action thriller with soldier Arnold battling an invisible predator who's killing everyone one by one. The predator who is apparently from outer space is a hunter, and enjoys killing his prey and collecting body parts as trophies. The film is tense and exciting, and the Special Effects still hold up well. The predator itself has a menacing appearance and proves a worthy foe for Arnold. Only the climax feels a touch preposterous but the whole thing works well overall. A solid recommendation for Arnold fans and for fans of violent action thrillers.Overall 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very good action/sci-fi movie. Usually that combination means a boring, over-attempting, poorly played, terrible FX B-movie but not in Predator's case. Here we get big name actors (Arnold Schwarznegger, Carl Weathers), good special FX, and a good story to work with. I thought this movie was honestly going to be terrible but I was sure proved wrong after seeing this. There are not many actors altogether here to speak of, in fact, just the 8 main characters and some minor side characters and extras. Only one woman actress here also. Also, 2 characters happen to go on to be governors, Arnold of course and Jesse Ventura. A few memorable lines, some great action/fight scenes thrown in. I recommend this movie to action and sci-fi fans. Not HARD CORE action though. 9/10.</fullReview>

As i said, we watched this after going to see the second AvP, and it really made me appreciate what people used to be able to do with limited amounts of resources. it really did rely on acting, and good makeup and costume. sure there is a bit of cgi, but it compliments, not overwhelms.We also really get the honor that the predator has by only hunting those that can hunt back, and not just the preying on the weak, something that really didn't come across in the new film.It's really a great film for those into the genre, and i know i am preaching to the choir on this.The new fanboys really should see this, as it will allow you to appreciate, and understand why many of us smile thinly at the crap Hollywood is feeding us nowadays.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I've said before, nobody goes to see a Schwarzenegger film for good pronunciation. It's really a shame the governator is no longer doing movies since his ultimate coolness factor makes any film he's in worth watching, no matter how bad.The Predator is a cute concept, but unfortunately it is less a science fiction movie and more of a Schwarzenegger movie. The opening is rather standard for action-films of the time and undoubtedly everything could have been a little cleaner. What the movie eventually amounts to is the final act and I thoroughly enjoyed the showdown between Arnold and the Predator.Sadly, what potential the movie could have had is slightly lost to its somewhat shoddy production, but it is an exciting and an interesting action movie, though far from the best of them. Even so the movie still has Schwarzenegger, guns, profanity, explosions and a guy in a monster suit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Stick around" (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's kind of hard to write an objective review of Predator. I mean, it's one of those childhood films that opened my eyes to the joys of bloodletting, swearing and rampant homoeroticism. But still, even in the glare of dewy-eyed nostalgia, it remains an excellent film.The reason why Predator works so well is because it takes the effort to make the characters memorable. All too often these days in action films you can barely remember a single person. Just take the risible Alien Vs Predator. Not one person stands out. They're completely faceless. But in Predator you remember all of them ? even Shane Black's character, who has about three lines, two of which are pussy jokes.My favourite character has to be Mac. He's a cool bastard. He whispers every line, snaps a razor on his face as he's shaving, stabs a scorpion off Carl Weathers' back and goes completely mental ("I'm gonna have me some fun"). Plus he instigates the scene where the commandos destroy the jungle with machine guns and grenade launchers. Sure it's ridiculous (everyone fires non-stop for about half a minute, but Arnie only reloads once ? plus Mac is firing with a min-gun!), but it's also a piece of wish-fulfilment. Wouldn't every red-blooded man like to do something so stupidly destructive? Plus I think McTiernan is well aware of the absurdity. He pushes the scene so far that he must have his tongue in his cheek. But on a Freudian level the scene's got to be about impotence. There you are with a huge gun in your hands, but you just can't do anything with it.Speaking of Freud, I think Sigmund would have had a field day with all the cigar smoking. Rarely a moment goes by that Arnie doesn't have a large stoogie in his mouth. And then there's the revelation of Painless (the mini-gun). It emerges for a sack like a giant strap-on phallus. However, the most alarming moment is when Dutch and Dillon have an arm wrestle. The close-up of big, sweaty muscles would make even the straightest man question his sexuality. Oh, and then there's the scene where the commandos make an A-Team-style jungle trap to capture the Predator in. The scene is really just an excuse for muscle fetishism. Everywhere you look there are rippling arms and torsos. And I swear that Dillon is covered in baby oil (an essential for any soldier). Either that or it's just old-fashioned sweat. But either way, the scene achieves the desired effect: tent city! Where the film also delivers is in the one-liners. "Stick around" is easily the best (Arnie's delivery is sublime), but I also love Blain telling Poncho that he hasn't got time to bleed. And then to elevate the scene even higher, Poncho fires a few grenades before saying, "You got time to duck?" The film is well aware of its own macho BS.But I guess all the one-liners, character work and homoeroticism would be for nothing if Predator was an embarrassment. And looking at the initial designs on the DVD, this could well have been the case. But thankful the alien was redesigned and the creature works exceedingly well.And the film also does an excellent job of building up the tension. The infrared shots are suitably odd and the effects work is decent enough. But what I like most are the little things like the first glimpse of the Predator hand (when he picks up the scorpion) and the self-surgery. They give you a glimpse of the creature without showing too much. And I also dig the way the Predator rips out Billy's skull with the spinal cord still attached. Cool.Another Predator moment I like is when Dutch is face down in the mud after falling down a couple of waterfalls. For a couple of seconds he relaxes but then there's a big splash in the background ? a splash that has seemingly come out of nowhere. It's a very simple way of reintroducing the film's threat, but it works terrifically well, as does the scene that follows where the Predator can't seen Dutch in the mud. McTiernan holds the moment for a long time and he never resorts to showing off ? the moment doesn't need any visual pyrotechnics; it holds our attention entirely as it is.What's impressive about the final section of the film is that it exists without hardly any dialogue. I guess in that way it's similar to the final section in Alien. And like Alien, the isolation works tremendously well ? the main character seems tremendously vulnerable. However, seeing as this is an Arnie flick, the final confrontation is a little different to the one in Scott's film. Here creeping dread is exchanged for more muscles and inter-species fisticuffs. But although the fight could have been cringe-worthy, again it works fantastically well. And it works because, for once, you're not sure how Dutch is going to win this thing. I mean, with every other Arnie film, the outcome isn't in doubt. But here you never really expect Arnie to triumph ? the Preadtor just seems so damn big. And yet again, credit must go to McTiernan. Aside from two Arnie quips, he keeps things remarkably straight. And he also uses the infrared to good affect ? it makes everything seem more panicked. I guess the only thing I don't like in the fight is the Predator's "Eeek!" when the log falls on him. It's a little goofy.But that one moment is easily forgivable. And it's refreshing that such a macho film ends with such a downbeat image ? Dutch dejectedly sitting in the helicopter. However, the film tries to cheer you up by having a 'curtain call' of the characters at the end. And as cheesy as it is, it actually works ? it leaves you with a big smile on your face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arnold Schwarzenegger and Carl Weathers star as two commandos who find themselves the target of prey to an alien hunter who likes to collect the skeleton remains of humans who pose a challenge. At first the commandos think it is a bunch of Latin American rebels but when their unit is picked off one by one, despite heavy weaponry, the unit must band together to survive a threat from out of this world. Predator could very well be the most macho action flick ever made, indeed the commando consists of such he-man type actors as Sonny Landham, Bill Duke, Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura and of course Arnold Schwarzenegger, however this macho-ism is actually a sly move due to the contrast of the fact that "The Predator" is hunting them precisely for that reason. It is great entertainment, with lots of suspense and a memorable creature design. Plus the movie features lots of action and a tight pace which overall make this a great movie. One of Schwarzenegger's best films.* * *1/2 out of 4-(Very good)</fullReview>

The creature was clearly a dominating figure and the advanced technology the creature possessed made him "militarily superior" to the commandos he hunted. Had the creature not been as sophisticated as he was, I'm not sure the plot would have been successful. There are, of course, a lot of macho clich's in the movie..."I ain't got time to bleed"...and so on. Probably the worst line in the movie was given by Arnold when he threw the knife and nailed the bad guy..."stick around"..made me cringe. The creature was the movie.

		<fullReview>This is, after the Conan The Barbarian, my second favorite Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick: it's mean, brutal, well directed, and even given the macho feel of the film, well acted.So the plot goes, that this special ops squad is sent in to the jungle to rescue some government officials. But then it all turns to hell: a hunter from outer space, this thing called predator, starts to hunt the men of the squadron. Rescue mission turns into a bloody battle of survival.Predator is dated extremely well, when you take in consideration the year it was made. Most action films made in the 80's, like Terminator (I know there are several who disagree but it's my opinion), look and sound pretty cheesy today, but even the musical score of the film sounds great today. It could be said, that you can watch the film, and you don't even have to feel nostalgic about it to think it's good, solid piece of testosterone action (and in some points little bit of horror as well).I give my thumbs up for this one, Predator is probably John McTiernan's best movie to date.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw "Predator" when I was 8 years old, and it scared me to death. The Predator creature is one of the most terrifying aliens ever created in Hollywood.I liked the location where the movie was filmed. It was a creepy jungle with all types of hazards that could have been deadly to the actors themselves. But the director John McTiernan (who also directed "Die Hard") knew how to make the movie in this magnificent tree-infested location.The action scenes were pretty good, but could have been better; there could have been less glaring mistakes revealed. There is a lot of blood in the movie, which makes it extremely violent.The best thing about the movie, however, is the Predator creature. It is completely unlike any creature ever seen on film before (the only other creature that was just as terrifying was the xenomorph from "Alien"). Beware of the creature's face; it's extremely scary! Perhaps the worst thing in the movie is the acting. It was OK but I sensed some cheesiness in the actors' one-liners. But Arnold Schwarzenegger was obviously the best at acting in this film.Overall, this movie was a pretty good sci-fi/action movie. It has a very monstrous creature that has to be seen to be believed. If you haven't seen the film yet, I highly recommend that you do so.I give it an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magical bit of storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being eleven when i saw this movie probably says more about why i love it than anything else. From the very start when the predator ship falls to earth and when the majestic music of Alan Silvestri kicks in...my god. People tend to overlook a movie like this, saying it's an 'Arnie movie' or that is has no substance. This movie is layered. From the relationship between Dutch and Dillon, Blain and Mac and the entire squad, to the slow realization that they are being hunted by some impossible thing that should not exist. Billy's character is just incredible. His way of seeing the world is unique and interesting. He knows things before anybody else does. One of the most haunting lines in movies is when Billy confesses his fear. Poncho:"You know something Billy, what is it?" Billy: "I'm scared."Poncho:"."Bullshit. You ain't afraid of no man." Billy: "There's something out there waiting for us and it ain't no man...we're all gonna die."WOW. And his stand on the bridge. Deciding to take the monster on with just a blade. And i'm so glad we saw nothing of that fight. Just fantastic. The action scenes at the rebel base are dated and way too Hollywood for my taste but i can sit through it knowing it is just a means to an end. Also how dutch escapes that bomb blast at the end is a little mystifying and i would've liked to have seen Dutch get taken out with the Predator but that is just my personal preference on an otherwise magical bit of storytelling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is an extremely brilliant film, even today! its man in the great outdoors thinking (as he always tends to do) that he is the greatest, until something bigger and better comes along and begins HUNTING them one by one. then Arnold gets annoyed (when he's the only one left!) and decides to take it on himself, and does a bloody good job, going back to basics and using the great outdoors to his advantage and, winning, well I'm never quite sure who won or not!? overall this is a good film which is actually quite shocking but a good action yarn, one for the boys! the predator effects are brilliant by the way, for the time!

		<shortDescription>The only decent Predator film...and it's a winner.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Predator is one of those films that, after you watch it, just seems like it was so COOL. The premise of the film is simple enough - Schwarzenegger and a team of Mr Universe competitors are dropped into the jungle to engage in commando-style warfare. Unfortunately, before they got there, an alien (who's even taller and stronger than THEY are) has landed, to hunt humans and collect himself a few trophies.That represents a big change for Schwarzenegger, compared to his other films - it's the only one where he isn't the biggest, strongest and tallest thing in town. The alien is armed to the teeth, equipped with super-high-tech technology, stronger than any two of the Commando team added together and - to add to their misery - damn near invisible, through the use of a stealth suit. Suddenly, the elite commando unit so used to beating enemies who are higher in numbers and lower in skill have the tables turned; there's only one thing hunting them, but it has the advantage, just like they were used to in their own missions.This film's tension, created by the inescapable alien and the vast, unyielding environment, combines wonderfully with the total coolness of the alien predator. Nobody, having seen this film, does NOT want one of the stealth suits that the Predator wears while he's hunting them down. There's a definite macho aura about the team - none moreso than the man himself, the Governator - but it seems somehow fitting for the kind of people that they're meant to be.Stereotypical? You betcha - the team is stocked to the gills with stereotypes. The film has its share of Hollywood moments, too, such as one when Schwarzenegger is struck by fire from the Predator's weaponry. One of his commando team had his insides turned into outsides by the self-same attack, but Schwarzenegger? Scorched shoulder. Yeah, of course. This guy has iron alien-weapon-proof skin, don't you know.But somehow, all those little things just don't MATTER in this film. It's as if you really aren't meant to care about them - it's not trying to be a drama, or a political commentary, or even to really take itself any further than the simple premise that kicks off and drives the whole film from start to finish - what if some alien used high-tech weapons to hunt US, just like we use ours to hunt animals?The film is pure, well-paced entertainment, combined with tension, a small note of horror and a high note of ugly, tall and indescribably cool alien. Without any shadow of doubt, this film is the crowning achievement of Arnold's action-hero days.Gotta love it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arnie leads the roughest bunch of "good guys" you'll ever see in what he thinks is a third world rescue mission. The mission soon becomes secondary to the boys' struggle for survival in dense jungle against an alien who kills humans for sport. Several memorable Arnold lines, particularly directed at Weathers ("pushing too many pencils, Dillon?" "you still don't understand, do you Dillon?" "we're assets Dillon, just expendable assets") and the ensemble cast is ready for action, best of a solid bunch being Sonny Landham as the group's expert tracker ("there's something out there, and it ain't no man.......we're all gonna die"). The first hour or so is as good as it gets in this type of movie (whatever that is). I think as the crew gets picked off the movie loses steam, with the final cat and mouse between the Gov and the alien almost anti-climatic. Good score and sound effects - THE best movie for my ersatz Surround Sound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film without fault</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arnie is a commando. He has some commando buddies. They meet up with Carl Weathers and abseil from helicopters into the jungle. They're all on a big mission, ostensibly to save some cabinet minister or someone. They find some badguys. Arnie ruins their luncheon by pushing a truck armed with explosives right into their midst. Outrageous amounts of shooting take place. Jesse Ventura steals the film with his sensational medigun, a weapon so powerful it sets people on fire after a few rounds! Arnie throws a knife into some passer by, 'Schtick around' being his handy advice. But when the shooting stops Arnie feels betrayed, Carl Weathers lied! Horror of horrors these old pals are now in great dispute. Little do they know that they share a common enemy...the Predator, some kind of alien hunter that has arrived from space with the expressed intention of turning everybody it finds into some kind of quirky evening wear. The team move on into the jungle, the spectacled disgusting joke peddler being the first to die. Ventura is next, his stomach exploding in a cacophony of splurting blood! Bill Duke doesn't like that one bit, Ventura was his best mate, so he fires off thousands of rounds from the medigun into the trees, his commando mates doing the same. They all miss! The Predator has got away FOR NOW! Arnie has a plan, 'If it bleeds vee can kill it' he quips! The race is on to catch the killer, traps are laid, but when the Predator falls for them his powers of escape are better than they had all predicted. It breaks free and Richard Chaves finds out what happens when a gigantic log is hurled at high speed into your chest! Suffice to say he doesn't benefit from the experience. Bill Duke and Carl Weathers decide to track the creature, and amazingly discard much of their ammo! They both end up in a rather bad way, Duke's head exploding and Weather's arm being shot off, naturally the rest of him soon following. By now just Arnie is left intact, his American Indian friend having unexplainably decided to offer himself as pray! Just the crippled Chaves and some peasant girl remain. Chaves soon finds himself dead, whilst the girl runs off. Arnie then gets shot in the arm, but it causes him no worry, because his skin is obviously made of cream coloured armour. He jumps off a waterfall, he does the same moments later, but no side effects are suffered. Swimming through the cleanest river water ever seen Arnie lies helpless on a muddy beach. But alas, this saves him, for the Predator is very thick and doesn't notice him, the mud hiding his presence. Arnie then turns into a cross between Ray Mears and Tarzan before taking on the Predator in a series of fights. Things are going badly for him, he's seconds from death, but then rather luckily the Predator opts to stand under one of Arnie's log traps and is seriously wounded when the huge heap of wood descends onto his 7ft frame. Arnie gives a sigh of relief, but he's premature. The Predator is still alive and has detonated a bomb! Arnie runs faster than Linford Christie and then the bomb goes off. It can only be described as a nuclear explosion so large is its mushroom cloud. It destroys a forest. Not a tree is left standing. Only one thing has survived...Arnie! Yes, he has been shot in the arm, battered by a giant alien, jumped off a couple of waterfalls and outrun a nuclear holocaust, but did you ever expect him not to make it? Of course not! Predator is a stunning film, packed with action and one-liners, very funny at times and not too long. Arnie plays Dutch relatively straight faced and gives one of his best performances. Jesse Ventura is particularly good as the loudmouth tobacco chewin hick warrior Blaine. This is a film that can be seen again and again, yet still entertains. Few films come close to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the best action/monster films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS Famous for playing an evil machine out to kill humanity, Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of those actors that you either love or hate. An actor who relies almost completely on his muscles, Schwarzenegger is one of the most recognisable faces on the big screen. In terms of work however, aside from 1984's "Terminator" and it's 1991 sequel, his finest work remains this violent monster film from 1987. With some great lines and some equally superb special effects, "Predator" is one of the finest action / monster films of all time.Sent on a mission to rescue a diplomat, Major 'Dutch' Schaeffer (Schwarzenegger) and his squad of soldiers find things in the jungle are not as they expected. Unfortunately for these remarkable soldiers, they are being hunted.Like so many other monsters, the Predator is a remarkably clever idea. Running around in his cloaked state with his spear-gun and blades, he is a solid killer who is not to be messed with.So as he is noticeable but well hidden, the way the film shows the Predator's cloak is clever. Basing it on reflected light, the graphics brilliantly allow us to see that something is there, whilst never actually knowing what he is. In effect, this gives us an increasingly eerie tension which the film thrives on.The casting of Schwarzenegger is brilliant as well because whilst so many monster films contain dire leading casts, this film benefits from a famous opponent to the 'evil' monster. Schwarzenegger is brilliant as the clever and enigmatic Dutch.As a supporting cast as well, the fellow marines are also fun and lively. With fine performances by Jesse Ventura and Carl Weathers, Schwarzenegger is supported by a cast who add an extra spice to the walking corpses. This is what so many monster films miss out on, and "Predator" works well as a result.As far as monster films go, there are few as good as "Predator". Well made and surprisingly well acted, it is one of those films which you can happily watch over and over. You wouldn't want to be left in the same room as a Predator, but you WILL want it on your television screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arnold Schwarzenegger's sci-fi action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story concerns a group of commandos, led by Major 'Dutch' Schaefer (Schwarzenegger), who are hired by the CIA to rescue a group of cabinet ministers being held by guerrilla fighters somewhere in Central America. They are accompanied on the mission by Dillon (Carl Weathers), a CIA agent and old friend of Dutch. During a lengthy introductory sequence, the team is dropped off somewhere in the jungle and they begin their search for the hostages. Along the way they uncover the mutilated bodies of a group of Green Berets. Upon further investigation, Dutch realizes that he knew the dead men and quizzes Dillon about their presence; he denies all knowledge of the Green Beret's mission. Assuming that the guerrillas must be responsible for the atrocity, the team track them down and a bloody battle ensues. After the fighting has subdued it becomes apparent that there were no cabinet ministers, and that Dillon and the CIA used the team to stop a potential security threat to the United States. Angered by his friend's deception, Dutch orders his team to retreat to the evacuation point, taking a female guerrilla along with them for the intelligence information she can provide.Shortly afterwords the woman tries to escape, and is pursued into the jungle by one of Dutch's team. Just as he catches the woman, a mysterious, almost invisible shape emerges from the jungle, cuts him down and carries the corpse off into the trees. It soon becomes apparent that the guerrillas were not responsible for what happened to the Green Berets, and that someone, or something else is stalking the commandos through the jungle. An implacable alien creature, capable of blending into the surrounding environment and possessed of far superior technology, is tracking them. One by one this unseen assailant picks the commandos off, until only Dutch remains. He alone must face this ultimate hunter; with whatever primitive weaponry his can muster. Alone, he must face, the Predator.Pretty good, but there are allot of better films out there. A solid 7/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A action film as it should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film with Schwarzenegger in its heydays, is an muscled packed action film just the way I like it.Director Mctiernan (Die Hard) does an excellent job. The alien Predator is slowly introduced and leaves enough questions to keep the viewer excited after the movie is over. And it is great material for the second movie. The nice thing is also that all the characters are really something. A bit fucked up, but this is cool. They are also slowly introduced and it is cool to watch at the muscled guys shooting and raving at something they can't see. It was a good choice not to reveal the Predator too soon. It keeps the tension high. The role of Schwarzenegger is easy concerning the acting, but he is one of those guys who have an astonishing charisma on screen. The ending is exciting and letting Dutch think it is over and then see a comeback from the Predator is well done as well as the scenes where the predator sneaks up behind Arnold without noticing him. This is a movie with everything in it. When I was young I just loved everything but seeing at a some later age this movie stills is wonderful! What a great movie this is! A classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the best "hunted by alien in jungle"movie. Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose Predator can be divided in two parts. The first being a straight forward action movie as we follow The Governator as Dutch and his posse take out an entire wing of a guerrilla group in order to rescue some US hostages. I think this bit is very necessary as it gives you an idea of just how tough this band of guys are - they are the best of the best. This reinforces the shock of what happens next.On the way out of the jungle his team are picked off one by one by a alien hunter. Despite being in a very earthy open environment, the sense of claustrophobia as the hunt begins is immense. Its a surprisingly clever film and doesn't get enough recognition I feel.The movie is brilliantly paced, each member of the team has their own unique persona and although the story is as basic as you can get it always keeps you interested as the conflict between the unseen predator and this crack unit of soldiers is so absorbing. Its full of now classic lines and scenes, a stand out moment being when the team level half of Costa Rica with a minigun trying to draw blood from whatever is stalking them. How we laugh as Arnie cracks a "stick around" after pinning a goon to a door with his throwing knife. OK maybe not.One of my all time favourites. I cant choose between this and T2 as my favourite Arnie flick. A sci fi classic in my opinion and one which was criminally overlooked in its day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arnold in an updated version of Most Dangerous Game against an alien hunter who can be invisible, has a force field, has heat sensors, and super advanced weaponry. This is one of the most memorable aliens in the history of cinema. Arnold's group of elite soldiers (they appear to be Rangers) are sent on a rescue mission in a South American jungle. It turns out there are more than just bad guys there. There is also, the above mentioned alien who loves to hunt them down one by one and take something from the victim as a trophy.There are some memorable lines, especially what Arnold says to the alien after he sees what he looks like under his body armor. Arnold does seem to take more punishment than appears to be humanly possible and survive. If you can get by that, you will highly enjoy this film. Definitely worth owning!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is a genre classic and stands as some of Arnold's best work. For those who've never seen the film the plot basically breaks down as: the wild bunch is hunted in a South American jungle by a big, ugly alien.The latest 2-disc DVD got a neat re-packaging for the 2004 release of AVP and has some really great featurettes including an "easter egg" with look back by some of the cast and crew on the the former future Governor Ventura. Arnold's Governorship wasn't discussed as all the "updated" interviews were done in 2001. So I'm guessing all the features on the new re-packaged '04 DVD are the same as the 2001 DVD except for a brief 2 minute "inside look" at AVP.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Hunter Becomes...The Hunted.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[SPOILERS HEREIN]Major 'Dutch' Schaffer and his team of special commandos arrive at the base camp deep in the jungles of Central America. Dutch is reunited with an old advesary of his, Major George Dillon. Dutch then learns that he and his men are assigned to rescue some cabinet ministers that were believed taken hostage by the guerillas. Not the apes, the Central American enemy soldiers. So Dutch and his men, Billy, Mac, Hawkins, Poncho, and Blain boarded a chopper, followed by Dillon, and they head even deeper into the jungle. The jungles were quiet, except for the occasional screeches of the jungle birds. Pretty soon, they discover the wrecked helicopter wedged in the tree branches. Upon closer inspection, they find the two pilots dead. Billy investigates even further and finds three dead bodies...Skinned. Dutch found one of their name tags which read 'Jim Hopper'. Hopper was from the regular army from Fort Bragg so Dutch wanted to know from Dillon why they were even out there. Dillon said that Dutch and his commandos were what he could rely on to get the job done. Well as they continued on, they found the guerillas' camp. Blain unveils Old Painless, his gattling gun. So while Dillon and Hawkins kept a look out, Dutch and his men stormed the camp, shooting at anything that moved. Bullets and blood flew everywhere. Soon all the guerillas were dead, save for one female. Dillon wanted to take her along, so he does, much to Dutch's chagrin.With the guerillas dead, Major Dutch and his men felt that now they were all alone in the jungle. They were wrong. Something was watching them. It was not of this earth. It traveled in camouflage. It set its sights on Hawkins, attacked him and dragged him away. They soon find his remains: blood, guts and entrails. Mac sees the monster and opens fire. Blaine fires with his gattling gun. Now they all fired in the direction the monster had gone. They used up all their ammo only to find absolutely nothing. The monster, or Predator, traveled by the tops of the trees, until he struck. This time he set his sights on Blain. He fired from his strange laser gun and killed Blain brutally. They cover him in a poncho and would come back for him later. Mac was upset over Blain's death and desperately wanted to avenge it. They set up camp and booby trap the entire place with alarms and trip wires. Suddenly, they find Blain's body gone. How could anyone have stolen it with all the traps and trip wires? The Predator was a hunter of humans like some humans are of any animal. The Predator collected human skulls, and just left the rest. The girl from the guerilla camps, Anna, felt she knew about this monster. She said every few years, on the hottest years, it comes around to hunt people. She said the people of her village knew about it for years. Well said monster next set his sights on Mac, who tried to shoot it. Predator shot first and blew Mac's brains out. Next, Dillon tried to take it out, but Predator got him too. Dutch, Anna, Poncho, and Billy run for it. The Predator gave chase. It shot at them again, injuring Poncho. They had to make it to the rendezvous and the chopper to freedom. The Predator was closing in. Billy and Poncho are taken out. Anna runs for the chopper, leading a wounded Dutch to fend off the monster himself. He runs--and slides right down a bank and into the river. He crawls out and gets covered in mud. The Predator materialized then and Dutch finally got a good look at it: it was tall, wore a face-less mask, had dreadlocks for hair, and wore a strange, metallic technological space suit. It was definitely some sort of alien. It sought out its prey by heat censors. It could not sense Dutch because he was covered in mud and so his body heat did not register in Predator's vision. It walked away. Dutch felt he could use this to his advantage. So he pooled together what weapons he had and set up booby traps. He summoned the Predator, and first attacked him with a fire poker that disabled his cloaking device. Next he shot it with an arrow. He felt that was the end of the Predator. Not for long. Soon it catches Dutch and pins him against a rock wall. And then, something strange happened. It removed its mask revealing a very grotesque, ugly monstrous face. Dutch ran. Predator followed. He managed to lure it into a trap, then sprung it. The log came down from the trees and crushed the Predator. It didn't kill him right away. He set some kind of device on his wrist band. It was a detonation device. Everything within 100 yards was about to be atomized. Dutch ran, and in a huge, fiery explosion, the Predator, along with half the jungle, was gone. Morning soon came and Dutch boarded the rescue chopper to safety. Knowing that this would be an experience he wouldn't soon forget.Well, what can I say about Predator? Lot's of action and some good performances, but I must say there was very still story. The story was pretty weak. Not a lot of explanation and not much about the Predator's origins. Oh well, in 1990 they made Predator 2 so maybe that would explain more. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a brilliant action star, is here and is a very good Major Dutch. Arnold is also the governor of my state and he is doing a good job. Carl Weathers is Dillon. You may know him from Rocky. Richard Chaves, Jesse Ventura, Elpidia Carrillo, Shane Black, Bill Duke, and Sonny Landham are here too. Each one turned in a very unique performance. So if you like movies about soldiers in battle, as well as movies about grotesque alien beasts and lots of blood, guts, intestines strewn about, entrails all over the place, and gore, then Predator is for you! This summer they had a movie where the Predator went up against the alien from Alien. The movie was pretty tame because they rated in PG-13. What a low blow to Alien and Predator fans! It was based on a video game of the same name. But anyway, check out Predator today! Predator 2 does not feature Arnold Schwarzenegger, but it does have Lethal Weapon's Danny Glover. I'll check that one out next. I recommend Predator!!-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my all-time favourite Arnie pictures, and I strongly recommend it. This one's being shown on TV twice this weekend because AVP has been released in the cinemas this week. I'd love to see that film but it's got a tough reputation to live up to.Arnie, as a special forces leader, is great as are the other members of the group, especially Jesse 'The Body' Ventura as macho BS artist Blain, Carl Weathers as Dillon and Bill Duke as Mac. The tension hardly ever lets up as the alien Predator hunts the group. The Predator itself (the late Kevin Peter Hall) is a wonderful creation, truly menacing. He's certainly a match for Governor Arnie and the final showdown between the two is excellent.I must give kudos to Stan Winston for the design of the Predator, and to Jim and John Thomas for creating the character in the first place. PREDATOR, and its' sequel, are films I will never get tired of watching.</fullReview>

It is not an intellectual movie, it is movie with a typical good guy/bad guy situation. So this may be the reason, why some people don't like it so much. The Alien is very well designed and, for the time, the special effects are quite good. Together with the second part of Predator ,with Danny Glover, it is one of the best movie series ever and I look forward to the Alien vs Predator movie.

		<fullReview>PREDATOR is one of the best movies to come out of the 1980s. I remember seeing it for the first time on VHS in 1988 (too young to see it at the cinema), and I still get the same buzz from the movie all these years later.This is probably Schwarzenegger's other best acting role - the other being Total Recall in 1990 - and there is also a great ensemble cast of macho characters. The location is spot on, the special and visual effects are excellent, especially Stan Winston's outstanding Predator design. The script is tight and has lots of quotable dialogue.The R4 Special Edition is due out in Australia in October 2004, and it's about time (the previous 2002 DVD contained censorship cuts).PREDATOR is an absolute action classic, with some cool sci-fi elements. Like many good things, it gets better with age - there aren't any films in recent times that come close to the enjoyment levels of PREDATOR.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best 5 action films of the 1980s and definitely in the running for the best action film tag line, Predator is an absolute treat from start to finish.Of course, if you are a retard of film you'll probably look down on it as disposable rubbish, which it is, but that is the very reason it should be embraced.Because this disposable rubbish is SH*T HOT! COME ON!The ever legendary Arnie is on top form in this one - he looks great, he cracks a few decent one-liners, and the part was tailor made for him so his woodenness doesn't show one little bit.THere are also appearances by Jesse Ventura and Bill Dukes so the 'daddies' quota is filled nicely. It's even got Action Jackson in it too.Brilliant FX and creature work from Stan Winston is amazing. THe alien itself is a beast; intriguing as well as a deadly b*stard in equal measure, hopefully ALien Vs. Predator will go into it's culture in the ways that Predator and the poor sequel have tempted us to wonder just what that may be.Because it's the first film in the 'series' it doesn't suffer from fan-boy syndrome and will stand in its own league as an introduction to a franchise, but a great film in its own right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well let me start off by saying that this movie is older then me i do appreciate it for all its glory. Good Story that spawned a not so great sequel. Good characters, who doesn't love Arnie taking on something that he hasn't before an Alien. Good Visual, i loved how it took place in the jungle. The creature effects of the Predator were outstanding, its one of the best looking aliens i have ever seen if not the best. WARNING SPOILERS: The story is about a group of marines who go to central America to kill a bunch of guerrillas. After that, they run into a complication, a huge alien is stalking them in the jungle. They fight the creature until everyone is dead except the one man army ARNOLD. The movie is never boring with a nice pace. One of the greatest Alien movies ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a risky premise that pans out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PREDATOR could had premise that could be box office gold but if the effects were wrong it could be a disaster. The film was anything but a disaster it was a box office hit. With the throw back to the 1950s story 20th century fox got a bonifide winner. When I went to see the film I had seen the trailer but did not know what to expect. About ten minutes into the movie I smiled with relief....it wasn't going to suck. The film follows a elite special forces rescue team sent into the jungle to rescue CIA personel and a helicopter crew. The rescue team reaches their target site and a battle errupts and the american team wins. Only they come across the predator at this site and a female POW. As the film moves on the predator comes for the team stalking them. Predator is a fun movie and has a great director at the helm. This is a good one to keep in your private collection at home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A concept as high as the Andromeda Galaxy, but you know what? It works.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone earlier mentioned that this film was an unofficial remake of "The Thing From Another World", a comment which inspired me to write about it, because I think that person is absolutely right. "The Thing," and its various knockoffs, including John Carpenter's superior sequel, had one major logical flaw that rendered its story overtly ridiculous: Why would an alien advanced enough to travel light years across space make its way to earth just to snarl and tear humans apart?This movie is essentially a two-hour attempt to answer that question, and it does it very very well indeed. The alien travels great distances to kill for the same reason we do: the fun of it. I'm reminded of the white big game hunters of the 19th century, who tested their machismo by shooting tigers while safely on top of elephants. The Predator may have a Victorian notion of "fair play," but it isn't about to play fair. Pitting it against Arnold, Jesse Ventura and a bunch of other testosterone- and BO-fueled punch-junkies was something like genius. The whole "ubermench" mystique of action movies is completely knocked for six by a creature whose ideas of machismo are far older and more potent than they could ever conceive. This movie begins poorly, but, as the cast is gradually narrowed down to two, and the mono-a-mono interspecies smackdown commences, the story tightens, the pace slows down and John McTiernan delivers one of the great action climaxes in film history.</fullReview>

The Way the predator picks off the marines, and the spooky bits where you saw the invisible image of predator as it cloaked. I was Itching to see what it really looked like, and I finally did after it was injured in a gunfight. Arnold Schwartzenegger (Terminator, Kindergarten cop, Batman and Robin) acts 'Dutch' well and his marine partners are not bad. Their originally called in to rescue a couple of hostages who are treated very badly in the beginning of the film as we see, But the platoon discover a sinister thing out there in the jungle and when they find another U.S marine team skinned alive in the tree's. A woman they find, only speaks native language, and after trying to escape them twice, she starts to think again after she bumps into one. Arnie was good in this film and I still can't get over the strangeness of when you see 'though the predators eyes' A definite 'must see'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blockbuster from 1987 that stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as a special units commando who leads his team into the deep jungles of Latin America for an unknown assignment. It turns out that some other Americans have disappeared and now Schwarzenegger's team must find out what happened to them. What they do not know is that a hunter from deep outer space is out to add to his trophy collection. The special effects are the greatest asset in this film. None of the characters are very interesting, even though Carl Weathers is impressive. There is not much of a story-line, but the direction is strong. In the end "Predator" is a likeable film that goes for thrills and chills, but never tries to be more than what it is. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes you're really not in the mood to think. A deep movie is the last thing you want. In such cases you want something like an action movie, but most action movies (especially those about monsters, like say Virus), are incredibly stupid. Well, Predator is one that isn't. It's not realistic, but it's still kind of freaky. The action sequences and direction (by Die Hard's John Mctiernan) are terrific, and this is a reasonable role for a guy like Shwartznegger. I hate when guys like him and Keanu Reeves take roles that just don't fit them. Keanau Reeves was right for Point Break and Speed and in the same way, Shwartznegger was right for this movie. The creature has been created by the master, Stan Winston, and is really cool looking. The movie is exciting and fun. It's nothing to praise for excellence, but it's also hard to criticize it. It's simply "enjoyable".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like "Predator", not for it's ingenuity (if it has any), but for it's flamboyant display of state of the art special effects and gargantuan explosions. The human story is thin, but it hardly matters to you while you're watching. This is what an Arnold movie is all about: kicking a**, and blowing up tons of s**t! But that's not all. His foe is an alien from outer space, and it's not just any alien. It has sophisticated weaponry and camouflage techniques that make it hard to see or avoid getting killed by.Thanks to effects artist Stan Winston, we have a creature that looks nothing like what we have seen before. I thought that the idea of it being like a hunter, with his trusty collection of trophies and other bones collected hroughout the universe, was brilliant. Otherwise, it's like a "Rambo" movie, with big. There really isn't much intellect involved here, nor is it needed to enjoy it. It's hard to not like this one. Rent it, or buy the DVD, and crank up the volume high! Very high!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Predator could have been slightly better. The appearance of the alien in his rubber suit is a big let-down, and some of the deaths could have been more graphic. That said, the movie is highly original and exciting. Arnie leads a group of soldiers into the jungle to rescue some VIPS, only to find themselves being picked off by an unknown, unseen presence. Once most of the cast has been killed, Arnie and the creature fight to the death. The predator is capable of invisibility (more or less) and has an impressive array of weapons which are used to lethal effect.I first saw this on video in about 1990, hiring it out without really knowing anything about the film. When I watched it I have to admit I was intrigued that a straightforward jungle movie could turn into a Sci-Fi thriller. It's undemanding but worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this first on T.V. and initially thought it was simply another Rambo-esque live-action cartoon (2-D 'characters', mindless machismo, tedious gunplay, etc.). In fact for the first three-quarters of an hour my finger was hovering over the remote control - there was a programme about knitting on another channel which looked more interesting...And then, one by one, the macho's started getting killed off. With every demise - I cheered each one - I got more intrigued, and I began to see the film's positive attributes: fabulous jungle setting, fine camera-work, great direction. And a story which was thankfully devoid of emotional/motivational clutter. It was just The Meat-Heads vs. The Thing From Space. And The Meat-Heads were losing! Hurrah!Until finally we were left with King Meat-Head standing defiantly alone. From this point on the film soared. Human ingenuity pitted against alien ruthlessness (backed-up by some pretty impressive technology). Some great scenes - particularly when Arnie lit his torch and screamed Tarzan-like into the night. Superb alien facial design - for once an alien who didn't look like a human with a wrinkly forehead (Star Trek take note...)I didn't want to like this, but in the end I couldn't help it. The first third of the film was boring nonsense (2/10), the middle third increasingly interesting (6/10), while the last third was mind-blowing (9/10)!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The premise of "Predator" and it's execution make this one of the alltime great sci-fi horror films. The premise - that of an alien hunting human-heads in the jungle for his trophy room - is simply ingenious; especially when those heads belong to special forces commandos who can fight back. Solid filmin many ways; credible performances, Arnold's best. Special effects superb; exciting pace which never lets up, you know Arnie's gonna eventually beat this awesome Alien, but you don't know just how. The excellent cinematography makes the most of the magnificent jungle setting. Unfortunately, the ending leaves much to be desired in terms of believeablity: there's just no way Arnie could have survived the thermonuclear bomb denoted by the Alien, not far enough away; not even sure the helicopter some distance away could have stayed in the air. Still, a great movie and one I enjoy watching from time to time. Funniest line (Arnold to the Alien): "You one ugly mudderf*cker!"</fullReview>

Our skulls are highly prized by this alien race. For we represent the most dangerous of opponents, those that are able to shoot back.

		<shortDescription>Arnold's best movie, a classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very well made film that delivers the goods, something that many movies nowdays simply fail to do. The story is classic in it's simplicity, an alien creature comes to earth to kill for sport, the casting is excellent and the direction is tight and never lets the movie wander from the business at hand. Many things make this movie great but one of the main reasons is that the characters don't waste time running around behaving like idiots just waiting to be killed as in many slasher films. Arnold, Jesse Ventura, Carl Weathers and the rest are ready for action at a moments notice and one actually believes that they stand a chance against the Predator. They don't waste time wondering "What is it?", "What does it want?", "This can't be happening" or many other stupid lines said countless times in equally stupid movies. Also, even though there is a woman in the movie, she is not the "love interest" of the hero, nor is she constantly getting in the way in need to be rescued. There are cool special effects, yes, but these are not the focus of the story, instead, for the gripping finale we get a kick ass mano a mano between Dutch (Arnold) and the Predator, who is one of the coolest looking monsters ever! All in all a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Predator is a unique film. It combines elements of Rambo and Commando with Aliens. To combine a story that has an elite team of testosterone laden heroes with a scary story of an unseen force that hunts you in the jungle is ingenious. And it has to be mentioned here that what really makes this film work is the casting. Arnold is great but I really enjoyed the other six commandos. They all had their own personalities and I would have to say that my favourite one is Billy. He is played by Sonny Landham ( a Joel Silver favourite ) with a perfect amalgamation of fear and knowledge. He seems to be the only one that knows that something is following them in the jungle. And he has one of the best lines in the film. When Poncho asks him to reveal what it is that he seems to be keeping from everyone, he says, " I'm scared, " Poncho replies, " Bull****, you ain't afraid of no man. " To that he says, " There's something out there, and it ain't no man. We're all gonna die." That is quite a chilling moment in the film. By now we all know what the story is about so I won't recount what that is, but I will tell you what else is great about the film. First we can start with the direction. John McTiernan proved himself a worthy director and I would say that it was this film that got him the Die Hard reins. He has a great pace and a smart attention for detail. He tells the story at a quick pace but he doesn't reveal all the secrets at once. He lets the story unfold right before our eyes. And by the time Dutch is ready to do battle mano a beast, we are ready for Arnold to kick some serious ass. The jungle setting is perfectly filmed as well. We can feel the heat and sense the persperation dripping from the characters. The deaths are very well done as well. Everything from distant screams to someone losing an arm is done perfectly. And that is a compliment not only to McTiernan, but to the writers ( Jim and John Thomas, who would have thought they would end up writing the terrible Wild Wild West? ). The lines they give the commandos are funny and contain much macho linguistics, and that is what we want out of a film like this. Predator is an action fans dream. It doesn't really slow down to get cute or philosophical, this is pure unadulterated action. So if that is your game then you can't go wrong with this film. This is one of the best action films to come out of the 80's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arnie's Best Film Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although being one of Hollywood's greatest action heros, Arnold Swartzeneggar, has hardly ever been in an intelligent film in his life. With the exception of Predator. The other well known stars in this film are Bill Duke(director-Hoodlums) as Mac, Carl Weathers(Rocky), Jesse Ventura(Demolition Man) and Sonny Landham(Lock Up). A team of specialists are sent to the forests to rescue hostages but are soon the ones in need of help when they discover that some sort of alien is killing them one by one. Arnie does well, but the film lacks a bit when he is left to kill the alien on his own. Bill Duke, however, is the best character in this though, adding personality to an action film. What I also love about this film is the little habits that each of the men had. Ventura likes chewing, Duke likes shaving and Landham likes looking scary and saying lines like "We're all gonna die, all of us". It is a shame that a weaker sequel lets down what could have been a great series. I'm looking forward to the third installment though. Rating=3/5</fullReview>

Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times described it as "grisly and dull, with few surprises. However, in subsequent years critics' attitudes toward the film warmed, and it has appeared on a number of "best of" lists. This reversal is just plain sad.On top of the thin plot, there is a lot of sitting around, and the "predator vision" has not held up over the years. A bit of editing, maybe cutting out twenty seconds here or there, would do wonders. While Stan Winston and crew deserve credit for creating an iconic monster, the film itself never really takes off until well over an hour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Along with James Cameron's ALIENS, John McTiernen's PREDATOR has been substantial in influence towards sci-action-horror over the last 20 years. Look at the Sci-fi channel as an example. MANY of their films over the years practically rip off PREDATOR in regards to a group of commandos/soldiers called in to defeat an alien/monster of some kind, falling prey to it one by one. Sure, the locale and creature may change, but PREDATOR's influence is undeniable. I think a major success in regards to PREDATOR is the way the film establishes the military unit under Arnold Schwarzenegger as very dependent and reliable on one another, each has a function within the group and they have been together for a long time. They've survived some pretty difficult situations, know their role quite well, have fundamental skills detriment to their team's success, operate with nerves of steel, and understand the objective. Harsh environments they are accustomed to, and under the command of Arnold, the group work well as a team.But, the enemy they will face is unlike any other and it has weapons and arsenal at it's disposal the group will discover the hard way. Duped into an operation by CIA agent Carl Weathers, Arnold and his men believe they are entering a jungle to rescue hostages, but soon discover that horrifying sight of dead green berets, skinned alive and hanging upside down from trees. After wiping out a camp of Russian and Central American soldiers, Arnold has a shouting match with Weathers over their being double-crossed into an operation that was a lie. But, they must put aside their differences when an alien hunter begins pursuing them, hidden by a cloaking mechanism, using the trees at great height to travel, equipped with a laser that can blow big holes into bodies. It seems that as long as the creature is able evade gunfire, it is almost unstoppable. But, as Arnold soon realizes, the thing can bleed which means it can also die. The rub is being able to slow it down or trap it so that they can shoot it when the creature is in a compromised state.PREDATOR is a film I can watch over and over mainly because the jungle setting is ideal for a sci-fi horror variation on THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME. The idea of an alien hunting humans, collecting skulls as trophies, moving through the jungle undetected until it's prey figure out who they are up against, is so thrilling because of the design(..gear and weaponry)of the Predator. How Arnold accidentally outsmarts the creature(..whose eyesight goes by the heat projected from human bodies)through the use of mud and ingenuity(..how to make traps from the surroundings)is certainly fun to watch. I think that's another credit to the movie..the humans have to depend on their brains to combat this adversary because the creature has superior weaponry. Entertaining, colorful cast of big, hulking macho men such as Jesse Ventura(..he got to fire the mini-gun called "Old Painless"), Bill Duke(..as the steely-eyed pal of Ventura's who tells Weathers that if he kept on making noise rustling leaves, he'd cut him and leave him to bleed slowly!), and Sonny Landham(..who has a plum role as a quiet expert tracker who fancies himself a proud warrior who decides towards the end to square off with the Predator in an unseen duel which doesn't last too long). The scene where the soldiers fire off rounds of ammo at the Predator barely affecting it at all is quite amusing. There are some dumb decisions made by several members of the group, perhaps out of heated emotion, but overall PREDATOR attains a well-balanced diet of action and horror, with a memorable foe. One question mark I've always had is the casting of Elpidia Carrillo as a female local within the jungle who is taken along as a hostage. It seems she's in the film just so that the cast could feature a female who speaks Spanish.</fullReview>

The acting is pretty good, sure Arnie has a little difficulty with that accent of his, but Carl Weathers is really good. The action is where this film is, and the tension and buildup is where it really succeeds. It takes a while to get to the Predator and his killing, and once it does, you cannot stop rooting for our soldiers to get out of his hunting spree. The creature design is superb, never before as a creature like this been seen.Overall, Predator is a great action film, full of terror, but could have been a lot better as it just doesn't come close to the epic-size of Aliens. I recommend this to anyone looking for action, horror, and gore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>smartest use of mud in motion picture history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Several years ago, when I was still hacking my way through college, one of my psychology professors decided to bring up "Predator" during a lesson on adaptive intelligence. "Smearing mud on yourself may not seem smart," he said, "but if it blocks the Predator's sensors, this apparently meaningless act becomes an intelligent act." As it transpired, no one in the class had seen the movie but me, and one guy kept shouting, "I don't get it! How does spreading mud on yourself equal intelligence?!" My frustrated professor eventually declared that men who hadn't seen "Predator" didn't qualify as real men. Just thought I'd share. Anyway, my professor was on to something; this is a really manly, tough guy sort of movie. And, like so many tough guys, "Predator" is both powerful and stupid at the same time.There's lots to loathe about this movie, including Silvestri's monotonous and silly music score, the ridiculous opening scene packed with cliched dialog ("It's been a long time!"), and the totally unrealistic battle with the rebels, who can't even manage to kill a single American while they're being mowed down by the dozens. Then there's the dreadloked Predator itself, who is a memorable alien, but not nearly so memorable as, say, the Alien. He's a bit silly-looking, you know.But then again, there's lots to love. Carl "Apollo Creed" Weathers can elevate even the lowliest material (well, maybe not - I haven't seen "Action Jackson" yet), and Arnold gives a very natural and laid-back performance. The Predator's cloaking effect still holds up, and some of the sequences are suspenseful. When the girl calls the Predator "the demon who hunts men's skins" (or whatever), I always get a little chill.Still, this is a pretty silly movie, even if you're in a charitable mood. My biggest problem with the upcoming "Aliens vs. Predator" is that the former series is venerable (it produced three classics - yes, I count Alien 3!), whereas the latter series is tacky junk. But, thanks to Dark Horse comics, these two basically unrelated properties are now fused together into one ghastly whole.I'm rooting for the Alien. But the Predator is still my goofy, manly buddy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Arnold's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one has soldiers attacking a base of rebels or terrorist or something. After they hit the base though the fun begins as this creature from outer space is tracking them through the thick jungles. It kills them one by one, hunting them. The army men led by Arnold try to set traps for the creature, but no matter what they do the creature always is one step ahead and one tough critter. The fact that this movie was such a hit is a bit of a surprise...in fact how good it was is a surprise too. They had so much trouble shooting this one, almost all the predator shots had to be done again as the original Predator looked really bad...it was played by Jean Claude Van Dame. They got a really tall actor to take his place and it worked a lot more as this one towers over Arnold and made the final fight great. The design of the monster's face changed a lot too, as the original looked really stupid, more like a mosquito or something from a bad science fiction movie of the 50's. In the end though this one turned out great and the finale is one of the best. Arnold facing off against a giant, ugly, super space alien hunter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>McTiernan shows his directing skills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John McTiernan directed this alien gore fest starring the legend Arnold Schwarzenegger as Dutch, a hard boiled military officer who gets a job to go with his men to somewhere in South America's jungles and hunt down some platoon that has disappeared strangely. They get there only to find some horribly mutilated bodies and some angry enemies (humans) which they have to fight first. Soon, the real terror in the jungle is revealed and as the trailer said, it is something that never before has been on Earth. Let me introduce you a PREDATOR!This film is brainless, but in pretty enjoyable way so I definitely didn't feel myself bored after this second viewing. There are many shootings and explosions only to show people some action and entertainment, and they really make no sense. There are some irritating moments like to horrible patriotic music playing background during one soldier missing his dead friend who was also a soldier. The characters are as thin as possible, but at least they act decently and pretty believably, but not in all cases. This film cannot be enjoyed if viewed with too much criticism, and I try to concentrate on the merits this film has. Trash or not, a film may still have some merits and cinematic achievements.The cinematography is stunning and creates great atmosphere in many cases and segments. The director really knows how to direct action thrillers, as Die Hard proves, too. There are two totally great little details and scenes in Predator, and I definitely want to tell about them. The first, and greatest, is when Predator fixes himself/itself and uses his tools with agony as "he" is wounded. As he shouts, there is one image/angle that lasts perhaps one second, but catches the sun very effectively from one little hole in tree and it shines very brightly through that hole and looks totally fantastic. As I mentioned, this image is only one part of the "fixing" scene and that image is very brief and I think it's left for viewers to spot. This little detail really blew me away with this second viewing, it is that inventive and effective. The other detail spoils a little, so I won't tell too much about it, but it deals with a camera angle which is used after Predator has shot one of its victims in the head. The angle and tension is very great before and after that killing, and it would've been much less effective in the hands of not so talented director. There are also other great examples of cinematography and visual talent of the director, so this is one important element and achievement in this film, and due to this, I appreciate this film pretty much, despite the film being pretty stupid.The effects are plenty and gory as Predator kills and shoots its victims with bloody results. This is pretty violent film and it is interesting to see this got an R rating at the time without any cuts. Still, this is a mainstream film so it is no use in expecting some over-the-top splatter film, but as a film from a big studio, this is pretty gruesome, but also cartoonish. The effects about the monster itself and its ability to change colors and copy its environment are very fantastic and even more convincing than the make up effects. Also, the monster itself is pretty damn ugly and disgusting and created with care by Stan Winston.Predator is great film for lovers of big budget action and (unintentional) trash cinema and of course a must for those who love Arnold's charisma on screen. This is a great example about this genre's abilities and McTiernan can be proud of this film, too. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How this movie became a classic still baffles me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously, what is the big deal of this movie? Predator is overall a mediocre film. The dialogue was stupid, like "I ain't got time to bleed" and "slack jawed f@ggets!" The action scenes were boring. This movie is hardly an action film. Most of the action in this movie comes from the scene where Arnold's team shoots up a military camp and when the Predator creature gets into a hand to hand combat with Arnold. The movie builds little suspense and I did not care for any of these characters. The movie tried too hard to be "cool" so I couldn't take this movie seriously.Right before the showdown between Arnold and the Predator, Arnold jumps into a lake and when he got to the surface, he sees that the Predator also jumped into the lake. Arnold crawls away and as he does, his body is covered in mud. What baffles me is the fact that his ENTIRE body was covered in mud just by crawling in the mud as if someone got mud in their hands and smeared it all over Arnold's body. The Predator couldn't see Arnold's body heat due to the fact that his body was covered in mud. Wow. For an "advanced alien hunter" the Predator wasn't very good. It got fooled by a guy covered in mud. And does that even work? Covering yourself in mud hides your body heat? That idea is stupid. The Predator's heat vision was terrible. I could barely see anything when the camera turned to the Predator's heat vision.At the showdown between Arnold and the Predator, the Predator was just slapping Arnold around like how any man could. I find it hard to believe how the Predator was able to rip Billy's spine out with its bare hands and lift and throw Arnold in the air with one hand yet Arnold was fine after being slapped in the face by the Predator. When Arnold finally defeated the Predator, the Predator set off its nuke and laughed exactly like how Billy did earlier. That scene was ridiculous. What was the point in that Predator nuking itself? One more thing that did not make sense about this film, after Arnold's team shot up the military camp and took off, the Predator showed up and held a dead scorpion in its hand. You could see the dead scorpion in the Predator's heat vision. Umm bugs are cold blooded, they don't give off body heat. The only thing I liked about this movie was when the Predator revealed itself to Arnold and Arnold said one of his memorable lines "you're one ugly motherfvcker." I also thought the Predator creature had a cool design.The movie is overrated. I can see why this movie received polarizing reviews when it was recently released. How did this movie become a classic? I don't know. Probably because of the whole Alien/Predator crossover.One thing is for sure, the ONLY reason why Predators are this popular is Xenomorph. If 20th Century Fox never wanted to make an AvP movie, Predators would had never become this popular.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Predator is hilarious for all the wrong reasons, and I love it! Well, I say 'love it' but it's more like 'I like it quite a bit.' It's full of stupid, cheesy one-liners that are endlessly quotable (my favourite being the one I referenced in my summary just due to it's pure randomness.) I laughed a lot more than perhaps the film wants you to, and thought that the entire movie was actually pretty bad but for all the right reasons. Arnold Swarzenegger is as good an actor as he's ever been, but he carries this film well based upon his actions rather than words. The action is what you come to see, though, and it's all pretty good. John McTiernan expertly directs the film, keeping up the pace and making the Predator a believable and compelling villain. Indeed, the special effects are very good too and I didn't once see the Predator as just a man in a suit. Look, this is by no means a masterpiece. However, I can see why it has such a cult following - like so many of Swarzenegger's 80s flicks. It wasn't the best film I've seen; wasn't the worst; wasn't even all that engaging, but it was entertaining and gave me a good laugh or two. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classic 80s action that pushes all the right buttons. Unlike Commando (1986), though, it's actually a seriously good film. You've got some OTT action scenes and cheesy one-liners, but John McTiernan also creates some genuinely tense moments.And, of course, it's Arnie.Note on the score: Alan Silvestri's score suffers a little in retrospect because a lot of it is so similar to his later score for Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988). If you ignore that, though, it's an interesting snapshot of a time when this kind of film's soundtracks were straddling the line between sound design and traditional orchestration. It's a good blend.Verdict: GET TO THE CHOPPER!yetanotherfilmreviewblog.tumblr.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An alien in the jungle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John McTiernan made a good fist of Predator but it was Die Hard where he hit pay dirt with a cracking action film combined with wit, humour, a devious plot and an action man better known for comedy roles.Predator actually starts off in space as a pod heads for earth. Meanwhile Arnie and his crack team of special forces personnel are hired by CIA agent (Carl Weathers) to rescue some hostages which includes an important politician in the Central American jungle.However the CIA have ulterior motives in sending the team. After a firefight with the rebels the team get picked off one by one. It seems something is watching them, something invisible and maybe alien.After the success of Commando and The Running Man, the budgets and production values increased for Arnie action films. Predator shows it on screen with a better and more diverse cast as well including an early acting role for future action film scribe Shane Black.This is a popcorn film with humour, action and teamwork. The latter part of the story pits Arnie against the Predator. Rather prophetically we see even in these early films Arnie having tender scenes with a latino lady.The film is still a little formulaic, a little by the numbers. Apart from Carl Weathers we get little insight to the rest of Arnie's squadron who are shorthand stereotypes. However Arnie did realise after this film that if he was going to conquer the action genre, he needed to show more than his muscles but films with a good script, very good effects and a visionary but also zany action director. His next big action film, Total Recall would certainly deliver the goods.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little overrated, but still a fun time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to find a fine example of pure 80s action cheese, then look no further than John McTiernan's Predator. This action-packed film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Jesss Ventura, Shane Black, and Kevin Peter Hall as a group of mercenaries on a rescue mission to retrieve hostages from the jungles of Central America where they soon encounter a unknown being out of this world. Predator may not be my favorite Schwarzenegger movie, favorite 80s movie, or hell, not even my favorite action movie, but it packs in something to keep you entertained and engaged.Like most action movies released during the 1980s, Predator's plot is very simplistic without being too messy and all over the place. However, the plot to this film isn't something to go crazy about. This may be a more subjective issue with me, but I found Predator to be fairly predictable and straightforward in terms of storyline. Its not terrible by any means, but I would not call this script exceptional either. Even with the corny quotes and one-liners (and they do make Predator a little more watchable), its still a descent story to stay interested in.The acting and character development is pretty much a mixed bag for me. Some performances are dull and forgettable while others are pretty good for what they serve in an 80s action movie. Arnold may not be the best actor, but his role as Dutch does serve a purpose and he pulls a fairly good performance and is the most memorable human character. Kevin Peter Hall's portrayal as the predator is also memorable in which his body movements help bring this unknown being to life. The rest of the cast does a decent job at playing their given roles, but they don't bring anything memorable aside from a few cheesy lines.This visual effects are the strongest asset to Predator and they still kind of hold up well 20+ years later. All the effects done on the predator are handled fairly well and the creature design by Stan Winston remain an iconic one to this day. The cinematography captures the isolation of being in the jungle as well as the lighting being utilized to change the time from sunny daylight to dreary darkness. Editing is also put to good use taking the action scenes and placing them in the right areas.Although I find Predator to be good, but not great, I still find it to be an entertaining 80s action movie with all of its cheesy glory. With a simple plot, corny characters, and great visuals, I can understand why a lot of other people love Predator so much. Even though I find it to be a little overrated, it is still worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Predator is a classic. It's a mix between the action hero style, the slasher flick, and the sci-fi.The good. Excellent design of the Predator, its background, habits, tactics, and equipment. Beyond that, what makes this movie is the initial creep factor, the way he hunts them down one by one, how he takes them out, the various ambush tactics, and the final confrontation. Perfect choice of special effects which still holds pretty well today. Nice action. Well paced scenario.The actors. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, and Jesse Ventura are doing their thing, but the nice performances come from Elpidia Carrillo, Richard Chaves, Shane Black, and, especially, Bill Duke.The bad. All army talk and fighting aren't realistic, they're stylized. Those action hero quip are lame and badly used, fortunately there are only two of them. Simple characters. Lousy intro story.The ugly. The bow and arrows are just crap.The result. Don't take it too seriously, enjoy the style, and then you can appreciate what makes this film good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Predator" is one of the most famous Schwarzenegger movies.The movie has it's fair share of one-liners and let's not forget the iconic "Get to da choppa!".To my surprise,however,the film isn't really that cheesy,sure it has over-the-top moments here and there,but it actually crates a genuine feeling of suspense throughout nearly the entire length of the film.The suspense the movie manages to create is also quite subtle at first.The Predator is not revealed to us until about an hour into the film,but we know that he is stalking the group of commandos.My main complaint is the music.For a lot of scenes it just seems really unnatural,I can't explain it that well,it's just that the music doesn't fit the scene you are watching.The characters are also a problem.Some of them are plain annoying and you won't care much if they die.The action scenes are very nice,Schwarzenegger throws in a one-liner here and there.The last 15 minutes of the film are also pretty intense.Overall,this is a very good action/sci-fi/thriller,despite it's flaws.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is to me a guilty pleasure for all time. It is a classic so well camouflaged in a mix of genres, i.e., War Movie, Sci-Fi, Horror, Murder Mystery, to name a few, that it doesn't even know its a classic! This even grants the film a certain amount of humility concerning its intentions. It is an action flick with the apparent gravitas of a Sgt. Rock comic book, that upon repeated viewings inspires some truly deep thinking. It's the little action adventure movie that didn't think it could and didn't even bother trying to do anything beyond entertaining its audience that somehow lumbers beyond the limitations of genre expectations to serve up food for thought as well as grist for the gore mill. It is a film I could have easily seen Joe Kubert or Jack Kirby doing the storyboards for that is peopled with musclemen who blindly wrestle their way into an end zone of unexpected deliverance. 'Predator' rocks with enough visceral thrills for any 'action junkie' and yet is deeply satisfying intellectually in this gruff, offhand Hemingwayesque way. It made me nod with the slowly dawning realization of having finished a well-sanded project in wood shop.'Predator' is an essay on machoism in all its most laudable and cartoonish aspects and that is what makes it such satisfying storytelling. The very beginning of the movie looks like a few seconds of some unknown Sci-Fi flick spliced onto the beginning of a standard Vietnam War movie dedicated to exploits of martial valor. It almost feels like a glitch in editing, as though somebody grabbed the wrong reel. Arnold Schwarzenegger swaggers out of a landed helicopter chomping a cigar backed by a team of ace commandos. You expect Chuck Norris to arrive at any moment. He meets with Carl Weathers, also chomping a cigar, and after some playful arm wrestling as a way of saying 'Hello', then gets down to being briefed about the mission at hand.Schwarzenegger eventually finds out that Weathers has him employing his team and combat tactics under false pretenses and that the mission has different objectives from those stated by Weathers. What Weathers doesn't know is that his 'mission' is about to be preempted for the sporting pleasure of a visitor from another world. After that, it's the hunt and the chase and the fight against an unseen adversary who at times seems everywhere and yet nowhere. The beauty of this film is watching the macho postures of the various lead characters slowly deconstruct and dissolve into expressions of alarm and dread or simply screams of terror and agony when it's their turn to have their ticket punched.When Schwarzenegger finally gets some idea of what's killing off his team one member at a time, he becomes an archetypal hero that Natty Bumpo or James Fenimore Cooper would be proud to welcome into the fold. This is the film 'Conan the Barbarian' should have been, but never could be. It is about the past, present and future of manly virtue or machismo, but only as a disturbing afterthought.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Predator is a 1980s action film that delivers all the goods such as cheesy Arnold Schwarzenegger lines and over the top action scenes. The plot is basically Alien in the jungle. A group of soldiers led by Arnold Scwarzenegger are hunted by an alien in the South American jungle, who kills them off one by one.This is one of the great 1980s action films. The special effects are really cheap but this is a hell of a lot of fun. You want a serious film. Go buy the 2010 Robert Rodriguz Predators film but if you want a really entertaining film, buy this one. Oh and one last thing before I end this review GET TO THE CHOPPER!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly didn't have much of an intention to watch this, but my brother forced me into it, and I went ahead and saw it. It was your typical average action film, explosions, gun fights, and gore up the butt. Although it does include a few different things, its a basic system that I've already seen over and over. Not that I didn't like it, but its the same repetitive action that has been done already.Arnold Schwarzenegger and a team of mercenaries set out in the jungles of Guatemala to investigate a group of missing mercenaries, along with taking out a campsite of Guerrillas. But their mission becomes a survival mission when they become the prey of an evil creature from space, which has the ability to camouflage itself.You can count on this film for giving you good action and explosions, but what you can't count on this film for is freshly made ideas for the story that you've never heard of before. It starts right away, and gets into the conflict right away. The film isn't long enough to make any stops. It just keeps going on.The film is quite gory for an eighties film, but it just makes it into another one of those shocker films that tries to shock you as much as possible. Don't get me wrong, it is quite graphic, and it pulls it off most of the time. But the film's main problem is not having enough time to stop, or some kind of different idea other than constant running and action. No expectations, just a little more different than other action films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has no depth. In fact there isn't any depth to virtually any of the characters. Sure it has great effects for it's time but besides thousands of bullets being shot everywhere, the characters don't have much to them. I understand that this predator concept is cool, and possibly before it's time. But the execution is lazy and just another throw away Schwarzenegger film.I enjoy Schwarzenegger in basically everything he does, because of the incredible amount of charisma he brings to the screen. And its because of his last 25 minutes with the Predator that this movie even gets a 4. To me the film is unwatchable with the other characters on screen. Not only are they clich, but none of them even seem real. You can tell each of them are just acting, even Carl Weathers.Once again with these monster/alien movies, you have to wait until basically the half way point to even see the Alien. I know that it's suppose to build up the suspense but look at the Dark Knight for example. The Joker is on screen before Batman or Bruce Wayne is. In my opinion you get us all thrilled in one of the opening scenes with the bad guy, show us his skills, and then throughout the whole movie we are wondering what the next thing he/she will do. That way the build up doesn't beat the reward. The Predator looks stupid, and it's easily a man with a mask. So I don't think this is an all time Sci-Fi classic, but at least some entertainment can be found with Arnold in the last 20 minutes or so.+end +Every Arnold scene -Lazy characters, no depth -stop trying to build up the Alien/Monster reveal -Predator is just a man in a suit with a mask 4.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Predator' is an oiled-up, flexed muscle of a movie, testosterone-fuelled and in love with its own reflection. The epitome of a post-'Rambo', pre-'Die Hard' action movie, its 18 certificate belies the fact that it's clearly aimed at 15-year-olds who, at my school anyway, latched on to the pussy jokes and tough one-liners in the mistaken belief that it made them sound hard. The movie makes the same mistake, and there's only so much grimacing and swaggering you can take before it all gets tiresome. 'Predator' is one big cinematic hard-on.Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Dutch, the leader of a crack army unit sent deep into the jungle on a rescue mission. In his team is Mac (Bill Duke), Blain (Jesse Ventura), Billy (Sonny Landham) and Poncho (Richard Chaves), plus Dutch's old buddy Dillon (Carl Weathers). There's also Hawkins, played by 'Lethal Weapon' screenwriter Shane Black, who asked for a role in an action movie when he sold that screenplay. Anyway, after much gunfire, a bit more gunfire and some additional gunfire, the team begin to realise that someone ? or something ? is in the jungle with them. It's an alien hunter with chameleonic abilities, who's hunting them down for sport, just in case you were wondering, and so the men are bumped off one by one. The creature is sort of a Preddy Krueger.If you're going to make a movie like 'Predator' then you need to include the following clichs: 1) shots of helicopters sweeping over the jungle accompanied by a rock and roll song; 2) macho banter, preferably including words like 'pussy' and 'faggot'; 3) tough guys chewing tobacco and smoking really big, phallic cigars; 4) weapons bigger than the characters holding them; 5) male bonding via insults and arm wrestling; 6) action figure names like Duke, Poncho, Buck, Chunky or whatever; and 7) ridiculously manly dialogue like 'I ain't got time to bleed,' and 'You lose it here... you're in a world of hurt,' uttered through clenched teeth. This stuff is taken to the extreme when Dutch prepares to take on the predator by coating himself in mud, lighting a torch, standing on a cliff and howling into the night; basically he gets laughably primal.Add to this Dillon trying to kill the predator after his arm's been blown off, Billy cutting his chest with a whacking great hunting knife, Mac snapping his razor by pressing it too hard on his face, a few gags like 'Knock knock' when Dutch bursts into a hut and shoots everyone and 'Stick around' as he pins a guy to a wall with a huge knife, throw in half the plot of 'Aliens', and you pretty much have the whole movie. The end credits undo some of the film's hard work, with the actors doing those 'Hey there!' smiling-at-the-camera moves so beloved of cheesy title sequences from Eighties TV shows. But for the first hour, before boredom sets in, 'Predator' isn't a bad movie, quite enjoyable in its own way, with a likable performance from Arnie, even if he is out of his depth up against better actors.The undoubted highlight is the predator itself, another fine creation from the studios of Stan Winston. Even though it's a tall-man-in-a-suit job, it looks really cool and the movie at least manages to find a new spin on the killing machine alien concept ? he's basically a big game hunter, drawn by the heat and treating humans like humans treat animals. Another good thing is Alan Silvestri's score, which is mostly Al-by-numbers but gives us a memorable theme tune and even manages to find some moments of poignancy in amongst all the shooting and shouting.There's a protracted sequence when all the guys are blasting the jungle to pieces trying to kill the predator; it goes on and on, loads of firing guns, yelling soldiers and trees getting shot to pieces. That's one of the gentler moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An 80s classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a child, I loved Predator. I thought it was fun, likable and efficient above other things. I revisited it again some time ago again, and was waiting for the opportunity to say that it has quickly become a favourite of mine. As far as John McTiernan's movies go, I think Die Hard is his best movie but Predator is for me definitely up there with his best. It is everything I thought it to be as a child and more.The action is exhilarating and kept at a snappy pace with enough suspense to thrill, while the special effects are truly excellent, they are memorable, look great and enhance rather than distract. The characterisation is also good, the story is gripping, Alan Silvestri's score is terrific, the pace is snappy, McTiernan's direction is efficient and the dialogue is quotable. The acting I have no problems with either, Arnold Schwarznegger gives one of his most charismatic, efficient and likable performances here.Overall, a great film and a classic of its decade. It may be a little too long perhaps, but it is great fun and works on all levels. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Major Alan 'Dutch' Schaeffer (Schwarzenegger) is called in for a mission to take him and his men deep into the heart of a Central American jungle to rescue some downed airman, which they accomplish with no sweat. Sure along the way they find some skinned human bodies, but they got the job done, right? WRONG! It turns out that a bigger Predator has turned these elite military men into prey, picking them off one by one. The remaining men and one woman have to learn how to not only survive, but triumph against this dangerous and very deadly heavily camouflaged alien warrior Are they up for the task?The acting will never win any academy awards, but this film is an action fans wet dream. With a wonderful degree of sheer macho power that is seldom,if ever, seen in movies of today, this movie becomes a true MAN'S movie and is further proof (as if more evidence was needed), that the '80's was simply such a kick ass decade. It's such a joy to watch Arnold, and Carl Weathers do what they do best, which is kick ass. Very cool special effects and convincing gore (for the most part) as well.

		<fullReview>John McTiernan's 107 minute salute to muscles is a huge cheesy mad monster movie. Everything you need to know about this movie is summed up in a hand clasp between Schwarzenegger and Carl Weathers, biceps bulging and glistening with moisture. Schwarzenegger's team of covert soldiers (most of whom have bodybuilders physique) are dropped into a mission to rescue hostages. They do so by conspicuously blowing up every single building in the village. Imagine my surprise when the hostage turns up dead. Then maybe there's some CIA ulterior motives. They go into it, but they don't. A couple of hostile "I used to trust yous" are shouted. I don't consider these spoilers because they aren't - this is just the reason for having the team in the jungle so the Predator can attack.The Predator lacks the cool intimidation of the Terminator or the panic inducing presence of the Alien. He looks kind of like a Native American tribal leader mated with Darth Vader. The visuals are fairly dated too, especially plasma blasts. Throughout the film, the cast of Kings of Iron battles the unseen Predator, including one incredible sequence where the entire team hurles a tsunami of lead at the jungle without even stopping to ask what Mac is shooting at. The action sequences are OK, but nothing is particularly memorable. The cheesy dialogue offers a bunch of pearls that is the biggest asset of the film: - "Stick around" - "Get to the chopper!" - "This stuff will make you a god damned sexual Tyrannosaurus, just like me - " I ain't got time to bleed!"Did I mention that this is a salute to the male form? Boy is it. Schwarzenegger and co seem to strip down faster than the cast of Magic Mike. A couple of deliberately constructed scenes focus on Weather's rippling six pack or Schwarzenegger's huge arms. There wasn't anything particularly dull or insulting about Predator, but its a big dumb film that is too light on the fun to make it enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A crack platoon of commandos is choppered in for a daring rescue mission in the jungle. However, following a firefight with a guerrilla base, it becomes clear that some unseen and very nasty presence is stalking them. Can they survive this mysterious threat ?If there was an award for most ripped-off short story, Richard Connell's 1924 classic The Most Dangerous Game / The Hounds Of Zaroff would be near the top of my list. To give you an idea, not only was this not the only 1987 movie of it, it wasn't even the only 1987 sci-fi variation of it (the other being the cheekily good fun Slave Girls From Beyond Infinity). The idea of human prey lends itself so well to so many different genres that it's constantly reused either as the whole story (Run For The Sun, Surviving The Game) or major subplots within it (High Noon, First Blood, just about any serial killer / slasher film you can name). This big-budget version, by brothers Jim and John Thomas, turns the big game hunter into an alien who collects human skulls and wants Big Arnie's for his trophy room. Talented director McTiernan serves up a solid action-packed thriller as the grunts struggle through the three stages of the story - dawning realisation of their predicament, increasing panic as the scary monster starts taking them down, and retaliatory resolve to outsmart and outmanoeuvre it. There's also a nice little allegory going on here; the better-equipped marines cheerfully blow the hell out of the rebel hideout with mortars, grenades and a minigun and then congratulate each other, only to subsequently come a cropper against the Predator's invisibility suit, thermal imaging sensors and space-age laser rifle. McTiernan carefully keeps the tension racked and makes expert use of the dense Mexican jungle locations, turning the movie into a violent game of hide-and-seek - the whole story can be summed up by Duke's throwaway line, "I see you ... ". Alan Silvestri's larger-than-life score pumps away at you all the time and the monster is terrific; the Greenberg Brothers' chameleon visual effects, Stan Winston's lizard suit and some rather nifty sound effects all combining to create a supercool creature. The movie has a big weak point for me though, and that's the performances / characters, all of whom are paid-up members of the Macho Man Society; you know a film hasn't quite worked when you're rooting for a psychotic reptile from outer space. Arnie is okay, Carrillo has one interesting speech and Duke gets some good moments but that's about it - the best performance is the physical one by the late Hall as the monster. Still, a lot of fun though - just don't think about it too much. Followed by a direct sequel in 1990, then a couple of franchise films later on (the AVP series). For a better Schwarzenegger / McTiernan collaboration, check out their much-maligned amazing / funny 1993 flick Last Action Hero (scripted by Shane Black, who here plays the doomed grunt with the bad jokes).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Schwarznegger vs Predator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Predator is a classic 80s action film. Don't let my rating fool you I like this film and have seen it quite a few times. It is one of those films where you just have to appreciate the absurdity, the bad acting and the endless macho posturing of these tough guys who are part of a special forces team sent to rescue a cabinet minister from a downed helicopter in a Central-American jungle. I had to look this part up because really what little plot there is in Predator isn't that important. It's okay but if you know the premise then you know how this film will end. That's not necessarily that big a problem here as this is a film about enjoying the action, although I do have trouble reconciling with the fact that it was directed by John McTiernan who went on to direct the far superior Die Hard.Predator is a film that does not take itself to seriously, how else can you justify lines like the one Schwarznegger delivers having speared a guerrilla to a wall with a knife, "stick around." Of course a huge suspension of disbelief is needed, none more so than in the hostage rescue sequence where Dutch (Schwarzengger) and his team go around blowing everything up, with some spectacular explosions, apparently confident that none of these will kill the hostages they are meant to rescue. The team is also guilty of downright stupidity at times, such as when they waste hundreds of rounds decimating a clearing in which one of them saw an enemy that by the time everyone has turned up and started shooting is long gone. Although of course this is a film in which you rarely see anyone reload their weapon.Despite this real credit should go to McTiernan for having the patience to have the Predator stalk his prey (Dutch and co.) for a considerable amount of time before he shows his cards. This helps build up some clever suspense as we see the team through the Predator's view and hear the eerie way it hears them speak. The Predator is a fantastic creation, from its look with the dreadlocks to its impressive array of weaponry to its poor eyesight in earth's atmosphere. The scenes in which it picks off Dutch's team one by one are suspenseful and provide some fantastic action sequences which forms the best part of the film.I could go on complaining about the wooden acting, the two dimensional characters and so on but this is an 80s action movie starring Arnold Schwarznegger, that's almost the point and even if it is not, it is to be expected. Ignoring this Predator is an exciting action film, that although lacking the intelligence of The Terminator it is a good watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Predator opens to a shot of space. An alien craft shoots past Earth and jettisons something which enters our atmosphere. Major 'Dutch' Schaeffer (Arnold Swarzenegger) and his team of five men, Mac (Bill Duke), Blain (Jesse Ventura), Billy (Sonny Landham), Poncho (Richard Chaves) and Hawkins (Shane Black) arrive near a Central American jungle and are briefed by General Phillips (R.G. Armstrong) and one of Dutch's old friends George Dillon (Carl Weathers). Dutch is told that two important cabinet ministers were taken hostage deep in the jungle when their helicopter was shot down by rebels and it's up to Dutch and his men to bring them back. Dillon says he will be going along as well. Once in the jungle they discover the helicopter which looks like it was shot down using heat seeking missiles. Soon after they also find another American soldier, Jim Harper hanging upside down from a branch and totally skinned, ouch. The men find the rebels camp. Dutch witnesses one of the hostages (Steve Boyum) being executed. The unit storm the camp, kill all the enemy soldiers and blow lots of things up. They find the other hostage dead too. They also come across Anna (Elpidia Carrllo) who Dillon insists he wants to take back and interrogate. Dutch finds out that Dillon lied and it was never meant to be a rescue mission but an assassination which causes hostilities between the two. They radio in and ask for an air lift but are told that they can't send a chopper that far into the jungle as the area is still too hot for a pick-up. They must track across miles of jungle to a safe rendezvous point. While making their way to the pick-up point Anna tries to escape and runs into the jungle, Hawkins is sent after her and he is killed by something which seems able to camouflage itself against the trees. Soon after Blain is killed by whatever it is. Dutch quickly comes to the conclusion that this isn't mere human enemy soldiers but something else, something much more deadly and brutal, something that maybe doesn't even belong on Earth and something with a primal and basic motive for hunting them, sport! But will Dutch be able to turn the tables on the ultimate predator (Kevin Peter Hall is the man in the monster suit) and lead his surviving men to safety? Directed by John McTiernan I thought this was a cracking piece of big-budget Hollywood entertainment. The script by Jim and John Thomas moves like a rocket and it never becomes boring or dull. It mixes action, horror and sci-fi very well. It is a little silly at times and some of the macho stuff is a bit corny. The one-liners are there too, the infamous "knock knock" after Arnie kicks a door in and blows an enemy through a wall and "stick around" after Arnie impales someone with his machete are stand outs. Only occasionally did I remember that I was watching a Hollywood product, the 'happy' Arnie gets the girl ending especially. There is only one big action scene and that's where Dutch and his team wipe out an entire enemy camp, it's a fun sequence with lots of gunfire and big explosions. And that mini-gun Jesse Ventura carries around blowing people away with is the coolest, meanest and sexiest looking gun in film history! (it was so cool Arnie had to have one of his own a few years later when he made Terminator 2) There are, rather surprisingly it has to be said, some very gory moments, skinned corpses, someone has their brains splattered over the camera lens, someones chest is blown open, a severed arm on the ground still firing it's weapon, a pile of guts on the ground and the predator rips someones spinal column and skull out. The special make-up effects generally speaking are excellent, as are the predator effects by Stan Winston. It's obviously a man in a monster suit, but hey what a cool monster suit it is! One thing that did annoy me is when the film switched to a point-of-view shot from the predator itself, it's sight is based on thermal imaging and the effect really got on my nerves after a while, don't know why really it just did. It's well made with nice production values and a special mention goes to the music by Alan Silvestri which I thought was appropriate and excellent. The acting is OK, but the cast is great with Arnie, Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke and Carl Weathers making it fun to watch. I really liked this and throughly recommend it, along with Terminator 1 (1984) &amp; 2 (1991) this is easily Arnies best film. This is probably on T.V. all the time and is widely available on a special edition DVD so there is no excuse for letting this cracker of an action/horror film pass you by. Watch it now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun but pointless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I realize that "Predator" is not supposed to have a point, few good action movies do, but something about its presentation just seems a bit empty. We have Arnold Schwarzenegger in the jungle with his elite force of operatives, and they quickly learn they were duped into going on an assassination mission by Carl Weather's CIA operative character. They are nevertheless incredibly successful, taking out a massive camp of rebels in a fashion that is, by Arnie standards, very believable (let's just say we aren't asked to believe he succeeds because 50 guys can shoot at him point blank with automatic weapons and not give him so much as a scratch, as in the ridiculous Arnie flick "Commando").The spot the elite team is in, with a valuable captive in tow, is apparently too hot for an airlift so they have to go through a nasty stretch of jungle, where they quickly learn they are being stalked by something evil. They have to fight it off, and that's pretty much the movie.I have always been underwhelmed. It's true that the actors do everything you could expect, and the script isn't weighed down by silly moral and political posturing, love interest subplots, convoluted sci-fi back-stories and the other clichs Hollywood feels need to be tacked on to action flicks. Still, the finished product is little more than Arnie and flunkies in the jungle fighting a monster. It almost reminds me of Arnold's infamous first movie where he fights a bear in one of the most poorly shot action sequences ever. This treads dangerously close to being that bear fight with a massive budget. That's not to say anything in the movie is badly done, this is a very solid production, but there's really nothing in the movie other than the well-directed action scenes.All that really saves it are the fine performances by the actors (including Jesse Ventura of later political fame), its streamlined presentation, and the fantastic score, which seems to have been very influential on action film music up to this very day.If you want something fun, utterly void of anything to think about at all, this movie is alright, but I'd be just as happy with one of Arnie's sillier movies where you can enjoy yourself just poking fun at the absurdities.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best action movies I've ever seen and the movie is perfect mix of action and science-fiction. The best mix since "Aliens".The movie begins as an over-the-top macho movie with big muscle's, even bigger guns and huge explosions. As the movie progresses it gets more mysterious and tense. The movie as a whole is highly entertaining even though everything about it is mostly over-the-top.Arnold Schwarzenegger is of course always at his best in roles like these. He once more has some incredible lame one-liners that somehow always work very well when he delivers those lines. In this movie he is supported by some other muscle guys played by; Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Jesse Ventura, Sonny Landham, Shane Black and Richard Chaves. All of these characters are over-the-top and stereotypical in their own way but it all works extremely well for the movie and its atmosphere.Alan Silvestri's musical score is really good and really adds something to the action sequence's. It's easily one of his best score's.The action from action specialist John McTiernan is most excellent and the predator is one cool looking character that also knows how to fight! The movie has some good looking special effects and some spectacular scene's and a great finale.Only real complaint about this movie is the Elpidia Carrillo character. Not to be sexist or anything but having a female character in this movie was really out of place and just simply unnecessary.The best science-fiction/action mix since "Aliens"!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

The make up effects in this movie are very disturbing and scary. You look at the alien with his mask on, and you're like "Eeh, he's ugly." Then he takes off his mask and you're like "PUT THE MASK BACK ON! PUT THE MASK BACK ON!". It's really effective. I was impressed with "Predator". I would highly recommend it for anyone.

It's really not great however. The Predator appears in the end of the movie, the final battle between him and Arnold is not that memorable. His cruel laughter and gruesome methods of killing, however, make "Predator" really an entertaining scifi action. The soundtrack is also terrific. So in conclusion, this is quite decent movie, but not as good as it's sequels ("Predator 2" and "Alien vs Predator"), which are terrific.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was horrible. One of the worst movies I have ever seen. All the other reviews must be people who have watched the movie over and over until they are hypnotized into saying it is a good movie. Don't listen to them! This movie looked like it was made within the space of a few hours. The acting was horrible. Arnold Shwarzenegger(who is usually very very good) was not believable. It was packed with tediously irritating "One-liners" such as "That is one ugly mother****er! when the Alien finally takes off his mask. And when arnold throws a knife through somebody's shoulder(pinning them to the wall) and says "Stick Around". This move(if nothing else) was laughable. The special effects were mediocre. Nothing amazing. Not even for 1987. The movie does not make much sense since, you cannot even understand what Arnold is saying alot of the time because of his thick accent. He seems to have worked on it over the years so he is now very understandable. There were times when I was quite bewildered as to what was going on. The movie was also agonizingly predictable. I found myself betting as to who was going to get knocked off next. I would say "Haha look at that ugly sucker. HE'LL be the next one to die. Ha! Ha! See? I was right!" The movie was also ridiculously unrealistic. At one point arnold throws a huge bomb of some sort at the Alien. It explodes and burns up everything in sight EXCEPT Arnold because HE was under a log! A log! It burned down trees but it couldn't get under the log! But anyway, if you see this movie after reading my review and like it then there is no help for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good action picture, but it could have been great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It must be said right now: "Predator" is one of the rare good action movies to see the light today. The problem is that it could have been great...Starring the indestructible Arnold Schwarzenegger, "Predator" is an audacious and inventive movie, doing a great mix of action, science fiction, horror and exotic destinations. And that just before the film's director John McTiernan come up with his masterpiece "Die Hard".Schwarzenegger plays Dutch, an American military officer dispatched somewhere in Latin America. His crew has to find and rescue a small group of American hostages captured by guerrillas in the jungle. According to Dutch, this mission seems to be only a walk in the park (or in the rain-forest, if you prefer...).In fact, it is. The guerrillas' camp is quickly knocked down by Dutch and his mates and the Latino soldiers of fortune are all eliminated. But neither Dutch, nor anyone of his colleagues could have predicted what would follow...In the way of the Xenomorph in "Alien", the soldiers are killed one by one in an horrible and disgusting way by what looks like to be an invisible figure.The Predator, thus we have to name it, is rather an extra-terrestrial whose 'hunting' outfit contains super-powerful weapons, an ultra-perfected camouflage mode, a mask that looks like those from Polynesian people and a rasta 'hairstyle'... By the way, we get to see its true (and very ugly, should I say it) face at the very end of the movie only, simply to imply that the people who are responsible of the presentation do not twist their thumbs...The movie "Predator" starts pretty well. The three skinned corpses give a gruesome foretaste of things to come and they are even more convincing than those that we would see four years later in the famous "Silence of the Lambs".In fact, the soldiers are killed one by one and each one in a different method. So it avoids to give a repetitive mood to the film and it also avoids from giving to the viewer a feeling of non-surprise. On the contrary, horror and gore are always there, victim after victim.But what really draws the attention, it's the Predator itself. Its creation and its movements required the use of very sophisticated special effects for its era and nothing has been left at random in order to make the creature even more frightening and also more exciting to watch.What made the movie famous, it's probably the audacious, ingenious and inventive use of the thermal camera. This method strengthens the existing parallel between "Predator" and "Jaws". Not only that the two main 'antagonists' kill their preys one by one, but we never really see them in the first hour. Instead of that, a special viewing point is taken for each of them. In "Jaws", it's the underwater swimmers' legs. In "Predator", it's the thermal camera.We must not forget the enemy's 'camouflage' either. Remember: the time is 1987. That means: no computers. Because today, recreating the curved mirror-like effect would be a child's play. But in the context of the time where the movie was created, it was a prodigious technique. And even today, it still stuns, even if it became easier.The greatest adversary of the Predator is also very good. Schwarzenegger is surprising in this film and his stature of former bodybuilder helps him instead of attracting prejudices, because he's not the only character in this movie who has mountains instead of biceps. In fact, I think that it's his best role (after the Terminator, of course).And to crown everything, the jungle becomes an entity within itself, as in "Platoon", thus fueling the thrills that give the Predator hunt.Unfortunately, the movie contains massive mistakes. In fact, "Predator" is an almost-perfect film for the first hour, or hour and a quarter. It's when there's only Schwarzenegger left to kill that everything changes. The action scenes, which were previously well-orchestrated and rather realistic, suddenly become laughable and ridiculous. Instead of killing Dutch, the alien doesn't seem to notice that he's there at all (problem of vision?) and when it has the possibility to kill him single-handedly, it doesn't. Why? I imagine that it's because the story has to end well and the hero must survive. Dutch also builds traps in order to kill his enemy. But just by watching his actions, I searched in vain, but I couldn't find the instruction manual in the scenery...Fortunately that "Predator" has a strong start, because the falling in the final act would certainly have annihilated it. Still, it's a good action picture that is worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sci-fi suspenser, simplistic but quite effective.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of this gory sci-fi actioner is very simple and quite effective. It's basically the story of a hunt. Initially the principal characters believe THEY are the hunters, as they stealthily creep through the jungle towards a guerilla stronghold. We in the audience know that these principal characters are actually the huntED, thanks to an opening sequence which shows an alien spaceship swooping from outer space into the Amazon jungle. What we have here, in effect, is another variation of The Most Dangerous Game, dressed up with state-of-the-art special effects, tons of hardware and weaponry, insanely pumped-up heroes, and an alien baddie as opposed to a mad-man.American soldier Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is called upon to lead his crack team into the hostile South American jungle. A helicopter has crash-landed carrying some very important people, and Dutch and his boys are supposed to find them and rescue them. The mission seems straightforward enough, until Dutch's men start hiking through the jungle and come across the flayed carcasses of another American military team. Tag along team-member Dillon (Carl Weathers) claims he knew nothing of another American unit operating in the area, but Dutch is already beginning to suspect that there's more to the mission than meets the eye. Eventually, Dutch and his boys find the enemy encampment which they promptly wipe out in a lightning attack. But they learn that they have been misled about the true objective of their mission (it wasn't a rescue mission at all, but an annihilation one). As the team head off into the jungle to their helicopter rendezvous point, they suddenly fall foul of a mysterious adversary which picks them off stealthily from the tree-tops. Gradually, they realise that they up against an alien being which is hunting them for sport.... and which can camouflage itself so that it all but blends in with the surrounding environment!Predator is a solid suspense flick, which has simple intentions but achieves them effectively. It never pretends to have any deeper meaning beyond the immediate excitement, and is all the better for this lack of pretension. The testosterone-fuelled cast play their roles with the macho conviction required; there's nothing challenging or subtle about their performances, but they do what's needed to suit the mood of the film. The special effects are good for the era, and actually hold up quite well when viewing the movie nowadays. The film moves along to an exciting finale, though I must say I found it hard to swallow the fact that when Arnold was setting all his traps and crafting his weapons in the film's closing moments, the predator was unable to sense him (yes, OK, he was caked in mud.... but he was making a lot of noise, moving around plenty, and working by firelight!?!) All things considered, Predator is an enjoyable, slick, simple-minded and effective suspenser.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun movie, but lacks substance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mercenary team is inserted into Central America to rescue American special forces soldiers and eliminate a local guerrilla cell. While there, they encounter an alien who is on Earth on a trophy hunting safari. Lots of people die.The movie is a fun action flick and a staple of 80s action. It's paced well and unlike most action movies of the times, doesn't have overblown effects, relying on substance over flash in visuals. The premise is a decent one and overall carried out competently.But, the acting was cheesy (what do you expect when the big names in the cast are Schwarzenegger, Ventura and Weathers) and the writing leaned two much on bad humor and made half hearted attempts at building tension.In all, it's a fun movie and a must watch if you are an 80s action fan or a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger, but outside of that, it's pretty average overall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure the effects are a bit outdated, but who cares? The movie itself is possibly the greatest action movie of all time, and the horror elements can't be matched by 90% of what comes out today.Predator has just about as much gore as most modern movies, but it does something they have forgotten?the gore isn't something so generic you've seen a thousand times. Some of it, like the head on the stick, are so much more over-the-top than what films attempt today it's just amazing. At one point blood flies so thick it literally covers the screen for a few seconds! With 30 Days of Night, The Decent, and The Mist: why couldn't they at least show as much carnage as a monster movie that came out decades before them? Shouldn't we be pushing the limits of gore, not making more stupid cut-off scenes? Also, I'd like to mention the well thought out the movie is. Contrary to sucky copy/paste monsters in the movies I just mentioned, the Predators actually took some thought to design. They really, REALLY make most action-monster movies today look retarded. Really, at one time we had Predators (some of the coolest creatures imaginable), now we have ridicules talking vines that eat people (in The Ruins). Predator stands the test of time to show me that our generation doesn't have a single original idea in their cheese-filled heads that shout: "No, this is too much gore . . . the audience can't handle this . . . we have to make another cut-off scene." From beginning to end Predator is flawless. I can only imagine what it would have been like to view when it first came out, before all the surprises were given away and become part of pulp culture. But even for someone who has seen both AvP movies, thus knowing every surprise that this superior film has, Predator is still one of the most flawless action movies ever.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Whatever happened to McTiernan? This is the guy who invented the blockbuster action film with `Die Hard.' The formula was clear: an ordinary man thrust into extraordinary situation; characters are simply but domestically motivated, and the whole thing is done with a wink at the audience. The second two of these are hard, fast rules by now. So why oh why does he ignore them?What we have here is Arnie, someone who takes himself seriously and doesn;t have the capacity for self-mocking. Even when it is the explicit point of the film (`Last Action Hero') he can't pull it off. Here, he takes on the persona of the comicbook Sgt Rock: gruff, cigar-chomping, straightahead kickbutt dude who takes no guff. He is surrounded by comic cartoon characters, but when it gets down to it, its man to man hand to hand gladitorial combat. And the Sarge will win because he is an American.There's not a shred of fun in this. Nor a sense of adventure. No character is remotely likeable.The only redeeming value is a nice use of fireworks toward the end when the alien shoots off flares to find the Sarge, though why they would help with his vision constraints isn't explained.I got some fun from this because a layer of winking was added by others. I saw it on cable in the Czech Republic and dubbed in Czech. The Czechs are a truly civilized people who have had constant unhappy relations with Germans, particularly the stereotype that Arnie represents. There's the wink. He never knew.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 4: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predator</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three years after the success of The Terminator, Arnold Schwarzenegger brought us this really good science fiction thriller with another alien movie, from director John McTiernan (Die Hard). A team of soldiers are sent into the Central American jungle to rescue downed airmen from guerrillas. The mission is successful and they kill all enemies, and rescue the hostage, Anna (Elpidia Carrillo), but it is as they head back for the chopper that they start to die one by one. This creature, the Predator, is nearly invisible, and is hunting them down, and taking trophies from their bodies, e.g. their skulls. After all others are killed, and Anna heads for the chopper, Dutch is the only survivor left alive. At first he tries to get away and hide from the Predator, but then he uses his commando skills, and the knowledge that he can't see his body heat when he is covered in mud, he builds many traps and tries to kill it. Also starring Close Encounters' Carl Weathers as Dillon, Commando's Bill Duke as Mac, Jesse Ventura as Blain, Sonny Landham as Billy, Richard Chaves as Poncho, R.G. Armstrong as General Phillips, Shane Black as Hawkins and Kevin Peter Hall as The Predator. The great moments are the base invasion, seeing through the eyes of the Predator, and seeing his ugly face, with Schwarzenegger saying the great swearing line. A sequel followed in 1990. Arnold Schwarzenegger was number 54 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 20 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a proof that without James Cameron Schwarzenegger's movies offer nothing but lots of gunfire and explosions. Extreme violence tries to evoke some kind of fear in the viewer, but this doesn't work in my case. Predator is painfully stereotypical and has no plot, not to mention character development. Technically, however, the movie is very well done. Watch this movie once, but don't try to figure out what it meant. And avoid the sequel at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Men hiding in the bushes. Check. Much younger girl captured and tied. Check. Girl afraid for her life. Check.Okay, fine, it's not that kind of Predator movie. Not even close, but I doubt this would be the title if released today. (Yep, Predators opens 7/9/10, but that's only after the established 1987 name was given.) Is this not one of the epitome of a Guy's Movie? Shallow plot, explosions, girl in distress, gun/knife battles, rippling muscles, aliens and Schwarzenegger. No wonder most call this a classic, though I would add: it's a DUDE's classic.The reason I don't call it a "real" classic, is because, I simply can't get past the incredibly paper-thin storyline. That's not to say it has an interesting concept about an out-of-this-world hunter, hunter-turned-prey, prey-turned-hero, etc. It did have some good graphics, and I admit when they wanted to put huge guys to be the best of the best in a jungle warfare setting fighting 3 enemies ? man, themselves and, of course, an alien, they succeeded in spades.If you're looking for a deeper Schwarzenegger classic, with just as much action, but with storyline and originality, you could do much better: The Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Total Recall and True Lies, to name a few.Wow, let's now tackle the incredibly deep plot: The elite group of soldiers are dropped behind enemy lines in the jungle on a search-and-rescue mission. Right off the bat, they realize they're in over their head when the targets are hanging, skinless and bloody, literally over their heads.Blaming nearby guerillas gives the film crew an excuse to have an extensive action scene and for Schwarzenegger say some "funny" but out of place one-liners. Wait, it might not be the newly slaughtered men. Could it be the entity that landed in a space ship shown in shot one? Duh, but we're not there yet. First they have to have the fight-amongst-themselves scenes, a hostage and the realizations as they're picked off one-by-one.Once all that's through, I believe, is where the movie gets better. Schwarzenegger calms his signature only-in-the-movies lines, and does battle with both brawn and brains, though the "setting the traps" does go on a little too long.Then again, despite the spin-offs and sequels, who better to really take on the Predator than Schwarzenegger? When the movie opened, and during the credits, I saw the name Alan Silvestri attached to the score and remembered that name. Without a second thought, or time, I was immediately reminded who he is and if you're as familiar or a fan of the Back to the Future trilogy as I am, you'll recognize his technique/style throughout the entire movie. From beginning to end. Every second.Unfortunately, that was tough getting through. Just like Danny Elfman is enormously recognizable with his music, so was Silvestri here. I like originality when it comes to composers, such as John Williams who envisions the project at hand and brings them to life with perfection and never duplicating.That didn't lower my overall rating, but it didn't help. (Much like Titanic's composer, James Horner, who barely lifted a muscle to change his Titanic score when "creating" the Avatar music.) I would recommend it, but it's definitely a leave-your-brain-at-the-door film. It won't change the world, but it did introduce a great character, The Predator, (with rules ? I did like that) to see more in films in the future (of 1987, that is.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why did I waste my time with this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was a kid Arnold Schwarzenegger was some kind of an icon to me. I loved the Terminator movies, I loved 'True Lies', I loved 'Commando'... You get the point. I loved nearly everything with Arnold in it. Even the movie where he was pregnant... How did I manage to miss one of his most iconic movies I will never know.Of course, I am talking about 'Predator'. A few years ago they aired it here on the TV but, sadly(luckily?) there was 'Rambo 2' on some of the other channels and I decided watching the Sly movie rather than the Arnold movie. I haven't watched TV for years.A few days ago I suddenly remembered that I wanted to see 'Predator' and, of course, I saw it immediately.I just shouldn't have done it. Sorry. It was very stupid, and, what is worse, it was the wrong kind of "stupid".Let me tell you what happened: The first five minutes looked promising. I really thought it was going to be a great movie. It had cool looking soldiers, cool tropic atmosphere, etc... During the first 30 minutes I had great fun with the movie. At the end of the first hour I still thought it was OK. But after that... By the time the final confrontation between The Arnold and The Predator happened I had started playing solos on my guitar using the movies' soundtrack as a backing track. Alan Silvestri did a great job, by the way... To sum it up - the movie went from great to very funny, from very funny to OK, from OK to "Why the hell am I wasting my time with this bore-fest?!" You may ask me why, and, of course, being the nice person that I am, I would respond to that question. As I already said, this movie was stupid. I don't have any problems with that. In fact, I love stupid action movies. They are funny. However even the dumbest action movie out there must have at least one character that I would root for. And that is the biggest problem of 'Predator'. There is NO such thing here. Sorry. 'Predator' is an example of how NOT to do character development. None of the characters was developed. We didn't know anything about their desires, nor we did know anything about their back story, nor we did know anything important about them - except the fact that The Black Dude was in love with Jesse Ventura's character and the Dude With The Glasses loved to talk about his girlfriends' private parts, and the Native American Dude was a native American. That is all. Really. Oh, and Jesse Ventura loved chewing tobacco. But really, there is pretty much NOTHING else. Now tell me, can an action movie be any good when its' main characters have less personality than action figures? The director and the actors should not be blamed - they did what they could with a script so utterly horrible it wouldn't be filmed even into a B-movie if the Universe was a better place than it is. The entire story of the movie can be summed up in ONE sentence and the characters are zero-dimensional. I will not spoil it here but you get the point.And you probably don't agree with me but that is fine. I am used to people thinking I am wrong.I was disappointed by this movie. Sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Looks like the only people inspired enough to comment on this movie are the people who love it, so I guess I'll be the voice of dissent-- I watched this for the first time after seeing the entire Alien series, as a way to prep for Alien vs Predator. I didn't expect much, especially after seeing the trailer, but I was surprised by how BORING this film is. The characters are completely two dimensional caricatures/stereotypes with no development whatsoever, the plot drags along, the only "action" is lots of shooting and marching around in the jungle, and the Predator doesn't even show up until an hour into the film. The lines are clich and there isn't an ounce of tension or investment into the characters--by the time the first twenty minutes were over, I was actually waiting (eagerly) for them to be killed.If you're into clichs, this movie is for you. If you'd prefer something with a bit more depth, stick with Alien (the original, NOT the sequel).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's consider what this movie predates (pun intended)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 5/10 rating is of course because "Predator" is only intended for Arnold Schwarzenegger's hard core fans; the arty crowd will consider it worthless. In this case, the future Governator plays Maj. Alan "Dutch" Schaeffer, leading a platoon into a jungle to stop a rebel army (har har), when they get besieged by an alien. Naturally, the movie is mostly an excuse for Ah-nuld to be as much of a bad-ass as possible.Of course, there's also the one-liners. Most famous is Blain's (Jesse Ventura, also a future governor) "I ain't got time to bleed", but there's also "Knock knock" after Dutch breaks into a rebel tent. It's weird to think that Elpidia Carrillo went from a dead serious, pro-revolutionary movie ("Salvador") to an Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle.All in all, we can probably all agree that this is nothing particularly special; mostly two hours of Ah-nuld kicking booty (and anti-revolutionary, just as Reagan probably liked). But as long as we understand that that's what it is, then there's really no harm done. Also starring Carl Weathers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pays homage to both "Alien" and "Aliens", but falls short of great cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a big fan of the movies Alien and Aliens, I was compelled to watch the so-called 5th Alien move, Alien vs Predator. AVP was not bad, it was fun. But, I had never seen Predator and wanted to see the back-fill. Now that I have, I cannot say that Predator is a bad piece of cinema.However, the accolades I've seen for it on IMDb are astonishing and unwarranted. This movie was neither Arnold's best, nor a superior sci-fi or action film. It was only mildly entertaining. I did not find myself drawn in by it, or caught up in the suspense.This is perhaps because I saw AVP ahead of time, or am completely jaded by the awesome movies that clearly inspired Predator: Alien and Aliens. Maybe I am disappointed that the set and setting were not other-worldly. To Predator's credit though, it pays homage to both Alien and Aliens while adding a fresh touch all it's own with the main characters' special effects.But c'mon guys... even if you first saw this when you were 15 years old, can you not recognize now that it is formulaic and mediocre? The story is unoriginal and the build-up is poor. Suspension of disbelief is shattered toward the end. Where did Dutch get all that stuff anyhow?If you like a good shoot-em-up, go ahead and watch it. The action sequences, for the most part, are easier to follow than average. But overall, I think I would have been happier spending my time re-watching the films that I believe are the inspiration for this picture. A rating of 6/10 for Predator is generous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Predator" starts out really good. From the beginning, this is a heavy testosterone macho-flick. That is confirmed already in the opening scene, where the camera zooms in on Arnold's and Carl Weather's arms (and muscles) when they're having a strength duel. It continues in the same style, with a team of soldiers wandering around in the jungle with 70+ kg. each of weapons and ammunition but with no further supplies or food. Who needs that when we have the biggest machine guns in the world, eh? Especially one really heavyweight machine gun that looks like it runs on gasoline. That one is operated by no other than Jesse Ventura. If I had said in 1987 that the two most extreme muscle-guys in this film would be governors, I think everyone had thought it was extremely funny and unlikely. After the first half of the film (who involves a really good action scene), the film turns to science-fiction. This part is really boring and bad, and destroys the movie's hope in getting a good ranking. Therefore: 5/10.</fullReview>

Anyone can hide in a dense jungle, but it isn't THAT easy to hide in a big city ("Look mommy, a ghost!"). The movie gives you a lot of those "I know you're out there, but I just can't see you".

		<fullReview>As action flicks go, this one's pretty typical. Arnold leads the usual band of expert musclemen into some tropical country on a mercy mission, or was it a mercenary mission, picks up a pretty young Latina (Elpidia Carillo) after a furious battle with well-armed swarthy guerrillas who make easy targets, and encounters a -- well, an alien, while on his way back to meet the chopper at the rendezvous.As Arnold pointed out at the time of release, you really get two movies for one. A regular excursion action flick and a science-fiction action flick.Boy, are these guys macho. (One of them is one of those North American Indians with an intuitive, spiritual collective unconscious who senses when the thing is nearby.) And they carry the ugliest guns ever seen on screen.It's the kind of "lost patrol" movie in which the characters get picked off one by one by an unseen enemy until, in this example, only Arnold and Carillo are left alive to hop on the chopper. The major difference between most examples of the genre and this one is that the other examples ordinarily take breathers and give the characters a chance to chat, so we get to know them a little. Not much time for that here. A coffee break would mean one less opportunity for the group to shred the banana plants with their slugs and grenades.The alien gave me a bit of a problem, I have to say. Here he is, all decked out in high-tech equipment including a helmet that gives his vision infra-red capabilities. (He presses Arnold's head up against a tree and examines it carefully through this heat-registering device and you can tell what great shape Arnold is in because his nose is cold.) He's also got some kind of rocket launchers built into his arms and carries some strap ons that enable him to heal quickly or, failing that, to set off an atomic explosion.All of that high-tech stuff didn't bother me. But his organic evolution hasn't seem to have kept up with his technology. Okay, he's got opposable thumbs. Thank heaven for small favors. And he's bipedal. But that's about it. How do you design and build delicate equipment like that when your fingers end in claws? And when he removes his helmet we see that his mouth is surrounded by four maxillapods, crab-like claws that can serve no other purpose than to shovel food into his diminutive mouth. They've invented space travel but not the fork? Finally, his hair is made up into dreadful dreadlocks, which looks pretty retro from our perspective.What's this alien doing here anyway? "He comes when the summer is hot," Elpidia intones. (A sissy after all.) He seems to be a trophy hunter. He skins the people he kills but then seems to do nothing with the body except burn it so he can add the skull to his collection. He fawns proudly over those skulls.Does he show any other values aside from the desire to kill other living beings and preserve their heads as trophies? What I mean is, does he have any NON-HUMAN traits? Well, actually no. While they are being pursued, Elpidia drops a weapon and Arnold stops her and says, "No! He didn't gill you befawh because you vair unahmed." Later on, though, he shows no such compunction about deciding to kill a wounded and unarmed Arnold. Then, too, when challenged directly by Arnold at the end, the alien unburdens himself of his technological accoutrements and faces Arnold hand to hand, raising the question of whether they have Roy Rogers movies on the place from whence the alien came.If you're a fan of action movies, Arnold, earth-bound science fiction, or any combination thereof, catch this one if you haven't seen it yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose that all of these "versus" movies have some redeeming qualities to them. They make the average moviegoer go and see the original movies. Before Freddy vs. Jason came out, I rented Friday the 13. And for Alien vs. Predator, I rented both of those movies. Alien's DVD was broken, so I watched Predator instead. Expecting a pretty good action/sci-fi along the lines of The Terminator, I was excited to watch this movie, hoping-nay, knowing-that it would be better than Alien vs. Predator. Was I right? Sure, but not by much.Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his commandos are sent to a jungle in Central America to rescue others, discover that there's worse things at work there instead of random bad guys the army has to kill. It turns out that the title thing, who can become invisible at will, is stalking and killing all of them. Guess who's the last one alive who has to kill it?The first 45 minutes of this film have nothing to do with the title being. Instead, it's this search-and-rescue mission that doesn't affect the outcome of the movie at all. Dutch and co. have to go in and kill a bunch of random people, the nationality doesn't matter, as long as they're not American. I suppose that's tolerable as long as the last hour is filled with thrills, gore, and fun. But considering what I just said, the last hour didn't have those things. Instead, what we have are a few, misplaced one-liners, a little generic action, followed by a lot of sitting around and talking. It's not even violent, it mainly consists of the cut-away kills that people don't like about the PG-13 action films. But when the people sit and talk, the dialogue isn't even interesting, it's a bunch of cursing and "Where's [name]?" Does anyone really care?Not being alive in 1987, I can only assume that the special effects must have been spectacular for the time. Now, they look generic. The costume of the Predator's alright, but nothing to write home about. Definitely the best part of the movie are the POV shots taken from the Predator. He obviously sees in heat, and even I was amazed by those effects. They also play the continuity with that well, while every other possible continuity error occurs throughout the film. For instance, at one shot, Dutch is completely covered in mud. The next? Clean. To sum things all up, Predator is a sloppily made action movie that's made superior from its "versus" movie because of the view of the Predator. Save your time and money by looking online for some screenshots from the movie. You'll thank me.My rating: 5/10Rated R for language and some violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERSYou're guilty of it, I'm guilty of it, we're all guilty of it. In what now seems aeons ago, we were all to blame for encouraging Schwarzenegger. We laughed at his bad acting and indecipherable accent, and even, in the 90s, let him think he was in on the joke. Of course, we drew the line at Last Action Hero (shame, I quite liked that one, but never mind...), yet Arnhuld had had a decent run of mindless action movies that, despite ourselves, we genuinely enjoyed.Nowadays, it's a mistake, a relic, like filofaxes or a digital watch. Most sane people are embarrassed to admit they ever watched an "Arnie" movie, Terminator excepted, much less enjoyed one. Predator is no different. Surprisingly, it wasn't one of the movies that Arnie did a sequel for, as it was his first big hit, earning considerably more than the Conan projects or the first Terminator. It saw him pushed up towards what now seems inconceivable superstardom, and is a typical macho tirade. A plotless pastiche of the Vietnam conflict, only with a seven-foot semi-transparent, green-blooded alien, it has characters that greet each other with an arm wrestle, call each other "son of a bitch" as a friendly nickname, and say things like "I ain't got time to bleed."Two things stick in my mind about this movie: one is that I was once naive enough to not really understand the "big as a house" joke and repeated it to my embarrassed mother; the other is that I couldn't tolerate more than fifteen minutes of it, so grating was it's dumb-as-you-like, testosterone-propelled dialogue. Seen in full, it's perhaps not that bad for throwaway entertainment, though I dispute Empire's recent claim that it's formula action trappings were supposed to be satirical of the genre.In Apocalypse Now a fleet of helicopters flew into the jungle to the overblown strain of Wagner's "Ride of the Valkrie". Here they do it to the jazzy-pop combo of Little Richard's "Long Tall Sally". In a bizarre sort of way, this is actually classier. The film saw the continuation of the "jokes" that Arnhuld woodenly tells, the "jokes" we used to convince ourselves we found funny. He gets five one-liners here: "stick around"; "knock, knock"; "oh, s**t"; "you're one ugly motherf****r" and "bad idea". As you can see, with first-rate material like that, its no wonder two writers were needed. (Intriguingly, one of the writers goes by the name of "John Thomas". No wonder all the characters are lead by their ...)The platoon are originally on a mission to rescue hostages. Of course, this being Arnie, he blows up the entire military camp, including the hostages they were supposed to be freeing; though this particular plot point is glossed over. Probably because it is a plot point, and plot isn't the governing factor here. Anyway, it soon turns out the men have another enemy in the guise of an infrared alien, and are gradually picked off one by one. While this obeys the basic tenets of horror, don't be fooled into thinking this is scary. Any chance of fear is vanquished by fairly standard direction and the artillery-lead pace. It's hard to be frightened when you've got huge guns and can blow down trees.Predator, more than the majority of Schwarzenegger's CV, still stands up as an okay-ish, no-brain shoot-em-'up. It doesn't have any real ambition or meaning, it just goes through ammo and a pedestrian storyline until the predictable outcome is met. At least we got a Schwarz who hadn't yet developed enough of an ego to object to being covered in mud. Though even if he had allowed his head to be shaved ten years later for Batman and Robin, would it have made a difference? A reasonable excursion though as Apollo Creed himself says to Arnie: "You got no style."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing special about this...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie was way back in 91. I was a little kid then, and I loved it. Now as an adult, I just watched this film for the first time in 5 years yesterday and I must say there is nothing special or great about this goofy film. It's a stupid kids film. Only immature people would find this film entertaining or great. And there are a lot of immature people who praised that this film was great. This film is just another remake of Alien or Aliens: This time it takes place in a jungle. Stupid one-liners, paper thin story, no characterization, and no sense of direction. After a huge shootout, the macho man solders trudge through the jungle with each soldier getting picked off one by one, until the last one left is Arnie. Of course at the end, he and the predator have a face off until there's one man left standing. This movie has aged terribly. The special effects are cheesy as the situations that endure throughout the entire picture. The only thing that I still like about this film, just like I did 15 years ago is the cool soundtrack by Alan Silvestri. The sequel Predator 2 is better and is more fun to watch. Though Danny Glover ain't no Schawarnegger.Did you know: Four of the macho men worked on my favorite show of all time Miami Vice!! Can you guess who?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Found It Tedious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are guns and other weapons a-blazing in this sci-fi "thriller" about an alien creature who's single-handedly wiping out an elite military team sent into the jungles of Central America to rescue some hostages. With all that, it sounds strange, but I found this tedious viewing all the way through. To me, it's most noteworthy for having two future US Governors in the cast. Jesse Ventura (future governor of Minnesota) played a small part, and Arnold Schwarzenegger (future governor of California) was the star. The story itself was repetitious all the way through, a traipse through the jungle while being stalked by a monster and the dialogue (as one might expect with this kind of movie) was weak. Schwarzenegger really was called upon to do very little except look tough - which, admittedly, he does well, and I wondered (as any thinking person would do) why the creature didn't just kill Dutch (Schwarzenegger) when it had him by the throat pinned against the tree? I suppose because that would have taken away the chance to have the really cool ending with a huge explosion and then Arnold standing victoriously in a macho pose as he looks around at the carnage. Tedious sums up all I need to say about this from my perspective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie delivers exactly what is promised to ACTION ACTION ACTION and it does action well. The infra red scenes were good for the time and ahigh point in the movie. It also had good music considering but where this movie fails is in the acting. True you don't go to this sort of film to see great acting, you go to see explosions so big that if you tried to do that you'd end up in a loony bin. And in a movie like this as long as the acting doesn't subtract from the action you don't care. In this film however the acting is so dismally that it's worthy of MST3K. That is what removed the excitement of a former governor firing a mini gun all over the place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical 80s Blockbuster Crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I can`t believe so many people love this film . Look at the premise : RAMBO meets ALIEN . What a simple wafer thin pitch that must have been . Worse than that any potential for generating nail biting tension is forgotten as the film concentrates on an all action comic book format and dialogue , it`s essential that everytime a bad guy gets killed - And seeing it`s the 1980s all bad guys are commies - big Arnie must make a wise crack like " Knock knock " . The rest of the cast aren`t served any better with lines which seems to be composed of either crude jokes or " Let`s kick some ass "!!!!! SPOILER !!!!!And PREDATOR contains what must be the dumbest scene in film history . While the survivors are trying to escape the alien one of the characters makes a brave rear guard action . There he is waiting at a bridge while he awaits the approaching alien . He has a M16 assault rifle with a built in M203 40 mm just the thing you`d want to take on a monster with murder on its mind . And what does he do ? He throws it away and pulls out a knife !!!! What an idiot . I`m glad he got killed since the collective IQ of humanity must have increased with his demise!!!!! END SPOILER !!!!And am I alone in thinking the directing is rather weak ? Many of the action scenes resemble those of THE A TEAM with bodies flying up in the air in slo-mo . Oh and in order to conceal the alien`s appearance much of the movie is filmed through the creature`s point of view , something that had been done to death in DOCTOR WHO by the mid 1970sSo I guess I`m alone in not liking PREDATOR . It`s by no means the worst film I`ve ever seen but it is extremely dumb and is typical of American films from the period which concentrated on style over substance in order to make money</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PREDATOR is one of the most trite action films ever. Almost everything about it is predictable. Not one genuine surprise in the whole film. The story itself never tries to go beyond it's B-movie premise: an alien (echoing ALIEN but looking like a Rastaman on steroids) arrives on earth to hunt humans for fun. The group the alien chooses to hunt are a bunch of soldiers (echoing the soldiers in ALIENS and Arnie in COMMANDO) who are on a mission in the middle of a jungle. The group is fairly large and once they figure out that the alien is there to kill them, they prepare to fight it, setting up booby traps all over the jungle. But then if you blink, you'll miss the part where everyone in the large group is killed, which, predictably, only leaves Arnold to fight mano a mano with the alien.The film and its B-movie story could have worked if the action was actually great. But it's not. It's all set-up. Aside from the typically overdone and unrealistic Rambo action at the beginning, once the action between humans and alien starts happening, it lasts maybe 10 minutes. And the climax is a total let-down: the alien blows himself up instead of dying in the hands of Arnie. No satisfactory "release" here. What's really bad about this stupid scene is that the alien is actually laughing as he's about to blow himself up. Watching the predator laugh like that was as alien as a big fat villain, who's in thew same predicament, laughing his head off in a James Bond movie.Boring characters, unimaginative story, inert action. The special effects are cheesy (the electrical sparks are really bad). The film's biggest letdown is the predator himself, who's an unimaginative creation: it looks silly, with the little pivoting gun on its shoulder. The predator is supposed to see things in a special way but it looks more blind than anything else. But worst of all, when the alien is invisible, well, everyone sees him! If I was the alien, I would ask for my money back for such a worthless cloaking device.In a fight between the alien in ALIEN and the predator, the alien would kick this loser's butt in a nanosecond.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a pile of...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, Predator is NOT Ah-nuld's best film, not by a long stretch of the imagination. That honour belongs to Total Recall, one of the few Ah-nuld films that can be described as intelligent. In fact, Predator is one of Ah-nuld's most ordinary films, especially in light of the comparison between he and his co-stars' macho posing in this film and the real actors in the sequel.There is one highlight of the acting in this film - Carl Weathers. His acting raises the bar above pantomime during the sequences he is in, but the story and character development don't give him a lot to work with. Granted, this is supposed to be an action film, but the best action films develop their characters to some extent during their running time. The recent X-Men feature is a great example of this.What's even more appalling is that actors from this film are winning positions in America's government. I thought they learned the lesson from when Ronald Reagan became president - actors do not make good leaders. Macho posturing worked in the film industry of the 1980s, but it is not what I'd like to see in government at any era.Unfortunately, as time goes on, it gets less and less kind to this film. Ah-nuld's track record has certainly gotten worse in the last ten years, with him obviously forgetting that people don't go the theatre in order to have some right-wing Fundie agenda pushed at them (eg End Of Days and The Sixth Day). None of the other actors have done anything memorable since, and it's probably just as well.All in all, I'm giving Predator 3 out of 10. It's entertaining to watch once or twice, but that's about the extent of it.</fullReview>
