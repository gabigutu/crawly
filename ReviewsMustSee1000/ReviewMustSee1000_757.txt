		<shortDescription>Spartacus or How I learnt to live away from Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Kubrick's farewell to Hollywood. I would have liked to be a fly on the wall. I don't believe for a minute that it was a cordial parting of the ways. I mean, Kubrick never returned, never! With "Paths of Glory" Kubrick gave Kirk Douglas, not just his best part as an actor, but his best movie. By the time Douglas called Kubrick to "take over" "Spartacus" Douglas was already a huge star with too much saying in the matter. Look at it, it's clear. "Spartacus" is more Douglas than Kubrick. Great fun to watch, yes, absolutely. A terrific script by black listed Dalton Trumbo. Some fight sequences unequalled in the history of film. Look at the fight between Douglas and Woody Strode and compare it to the ones in "Troy" or "Gladiator" for that matter. It is sad an embarrassing to realise how low we've fallen. Computer generated images or not. The cast is unbelievable but it's clearly not Kubrick's. The casting of his movies was part of his master plan. He would cast a Ryan O'Neil as Barry Lyndon for instance so he can blend perfectly with the magnificent tapestry, without adding any colours of his own. The same can be said of Keir Dullea, in 2001, a robotic non entity in a showdown with a voice. When he needed actors to be at the very pinnacle of his universe he went to Peter Sellers, Malcolm McDowell or James Mason. Even the casting of Tom Cruise made a lot of sense. He used the star and his wife to talk about the dreamlike powers of betrayal. In "Spartacus" Tony Curtis, plays Antoninus, a teacher of the classics. A campy idea never seen in a Kubrick film, before or since. To be fair, there are some spot on, brilliant pieces of casting. Charles Laughton is, as usual, superb. Peter Ustinov, terrific. Laurence Olivier manages to give a multifaceted portrait of weakness, fear and greed. Jean Simmons makes the reason to survive totally believable. But the cutesy love scene between her and a shiny muscular, coiffed Spartacus is truly terrible. As a final blow, the scene is enveloped in a sticky, corny music theme. Having said all that. Don't you dare missing this epic. I'ts Kubrick's goodbye to Hollywood and like everything else that the master said or do, he really meant it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Eternal Cry For Freedom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From what little I've read of this film it was lucky to have been made at all. Some very big talents had some very big egos and those egos clashed repeatedly. Original director Anthony Mann was replaced by Stanley Kubrick by Producer/Star Kirk Douglas among other clashes.But the result was all worth it. The stars all give top notch performances, but the mark of a really great film is the memorability of each individual in the ensemble. To give a few examples, Charles McGraw as the sadistic trainer at the gladiatorial school, John Dall as Sir Laurence Olivier's protégé, and John Ireland as Kirk Douglas's fellow gladiator trainee are all memorable in the brief roles they have.Kirk Douglas wisely opts for a straightforward interpretation of a hero in the title role of Spartacus. He's a BC everyman, born into a world which hadn't heard anything about human rights, he knows and feels he's not just cattle. Catch the alternating scenes of Douglas and Sir Laurence Olivier addressing the slave army and the Roman Army. Olivier with his years of Shakespearean training coming across as the tyrant to be, and Douglas in simple prose talking about the slaves fighting for their hopes and dreams. Very effective.The plot concerns a revolt at a gladiatorial school which mushrooms into a crisis for the Roman Empire. Political factions led by Olivier as Crassus and Charles Laughton as Gracchus seek to use the slave revolt to further their own ends. Laughton as always is a wonder. It's a bit of unusual casting for him because his parts are usually those of very tortured souls. His Gracchus is a sly rogue, but a decent man. One of my favorite movie lines of all time is delivered by him addressing the Roman Senate where he says he'll "take a little republican corruption for a little republican freedom." Another sly rogue in the film is Peter Ustinov who won the first of his two Oscars as Batiatus the owner of the gladiatorial school. Like so many others I'm sure in those days, he's just trying to come out on the winning side when doing so could be a life or death situation.Jean Simmons as Varinia, beloved of Spartacus, has the only woman's part of any substance. But when was Ms. Simmons bad in anything. One of the most underrated and under-appreciated actresses in the history of film.The lessons about man's desire for freedom and to control his own destiny are eternal and valid. And this film will be also.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Controlling Stanley: The Spartacus Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As most are undoubtedly aware this is the film that the director virtually expunged from his repertoire. But why did Stanley Kubrick really disown SPARTACUS (1960)? The answer can be summed up in two words: absolute control. Kubrick wanted total administrative as well as artistic authority over the making of the film about a revolt of gladiators and slaves in ancient Rome.But you will notice that Bryna Productions not only financed SPARTACUS but also an earlier film directed by Kubrick, PATHS OF GLORY (1958). Bryna was Kirk Douglas' film company and, as most filmgoers know, he was the star of both films. Besides having all the money to make the films, Douglas had artistic vision as well. Only three weeks into what would prove to be an incredibly complex and arduous production, Douglas fired venerable director Anthony Mann (RAW DEAL, RAILROADED,THE FURIES, THE NAKED SPUR, THE MAN FROM LARAMIE, MAN OF THE WEST, etc.) from SPARTACUS. With only two days notice, Kubrick was hired to replace him.Shooting PATHS OF GLORY, Douglas had confined his criticisms and objections to Kubrick's failed rewriting of the script (they went with the original screenplay). Douglas' complaints and artistic influence were far greater on SPARTACUS, much to Kubrick's chagrin. Though the director craved autonomy over every aspect of the film, Douglas would not budge. A tense compromise was reached but ultimately Douglas had the last word. Kubrick saw himself as just a hired gun. And he would never allow himself to be placed in this position again.Later, both men would complain about the film's outcome and each other. They never made another movie together. But SPARTACUS is no uneven patchwork of divergent ideas. The film is cohesive and arresting. At the restored version of three hours and eighteen minutes, there is practically no dead footage in the film. Dalton Trumbo's screenplay is surprisingly economical, with sharply drawn characters placed against the sweeping historical majesty and violent sociological tumult of ancient Rome. Quite plainly, the gloriously inventive music by Alex North is among the greatest scores ever written for a motion picture. And despite Kubrick's bad experience, he managed to guide the actors towards creating outstanding work (a best supporting actor Oscar for Peter Ustinov). He even transformed the very real enmity between Laughton and Olivier into an on-screen asset. His other contributions were considerable also (the large scale and power of the battle sequence, for example). In the end, for the film at least, the clash of giant egos proved fortuitous. Recommendations: for greater insight and detail on this and Kubrick's other films I urge you to seek out Jan Harlan's excellent documentary, STANLEY KUBRICK: A LIFE IN PICTURES, and Vincent LoBrutto's exhaustive, highly informative biography, STANLEY KUBRICK. For the producer's views on SPARTACUS and its director, take a gander at Kirk Douglas' very candid autobiography, THE RAGMAN'S SON.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Triumph of Spirit Over Oppression?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a historical epic, 'Spartacus' stands out from the crowd.The film has the basic theme of 'force' versus 'an idea'. One man - Spartacus- has the idea of freedom, which is pitted through his slave army against the entire force of the Roman Empire.In Spartacus's eventual defeat, force seems to be victorious, but we know with hindsight that it is Spartacus' idea that finally prevails, albeit long after his death, with the abolition of slavery. As the opening narration makes clear, as a young man Spartacus would dream of the death of slavery - "two thousand years before it finally would die." Kirk Douglas gives an inspiring performance as the brutalised and uneducated slave rising above his degradation to find love, leadership and high ideals.The film closely interweaves the fate of Spartacus with that of Roman politics. His slave rebellion contributes to the fall of Gracchus, the main Republican advocate, and the corresponding rise of authoritarian Crassus. In a way, Spartacus is portrayed as a catalyst for a new era of Roman dictatorship under the Caesars; by suppressing his slave rebellion, Rome sets itself irrevocably on a path away from Republic and freedom, and perhaps confirms its eventual downfall. Some historical licence, no doubt; but a thought-provoking concept.Unlike many other Roman epics such as 'Ben-Hur' and 'The Robe', the film does not have a Christian motif. However, 'Spartacus' epitomises the triumph of the human spirit in a way that few movies do. Even after his death, not only Spartacus' son but his spirit lives on,if only in man's perennial cry for freedom. The slave leader's resolve, and his will to freedom, remain true to the end.Considering that it was made in 1960, the film's confronting of hard themes is notable. For example, we have the hint of forbidden homosexual/ bisexual desires from Crassus to Antoninus; the seeming death and failure (but perhaps ultimate victory)for the hero, who traditionally should triumph; and unpleasant scenes involving battlefields and rows of crucified bodies.The movie is helped by an excellent cast, an evocative score and Stanley Kubrick's direction. The sets and costumes also show great attention to detail, so that ancient Roman society comes alive.Overall a most entertaining and inspiring movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The darkest historical epic. No dancing girls, no chariot races, filmed in sombre browns and reds. Nominally directed by Kubrick but Douglas, as a very 'hands on' producer was responsable for the operatic sweep of the film. I was astonished when revisiting the film in 1991 at the cinema at the bravery of the project-to have the hero cry several times, once even out of self pity and with a heart rending ending! The film has depth and weight, the characters are well drawn. The performances are almost flawless, Douglas managing as actor to create tension in each scene-Olivier, not withstanding his eyerolling mannerisms is perfectly cast. The minor parts are richly drawn-gravel voiced Charles McGraw, Herbert Lom and Woody Strode. The cinematography and music are flawless. Only John Dall as a very modern Glaberus and John Ireland as Crixus seem out of place. Ironically, despite the downbeat tone of the film it is impossible to watch it without being uplifted through your tears of compassion. Unofficialy remade as Braveheart...watch one after the other and you'll see the similarities in mood, theme and even the battle choreography. Spartacus would be my 'desert island' movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too sentimental, but beautiful... Wonderfully erotic and surprisingly moving...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Widely acclaimed for his serious ambitions and his uncompromising perfectionism, Stanley Kubrick has won for himself a unique degree of artistic freedom...Based on a true story of a slave revolt in 73 B.C., Dalton Trumbo's script mixes the melodrama with some quite moving moments... The film depicts the Roman era, the brutality of the slave system, gladiator combat and the decadence of Roman senators... What emerges from the screen is a passionate statement on behalf of freedom and men who are willing to die to overthrow oppressive governments...The credit for the film's style belongs to Stanley Kubrick, who handles scenes of intimacy and scenes of gigantic sweep with equal attention, illustrating the violence, brutality and corruption of both, the masters and the slaves, raising the question of freedom which justify the human cost...Kirk Douglas plays Spartacus the idealistic noble slave who believes he must struggle forever against tyranny and just by opposing tyranny he inspires his followers with his example...Spartacus' character, from a violent primitive rebel who hamstrung a foreman with his teeth, into a gladiator who fought desperately for life in the arena, into a revolutionary able to unite an amorphous mass of slaves and deserters, into a force which succeeded to defeat Rome's best trained armies, into a charismatic leader (with a vision) who forces a long-awaited revolt against the Roman empire...Two political rivals (Crassus and Gracchus) use the slave uprising threat to manipulate the Roman senate for their own ends: Crassus (played powerfully by Laurence Olivier) extorts 'a fee,' the dictatorial post of First Consul, Commander of all the legions of Italy as his price for releasing Rome from Spartacus... Crassus sees the defeat of Spartacus' army as a chance for him to seize power of the empire for himself... He tries to make the slaves betray Spartacus... He tries to win the love of Varinia, not merely to possess her, but as a form of victory over Spartacus... In his last confrontation with Spartacus, he is seen losing all his delusions of grandeur as he stands deeply wounded by the total disregard in which Spartacus holds him...Charles Laughton plays, with expertise, Gracchus, a generous Roman politician, soft and rich, able to get his Julius Caesar (John Gavin) elected leader of the Praetorian Guard to annoy Crassus' ambitions...The first hour of "Spartacus" contains many of the film's best moments : The operation of the gladiatorial school and its training program is impressive and also expressive... The gladiators school is tough but fair: The men are oiled, bathed, shaved, massaged and trained to fight... They are never allowed to kill... And for their good performances, they are even rewarded with the companionship of a young lady... In this degrading manner Spartacus meets Varinia (Jean Simmons-lovely as ever) and it is his love for her and his hatred for his captors that inadvertently sparks off an uprising and the gladiators break out...Particularly effective is the scene in which Crassus and his "capricious over-painted nymphs" (Nina Foch &amp; Joanna Barnes) ask to be entertained by the sight of two pairs fighting to the death... The scene summarizes the injustice of the situation, the cruelty of bondage and the insurrection becomes a triumph easy to understand...Nominated for six Academy Awards, and winning for Cinematography, Costume Design, Art Direction and Supporting Actor?Peter Ustinov. the motion picture contains no chariot races and no orgies but it still imparts the grandeur and the decay of ancient Rome... With a stirring musical score by Oscar nominee Alex North, "Spartacus," is masterfully directed by Kubrick...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very moving and compelling story of epic proportions. The plot is relentless, propelled by a dazzling screenplay. Kubrick draws some of the greatest performances of the cast, and fills the screen with images that fascinate throughout. Well paced for a movie of this magnitude.To those who complain of anachronisms and poetic license with historical events, I say to them, 'Remember, it is a movie.' To be truly accurate, the cast would be delivering their lines in Latin and ancient Greek, with English subtitles. Whatever Kubrick might lose with historical inaccuracies, he gains far more in his ability to convey the story to the viewer. Even though it is over forty years old, the film tells us more of the present day than it does of the past.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Wish Stanley Had Won</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:This movie, oddly, parallels A.I. but for a different reason. It is a hybrid of Kirk Douglas and Stanley Kubrick. Young people, Kubrick, probably the greatest American director, wanted a deep penetrating analysis of war and slavery evocative of Paths Of Glory. He and Kirk had worked well together on that film; so Kirk got the studio to go for the project. During making this movie war broke out and not in front of the camera. Stanley went to the studio but he was just starting out; Kirk had a lot more pull. He won and the great movie that you can see traces of was obliterated and replaced with a prosaic action movie. Kirk also thought we should hear endless speeches and scenes of them wandering that would have made Ceil B. DeMille say,"Cut, that is enough wandering crap, we are boring people." It is clear Stanley did the best part of the movie, the training camp and revolt. I own all of Kubrick's movies and I can assure you he never has long boring scenes of magic shows, people going from place to place ad nauseum. Forgive me, the I Am Spartacus did not come from the pen of the darkest misanthropist who ever lived. He makes me look like Gene Roddenberry. Does this look like the man who has the general in Paths say,"The men died gloriously, sometimes some one does something that spoils the whole undertaking.."When you are watching this movie, like A.I., you can see traces of the Kubrick movie that never got made. The first half is worth owning the movie for, the training camp and the revolt. Both are filed with the usual Stanley, man's boundless cruelty to each other, I assure you the scene where Strode could have killed Douglas but spares him and tries to kill the patrician slime: That is Quintessential Stanley. The weakness of the film is the eternal scenes of wandering and the Kirk Douglas what a man I am show. The one with I Am Spartacus may be remembered, yes it is good, but find me a parallel humanistic scene of human nobility in any other Stanley Kubrick film. That is all Kirk Douglas, and forgive me, it is not Spartacus that is being canonized. The battle scenes, leaving aside the sneakers on their feet, are way too drawn out and boring. Do we need to see the Roman formation for a half an hour as it creeps towards the slaves lines?Douglas while a great actor was an incompetent director. You can see the damage; he has no grasp of pacing or relevancy to the plot. One or two wandering scenes are sufficient more is boring. However noble the I Am Spartacus is, coincidentally it is a tad self aggrandizing. Like A.I. the movie is a hybrid of a legendary director and an actor in over his head. I own the movie for the Kubrick parts believe me even half of a Stanley Kubrick movie is worth owning. Also, Douglas, while incompetent, does not wreck the movie like Stevie does to A.I. Despite this, you cannot but wish Stanley had won. Imagine if the rest of this classic, mirrored the first half. The wandering scenes can be done well compare these to the ones in DeMille's The Ten Commandments. Notice how we do not see eternal perambulation like we do here. He was a terrible director and he did real damage to Stanley's movie. I heard Kubrick fought to have his name taken off of the movie. His standards, 1000s of takes, were not even remotely met here. Half of a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The World of Stanley Kubrick: Director for hire.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spartacus (1960) was a director for hire gig for Stanley Kubrick. Kirk Douglas was in a pinch for his next film project. He was making an epic film about a slave in the roman republic who rebels against his masters. Anthony Mann stepped down from the director's chair and Mr. Douglas needed someone to take over. Enters Stanley Kubrick. Although he has little creative input (i.e. script and story wise) he manages to make a compelling movie with his keen eye and directorial abilities.Filmed in a grand scope and in such great detail, Spartacus is eye candy for fans of epic film making. I can only imagine what the film would have been like if he had total control over the project. Kirk Douglas is the man as Spartacus, Tony Curtis is quite good as his sidekick, Charles Laughton is wise and witty as the elder senator, Peter Ustinov is a hoot in his role as the poor victim of fortunate (and unfortunate) circumstance and Sir Laurence Olivier shows why he was the premier actor of his day as Crassus.Highly recommended for Kirk Douglas fans and Stanley Kubrick philes.</fullReview>

Kirk Douglas said it was the greatest analysis of film-making ever. He explains the purpose of every scene, very openly and honestly critiquing the changes the actors made, for (in his estimation) better or worse.There is another track of commentary by the actors. The actors had an unusual degree of latitude in re-writing their lines and forming their characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bit Long, But A Solid Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't "Ben-Hur," but it's no slouch, either. It's a no-nonsense dramatic tale of a slave who leads a revolt against Rome, is successful in building the movement from almost nothing to an army of thousands, only to be beaten and literally crucified in the end.....but leaving his mark, to use a cliché, on history.The prelude to the final battle scene is awesome-looking when you see all the soldiers lined up. I liked the fact they didn't overdo the action scenes, which they could easily have done employing a cast of thousands. While they cut those down, they cut down on the overall length of the movie which was over three hours long. At two-and-a-half hours this would have been much easier to view.Kirk Douglas, as "Spartacus," the leader of that revolt, was excellent and Peter Ustinov shines, too. The dialog given Ustinov and Charles Laughton was intelligent. This movie also featured the acting talents of Jean Simmons, Laurence Olivier, Tony Curtis and John Gavin. Not bad, eh? A solid adventure story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Based on a historical slave revolt in areas controlled by Republican Rome, it is a story of both tragedy and triumph.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you saw the movie, read the book (by Howard Fast) and if you have read the book, see the movie and see that they fit seamlessly together without major deviations.The most memorable scenes are of course those of the final battle with the eerie and chilling sound of the clink, clink, clink of armor as the Roman infantry marches into intricate battle positions. I believe soldiers of the Spanish army were used as extras for this movie.The most memorable line is that of Crassus (Olivier) as he impresses upon Antoninus, the slave (Tony Curtis), the strength of the Roman Republic. He gazes at a cohort of soldiers with their massive pilae (spears or spikes)and their bronze shields marching pass his villa at night. "There Antoninus, goes the might and power of Rome. Nothing can withstand it...........how much more a mere boy?" And at that point Antoninus, whom he had been trying to seduce into a homosexual tryst with oblique erotic talk referring to "snails and oysters," escaped to join the rebelling army of slaves led by Spartacus.Made just as the various civil rights organizations were starting to cohere, one wonders if this epic movie which highlighted the injustice of slavery, had an impact on American society which finally acknowledged and did something about its gross violations of human rights based on skin color.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An idealized and dull version of Spartacus.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watched it again, nearly twenty years later, and I can't say I warmed to it much. I certainly didn't expect Ancient Rome to be shown in such a dark way as in "Caligula" (especially not in 1960), but the story of the slaves who rebelled goes into the other extreme: it's pure Hollywood nonsense, unfortunately. Spartacus isn't bloodthirsty or ruthless enough; he is more like Moses than an ex-slave/gladiator. Out of all the slave women in Ancient Rome, Olivier has to have the one, i.e. has to fall for the exact same one that Spartacus loves. That is just a little too corny for my taste. The first third, with the training and the rebellion, is actually good, but from then on the pace is much too slow, there are some needless scenes, and the movie gets increasingly unrealistic. Plus, the ending is a downer. ("Braveheart", which is similar in its basic premise, length, and that it has also a downer ending, grips you; "Spartacus" does nothing of the sort.) The casting is very good, though, with Olivier and Ustinov being particularly good. I see nothing here that would suggest that the best director of all time is behind the camera. Then again, Kubrick was only hired to direct this; i.e. this film wasn't one of his produce/direct/write projects. Also, it was years before he developed his unique style. It's his next movie. "Lolita", that started a string of major classics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.For decades, filmmakers have fallen into three camps:--those that believe film is a simple entertainment medium focused primarily on storytelling--those who function as artists in what they consider the newest and possibly most powerful art--those that recognize the other two, but see film as as a means for conveying a message, beit journalism, essay or propagandaKirk Douglas was clearly in the third camp. A solid American, this is his personal commitment to liberal American values, seasoned by his zionism. The context was a dangerously paranoid government apparatus that was slipping very close to fascism. Douglas was a major player at the time, and he is behind what we see here: good and evil; slavery and freedom; the power of a righteous stand. Not only is it explicit in the story, and his performance, but in the way the film was made and the collaborators selected. What makes this a mess is that there is a fundamental mismatch with watching through Kubrick's eye. He was brought in after production started and disowned the film on completion. He is clearly in the `art' camp, possibly America's best example. Incidentally, in recent years Douglas has shifted his membership retroactively to the `mere storyteller' role in a speech to the National Press Club and his book.Sort of takes the honor out the principled stand, doesn't it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPARTACUS: a flawed masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a student of Roman history, I generally cast a jaundiced eye on Hollywood epics dwelling on ancient Rome. They're either camp, like "QUO VADIS" (Robert Taylor's impersonation of an actor is particularly unsettling), or badly researched and preachy, like the incredibly overrated, "BEN-HUR" (starring Charlton Heston, and his flying circus of facial tics). Given Hollywood's miserable track record in handing out awards (i.e., "How Green was my Valley" over "Citizen Kane"??? --- enough said), it is telling that "Ben-Hur" snagged 11 Oscars, including Chuck's, but "Spartacus" was virtually ignored (Ustinov's wonderful rendering of Lentulus Batiatus excepted).And yet, as history, "Spartacus" is a terrific film. There are, inevitably, inconsistencies: the real Gracchus (played by Charles Laughton), was dead fifty years before Spartacus' rebellion occurred and Spartacus himself died in the film's final battle - he was NOT crucified, an imaginary incident conjured by Douglas to allow for a heart-breaking farewell scene with Jean Simmons - this is regrettable, but forgivable, dramatic license. Overall, however, "Spartacus" is one of the few films that can withstand historical scrutiny. In one of many brilliant scenes, Olivier and his brother-in-law, spectators at the gladiatorial school run by Ustinov, cavalierly discuss politics, oblivious to the fact that, in the arena below, two men are fighting for their lives. Their detachment from the slaughter being perpetrated, ostensibly for their amusement, is a vivid and unforgettable reminder that barbarism once passed for entertainment. And the now-"Un-infamous" scene where Tony Curtis and Olivier make homoerotic small talk is not only tame by today's standards, but quite realistic, given what we now know of the bisexual nature of many upper-class Roman men in the first century B.C.E.There is one other flaw in "Spartacus": namely the sanctimonious condemnation of slavery in the opening narration. Nearly all of Hollywood's films about ancient Rome -- indeed, the ancient world in general -- incorporate this tired, pompous disclaimer about slavery and the pernicious effect it had on whatever civilization is being targeted: we need to be reminded that here, in the USA, the evil that was slavery flourished for a hundred years, as it flourished for centuries in Britain, Russia, Spain, and China: the United States of America endorsed and approved slavery, and certain areas in this country still tolerate racism, misogyny, and homophobia -- but we would resent any entity that would consider those flaws an embodiment of the American Mind. Oppression was no more typical of the Roman Empire than Mississippi is typical of the United States (thank GOD!). We should remember that before we condemn a culture that survived for over 2200 years (from the founding of Rome in 753 BCE to the fall of Constantinople in 1453 CE). Finally, Alex North's wind-and-brass-besotted, jagged score is wonderfully appropriate and especially effective in the military scenes. This is one of the few films I felt compelled to buy, so as to have my own copy. It is flawed, but only because Douglas aimed so high, and it remains one of the few films that I term, "great."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It moves with spurts of candor and lapses into ennui. I originally saw this movie with my Latin teacher. She was as unimpressed with much of it as I am today. At the time, I thought it wasn't bad. But I knew there were a lot of factually incorrect parts of the plot and characters. That's a needless flaw. I just saw the longer version on cable tonight. Loved the gay sex scene (implied) between Olivier and Curtis. WAAAAy ahead of its time.... and didn't make it in 1960. Although the opening scenes up through the revolt are reasonably good along with the sets and the scenes of Rome pretty good, the movie then devolves into a sort of Roman Westward Ho. There are so many factual errors, not to mention the psychology of the characters being more 20th century than 1st BC. It's a grand spectacle, but unfortunately mostly filled with hot air. A great cast of course with Laughton, Olivier and even Douglas... plus the ever conniving Ustinov. Jean Simmons looks like she's just waiting for the 4:05 express bus to Burbank, most of the time. I did like it that a Jew wrote the book at a time when he was oppressed in America and another Jew played the main character who was being oppressed... a lot of symmetry there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rome Epic Roams Too Much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Spartacus" has its moments but feels for the most part like what it is: An overblown epic with too many cooks stirring the pot.It's shortly before the dawn of the Christian era, and somewhere in the vastness of the Roman Empire, a slave named Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) is forced to become a gladiator, providing kill-or-be-killed entertainment for leisured decadents. Alas, he is pushed too far, and leads a revolt that soon threatens great Rome herself. Will Spartacus lead his people to freedom? Or will the vile Crassus (Laurence Olivier) bring him to heel?Nominally directed by Stanley Kubrick, for which this was his introduction to the big-time, "Spartacus" is in fact a shining example of limitations, both of the Hollywood star vehicle as art form and the ability of a 1960 film to come to grips with the ancient world. How best to condense the social upheaval of the Third Servile War? Why, how about Kirk and Jean Simmons smooching at a pond!The film starts off well enough, with Douglas in fine fettle glowering at the camera and everyone else, especially trainer/tormentor Marcellus (Charles McGraw). In a sequence that obviously influenced the later Best Picture winner "Gladiator", Spartacus learns the ropes, makes some friends, and begins to want to do something about the injustice he is experiencing. The first hour concludes in the film's only great moment, a duel between Spartacus and the mysterious Draba (Woody Strode) for Crassus's cruel enjoyment.Once Spartacus rebels, however, the film goes to pot. Douglas loses the fire while Kubrick loses interest in Spartacus's story, becoming engaged only when the scene shifts to Rome, where the aristocratic Crassus battles with the plebian Gracchus (Charles Laughton) for the city's soul, and Spartacus's former owner Lentulus Batiatus (Peter Ustinov) finds himself in the unhappy role of political pawn.Ustinov's performance was the only Oscar-winning one in any Kubrick film, and he's great both as a bridge between the two story arcs and as low-key comic relief, playing off the high dungeon of everyone else. The problem with "Spartacus" is you also have some Golden Turkey performances, too, like those of Simmons, John Dahl, John Ireland, and John Gavin.Olivier may be the best thing in the film, in those moments when he is at the center of it. Playing Crassus as if he were Roy Cohn in a toga, he plumps quite convincingly as he makes sheep eyes at slave boy Tony Curtis and displays a patriotic narcissism in uncovering his lusts: "There is only one way to deal with Rome, Antoninus. You must serve her. You must abase yourself before her."Nothing else sticks quite like that (and that only because the restored version on the Criterion DVD put back an excised scene of Crassus and Antoninus in a bath, which explains what the old Roman meant by "abase".) Whenever the movie goes back to Spartacus and company, its hard watching as Douglas smiles a lot and moves through adoring crowds like John F. Kennedy at a campaign stop. We are told a lot of Spartacus's skill as a commander, but the battles all occur off-screen, with the one exception being the final one, a clumsy set-piece that compares badly to the spectacle of less-heralded "sword-and-sandals" pictures.Not uninteresting, especially as the Criterion DVD includes many commentaries and supplements that enrich the experience of the movie. It's just that for a director of such discipline as Kubrick, "Spartacus" is all over the map. It's no mystery why he largely disowned this film after its release; it really was never his picture in the first place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contrast. Kubrick applies it in this story, making use of the dictatorial might of Rome revealed in Crassus (Olivier) and the longing to be free, as portrayed by the slave Spartacus (Douglas). Although we may understand Crassus's maniacal love for Rome, Kubrick allows us to recognize through Spartacus, our own rational passion for freedom.Story telling aside, imagery is also used to contrast ideas. A casual discussion between Roman dignitaries in the foreground, coldly indifferent to gladiators fighting to the death in the background, contrasts adequately both human decadence and desperation. More importantly, since our attention is on the fight, their inattention is accentuated, defining cool depravity. Throughout the film, decency and depravity are displayed. The love affair between Spartacus and Varinia is among the most passionate I have ever seen on film, with little, if any, sexual innuendo. Evil is manifested in casualness: As two Roman women sip on wine, they coolly select the men that they will watch try to butcher one another. It is as if Kubrick possesses the desire to present on film the fundamental nature of an idea, or perhaps, the very best example of it. He certainly had the ability.Spartacus ends with bittersweet imagery. As an eleven-year-old, it was difficult to see the hero die, crucified. But now, when I study the pain-staking attention to cinematic perspective that places the climax of the story in the background where all my attention is instinctively focused, I realize that I was not only influenced by emotional story-telling, but by remarkable visual imagery</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Film, Brilliantly Portrayed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Until Shakespeare in Love came out, this was my number one movie. It still stands the test of time.Acccurately described as "The Thinking Man's Epic," this film should be must viewing for everyone who wonders why "progressivism" will never lose its appeal. The villains are brilliant in their belief that "Rome is an eternal thought in the mind of god." (Crassus. He died, by the way, by having molten gold poured down his throat.) And the heroes are united in their belief that "The finest wine comes from home, wherever it is." Spartacus has, in its own way, become almost a cliché - its "I'm Spartacus" lampooned in an Academy Award lead in and the whole movie replayed as Braveheart. (Witness the sound effects as the shields slap into position during the charge. Mel Gibson admitted to stealing it.) But I defy any thinking person to watch the movie and not tear up: at the scene where Spartacus tells his army, "I know that we're brothers. And I know that we're free. WE MARCH TONIGHT." At the scene where he kills Antoninus, with the words, "I love you, Antoninus, as I love the son I'll never see." And at the end scene, where Jean Simmons - transcendently beautiful - shows the dying, crucified hero his son and says, "It's your son, Spartacus. He's free." In an age when we are so willing to trade our freedom in for the illusion of safety, the message of Spartacus - the movie, and the true historical character - will remain forever uplifting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sword and sandal epic that has everything.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spartacus is the Thracian slave who refused to be a Roman plaything, breaking out of their clutches he led the slave revolt that panicked the Roman Rebublic in circa BC 73, this film is based on that period in history.Spartacus got off to a troubled start, original director Anthony Mann was fired by leading man Kirk Douglas (Spartacus) after a falling out, some of Mann's work does remain in the final picture, tho, notably some of the early scenes in the desert are thought to be at Mann's direction. In came then director for hire Stanley Kubrick, who along with Douglas crafted arguably the greatest sword and sandal epic to have ever been made. One that holds up today as the one any prospective new viewers to the genre should seek out. Adapted by Dalton Trumbo from Howard Fast's novel (whilst also tapping from Arthur Koestler's novel, The Gladiators), Spartacus is a stirring experience highlighting the power of unity when faced in opposition to a tyrannical force. It's also boasting a number of intelligent and firmly engaging strands that are a credit to the excellent writing from the once blacklisted Trumbo. Politics figure prominently, whilst the story has a pulsing romantic heart beating amongst the blood and power struggles that are unfolding. Brotherhood bonds within the slave army are firmly established, and the love story axis between Spartacus and Varinia is very fully formed. We are in short set up perfectly for when the film shifts its emphasis in the second half.So many great sequences are in this picture, the gladiator training school as Spartacus and his fellow slaves find that they have dignity within themselves; forced thru a tough regime designed to set them up for blood sport entertainment to the watching republic hierarchy. The break out itself is tremendous for its potency, but even that is playing second fiddle to the main battle sequence that Kubrick excellently put together. The Roman legions forming in military precision is memorable in the extreme (this before CGI, with Kubrick's directing of all those extras being worthy of extra praise from us). Then with the battle itself raging one can only say it's breath taking and definitely a genre high point. Then of course there is the sentimental aspects of Spartacus. Kubrick of course was never known for his warmness, but with the aid of Douglas they get it right and manage to pull the heart strings whilst simultaneously pumping stirring the blood via the action. Right up to the incredibly poignant and classical ending that stands the test of time as being cinematic gold. The cast are wonderfully put together, Douglas is fabulous as Spartacus, big, lean and brooding with emotion, very much a career highlight as far as I'm concerned. Laurence Olivier takes up chief bad guy villainy duties as Marcus Crassus, just about the right amount of sneering camp required for such a dislikable character. Peter Ustinov (Best Supporting Actor Winner) is in his pomp as Batiatus, Jean Simmons (perfectly bone structured face) plays off Douglas expertly as Varinia, with Tony Curtis (Antoninus), John Gavin (Julius Caesar) and Charles Laughton (Graccus) adding impetus to this wonderful picture.Spartacus also won Academy Awards for Best Color Cinematography, Best Art and Set Direction and Best Costume Design, with nominations rightly going to Alex North for his score and Robert Lawrence for his editing. It's a special film is Spartacus, excellently put together and thematically dynamite. Which while also being technically adroit, it's ultimately with the story itself that it truly wins out. Even allowing for some standard Hollywood additions to the real story (Spartacus most certainly didn't meet his maker the way the film says), it's emotionally charged and as inspiring as it is as sadly tragic. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What surprised me was to see this movie #160 on this list... What a shame!!! The taste of public is really rotten to the core! When I compare old Hollywood movies and first of all, Spartacus, with contemporary remakes or new movies about ancient world I feel like I compare pure 100% gold with a fake one where is nothing but color left but essential qualities of good old movies which made them masterpieces are not there... What makes such movies like Spartacus true masterpieces is a combination of everlasting ideals, brilliant performance, personalities of actors, and a strong feeling of LIVING AMONG the characters at the same time when they lived... The idea of slavery and freedom is at the core of this movie and is present in almost every scene and every dialog. These two phenomena do not belong to our past: even in economical sense slavery is still a reality in some countries. And in much wider sense slavery is still a problem among humans: whether it a straightforward behavior of a superior suggesting a complete power over the subordinate, or a mental slavery, a submission to some ideas, noble or false and anti-human... Each word of each character in this movie carries a load which contributes to a powerful effect it produces on an attentive viewer. And if each word is uttered in such a brilliant way by Kirk Douglas, Jean Simmons, and other great masters against the perfectly designed background, all of it makes this movie an indelible experience... I agree with others who mentioned that K. Douglas deserves an Oscar for his stellar performance. It is, however, neither first nor the last time when injustice has been committed in this world...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the Greatest Ever Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spartacus, the Roman gladiator who led the slave revolt known as the Third Servile War, has long been a cult hero of the Left. The Communist movement which attempted to seize power in Weimar Germany was known as the Spartacist League, a ballet about him was composed by the Soviet composer Aram Khachaturian and Eastern European countries during the Communist era used to hold mass gymnastic displays known as "spartakiads" in his honour. It is therefore surprising that a Hollywood film about him was made at the height of the Cold War, even though epics on Classical and Biblical themes were highly popular during this period.The film can be seen as the projection of modern political ideas back to Ancient Rome, but those ideas, however, are not necessarily Communist ones, although the scriptwriter Dalton Trumbo undoubtedly had Marxist sympathies. Certainly, Spartacus is portrayed by Kirk Douglas as a noble idealist, but the ideals he represents are more those of 1776 or 1861-65 than those of 1917. The film does not attempt to analyse Roman slavery in Marxist terms. The rebellion of the slaves is not seen in terms of class struggle, but rather of a revolt against tyranny. The two rival Roman leaders, who try and turn the slave rebellion to their advantage, can be seen as representing two types of Fascist. Gracchus, who talks of Republican freedom but who has no objections to slavery, is a plebeian demagogue of the Mussolini type; Crassus, disgusted by political corruption and hoping to impose his version of order on the state at sword-point, is a patrician soldier more akin to Franco. Spartacus and his followers, by contrast, have no ambition other than that of returning to their homes to live peacefully as free men. Spartacus's conversations with his wife Varinia and his friend Antoninus are not about politics but about the simple pleasures of life- love, poetry, nature.Most previous epics, even if not based directly on the Bible, had an explicitly Christian theme. "Quo Vadis?", "The Robe" and "Ben-Hur", all linked the history of Rome to the birth of the new religion. "Spartacus" is set some seventy years before the birth of Christ, so cannot be explicitly Christian, but even here there is an implied Christian subtext. (This was not, however, the first epic to deal with Christian themes by implication; "The Egyptian" draws implied parallels between Christianity and the philosophy of the heretical Pharaoh Akhenaten). The film is not always historically accurate, and in one of its deviations from known historical fact, Spartacus does not die in battle, but is captured and crucified. Crucifixion was a common method of execution in Roman times, but today it is such a powerful Christian symbol that it cannot be depicted without evoking the Passion of Christ. Spartacus becomes a symbolic Christ-figure, a man who has been defeated in worldly terms, yet who in death holds out the hope of freedom for others. The famous "I'm Spartacus" scene can be seen, literally, as a demonstration of his men's loyalty to him, and as a symbolic representation of the fact that his ideals live in us all.The film clearly deals with some weighty intellectual topics, far more so than did the average epic of this period. Fortunately, it is well served by an intelligent script and some equally intelligent performances by most of the main players which enable it to do justice to these themes. This intellectual ambition and the film's well-developed characters, have led to it being held in high regard today, although it was perhaps not so highly regarded when it first came out. It did not, for example, garner nearly so many Oscar nominations as "Ben-Hur" had done the previous year. It did win three technical awards, plus "Best Supporting Actor" for Peter Ustinov, something that has always surprised me because Ustinov's was not the best performance by a supporting actor in 1960. Indeed, it was not even the best supporting performance in "Spartacus" itself; I preferred Charles Laughton's devious Gracchus, a man who finds some dignity and a spark of humanity when he finally realises that he has been outmanoeuvred, and Laurence Olivier's Crassus, whose dignified aristocratic exterior hides a ruthless and cynical nature. Ustinov was much in demand in epic films (he also featured in "Quo Vadis?"and "The Egyptian", but his style of acting seems too mannered to be convincing today. I have never imagined Roman gladiator trainers as obsequious, effete and slightly camp British public schoolboys, which is how Lentulus comes across; I found Oliver Reed's interpretation of a similar role in "Gladiator" much more convincing.What really surprises me, however, is that there was no "Best Actor" nomination for the upright and dignified Kirk Douglas, no "Best Actress" for the lovely Jean Simmons and no "Best Picture" for the film as a whole. The one thing I did not like about the film was the notorious "snails and oysters" scene which I felt should have remained on the cutting-room floor rather than being restored to the film in 1991. That apart, however, I found this a highly impressive film. Its director Stanley Kubrick appears not to have cared for it too much- his main complaint seems to have been that he was not given the complete artistic control over the project that he later came to take for granted. Films produced by "auteur" directors, however, are not necessarily superior to those made by a studio system, and artists are not always the best judges of their own work. (Tchaikovsky, for example, often undervalued what are today regarded as his greatest compositions). For me, "Spartacus" is perhaps the greatest epic ever made, beating even "Gladiator" and Charlton Heston's trilogy of "The Ten Commandments", "Ben-Hur" and "El Cid", and equal in quality to anything in Kubrick's later work. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Spartacus" is an overrated spectacle whose parts (and there are many good ones) are better than its whole.It starts out well with Douglas becoming a gladiator and learning the ins and outs of the business. But after the revolt, all the slave scenes become unbearably tedious.The Romans steal the movie. The politics, the backstabbing, the jockeying. The Romans also are better actors, and their scenes are done with a wry humor. In one scene with Peter Ustinov's and Charles Laughton's characters are sharing a meal, and each of the actors desperately trying to outact each other -- and better acting you're rarely likely to see as the old ham and the up and coming ham both try to steal the scene.Olivier's Crassus is also notable. In fact, some of the slave scenes are so cloying and tiresome one winds up rooting for the Romans. The slaves scenes are enlivened occasionally by the arrival of Herbert Lom (Inspector Dreyfus). So, many good scenes (especially the climactic battle), many good performances, some fine writing here and there, but ultimately boring with the people who should be most interesting and sympathetic, the revolting slaves who are willing to die for the cause of freedom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie Due To Its Romantic Ideals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did you know that Karl Marx hero was Spartacus ? There's something deeply ironic about this because the film version of SPARTACUS has so many Marxist ideals it could have been subtitled " THE STORY OF AN ENLIGHTENED PROLETERIAN HERO " As film buffs may know the screenwriter of SPARTACUS Dalton Trumbo was blacklisted by the Hollywood studio system because of alleged communist sympathies and it's impossible not to notice that Trumbo has done a sort of leftist inversion of John Ford's " Always make the legend " mantra . As a history lesson SPARTACUS is rather poor , if you look up the goofs on this page you'll notice that no one has really bothered to their home work as to the history , politics and machinations of ancient Rome with perhaps the most striking piece of speculation is the myth that Spartacus was from a Greek province sold into slavery when it's far more likely he was a Roman legionnaire who was sent to gladiator school but I guess the being sold into slavery makes for a better story But this very simplistic black and white view of history can be forgiven because it's what makes SPARTACUS a great movie , we know who the bad guys are and why they're bad guys ( They're rich and cruel ) and we know who the good guys are and why they're good guys ( They're poor but noble ) and therefore the audience know instantly whose side they're on SPARTACUS is also a film famous because its director Stanley Kubrick supposedly hated it mainly down to the fact that he didn't have any involvement in the screenplay . What ? A director dislikes a movie of this standard ? I'm certain Spielberg or Scorsese would have killed to make a movie this good . It contains fine performances from all the cast but the stand outs are Douglas , Simmons , Laughton ( Someone else alleged to have had leftist sympathies ) Olivier and Ustinov , so many fine actors in one movie and you don't notice how many different accents used until it's pointed out to you . Check out those battle scenes at the end and remember this was long before CGI so these were real people making up the slave and Roman armies but for me the greatest scene of the film and one of the most haunting scenes I have ever seen is where Woody Strode and Kirk Douglas sit facing each other waiting to go into the arena . What makes it even more spellbinding is that there's no dialogue at all , we only hear the sounds of the previous contestants fighting to the death Without doubt a movie that deserves to be in the IMDb Top 250 Movies list and possibly Kubrick's best film , he certainly didn't make anything as good as this ever again . But it's a movie that was ignored for most of the major awards at that years Oscar nominations . I guess that because the Oscars are a celebration of American film making talent they didn't want to give awards to movies celebrating communist heroes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not A Complete Kubrick Film, But His Traits Are All There</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The very modest Stanley Kubrick never gave himself full credit to the contributions in making "Spartacus", which makes sense because he was not in full creative control. The main individual behind most of the project is actor/producer Kirk Douglas (Douglas was also the man who was responsible for hiring Kubrick a week after the filming had begun). Still of the sequences, the themes and the characters have the feeling and symbolism that Kubrick possessed in the four decades he had as a director.Based on a historical novel by Howard Fast, which was based on actual events, "Spartacus" tells the tale of a slave as he trains to become a gladiator who then emerges as a leader of an epical slave uprising in the Roman Republic. Spartacus (Douglas) is a brave and loyal individual who has strong admiration towards his people much like Christ, only the setting of this movie was before Christ was born. Sure not all the historical context is accurate, but the performances by the star studded cast will simply amaze you, and the epic historical period piece is reminiscent to the classic around the year it was filmed. But what might come as quite a shock was that the levels of violence are very graphic and quite brutal (especially for a 1960 film). It is also saturated with political and sexually explicit content added to the script by writer Dalton Trumbo (who was blacklisted by commie hunter Joseph McCarthy). The visual eye-candy is a treat for the eyes and has lot of Kubrick symbolism including the vibrant cinematography, the clever camera angles and the nuanced themes of alienation and the evils of dehumanization.Kirk Douglas looks like he was carved out of stone gives a very powerful performance as Spartacus; however he may come across as bit over-the-top. But that's just my point of view. I last time only saw this movie was years ago, when I was a rowdy adolescent who's hobbies were cookies, comics and cartoons. But he's not alone in this as he's backed up by a plethora of powerful thespians like Laurence Olivier, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov and Jean Simmons who also share the spotlight and succeeds nicely here.In the end I thought it was an amazing film, not the greeted film of all time, but nowhere close to being the worst film I've ever seen. To call it a minor Kubrick film is no exaggeration to say the least. The main flaw is that some scenes tend to drag on for too long and I think there are times when "Spartacus" tries too hard to be an epical war period piece (which it does no question about it), but it crams too many sequences in that some scenes were not all needed. But it's still intriguing, technically sublime and the fight scenes were very well choreographed. If you like historical war period pieces that will keep you enthralled, you'll likely enjoy "Spartacus".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Luckily, Kirk kept Kubrick under control.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kubrick started his career as a fairly dim-witted student, but was nevertheless a moderately talented stills photographer. As a film director he was also exceptionally pig-headed and obsessive, who frequently drove those he worked with to the point of desperation. A light touch was something he did not have. Some people think all his films are different. In fact, they all exhibit very similar and highly annoying characteristics. They are badly paced, since he appears to have had a poor idea of cinematic timing: the inflexibility, and fixed nature, of his stills photography training constantly shows through. The shots are composed as if they were intended to be totally static. An example in this film is the interminable build-up to the final battle. Often there are passages of excruciating slowness.Secondly, in almost every picture there is at least one actor who is driven wildly over the top, usually from being forced to undergo a prolonged series of takes which render him near-demented. The prime example is G.C.Scott in "Strangelove", but there are many others. Kubrick may not have been responsible for the casting of Tony Curtis, but the actor's performance here as a "singer of songs" bordered on the ridiculous.Thirdly, although Kubrick relied on using scripts by gifted writers he seems to have constantly wanted to distort these scripts along his own lines. The "adaptations" he made were not constructive, and never improved the stories. Authors he mistreated in this way included Burgess, Clarke, Nabokov, King, Schnitzler, etc. Typically, "Burgess felt that Kubrick had used him as a film publicity pawn", according to Wikipedia. Burgess later called him "Sidney Labrick". Malcolm McDowell shared these feelings, and spoke harshly about Kubrick. As evidence, both novelist and actor cited Kubrick's uncontrolled ego, made manifest in the film credits: the only author credited is "Kubrick". The sole thing truly great about Kubrick was his gigantic ego. If he was dim-witted, why was he so successful and rich? Bloody-minded doggedness does it, is the answer. Brawn bludgeons, beats and baffles brains.Kubrick once remarked that "Spartacus is the only film on which I did not have absolute control", and this must be why it still retains superior qualities, sadly lacking from his later painful disasters like Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, The Shining, Eyes Wide Shut and so on. Curtis is reported to have written that Kubrick's "greatest effectiveness was his one-on-one relationship with actors." The ambiguity of this comment may have been because Kubrick perhaps was still alive at the time Curtis published it. Several actors fell out permanently with Kubrick: Douglas, Brando, Scott, for starters. You might call these relationships one-on-one, if your tongue was in your cheek.In spite of Kubrick, Spartacus is a splendid, entertaining and fascinating film epic, featuring fine performances by several outstanding actors: Olivier, Laughton, Ustinov, Strode, Lom, besides Simmons and Douglas. At this stage in Kubrick's career, all these personalities outweighed him, and, although I'm not totally certain, I don't believe any of them ever worked with him again.. The script is intelligent, perceptive, and often quite witty, although it tips over into excessive sentimentality at the end. The final ropy shots of Douglas on the cross make me think that Kubrick was trying to sabotage the film. However, allowing for the different eras in which they were made, it is a fundamentally better film than Gladiator. Both of these are far inferior to Troy, however.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spartacus a grand entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spartacus is a film from an era when Hollywood was pushing spectacle in your face. The growing popularity of television had whittled the movie going audience to a fraction of what it had been just a decade before, with millions of Americans deciding to stay home and get their visual entertainment for free rather than trek to theaters. As a response, studios began creating epic entertainments, historical epics or biblical stories, filmed in one of many wide screen processes to ensure that what was delivered was more than you could get in your living room. Spartacus is a historical epic of this nature, the story of a slave revolt in the Roman empire led by a man named Spartacus. While many of the trappings of the film are familiar to almost anyone who has seen this type of film, it is unique and thought provoking in many ways, although not quite a masterpiece.Based on a novel by Howard Fast, Spartacus finds our hero a slave since birth working in a Roman camp mining precious metals. He is sold to a gladiatorial training school run by Lentulus Batiatus (Peter Ustinov) where he taught the arts of becoming a gladiator. He also is introduced to women for the first time in his life, specifically slave Verinia (Jean Simmons), but instead of taking her forcefully, Spartacus chooses to treat her like an equal, and this impresses her. After training for some time, Spartacus is one of four gladiators that is selected for a combat to the death to entertain visitors of Batiatus, including powerful Roman Patrician Marcus Crassus (Laurence Olivier). The outcome of the match, and the selling of Verinia to Crassus, enrages Spartacus and the other gladiators who revolt and capture the school. They eventually organize around Spartacus, who convinces them that if they can escape the clutches of the Romans by freeing slaves, forming an army and begin marching to the sea, where they can escape by ship to return to their homelands.With this revolt underway, the Roman Senate attempts to break the slaves by sending various Roman forces against them, but each falls under the might of the freed slaves. At the heart of the Roman opposition are Senator Gracchus (Charles Laughton), who represents the masses, and Crassus, who serves the elite mindset. They each perform maneuvers behind the scenes to either support or hinder Spartacus' campaign, with the final result being the furthering of their own political goals.At the heart of Spartacus is a story of, essentially, class warfare. The Romans are the upper echelon, keeping the mass of slaves under their boot. They treat them without care, using them for both entertainment purposes as gladiators and concubines. The Roman elite are viewed as corrupt and unfeeling towards the human lives they have put into bondage. The slaves are seen as much more noble individuals, fighting for their freedom from the Roman oppression. Unfortunately, the film is much more engaging in it's Roman scenes than in it's slave scenes. The Roman characters are more interesting, their dialogue better written and the various layers of their complicated machinations more enthralling than those of the slaves. We are supposed to root for Spartacus, but his character is left underdeveloped, and his romance with Verinia is not very involving or touching. It is not without some charm, but on the whole proves rather rote. The Romans aren't characters we root for, but when their scenes are on camera, they are at least interesting to watch.Spartacus is well known for it's elaborate spectacle. It's battle scenes, while not as gritty or realistic as ones from more modern epics, are still impressive and grand. The major battles were filmed in Spain with use of the Spanish army, and the mass of individuals used are sight to see. But again, as the slave characters are underdeveloped, it is hard to find yourself really caught up in the action.Aside from it's epic scale, Spartacus is also notable for it's impressive cast. The combined power of British thespians Olivier, Laughton, and Ustinov is a rarity in cinema, and they all perform their parts admirably and provide the most memorable parts of the film. Spartacus was also the first major studio film from director Stanley Kubrick, who had made a few smaller films before Spartacus, but this really catapulted him to the big time. Kubrick would later distance himself from the production, as he did not nurture it from inception but was merely a hired hand (brought in to replace director Anthony Mann), but it is easy to see what would have made the film attractive to him. Kubrick has often made films with a theme of classism at it's heart, and that is the central theme of Spartacus. It is the most accessible film Kubrick has ever made.Spartacus is a decent epic film, with a bit more depth than what you find in most epics, thank's mostly to the scenes involving the machinations of the Romans. If you are interested in the grand scale films of that era, Spartacus is worth viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a rather long film but movies are generally better when long, only since LOTR have movies, mainly historical epics, are coming back to Spartacus like lengths. This was a politically and socially somewhat radical film for its time. Political games, power, and homosexuality were present in this film. This film is generally historically accurate, but if it were exactly accurate, it would have had to show Spartacus as a man who lost 35,000 men because the germans refused to follow his orders and broke off with spartacus and eventually were slaughetred by a roman legion, a man who was trapped by his own men thirsting for roman blood and had a sense of invincibility. This of course would have made a more realistic but even more of a downer emotionally to the audiances.With strong messages great acting and Quote like "Id rather be here among brothers than to be the richest citizen fo Rome" and "We must stay true to ourselves" makes this movie one of the best 100 of all time. Spartacus was actually killed in the battle trying to get to Crassus, in turn killing 2 centurions outright. His body was never found...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you watch Spartacus with all actors and actress within, you feel not only they successfully convey the true story but you live within the sequence itself.The first impression you think it's from this Millennium but actually it's 45 years ago !The Cinematic effect and the visual effect at that time wasn't supported with advanced technology, and I think because the actors and actress are talented,even the director and the crew are doing the best work to succeed the movie.All efforts from Actors and Actress creating interactive live event, there's originality in this Film and the way the director trying to convey his vision with the reality combined altogether harmoniously ! The characteristic of Spartacus defined with integrity, he is a leader a lover and a freeman, Mr. Douglas still have that impression in his daily life, also, the other actors which obviously dominating the movie, each of them doing impressive role.Spartacus Film, is one of the best ever movie released in 60's and compete Millennium era.We send our love to all actors and actress and the crew.by Aras</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Due to the fact that the great director himself didn't write it, many film fans don't consider Spartacus to be a part of Stanley Kubrick's oeuvre that is on par with the many great classics that he has given to cinema. While it is true that Spartacus isn't as good as films such as A Clockwork Orange or Dr Strangelove, it's still a fine piece of cinema and it also represents one of the better epics to come out of Hollywood, and despite the fact that he didn't write it and didn't get as much freedom as he usually likes, Kubrick has still managed to inject his own style into the picture, which is at least somewhat responsible for the fact that this is more than just the standard blockbuster. The film seems to be played mainly for entertainment purposes than anything else, and it's lack of themes is testament to that fact; but Spartacus does give the viewer a comment on nature of freedom, and also a comment on what goes into the making of a hero and a legend. The famous "I am Spartacus" scene sums the latter part up nicely.In my opinion, Kirk Douglas wasn't the right choice for the lead in this movie. Even when he's covered in grit, he still looks too polished to play the heroic lead and on the whole his performance isn't one of the best things about this movie. Kubrick isn't too good at casting actresses; that was more evident in 1980's The Shining, but you can see it here also. Jean Simmons doesn't do very well opposite Douglas, and in every scene she's in she looks either uncomfortable or incompetent. The acting isn't the most important aspect of this film, however, as it's the history surrounding the story that is. The battle scenes are brought to the screen with the greatest of care and the result is a screen spectacle indeed. The story surrounding Spartacus and his slave army is always going to be interesting, and relevant, as it can be paralleled with a number of historical events. This film may be given a new lease of life these days due to the success of several recent historical epics, but trust me; Spartacus is a hell of a lot better than the likes of 'Gladiator'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest epic movies ever made. It would never have been made at all if Kirk Douglas had been given the role of Judah Ben Hur in William Wilder epic masterpiece Ben-Hur. Burt Lancaster had also been considered for the role but turned it down. Kirk was offered the role of Messala opposite Charlton Heston but he turned it down refusing to play second bill to a young upstart such as Heston.Douglas made Spartacus purely to get back at MGM and William Wilder. This need for revenge drove Douglas to make what is a truly great film.The Direction given for Anthony Mann and Stanley Kubrick is excellent. The cast is also flawless. Kirk was clever enough to cast all the Americans in the film as Slaves and Gladiators including himself. The English actors in the Film were all cast as Romans, Olivier, Laughton and Ustinov. This made perfect sense as the Romans and Slaves now sounded different. This makes the film all the more believable.This film is one of my all time favourites, but I often wonder if kirk had got his way and had starred in Ben-Hur, would this film have ever been made ???A final word on the lovely Jean Simmons. She is one of the most beautiful women that has ever graced the silver screen</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That is what this film is. I skim through the reviews here on IMDb and find several things posted like "idealized and dull", "Rome Epic Roams Too Much", "Unfocused and Simplistic", "Overkill", etc. Maybe it's just me, but I can't quite see what these people are talking about. In my mind, Spartacus is one of the grandest and most powerful films in its genre. Perhaps it has moments where it becomes a bit melodramatic, but don't most epics, even the most loved? Didn't The Ten Commandments? Didn't Ben-Hur? While Spartacus can certainly boast of sprawling battle sequences, riveting gladiatorial matches, lavish sets, and all the other things that one might expect from a Hollywood epic, it is the quieter, gentler, and more human moments that make the film more than that ? the scene of the liberated slaves together about the campfire as Tony Curtis' Antoninus amuses them pleasantly with magic tricks, the tender and joyous exchanges between Spartacus and Varinia as they dream hopefully of the future and reflect on their pasts, the shot of an ancient couple dancing blissfully as free people after who knows how many years of slavery? All these parts listed deeply and compassionately illustrate the lives of ordinary people in a strikingly intimate way, far distanced from an epic motion picture's usual excesses.Of course, the cast is nothing short of stupendous. Kirk Douglas is excellent in the title role. In much of the first part of the film, he bristles with pent-up energy. Grimly mute, the viewer can sense the simmering rage the character has against his captors, a fury just waiting to boil over. Later, as leader of the slave revolt, he exudes a deep love for all his comrades, as well as the painful weight of his responsibility for them, especially when it appears as if their rebellion may fail. Jean Simmons as Varinia is exquisite, not just in terms of her beauty but in her performance. And as Crassus, the great Laurence Olivier creates a multi-layered and intriguing antagonist ? cold and sinister, but with depth and inner turmoil, as can be seen in his scenes with Antoninus and later Varinia.Peter Ustinov won an Oscar for his role as the obsequious head of a gladiatorial school, and it is easy to see why. He clearly relishes the part of this finicky, weaselly, cowardly slave master. Every time he appears, he brightens up the screen. Equally superb is Charles Laughton as the aging Gracchus. He skillfully portrays a bloated old senator with the countenance of a codger but a sharp and conniving mind. Throughout the film, Laughton is witty, amusing, and finally tragic. There is pathos in his last scenes. It is a great part to play that gets many of the best lines. (To paraphrase: "Privately, I believe in none of the gods. Publicly, I believe in them all.") When Ustinov and Laughton are on screen together to conspire or chat about their vices, the two's perfect chemistry makes those portions perhaps the best in the whole film.Charles McGraw, Herbert Lom, and Woody Strode are also very memorable and deserve a mention.Kubrick famously loathed the film, and everyone often makes a big deal about that, along with the hubris of Douglas that spurred the project to one-up Ben-Hur. So they should; it's a fascinating topic. But while it may not be fully Kubrick's vision, Spartacus remains stunning nonetheless. The acting, as I've noted, is great. The screenplay by the then-blacklisted Dalton Trumbo can be hauntingly poetic. The musical score is splendid. No matter the views of the man credited as the movie's director, I feel that Spartacus, just as it is, is a well-done and resonating piece of work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a classic Kubrick film, but a classic sword and sandals epic (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most Kubrick fans tend to look down on Spartacus. This is for a variety of reasons, but the main one is that it's the only film Kubrick made as a hired gun ? he certainly didn't have full creative control. Well, hired gun or not, I think Spartacus is a fine film. It's one of the best epics ever made.The most enjoyable part of Spartacus is undoubtedly the first third ? the section dealing with the training of the gladiators. It's kind of like a Roman Full Metal Jacket ? we get to see a bunch of 'recruits' get trained and abused by a loudmouth bully. But unlike Full Metal Jacket, we not only get mind games, we get proper sexual humiliation too. For instance, there's a scene where the gladiators, as a reward, get the company of a woman. Spartacus gets Varinia (Jean Simmons), but he says he's never had a woman before (as good as he is in the film, I still find it hard to buy the horny Kirk Douglas, he of the rocking trailer, as a virgin). And then immediately afterwards, Marcellus (the trainer) and Batiatus (the establishment's owner, played by Peter Ustinov) appear at a hole in the ceiling and laugh at him. It's a wonderfully cruel scene.Another fantastic little moment is when, a little while after his first encounter with her, Varinia is taken to Spartacus' room/cell. The door is opened for her, but before she can walk in, Marcellus says that she's going to go to the Spaniard instead. It's a superb piece of mental torture ? see the woman you've fallen in love with and then hear her get nailed by another one of the gladiators.Yet another excellent scene is when a group of Romans, led by Crassus (Laurence Olivier), visit Batiatus' training school. For their own amusement they want to see matched pairs fight to the death. But the women in the group not only want to see the men fight and die, they want them to do it in as little clothing as possible. Only enough for modesty, one of them says. And there's also a great bit when one of the women drools over a big black gladiator ? these men were obviously a sexual fantasy for a lot of Roman women.And the fights themselves are superb. The first is filmed through the slats of a door that Spartacus is looking through, and the second, which features Spartacus himself, sees him battle Woody Strode. But what makes the second fight so enjoyable is the little details. For example, the women are really into it, but the men are bored ? they talk amongst themselves as the gladiators fight to the death; this entertainment is ordinary and rather mundane. Another great detail is how bloodthirsty the women are. They're the ones who call for the loser to be killed and they're the ones who are most outraged when Strode won't do what he's supposed to.After this, though, things take a slight turn for the worse. We start to get some heavy handed moralising and we get all the inevitable talk about freedom. But unlike some, the romance between Spartacus and Varinia never bothers me. Sure the otherwise excellent score gets a bit too cloying in their romantic scenes, but Douglas and Simmons have superb chemistry and they lend the film a lot of warmth. Much worse for me are the small moments that litter the film ? a couple burying their baby, an old lady squirting milk in a child's face and everyone gazing lovingly at Spartacus like he's a dimpled slave Jesus as he wanders the camp at night. These moments are obviously meant to add colour and to pull our heartstrings, but they're far too blatant ? they have all the subtlety of a hammer blow between the eyes.Much more successful are the senate scenes, especially the exchanges between Laughton and Olivier. You really can tell they don't like one another, and their attempts to outdo each other add to the characters and the film. I also like the brief moments between Curtis and Olivier, but perhaps in a rather sniggering sort of way. There's just something rather amusing about Sir Larry ordering a Bronx-born slave Curtis to be his 'body servant' ? ooh er, missus. And the 'snails and oysters' scene is well done, too, and exceedingly homoerotic as well (Spartacus is one of the few sword and sandals epics to include homoeroticism on purpose, rather than have it occur as a natural by-product of beefy men wandering about in their pants).But although the film sags in its middle section, it picks up again at the end. One of the best scenes is the final battle ? the chopped limb and the sword through the neck are attention grabbers, but the best bit is in the pre-battle; the way the Roman formations change. It's a magnificently visual way of contrasting the two armies ? the mass of slaves, standing as one, and their organised opponents using strategy and cunning.And even though it's been parodied to death, the "I'm Spartacus" scene is still a great. As is the final scene where Simmons confronts Spartacus as he hangs on the cross. In the wrong hands it could have been maudlin in the extreme, but it actually comes across as rather hopeless ? Douglas, when looking down on his newborn son, doesn't appear to be full of joy and love. Instead he almost looks angry ? he's lost and he knows it, and even though his wife and son are free, everyone else is no better off than when he started. Indeed they might even be worse off. And it's this final defeat that ultimately makes Spartacus stand out ? it doesn't provide us with miracles; every victory is hard earned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If "epic" equates with "tedium" then this is indeed a classic of the genre. Every so often there's a shot that reminds you that Kubrick was involved - for example, a breathtaking long shot against an amazing sky in which Spartacus carries his wife on horseback from one side of the screen to the other across the ridge of a hill - but most of the time the entire enterprise is wallowing in an over-emotionalism that renders it mostly difficult and usually impossible for the audience - well, this audience, at least - to feel anything at all. The very guilty party is Kirk Douglas. There is a scene towards the end of the film when he is addressing his slave army, and the scene alternates with Olivier addressing Rome: the difference in quality is palpable. Poor old Douglas doesn't have a hope, he is so greatly outclassed. Now, I have seen Douglas be very good indeed: he is excellent in Wilder's "Ace in the Hole", to name just one of his movies, so I'm not an unqualified loather of his work. It's just that here, where he was apparently producer as well as star, we have a film that was made according to his taste, and his taste is lousy. There are good moments, but he's rarely in them: they feature Olivier, Laughton, Ustinov and Lom. The wonderful Jean Simmons copes pretty well with her poorly-written part. The early fight sequences in the gladiator training camp are good too, and promised better things to come, a promise sadly unfulfilled. As we discovered in the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, too many battle scenes make for emotional numbness. Which brings me to Alex North's score, to which the same applies: there's just too much of it, and so much of it the same. The epic movie as a genre is, I'll admit, something I find very hard to take. It generally requires you to believe in unflawed heroism, which I find an uncomfortable, nigh-on dangerous idea. In the case of Spartacus, this is somewhat redeemed by the film's reaching for a tragic ending, and it is here that Douglas' performance begins, far too late, to turn into something to which one can relate. In his climactic fight with Curtis (a star actor strangely wasted in this film) the impossibility of Spartacus' position gives the actor something to chew on other than the scenery, and the outcome is the kind of emotion sadly lacking elsewhere. The same is I don't think quite true of the final scene between Douglas and Simmons: "The Life of Brian" has perhaps intervened too powerfully for such a scene ever to be truly poignant again. But Simmons and Douglas try very hard to make it happen. Unsurprisingly, it's when the intervention comes of Ustinov's all-too-human, hitherto comic character that the scene starts to mean something. If you can spare the hours of your life to watch this kind of thing, then fine. But having sat through it myself now, I honestly think you'd be better off walking in the park.</fullReview>

There is much intrigue and political maneuvering behind the scenes which adds greatly to the story of the movie. The actions scenes are dramatic and effective on the individual scale and grand and bold in the large battles. The fighting scenes are realistic and varied which keeps the audience entertained. The characters in the movie are well developed over time. They are shown to develop strong friendships and loving relationships with their partners throughout the movie. Also the movie portrays the Roman Empire at the time in terms of the political, economic, military and foreign policies and how they all come to bare upon the situation at hand. The acting is great with many notable stars present. This is a great movie only let down by the limited special effects of the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Finally "Get it" After All These Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched this movie several times throughout my life but it was only extremely recently that I came to appreciate it for the triumph that it truly is. What is the difference? SUFFERING. Forget about the fact that as a smaller child I probably didn't comprehend the entire plot and what was happening, but it's when you start to understand what it means to truly suffer and what it takes to rise above it can you appreciate this film for all that it is. An entire lifetime of living in the "pit" of slavery is WAY beyond MY ability to understand. But I've watched several of my closest family members die in the past 3 years. Learned what it meant to not have a home or a friend. And to have sickness take away control over my own body. These elements are all found in this movie. They are all the true attributes of being a slave. Slavery: You own nothing; Not even yourself. Nobody to call your own. No home. Unable to even have a friend. As Spartacus says, "Death is the only freedom a slave knows". yet he ends that sentence with, " ... But that's why we'll win." Because a slave has no fear of death. And with that one spark of hope, the hope that there is something "better" than the life he's living. And that HOPE jumps to a flame when one life is given as a sacrifice. It's not actually Spartacus that starts the revolt. It's Draba! It's his life that is the catalyst for sudden and massive change. Back in the days when Rome was in control of the world and it had a god for everything (probably even a sneeze), Spartacus says, "I imagine a god for slaves ... and I pray. I pray for a son who will be born free". His hope isn't even for himself. And in my own "pit", my Christian hope burst forth and I finally understood why Jesus had to come as a meek and humble servant. So that we would know that there IS a God for slaves, because each of us is a slave to something. When Spartacus is "wooing" Varinia it is the simple touch of their hands and the first person to show concern for her ("Did they hurt you?") that breaks down the walls to her heart and allows her to give it to Spartacus. Would she have loved him as deeply if he wasn't a slave too? And so I watch Spartacus and comprehend it. Not just because I understand how it fits into history, but how it fits into ME. A God for slaves. Yes. A God who understands my slavery and woos me so I am free to love Him back. Not because He has power over me but because he understands what it means to be a slave BEFORE He came into power. Truly an epic that transcends all that is in the human heart. At last I "get it". Watch it again and glean your own hope knowing that someday the darkness will end and hope will reign. That is what makes this story an epic. transcendence. And know that there is most definitely a God for slaves and so ... you are understood. Sincerely, Laura-Lee</fullReview>

Jean Simmons plays the woman Spartacus loves, and Tony Curtis plays his fellow slave and loyal friend.Large-scale production is most impressive and powerfully told, with few lulls in its 3+ hour length.

		<fullReview>After having recently watched Kubrick's weak debut, Fear and Desire, and a solid but forgettable film (Killer's Kiss), I was pretty impressed by Spartacus, which is one hell of an epic journey. I felt that some scenes dragged, making the watch a little exhausting at times, but nothing that affected my overall experience. The score was great but a bit repetitive, which is fine as it's a very long film. The battle scenes were outstanding and Kirk Douglas amazed me as Spartacus, a gladiator and leader of the slave's rebellion. I could totally see resemblances to his character in Paths of Glory as they both share a strong sense of humanity and perseverance. The message by the end is that hope is alive and Spartacus's dream can actually prosper and be concreted, despite all the destruction that happens in the final battle with the Romans and its horrible consequences. A strong and fitting finale to another terrific film by Kubrick!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautifully shot historical epic that is truly memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Referring to the Criterion Collection's 192 min. version) Oh man. This film just oozes bigness. Not without a touch of the old school Hollywood over-drama, or camp, but it's almost endearing here where it would otherwise be lame. The cast is certainly something stellar: Lawrence Olivier, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov and Kirk Douglas all in epic movie mode. Perhaps the most worthy reason to recommend Spartacus is the photography. The word epic gets abused left and right these days but this film IS epic. Stanley Kubrick may not have had much creative control with the film, but his cinematographic work is evident and it is awesome. Huuuuuge landscape shots depicting thousands of soldiers on the move, climbing mountains, fighting, etc. (and filmed in 1960 no less!) yet the vastness is not overwhelming and the focus is steadfast. The grand presentation of Spartacus features an overture and intermission, etc. which showcases Alex North's somewhat bombastic but often beautiful score that is also a constant throughout the film's action. This gives the film more of an operatic feel, likening it perhaps more to something like Eisenstein's Alexander NEVSKY than to Ridley Scott's GLADIATOR. In the end, SPARTACUS more than holds a candle to the historical epics made today and certainly outshines several of its contemporaries. If the length doesn't scare you off (around 3 ? hours), SPARTACUS definitely worth a close viewing and a good discussion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much more than just "Kubrick's Hollywood movie"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though it is now recognized as a classic, Spartacus was notoriously disinherited by its director, the late, great Stanley Kubrick. His hatred for said picture derived from the fact that he wasn't involved with the project from the start (which is why his name is nowhere to be found in the screen writing credits), but hired only after original director Anthony Mann was fired (the only remains of the latter's work is the opening sequence). Given Kubrick always demanded total control over his pictures, it is understandable that he came to despise his only real "Hollywood movie". Nevertheless, Spartacus is a great picture, one that, alongside Ben-Hur, has defined the epic genre for years (and if the best they can make nowadays is Alexander, then its position remains unharmed).The film stars Kirk Douglas, one of the few actors to have worked twice with the director (their previous collaboration was the anti-war masterpiece Paths of Glory), as the eponymous slave who finds himself in the middle of a political war between Roman senators such as Marcus Licinius Crassus (Laurence Olivier) and Sempronius Gracchus (Charles Laughton). Seeing the chaos that is rising throughout Italy, he decides to organize a rebellion, gathering a massive group of followers, including Crassus' former servant Antoninus (Tony Curtis). As the situation gets more preoccupying, the common people watch as Rome is threatened by thousands of "inferior" individuals, led by a charismatic man who believes in justice and freedom.It is probably the aforementioned beliefs that upset Kubrick, famous as he was for almost celebrating misery and decadence in his films. In fact, despite the famous all-but-cheerful ending (brilliantly spoofed in Monty Python's Life of Brian), Spartacus is one of cinema's best representations of free will and courage prevailing over oppression. Much of this is due to Douglas' performance: playing it both ferociously determined (when Spartacus lectures his comrades and prepares for the imminent battle) and touchingly tender (when he meets his future wife, played by Jean Simmons), his performance transcends the character's mythical status and lends him a humanity that makes him instantly likable. Also remarkable are Peter Ustinov, playing slave merchant Batiatus (and winning an Oscar for it), and Olivier, particularly in the now infamous, audacious for the time, seduction scene with Curtis, where food is used as a metaphor for men and women (ironic, if you consider Olivier's part in that scene had to be re-recorded by Anthony Hopkins).The best epics are those that blend the spectacular and the personal, and that is where Spartacus truly succeeds: like Ben-Hur and Lawrence of Arabia, it never sacrifices characterization in favor of action, but lets the mesmerizing (and, as opposed to more recent genre films, bloodless) battle sequences be a part of the protagonists' development, bringing the movie closer to Asian "wuxia" movies such as Hero or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon than Hollywood blockbusters like Troy.So, in a time where the epic has lost most of its charm, movies like Spartacus are even more essential now than they were before. It may have been dismissed by Kubrick himself, but everyone seems to like it, and for a good reason: there is a heart beating beneath the eye-popping exterior.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's direction is very well crafted and Kirk Douglous has poignantly portrayed the legend of Spartacus thus revealing the true grit and stoic fortitude that is usually hidden in a rebel or a societal misfit.Douglous and Olivier have played their roles very well while Tony Curtis has failed to give a stunning and respectable performance during the fatal duel at the end of the film.The sets are more real and painstakingly crafted than in "Gladiator". After watching this movie, one realizes, that the quality of historical film making has deteriorated with the passage of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Look Back On 1960s Technicolor Lushness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spartacus is a Roman epic with Laurence Olivier in one of the greatest performances I think I've ever seen. It's also an ambitious early vehicle for Stanley Kubrick. And, it's an important point in cinematic history because it was the first film to openly defy the black list by using the work of blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, and billing him. The most entertaining thing about it, aside from Olivier's fierce, intense, and successfully infuriating performance, is the dated look of the lavish and obviously fake sets, the bright and blown out Technicolor cinematography, the opening slave revolt and the costumes and weapons and firetruck red blood. It's a movie of the times. It also marks my confirmation that Laurence Olivier is a brilliant actor. He draws such an intimidating facade for his prideful and puerile militarist, hiding his weak fear for humiliation in his battle for power against the truly confident Gracchus. I have seen Olivier in Sleuth, in which he gave a wonderful performance, but he didn't shoot to the top of my list as he does here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have ever stood in the face of tyranny, perhaps standing for the Union contract in a place of work, or a schoolboy defending another against a bully, than you are Spartacus. Spartacus is a man who'd rather die on his feet, than live on his knees. You gotta fight the power, man!!! I like to believe there is a little Spartacus in all of us.Seriously though, great classic. Good acting all around, especially Spartacus of course. And Sir Lawrence Olivier (Crassus) is always great. The love scenes with Spartacus were very genuine, good chemistry. And though this movie is long, it is well worth it.4/5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, glorious film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Spartacus" is no doubt the "Gladiator" of its time. Starring Kirk Douglas as the skillful gladiator who escapes from his owner Lentulus Batiatus (Peter Ustinov) and organizes a massive slave revolt. Meanwhile Crassus (Laurence Olivier) and Grachus (Charles Laughton) try to manipulate the situation to their own benefit.With a movie starring Douglas and Olivier (among others) and directed by Stanley Kubrick there's really nothing to dislike about it. The direction, action, performances, script are all admirable, an example of great, classic filmmaking.Mostly the acting though. It would seem that Douglas is rigid as Spartacus, but it's just how his character reacts to the situations he's put in, and as the movie progresses he gets more relaxed in the role. Olivier's bisexual Crassus is well acted as well, you sense his pride and love for Rome in his presence on screen.What's surprising here is Ustinov...well, not so much Ustinov but his Oscar win for Best Supporting Actor. I'm not saying he did a bad job - it was a great and often hilarious performance, but it's also the kind of performance where you would think it should've won an Oscar, but it would never actually win. I'm glad it did, though.What surprises me also is how great this movie is for all ages. It isn't too bloody, or long for children, and it's of course wonderful for adults too.Anyway, this is a great and entertaining film for people of all ages, 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've got to say that I'm not a massive admirer of Kubrick, but there's no denying that this is a very fine movie. Back in the days when extras weren't computer generated this is very much the film that Gladiator was based on.Kirk Douglas plays the lead and the length of the film gives the actor and director plenty of time to develop the character. Spartacus starts the film as a slave, but is spotted and trained up to be a gladiator. During an uprising he becomes the leader of an army who simply want freedom from the roman empire.Where this film wins over Gladiator is in the character development and dialogue. Olivier, Simmons, Laughton, Ustinov and Curtis all put in fine performances and the "I'm Spartacus" is probably one of the most memorable scenes in movie history. 10/10 </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kirk Douglas' movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I realise it is the norm to refer to a film as the director's 'baby' as in "Ridley Scott's 'Alien'". However, to refer to "Stanley Kubrick's 'Spartacus'" I find ridiculous. Clearly, it is Kirk Douglas' movie through and through and he employed Kubrick for his undoubted skills as a filmmaker. Not withstanding Kubrick devotees, "Spartacus" will be remembered as Kirk Douglas' movie and (IMHO) rightly so.Outstanding performances abound - Douglas, Olivier, Laughton and Ustinov are all outstanding - whilst, as comparisons with "Ben-Hur" are often made, perhaps shares its only weakness with the other great epic in that the love story elements are a little mushy today. However, the romance between Spartacus and Varinia is more engaging than that of Judah Ben-Hur and Esther. For Antoninus to proclaim his love for Spartacus - having just been terminally wounded by him - was rather cringe-worthy it must be said.Pushed to it, I still prefer "Ben-Hur" and the somewhat maligned "El Cid" but "Spartacus" remains a classic.I liked "Gladiator" very much too - and while it is not a competition - I do think "Spartacus" is the better movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's splendid breakthrough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the golden 60's they didn't have "Braveheart" or "Gladiator" either but luckily they did have "Spartacus" so actually they had 'em both and even more. Timeless "Spartacus" was Stanley Kubrick's brilliant breakthrough hit and the first one of the nine movies (made in the era of 1960-1999) that eventually made him the invincible, masterful director genius we will always remember him as. Glorious Kirk Douglas is just superb in the role that was probably the greatest of his whole career and we certainly shouldn't forget that the supporting cast was simply magnificent too. Legendary Laurence Olivier fits perfectly in the role of a wicked Marcus Licinius Crassus, excellent Charles Laughton amuses as Sempronius Gracchus and Herbert Lom's Tigranes Levantus gives a pleasant spice to the story. They were all great but I especially loved Peter Ustinov playing quite likely the funniest character Lentulus Batiatus. He clearly wins the sympathies of an audience just by being the nice and amusing comic relief.There's something common in most of Kubrick's movies but I just can't put my hands on what it actually is and find enough words to really explain it. I guess it has something to got to do with the things I find to be his usual trademarks: those dark and dismal moods of the story, odd, peculiar and sometimes even frightening atmosphere and events and slow, very much dreamlike camera-work. "Spartacus" doesn't look so much like Kubrick's completely own creation as his future masterpieces like "A Clockwork orange", "The Shining" or for example "Eyes wide shut". The fact that it's not my personal favorite in the works of Kubrick is still irrelevant. "Spartacus" is a fantastic, grand movie classic and one of the finest historical Hollywood spectacles. Spectacular movie deserves at least 9 out of 10. Entertaining, visually imposing experience. Hats off to Kubrick.</fullReview>

I really enjoyed seeing it in this format.At slightly over three hours in length it is not a long film to tell the story. By modern standards some scenes may be slow but overall the pace was appropriate for the sombre story of downtrodden slaves seeking freedom from manipulating Roman overlords.The colours and cinematography are excellent. Alas I can only imagine how it looked when first released in 1960. The restorers have worked well but the clarity of the picture has been lost in parts of some frames. The casting is good with all turning in good performances in their roles.Leaves the modern efforts like Gladiator looking flashy but lacking depth and scope.Given the number of times this has been shown on TV it is obviously still popular with many of the viewing public. However if you do get the chance to see it on the big screen in 70mm it is still worth the entrance fee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic epic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spartacus is the definition of an epic Hollywood movie. It's not a film; it's a movie. There are no hidden meanings, no tricky camera work, and no brilliant dialog. It's just a fun, epic film.Now all of that is the exact opposite of the type of films that Stanley Kubrick makes. Kubrick makes smart, cold, beautiful films that use visuals to tell the story instead of actors, usually. Kubrick never made popcorn movies. He never made fun movies (except for Dr. Strangelove, possibly). So it's no wonder that many people do not consider Spartacus to be a Kubrick film. Well, it's not. He may have directed, but this twisted Kubrick love child is not a "Kubrick film". It's a Hollywood picture.Now that doesn't mean the movie is bad or anything. Oh, God no. The movie is great. It has great acting, a cool plot, cool action scenes (and for a movie made in 1960, that's pretty good), and most of all, it's just down right fun. It's a long movie, but it's still fun.Normally in my reviews, I rant for as long as I can about every little aspect of each film. I do this because I want to make sure I say EVERYTHING I want to say about each movie, because I hate writing more than one review for each movie. But, for this movie, I've really said all I want to say. It's just a good movie. There's nothing outstanding about it, it's just a classic, epic film. I can't really say why it's so good, it just is.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I AM SPARTACUS!!!" And I was moved to tears!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A truly moving portrayal of slavery in Roman Times, and one man's self determination to do something about it, against impossible odds!Spartacus is a classic amongst the classics. Not quite so pompous as Ben Hur; not so overdone as Ten Commandments. Spartacus offers a comfortable middleway between being a cultured movie &amp; mass-acceptance movie.Kubrick's direction has never been better, especially during the final battle scenes, and the rather subtle &amp; discreet scene between Olivier &amp; Curtis sharing a bath together - a lot of the cryptic dialogue between the two probably went straight over the heads of a lot of viewers, myself included initially.But this is the work of Kubrick. Not only can he provide the audience with what they want to see - action, pathos, drama etc; by the same token he can provide us with little hidden delicacies that tease us &amp; tempt us, once we've unravelled their meaning.I was also taken by the wonderful score by Alex North, especially at the very beginning during the title sequence.The actors all take a share of the spoils. Simmons, Ustinov, Curtis, even the cameo from Woodie Strode, play with a certain majesty that is needed for a weighty film such as this. Kubrick knows how to tap the best out of some actors, and here is no exception.Of course the true honours are shared by Olivier and Douglas. In a way the characters they play is like a metaphor of their real acting abilities.We have in the red corner, Laurence Olivier, playing the sweeping &amp; majestic Crassus, leader of Rome (in all but name), who rides his white horse with an air of arrogance &amp; godliness and you feel could crush Spartacus with one hand. And we all know Olivier's true acting pedigree both on stage &amp; on film, be it Shakespeare or a ruthless Nazi dentist, Olivier always has that aura of class about him.While in the blue corner, Kirk Douglas, playing Spartacus, the David to Olivier's Goliath. But a man, a little man, who stands alone in defiance of dictatorship, and almost succeeds. And then we can contrast Douglas' films and see that even though his portfolio is not quite so grand he does &amp; has produced/acted in a great number of memorable movies.It's not often I shed a tear at the movies but after the final battle scene, the victorious Crassus wants to know who Spartacus is amongst the walking wounded. One by one they stand up and declare "I, am Spartacus!" while Douglas looked on, the tears rolling down my face!Spartacus is perhaps slightly over hyped, but its a very good &amp; thought provoking movie for all that.****/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sincere, optimistic Roman epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I know I shouldn't comment on other people's comments, however silly they may be; but sometimes they may represent commonly held falsehoods. So let me state: (1) No, it is NOT worth killing thousands of people in a civil war in order to free one woman and a child, and (2) The film never claims that it is. `Spartacus' is, indeed, an optimistic film; with an ending of neither unrelieved gloom nor unleavened triumph; but what MAKES it an optimistic film has nothing to do with the way it ends.Instead the optimism derives from the following ... The ancient world was a brutal and uncongenial place, and a modern human rights activist, the sort that your average Hollywood director would so glibly plonk in amongst the togas, would be crushed within a week - and it would only take that long because of the lack of attention he would get. `Spartacus' is a plausible story of how noble aspirations might grow and even flower out of such unpromising ground. That Spartacus could achieve anything at all is a kind of a triumph. Of course, it's not enough for the movie to SAY this; it also has to build the world carefully, so that the message I mentioned doesn't seem like a post hoc attempt to wring some hope from the mud - and it doesn't.It's also a grand old epic, obeying all the rules of the genre. It looks as if it had as many extras as the Romans themselves had. It has battle scenes. It has more great actors than you can poke a stick at ... among them Peter Ustinov, who gave his best performance: a caricature of a slave owner, but a realistic and insightful caricature. It has great photography. (Kubrick couldn't use a camera clumsily if he tried.) It covers a great deal of ground, with two or three apparently disparate plot strands turning out to belong together, without coinciding too neatly. It creates its own world. In every respect (musical score excepted) it towers over every other ancient world epic.</fullReview>

I also thought that the ending was very sad, typical of Kubrick. You can really get into this film because you just keep wanting to find out what's going to happen next.

How are the excesses portrayed in Spartacus all that different than the well documented history of "The Empire"?Fortunately, my forefathers 200 and 3000 miles due west of Nottingham believed that "the suffering to free one woman and one baby" was indeed a noble cause.

		<shortDescription>Where Splendour Exists within Human Spirit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Antiguity with its might and power, its mysteries and monuments that have survived for centuries...yes, they all make us believe in human possibilities, human skills. However, we often tend to skip the fact that it was not the splendor nor the power that made nations truly 'civilized' but the timeless spirit of dignity and freedom...In the history of great Hollywood productions, 1960 occurred to be a crucial moment for films, in particular epics set in the ancient times. The period of Cecil B DeMille's lavish spectacles was practically over; yet, the new challenges appeared: What historical figures will turn out to be appealing to the most 'up-to-date' needs of cinema buffs. There was a dilemma what hero to select. The choice went onto making a movie about Spartacus, the leader of slaves revolt during the Roman Republic. After David Lean had turned down the offer to direct the movie and veteran Anthony Mann had been fired, a young director Stanley Kubrick took up the task with the cooperation of Dalton Trumbo (the latter one, thanks to Kirk Douglas' help, managed to adapt Fast's novel to screen). Seemingly, the popularity of the film works like the wide acceptance of Spartacus and his struggle...more convincing with the passing of time. In the long run, people notice more and more merits in the film and, as a matter of fact, SPARTACUS was underrated in 1960 but was fully appreciated a few decades later. What is it if not a work that deserves being referred to as 'ahead of its time'? The major reason why we can consider SPARTACUS as an extraordinary epic is its extensive development of human psychology, of motives that govern human hearts, of reflections. At multiple levels, we encounter this in the main hero - a slave who is free in spirit, a charismatic soul, almost a dream-like hero ('idealized' to a certain extend). Yet, apart from this 'glorification' we clearly encounter a dream of one man which spreads and becomes the dream of many...what dream? The one about brotherhood against tyranny, courageous NO to slavery and to any humiliation. That aspect is executed in images and plots - the most memorable being, perhaps, the plot of Spartacus and Varinia (Jean Simmons)... his journey from "I am not an animal" to "I love you more than life". The beautifully symbolic scene when Spartacus and Varinia talk about the wind and wonder where the wind comes from occurs to represent this quest for knowing oneself, knowing the other person one loves. What a terrific moment! At the same time, the extraordinary aspect of development is intensified by the notion of justice...that has not been taught to people but the true Justice that is present within any cautious heart. Spartacus believes in Justice, he believes in Freedom and, like Jesus Christ, he ends up on a cross. HOWEVER...while Jesus clearly represents 'Crucified Glory of Love', Spartacus manifests 'Crucified Dream of Freedom.' The great merit of SPARTACUS, therefore, does not lie in spectacle or thrill but in the sophisticated glimpse of many characters. Apart from the main hero, we get the insight into slaves and free Patricians, the poor and the rich. Jean Simmons as Varinia - a woman who finds the love of her life; Tony Curtus as Antoninus - a young boy, a poet, a dreamer who lives his ideals...slaves that deserve to be free---the quintessential characters of the film's message. The wealthy Roman characters naturally appear in opposition to the film's spirit. Here comes Laurence Olivier as Crassus, an ambitious, powerful man of Rome, someone who cannot stand any 'no' meant to subvert the established ORDER. His patriotism equals with superiority of one group. He believes that "Rome is an eternal thought in the mind of God." He is, at the same time, a bi-sexual character attracted by Antoninus. Just before the boy runs away, there is a famous scene when the two share a bath together: "I like both oysters and snails." Besides, there is the Best Supporting Actor Winner - Peter Ustinov - as Batiatus, the corpulent lanista at the gladiatorial school of Capua, a decent man who rather finds understanding in the warm house of a corpulent womanizer, senator Gracchus (Charles Laughton) than at the luxurious mansion of proud Crassus. Patrician women are portrayed memorably, yet a bit sarcastically, by Nina Foch as Helena Glabrus and Joanna Barnes as Claudia. They are hungry to see muscled men fighting to death. They depict decadence being clearly aroused lustfully by selecting the half naked bodies of gladiators.Another merit is the sophisticated music composed by Alex North. In its uniqueness and meaning, it is comparable to the music by Miklos Rozsa in QUO VADIS? Having extensively researched the historical background and some information on ancient rhythms, Mr North collected the instruments of the time, like lute, mandolin, kythara, dulcimer, and bagpipes and, consequently, created a dramatic effect. The most memorable theme is Spartacus-Varinia love theme.The symbolic moments and visuals lead us to the world of that period and touch viewers. We see the unforgettable images of parents burying their beloved child, nostalgia in the eyes of old people, tears of brotherhood in mutual struggle and horses escaping the horror of war. Except for some historical errors (e.g. the fact of Roman garrisons) the film can boast of a very realistic depiction of the battlefield, the nicely reconstructed every-day life in Rome, including saunas, gladiatorial school and wardrobe. That all makes SPARTACUS nearly a masterpiece.There are many Roman epics but only few can stand alone, as unique and significant ones. SPARTACUS, with the splendor rooted in human spirit, is surely one of them."...as long as we live, we must remain true to ourselves," whispers the voice of freedom. Yet, there is another voice, the voice of tyranny which shouts loudly enough to tread its way of destruction: "CRUCIFY THEM ALL!" The whispering voice, however, lives on...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's epic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basically all of Kubrick's movie had an epic feel to it, due to the way they got done but with this movie Kubrick perhaps delivers his only true epic movie, in terms of its story and battles.It also at the same time is the Kubrick movie that feels the least Kubrick-like. This is no wonder, since Kubrick got brought in very late into the project by star Kirk Douglas, after he had a falling out with the original first director Anthony Mann. It hasn't really been ever clearly specified how many scenes Mann already had shot but I think its more than most people try to make you believe. Especially in the beginning there still quite a lot of moments that seem Mann-like, mostly with its character handling and interactions between the different characters. It seems as if it only are the last 30 minutes of the movie that feel typical Kubrick like and its no coincidence that the last 30 minutes of the movie are also the very best minutes of the entire movie.Because it really doesn't matter how great or lacking you think the first hours of this movie are, the movie gets made and comes totally together at its fine ending. I can definitely see still the flaws of this movie. The story doesn't always connect and its progress and characters are somewhat lacking at times. Suddenly Spartacus becomes the leader of the slave army, without a doubt or question from anyone else and not only that but he turns out to be a strategic mastermind, despite that fact that he had spend whole his life being chained and put to work in the mines. It are all little things like that that bug but like I said, the movie doesn't fully come together until its fantastic final 30 minutes, when suddenly everything works out amazingly and falls into its place.The true story of Spartacus always have been an intriguing one. A former slave who made the Roman capital tremble and this movie version of famous story is still the very best one of it out there. It captures a lot of its story and it actually tells it from many different perspectives. There are quite a lot of characters in the movie and the movie itself is also a real long one, with its 3 hours+ running time. But no, the movie obviously never bores, which is mostly also becomes of the many different characters and their viewpoints and plot lines.And the movie above most things still really remains an actors movie. It builds heavily on its characters, so it also relies heavily on its actor's performances. But with a cast like this movie had, that hardly was a risky undertaking. It of course has Kirk Douglas in the lead role but the movie its best performances come from its supporting cast members. Persons like Laurence Olivier, Charles Laughton and Peter Ustinov for instance. A whole bunch of familiar faces show up in this movie, even for some really minor parts at times.By todays standards, this movie might not be the most exciting one to watch out there but this is something that never bothered me. It always had been a movie to me that was about the story behind the story of Spartacus. Having said that, there are still a bunch of action sequences in this movie, as whole a a couple of really large scale sequences. After all, this movie is still really an epic, that's expensive- and big looking.Still the best, most impressive and the most effective telling of the Spartacus story.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering what little creative freedom Stanley Kubrick had in the making of this film, he sure did make it into a very memorable film. Sure there are certain scenes were I can say "that is definitely not a Kubrick scene", but at other times one can say "oh yes, that's a definitely Kubrick scene". it amused me how kirk Dougles (as Spartacus)first the first director and then hired Kubrick, thinking he could manipulate him. Oh, no, if anything Kubrick manipulated him. it is as Dougles said after the release of this film "Kubrick is a talented sh@t!", which in it's own way is a way of saying, "he pisses me off, but he's a damned good director". And I love seeing what Kubrick can do to a film, on the verge of failing.What more can I say, the cast is excellent. the movie is long, very long! But it serves it's cause. Such an epic can't be told in a mere two hours. And the ending is some of the greatest in all the history of Hollywood epics. I give this film no less than it deserves; a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 60s epic done correctly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The late 50s and the early 60s was the heyday of the big screen epic film. many were spectacular, while a few missed the mark.Spartacus was a spectacularly successful epic film in every way. The cinematography is rich and gorgeous. The cast and acting are superb. The story is sweeping and engaging.Spartacus tells, in broad strokes, the true story of a slave uprising against ancient Rome. Of course, the history is so far back that the real details have to be obscured by time, but in general the rebellion went on for a considerable time as the escaped slaves roved around the peninsula making trouble and dealing successfully with the smaller Roman forces sent to take care of things. Once the Romans got really annoyed, however, they got serious and defeated Spartacus' forces.Kirk Douglas gives his average outstanding performance in this movie, bringing the slave/gladiator to life right before your eyes. The deciding battle near the end is truly spectacular.Spartaus is a must see film for true fans of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only a simple man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any qualifying adjective that can be put to this movie will be short. This is not the epic film that many current generations are accustomed to see, but if it is for the time that was made even if it is ahead of his time and even if it break with the way it is accustomed to making this kind of movie, turning it into something more crude, more real, more visceral. It is not a moral analogy of the story of a man as Ben-Hur, nor are the downsides of a gladiator became a hero who defeats an empire, as in the film of Scott, Spartacus is not like any other genre movie or "Roman-Christian" theme is the vision, somewhat limited by the studios, of a simple man who revolutionized the movies with his magisterial work (Kubrick), which tells the story of another ordinary man who was not done for its time. Without so many claims Spartacus addresses the issue of freedom trough a clear way, it does so with the intent to make us believe in that principle, not transform us but yes to realize that the whole struggle is not in vain. It does not give hope, or provide answers, but if advised and drew the common man as the most important piece that should start to change in order to find the goal sought. Spartacus, said the prologue, was ahead of his time, like Kubrick and his esthetic and narrative style that can be found in each frame, his struggle as a creator of art is reflected in every scene. Kubrick is the Spartacus of movies, which advocates freedom of style, gender, leaving the stereotype and show something different, something innovative. Spartacus is Kubrick, and that is reason enough to consider this movie as a beautiful work of art ... Or there is another way to call it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most unKubrickian Kubrick project......but it still delivers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spartacus follows the time of the rebel Spartacus' life starting with his life as a slave, then gladiator, then rebel, and finally leading up to his crucifixion. This film was directed by Stanley Kubrick, but if you're a hardcore Kubrick film like myself, you'll have a hard time believing it. Is it beautiful? Yes, the photography of the film is pretty top notch. Is the camera work Kubrick? To a certain degree. It's not full force Kubrick. I interpreted this as a laid back Kubrick style of filming. And the fact that he didn't write the screenplay had a lot to do with it I'm sure. Can I praise Kirk Douglas enough for his portrayal of Spartacus? I don't think so. Kirk gives one of the best performances of his career that I've seen. I still can't place his acting here above his acting in Paths of Glory though. Another great actor here is Jean Simmons, who is a hottie for real. She is absolutely beautiful. Another thing about the movie is that even though, it's over 3 hours long, I found the pacing very well done. I never found myself bored because the film has powerful dialog, which is another big plus.10/10 Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spartacus vs Gladiator: conflicting ideologies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPARTACUS dir by Stanley Kubrick based on blacklisted writer, Howard Fast's 1952 novel Historian Durant was an adviser.Won Oscars for best supporting actor and best cinematography. Amazing that it is in many ways a better film than Ridley's "Gladiator" which won best pic of 2001, yet Spartacus was made 41 years ago. It is an epic look at the underbelly of the Roman Empire, with allegorical overtones about the McCarthy era House Un-American Activities Committee. Like "Gladiator", there is a struggle between the aristocratic class and the senate. In an obvious scene, the patrician aristocrat, Glaucus, holds up a list of names of those to be arrested. The leading senator himself is eventually brought by force from his home to the senate to listen to the aristocrat's demands.Impressive scenes throughout, without aid of computer technology. Kubrick gives us a vision of the carnage after a major defeat of the slave army. Hundreds of remaining male slaves are crucified along the highway leading back to Rome. A romantic plot is overlaid on this by Hollywood, as usual. The dismal tragedy of the execution of Spartacus is mollified by the idea that his infant son will live in freedom. This was to suggest, prophetically we can see today, that the future generation of Americans would be free from the paranoid injustice of McCarthyism. Where Kubrick's is ideologically superior to the new Gladiator is that it dramatizes the oppressed dignity of the working class against the corrupt decadence of the owners. But in "Gladiator", the hero is a military general, defeating the barbarians at first. He is an imperialist who dreams of private life, and his story unfolds as an individualist. He does not inspire an uprising of slaves who seek their liberty. Instead he inspires admiration for his individual struggle for vengeance. It is a simple revenge plot of justified violence, parading its own hypocrisy openly. The film pretends to be critical of Roman blood-lust, which creates violence as a spectacle of entertainment; yet "Gladiator" itself won the prize precisely by representing a spectacle of violence (or to be more accurate, it won by deploying this hypocrisy of glamorizing violence while moralizing against it--the most common technique in movies today). In contrast, "Spartacus" represents much justified violence on the part of the slave uprising, but it leaves us with a distaste for the struggle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That very scene, that very line -- was what drew me into this film when I was a mere five years old. This is an epic film of a man who grew to be the most unlikely leader...a film that should be viewed over and over and over again for its brilliance, its acting by the great Mr. Douglas, it's direction by Mr. Krubeck, it's locations and story. It's been a LONG time since epic movies have been made, everyone is after the almighty dollar and want things resolved in a hour and twenty minutes. But some films don't deserve these chops and back in the day when we had films such as Lawrence of Arabia, the Ten Commandments, Ben Hur, and Spartacus who cared how long they were, they were brilliant films.I'm writing this in 2004 where we are not seeing films such as Gladiator, The Harry Potter Series, The Lord of The Rings Series, Master and Commander from the Far Side of the World, etc., going over that two hour mark and people actually sitting through them -- enjoying the film experience for the entertainment and epic grand tales of these stories. Just like back in the day with Spartacus. I say, its about time, bring them on. For the rising costs of film to sit in a theater, now having this new wave of movie going experiences like Spartacus is as great way to bring the recent movie going public BACK to these films and to be able to sit down and watch them for the brilliant films they are.Spartacus is one of the top 100 Films of all time.</fullReview>

The battle scene in the end and the scene where Crassus (played by Laurence Olivier) is seducing a slave Antoninus (Tony Curtis) when he is taking a baths are very great. The cinematography is beautiful and although director Stanley Kubrick did not really made the film his own with his wonderful style, he does a great job. Performances by Douglas, Olivier, Curtis, Jean Simmons (who plays Varinia, the wife of Spartacus) and especially Peter Ustinov (as Lentulus Batiatus, who bought Spartacus in the beginning) are amazing. The movie is a little too long but despite that it is a very good one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See the Restored Film on the Big Screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a huge silver screen in a 1,500 seat Italian Renaissance Theater, I viewed the epic film. Restored in 70 millimeter film, you cannot fully appreciate this work viewing it on a TV screen. While Spartacus is a historically accurate person the movie makes slight changes to his history. We find Kirk Douglas as Spartacus being taken into slavery at age 13 and now in the rock quarry in Libya, North Africa prior to his being sold to Peter Ustinov as the gladiator school owner, Lentulus Batiatus. A historical note on an Internet website reports that Spartacus was a Thracian Soldier who was captured by the Romans and sold into slavery. This aside, the drama and telling of the story of slaves wishing to be free men is more compelling than this slight historical inaccuracy.For almost the first hour of this long 190 minute epic, Kirk Douglas has few speaking lines. Rather, he acts by his eye movements and sheer presence on the film. The film is heavy with excellent extreme facial close-ups which when seen in 70 millimeters makes for dramatic acting in spite of the lack of dialog. What is remarkable is the way the film shows and tells the story of how gladiators were trained at "schools" to perform in the arenas of Rome. See this film for the training school sequences alone and you have received your money's worth.Kirk Douglas begins to speak more dialog after he and his fellow gladiator trainees overrun the school and set out to free all slaves being held in Italy. However, the most dialog and most skillfully acted is the scene stealing performance of Peter Ustinov as Batiatus. Strong performances were made by the great Charles Laughton as the senior Roman Senator, Sempornius Gracchus. A Roman Republican, Gracchus weaves a web of political intrigue which ends in his not shown on screen, suicide. Sir Laurence Olivier as the power seizing Marcus Licinius Crassus is a believable power behind the throne who wins in the end.Charles McGraw plays the gladiator trainer Marcellus. Marcellus was a slave gladiator who survived the arena and was promoted to gladiator school trainer by Batiatus. Watch how he dies during the slave revolt. Good performance by McGraw.The subplot is a romance between Spartacus and Bratiatus' household slave and slave concubine Varinia played by the lovely Jean Simmons. Her only flaw when viewing her close-ups is that Hollywood makeup artists gave her overly large black eyebrows which detract from her pretty face. Spartacus, whom in this movie we are lead to believe has been a slave for more than 15 years or so and obviously "without woman" falls in love with Varinia and she with him. History records, however, that Spartacus had a wife before he was captured and made a slave. But, without a romance and a pretty face, these "swashbuckler epics" would not survive on the sheer weight of the fighting sequences and political twists and turns.Once the slaves escape and run wild liberating 12,000 slaves of Italy, Douglas and Simmons declare their love for each other and become common-law husband and wife. A boy child ensues. Watch to see what happens in the end.The final battle scenes using 8,000 real Spanish Army soldiers marching in attack formations becomes too much for the slave army to overcome. Craccus prevails and the entire slave army is destroyed and the survivors crucified along the famous Apian Way Road into Rome as an example for others not to repeat this again.Tony Curtis a slave poet and magician/juggler, Antoninus, who first resembles a pacifist becomes an able right hand man and Lieutenant to the new General of Slaves, Spartacus. Despite Mr. Curtis' renowned "New York" accent, you seem to forget it due to the action-in-every-scene of this movie. Spartacus lives long enough to see from his Varinia and his infant son being smuggled out of Rome with the help of Batiatus and the money from Gracchus as Simmons hold up Spartacus' son and from the cross, Spartacus knows that his son will grow up a free man.An error was made in naming John Gavin's character Caius Julius Caesar who became head of the Roman Guard. Caesar is a title meaning Emperor and thus the younger Caius Julius would not have been referred to by the name Caesar until he later became the actual Emperor of Rome. In fact, it's more accurate to refer to him later as Caesar, Julius rather than Julius Caesar. In the same manner, Christ is not the last name of Jesus. Rather, Christos in Greek means the "anointed one" and thus, it is a title, also. John Ireland plays slave gladiator and Spartacus' lieutenant Crixus, although he has little speaking parts he fights well. Woody Strode as Draba gave a memorable performance.This movie is a solid "9" and should be seen on the widest TV screen you can find, or else watch for a revival showing on a huge theater screen. Don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gladiator as realistic individual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a difference a script can make!! This past Sunday, March 25, 2001, a "historical" movie, GLADIATOR, won an important award, the Oscar for Best Picture. Its credentials and appeal are in striking contrast to the 1960 epic SPARTACUS. That slave and gladiator and human being (played by Kirk Douglas) stands head and shoulders above the slave and gladiator and human being, Maximus (played by Oscar-winning Russell Crowe). The story and underlying ideas that send the characters to their comparable deaths are of considerable impact on their audiences. The 2000 script by co-producer David Franzoni and others did not win in the category for Best Screenplay (Original) because of any number of plot discrepancies and overall "leaps." The 1960 script, on the other hand, utilizing a powerful historically based novel, does convey more of the reality of slavery's cruelty and oppression. Whereas Russell Crowe's portrayal comes across as a blend of "Terminator" and "Rambo," the Kirk Douglas fight scenes retain an urgent, fearful, and yet human effort to stay alive one more day. A contrast of the villains in the two screenplays (Commodus versus Crassus) as well as other minor characters (e.g. Lucilla versus Varinia, Quintus versus Antoninus) shows again and again that the earlier slave/gladiator epic went for message and subtlety while the 2000 slave/gladiator "vehicle" goes for enormous effect and visceral fast moves. I find the new GLADIATOR to be visually impressive and interesting for its use of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) as a conflicted world leader. The story of the downtrodden and their champion that is SPARTACUS is going to last and hold up far better to future generations, however. The DVD extras that include commentary by Director Ridley Scott and others may hold some answers to the plot "flaws" of the new movie but the reverent restoration done a few years ago on the old movie improved its story's already evident strengths and daring characterizations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of those movies which somehow seems to improve as it ages (probably because, between viewings, we forget how many cliches it avoids), Spartacus is a terrific film, and one which, I think, would have been every bit as terrific even if Mr Douglas and Mr Mann hadn't had that little falling out which led to Mr Kubrick getting the phone call.Don't get me wrong, I think Kubrick was a great director, perhaps even the best there has been, but not only had Spartacus been in pre-production for over a year by the time he was told to hop aboard, the actual shooting had already begun (that opening sequence in the quarry is all Mann's, I believe). On a project of this scale, made in the heart of the Hollywood machine, even the most tyrannous director would be hard pressed to shape it into something that reflected himself, and indeed, some sources suggest Kubrick all but disowned the film. He certainly wasn't involved with the '91 restoration.The only conclusion is that, whatever contribution he made scene-by-scene, the film's many overall qualities (witty dialogue, an emphasis on intrigue, a political theme, very handsome look) were there regardless of Kubrick, not because of him.</fullReview>

The score was excellent, as were the cinematography and acting. I wasn't sure what to expect of John Dall and John Gavin but I was pleasantly surprised by all. Laughton and Ustinov are very good and Olivier's Crassus drips with evil.The drama is so compelling - you empathize with the characters so much! I cried during the "I am Spartacus" scene. And at times, Tony Curtis seems like this little boy who needs to be loved and wants so badly to help Spartacus that you just can't help but feel for him. And I don't blame him for running away from his master. If Olivier's Crassus came on to me, and told me to serve Rome (an analogy for himself?), I'd flee too.The supporting actors are great too. Charles McGraw was very hatable, and the Roman "nymphs" (Nina Foch and Joanna Barnes) are such a fine example of the vain, idle rich.Although this isn't the most Kubrick-ian of Kubrick's films, probably due to Kirk Douglas' and Anthony Mann's influences, it is one of the best historical epics ever, and is a total treat to watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has moments that transcend the campiness of the genre of The Hollywood Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps the most un-Kubrick of Kubrick's films, but his touch is evident, if not always obvious. (Understandable, since part of the footage shoot by Anthony Mann was used...)Kubrick's films always have a theme of man versus destiny, versus a supposedly insurmountable obstacle. Things look bleak, but an individual musters the courage to fight against the powers that be...and he usually loses. Kubrick is a pessimistic -- well, maybe a pragmatic romantic. He likes to see the little guy fight the good fight, hopes that maybe it makes a difference, even if he knows that the battle is doomed from the start. Maybe it will make a difference in the long run, but make no mistake, our hero is doomed.About the movie itself...The romance is tacked on, perfunctory, and without any spark between Kirk Douglas and Jean Simmons. Its only purpose seems to be the final scene, to allow Spartacus to see his free son while he is lashed to the cross, crucified by the state of Rome. (If you didn't know that's how it ends, you shouldn't be reading this, and you have no one but yourself to blame.) But the politics, the manipulations, the intricate dealings between those with power and those who have been overpowered are FASCINATING! Both between the powers of Rome and the slaves but amongst the senators themselves! Crassus' rise to power -- seizure of power may be more accurate -- is underplayed with cool calculation by Laurence Olivier. There is no need to wonder why he is regarded as one of the finest actors to grace the screen based upon this performance. Charles Laughton and Peter Ustinov also turn in first rate characterizations, and any of the scenes in which any combination of the three negotiate, threaten, haggle or barter far surpasses some of the moments of simple moralizing that pop up elsewhere in the film. This, I believe, must have been what attracted Kubrick to the material, even though he was just a director for hire. Look at "Paths of Glory" or the scene where the President phones the Russian Premier from the war room in "Dr. Strangelove," and you'll see how Kubrick regards the negotiations of those in power. Moments of absurdity as fine as any ever committed to celluloid.Watch it for that. Watch it for the absurdity of it all. Kubrick's sense of the epic isn't as developed as, say, Sir David Lean's, but he doesn't give a rat's fart about the grandeur. Watch it for the struggles between those who have power and those who WANT power. Watch it with the knowledge of what befalls Crassus (and Caeser, for that matter). Watch it knowing the tragedy that will eventually befall those who try to defend Rome, and the tragedy that will befall Rome itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the great epics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1960, "Spartacus" must have been a stunning achievement - it was one of the most magnificent, intellectual, daring epics since "Gone With the Wind" and dealt with important ideas like freedom and independence as well as spectacle. The unconventional ending denies the hero a happy victory, and he has to take solace in the fact that maybe the world will be better for his children as a result of his achievement.In 1999, it still holds up well, especially the quality of the battle scenes and the subtle dance of sexual motivations. In particular, there is a key, daring scene which has been restored in the new version (it was cut by censors), where Olivier's Senator Crassus and a slave, played by Tony Curtis, share a bath. In that scene, the complex motivations of Crassus are made clear, and they are way ahead of their time - Crassus confesses, "I like both oysters and snails," and essentially reveals that he is a bisexual who sexual desires are a form of conquest and an outgrowth of his possessive nature.Unfortunately, I also found to be a very restrained film. Writer Dalton Trumbo suffered at the hands of the Hollywood blacklisters (this is his first screen credit since he was blacklisted more than 10 years before), but he avoids any stirring speeches about freedom and revolution. Frankly, it isn't clear to me why the other slaves are so quick to join Spartacus in his largely personal rebellion, or why they follow him as a leader. The audience has to believe that the individual freedom we enjoy in 20th century America was universally and automatically something that the gladiators were willing to readily die for, on Spartacus' say-so.Director Kubrick's later works (most notably "A Clockwork Orange") would rebel against authoritarian governments with much more passion than this film. In addition, the relationship between Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) and Varinia (Jean Simmons) is tender but restrained; they fall in love in the opening scenes of the movie even though they never speak, barely ever touch each other and never speak more than three words.All that said, the film is a remarkable achievement. The performances are all superb, especially Ustinov's sly, Oscar-winning comic performance; Olivier's evil dictator; Laughton's wonderful work; and Simmons and Douglas as well.The battle scene is one of the most spectacular ever filmed, with over 8,000 Spanish soldiers filling out the ranks of the slaves and the Roman army, in sharp contrast to those all-too-common ancient battle scenes in which fast cutting and close shots fail to create the illusion that the couple of dozen men fighting are two clashing armies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest battle .. is against time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One year earlier, in 1959, William Wyler finished his own opus known to film buffs as Ben Hur.In 1960, Kubrick directed this film under the tight scrutiny of the "real" producer, Douglas himself.Both films seem alike in the IMDb. That is, the ratings are similar, the public acclaim (at the time) similar, and both won multiple awards.But the real battle, the real foe, is time itself.A half-century later, BEN HUR still shines, the dialog still rings, and Heston's prideful acting outlives the actor himself, as is true with all great actors.This film does not fare so well for any who would spend 3+ hours with it. Douglas could not resist casting himself in the lead even though he was 45 at the time. The average age of an actual Roman gladiator was 22.So Spartacus, to the jaundiced eye, seems more than the story of someone's father raising an army of slaves, than an actual gladiator.The fight scenes all seem staged, as, indeed, much of the "action" seemed in most films of the era -- compared to SPARTACUS BLOOD AND SAND in 2010, for example, the 1960 film seems almost in slow motion.The point? I could go on. Jean Simmonds seems lost in her role. The dialog is stilted. The music is insanely wrong, too much wind instrument noise, also common for the era. In fact, of the entire cast, the only one who seems comfortable in the role of a Roman is Peter Ustinov and that is because he carried himself in real life the same way, as if everyone he met was in some way beneath him.There are timeless films and timeless performances. This is not one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I know a lot of people love Gladiator, and I guess it wasn't that bad, but it was still just a dumb action movie. it also pales in comparison to Spartacus, the original fight in the Colosseum flick. What differs is that it is just so much more interesting, with a great story about a man who tries to fight against the Romans and regain his peoples dignity.There are a number of notable pieces of brilliance that make this such a great film, especially for it's time. Firstly, the script is full of great dialog, and offers some fantastic lines for the Romans. It is the first film to include a Gay scene, though it is done with clever subtlety. And it was one of the first big epics to end in a downer. Yep, that's right!! Goes against what most people want in a big screen epic but it was done well!! There's plenty more to recommend it, but I think it is best just to say it is one of the finest films ever made and well worth watching if you want a film with some brains, as well as epic action.</fullReview>

Unlike Gladiator which it is compared to, Spartacus does a great job in developing the characters in the movie. While Kirk Douglas did a masterful job, Lawrence Olivier, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov, Jean Simmons, et al, gave masterful renditions. The climactic battle may have lacked the enthusiasm of the opening battle sequence in Gladiator, but the dramatic approach of the Roman legions on the field of battle was breath taking, particularly with the dramatic music score by Alex North.I've seen this movie at least 10 times and intend to see it another 10 or more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film which actually lives up to its budget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made for the then-unheard-of sum of $12 million, and involving 10,500 people throughout the course of production, "Spartacus" probably still stands today as the biggest film ever made. What makes it more than this is a commitment to theme and character too often absent from big-budget Hollywood.It seems trite to say a film is about "what it means to be human," but that is indeed the core, the thread which runs through this magnificent epic. The quest of a man to prove to himself and the world that he is indeed a man.The existence of the character of Spartacus seems almost impossible. How could a man who was born in bondage, whose family had been mere chattel for generations, who has been treated his entire life as a beast--how could such a man be so SURE that he was more than just a body to be used up, and that freedom was his destiny?It seems unrealistic, but it is not. Anyone who has read "The Autobiography of Frederick Douglass" knows that this strength and pride can burn inside a slave even when there is no external force to spark or sustain it. Like Douglass, Spartacus is a man who knew, intrinsically, that he and people like him deserved more.There is much, much more to this film than just Spartacus, of course. But it is his growth into a truly free human being that left the strongest impression of me. He develops from a man barely capable of articulating his feelings at the film's beginning ("I am not an animal!") into a true leader who is ultimately a far greater man than the ruthless, privileged Crassus could ever hope to be. Early on in the film, Spartacus expresses shame to his love Varinia that he cannot read, that he does not understand the forces of nature such as wind and the movement of the heavens. Varinia responds, simply, "You know things that cannot be taught." Surely enough, near the film's conclusion, the educated and urbane Crassus struggles to understand Spartacus and Varinia's love for him. "I want to understand!" he exclaims in anguish. But he could never understand what Spartacus knew intrinsically, even though he could not read a single word: the value of each human being, be they rich or poor, free or slave.These grand themes are subtly tempered by the presence of Batiatis and Gracchus, two very flippant, cynical, down-to-earth characters who present a gray area between the grand extremes and dramatic speeches of Spartacus and Crassus. Peter Ustinov won a much-deserved Best Supporting Actor Oscar for slimy, wimpy slave-trader Batiatis; Charles Laughton could just as easily have won for the decadant but ultimately good-hearted populist politician Gracchus. Add on Olivier's stunning performance as Crassus (truly a screen villain writ large--on par with the greatest), and you're left wishing that somehow the Oscar could have been split three ways. Quite frankly, I'm at a loss to think of another film which boasts THREE supporting performances of this calibre.The film isn't without its weak points, however. Tony Curtis as Antoninus and John Dall as Glaborus take the viewer out of the world of the film with their unapologetically modern dialects. In the end, though, these are minor quibbles within a major cinematic achievement. Easily one of the 100 greatest films ever made--I'm rather disappointed to see it so low on the IMDB top 250.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a "little" commentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would not write an entire critic for this movie, because it's clearly out of my range. As a summary I'll say its the film that most perfectly portraits the concept of freedom.I will only write a commentary about the final scene. I remember how I liked the whole film when I first saw it a lot of years ago. But with every time I saw it afterwards, I began to realize the level of perfection the final scene achieves.Today, every time I see the film, I cry at the end. It's the most wonderful ending any script of any film has achieved, IMHO. In fact, it´s the happiest end that would have been realistic without being historically wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic cinema at its finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick essentially disowned this movie, saying it was not really his work. It's true that Anthony Mann directed the first half, and the movie on the whole lacks trademark touches of Kubrick, who was basically a director for hire. There's a reason you don't find this in his box sets.Having said all that, this is a movie anyone should be THRILLED to have on his resume. It's rare you find something that shoots so high and makes a bullseye. Certain things, such as the extremely long time at the beginning we simply watch a blank screen while music plays, would have come across as pretentious and irritating in most anything else, yet it's okay here because this movie doesn't just act like it's a larger than life masterpiece, it delivers the goods! The sets and location shooting are breathtaking at many times; the sight of the hundreds of slaves marching into battle made my jaw drop. And there's plenty of substance beneath the style; the story line is gripping and goes far beyond that of many similar movies in terms of complexity. As far as the performances, they are uniformly great. Kirk Douglas, a stellar leading man, suits the title role perfectly, Laurence Olivier is amazingly detestable as the villain, and the supporting cast, which includes Jean Simmons, Tony Curtis, and Charles Laughton, is highlighted by Peter Ustinov's justly Oscar winning performance. Despite a 3 hours+ running time, Spartacus is never once boring, and despite being a rabble rousing film about a hero, is never once predictable or cliche. The famous "I'm Spartacus" scene towards the end has been parodied many times, and it's easy to see why it made such a huge impression on filmgoers. Works like this are among the best examples of "movie magic" and it should be required viewing for any film school student!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A magnificent movie deserving of every accolade heaped upon it. Watch out, especially, for the credit sequence at the beginning. It is truly worthy of this epic.Unless you are watching it at home (and can rewind), it might just pass you by before you are settled in. And that would be a pity. So get comfortable quickly before the movie starts. Be prepared for a real treat.Whoever put the credit sequence together ought to be commended. Coincidentally, Alex North also composed the music of the other epic with a great credit sequence, Cleopatra.</fullReview>

Russell Crowe sweating and grunting isn't drama. Kirk Douglas telling a man he has to kill that he loves him like a son, and making you weep as he does it... _That's_ drama.The whole thing is fine, even the one slave-turned-soldier who apparently was captured in Brooklyn (judging from his accent). Peter Ustinov does the cowardly hero to perfection. Charles Laughton makes intrigue interesting. And Olivier is evil. It doesn't get any better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roman Slaves' Cry For Freedom Is Clearly Heard Through This Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In spite of some historical inaccuracies, the epic spectacle "Spartacus" (1960) is a remarkable movie which should be rightly called late Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece (even though he practically disowned it). The cast members are excellent. Kirk Douglas was perfectly cast as this historical slave revolt leader. In fact, he was the right age. (Spartacus was in his late 30's when he revolted while Douglas was about 45 when he made this film.) Sir Lawrence Olivier is superb as the cocky and filthy-rich Roman politician Crassus. Other players including Peter Ustinov, John Gavin (yes, Honorable John Gavin, former U.S. Ambassador to Mexico) and Charles Laughton are equally magnificent in their respective roles. The drama and emotion of this film moved me to tears.The last decisive battle scene between the slave army and Roman legions was magnificently staged. The extras playing the Roman legionnaires marched in formation so precisely, and the whole formation moved like a single organism. The blinding flash, which was created when thousands of extras simultaneously pointed their shields toward the camera, was absolutely awe-inspiring. Just before the two armies clashed, thousands of extras playing the Roman army quickly and precisely reorganized the formation to create skirmish lines. This was a site to behold. It must have been absolutely terrifying for the foes of Rome to watch the formations of these robot-like, super-precise Roman legionnaires charging toward them. (No wonder the extras moved with such a precision. The Roman soldiers were played by 8000 infantrymen from the Spanish Army.) The whole thing was so good it gave me goose bumps.Of course, since this is a Hollywood movie, there are some almost mandatory historical inaccuracies: 1) Roman historians recorded that Spartacus was sold as a slave as a punishment for deserting from the Roman army. There is no record of his working in a Libyan mine. According to Roman historian Plutarch, Spartacus was sold to a gladiator school run by a man named Lentulus Batiatus (played in the movie by Peter Ustinov). 2) Spartacus apparently did not meet his wife at the gladiator school. He was already married at the time he was sold as a slave, and his wife was also sold as a slave. 3) Spartacus' slave army suffered greatly from an internal strife which eventually led to its defeat by Crassus' legions. (This internal strife was not even mentioned in the movie.) Spartacus and his followers within the slave army wanted to flee from Italy and disband the army outside the Roman territory so all the foreign slaves can return home. Others wanted to remain in Italy and keep on looting. 4) In the movie, Spartacus forbade his men from forcing Roman prisoners to fight as gladiators. However, real Spartacus apparently made many Roman captives to fight in gladiator fights. 5) Both Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus and his brother Gaius Sempronius Gracchus, famous pro-plebian reformers, died decades before Spartacus' revolt. The film is unclear as to whether the Charles Laughton character is Tiberius or his brother. 6) Crassus' last decisive campaign against Spartacus was more complex and time-consuming than what was portrayed in the movie. It involved building dozens of miles of fortifications near the southern tip of Italy and decimation (i.e. execution of one in ten soldiers) of his own defeated legions for cowardice. However, these historical inaccuracies did not lessen the value of this movie. The cry for freedom by Spartacus and other slaves 2000 years ago can be clearly heard through this movie. All lovers of Roman epic should see this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Pick For #1 Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know it is probably not going to make me very popular here on IMDb where everyone seems to be either a fan of Shawshank Redemption or Citizen Kane or they are all about Star Wars or Lord of the Rings..... well I like all of those movies too but for whatever reason my all time favorite is and always has been and always will be Spartacus! Maybe it is because it is the first movie I remember watching as a kid and I just loved all the action and especially the climactic scene at the end where Spartacus is forced to fight his own friend.... whatever the reason is I always really loved watching this movie and still do. I can't wait to share it with my kids whenever they are old enough for a kind of violent movie like this.Directed by Stanley Kubrick you know it has to be good, and I think this is his best movie that he ever made.1960, rated R but probably PG-13 by today's standards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ambitious epic, but rather ponderous, and unsubtle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spartacus is one film I felt compelled to watch. It had been frequently mentioned as a classic, and therefore I was pleased to finally catch up with it this year. I was disappointed with it however, on the surface, it has an interesting story, and interesting characters. The acting is good, if a little over done as might be expected in a Hollywood epic. It starts of well enough, with Kirk Douglas playing Spartacus who is a slave being trained to be a gladiator. The scenes in the gladiator school, are tough, and have a brutal efficiency to them. Then the story begins to escalate and I think struggles to maintain a focused narrative. Spartacus leads a slave revolt, which causes all sorts of plotting in Rome amongst the panicking generals and senators. Lawrence Olivier plays the most ruthless of the antagonists who sets out to destroy Spartacus, and in doing so wants to lay his claim to be the emperor. He is opposed by the machinations of Charles Laughton's higher minded senator. The acting is solid but subdued on the whole. Peter Ustinov as the Roman who runs the gladiator training camp, is doing Peter Ustinov's forte, i.e. doing a clever slyly witty turn. The film is rather worthy and its attempt to see Spartacus as a Christ like figure, is obvious. It amuses rather than jars seeing Hollywood's po-faced interjection of the religious symbolism in the film. Where the film disappoints is surprisingly its cinematography. Kubrick doesn't bring much visual flourish to the film which is unexpected. Only the major battle scene shows Kubrick at his best, with its cold and clinically powerful visuals. The film lacks the drive to sustain three hours though, even with the many sub plots. The film is never dull but it is only sporadically exciting, and you sort of drift along with it. There are some major faults with the film,one is the illogic of Spartacus in allowing himself to be attacked by three Roman armies. He did have the opportunity to attack one roman army at a time at his discretion. Poor generalship on Spartacus's part certainly, but not helpful to the films credibility. The last scene shows Spartacus being crucified, yet he has not a mark on him. Kirk Douglas suffers manfully but the lack of injuries is ridiculous, and really kills the power of the ending. It is a film I am glad to have finally seen, but it left me unmoved. It's a film that tries hard to be an intelligent epic, but it is strangely unconvincing, despite the good overall acting. It is by no means a failure, but somehow it lacks a necessary deep and emotional connection to any of the characters. The scene that does work best is the 'I'm Spartacus scene' it is a classic, yet not enough to make me like this film. I respect the ambition of the film, but once the film was over, I felt underwhelmed. It's one film ticked of my must watch list, but not one I would need to watch again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Epic Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick has given us many memorable films, but this is my personal favorite. It is hard to imagine that he was not even nominated for best director in 1960. I suppose his final satisfaction must have come in the endurance of this film's popularity after all the other nominees faded into obscurity.'Spartacus' is one of the great Hollywood epics and Kirk Douglas' defining role. It is a brilliantly written screenplay that combines the struggle for freedom from oppression with a compelling love story in a setting that accurately depicts the majesty as well as the corruption of the Roman Empire. The scenes depicting the political maneuvering of the Senate were priceless.Kubrick's work was nothing short of brilliant. His attention to the details of the period was wonderful. The orchestration of tens of thousands of extras in the battle scenes was phenomenal. His presentation of the love scenes between Varinia and Spartacus were sensitive and compelling. I was most impressed with his treatment of the slave army. He put a human face on the slaves by showing mothers with their children and scenes of Spartacus walking among the people. This completely wins the affections of the viewer. His pacing was perfect and despite the film's length at over three hours, it did not seem to drag since there was always something fascinating on the screen.Kirk Douglas gave a powerful performance and created a character that was bigger than life. He was strong and inspirational while simultaneously being gentle and kind. Laurence Olivier gave a riveting performance Crassus. He was cunning, imperious, consumed by ambition and utterly heartless. It is hard to imagine a more nefarious bad guy.Jean Simmons has had an impressive acting career that has spanned more than 50 years. She is both a great beauty and an enchanting actress. She gave Varinia dignity, strength of character and a quiet seductiveness that played well off the power exuded from Douglas. Their screen chemistry was both passionate and touching.Rounding out a great cast were Peter Ustinov who was terrific as the sniveling and cowardly Batiatius always conniving to profit from someone else's misfortunes, and Charles Laughton as the astute and duplicitous Gracchus, manipulating the Roman senate to his best advantage.This is among the best epics ever made and certainly among the top three films about the Roman Empire. I rated it a 10/10. This film should be on every film buff's list of required viewing and is highly recommended for its moving story to anyone who hasn't seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Entertaining Spectacle That Also Has Some Substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main reason to watch the epic "Spartacus" is probably for its sheer entertainment value, since it offers interesting characters, a great deal of action, and numerous lavish settings and sequences. But it also has some substance as well, even if it is not as noticeable as the rest. Without knowing who the director was, it might come as a small surprise to know that Stanley Kubrick directed it, but then again, his craftsmanship and distinctive style are quite apparent at times.The story certainly lends itself readily to cinema, and with all the battles, confrontations, and tumultuous developments, it's little wonder that they decided to film it as an epic. It makes for an interesting contrast with the movies on which Kubrick put his own stamp, but then again there are times when the subtleties in some of the characters, and some of the less-obvious possibilities in some of the sequences and settings, add some depth. It makes the movie worth re-watching to catch some of the detail, since the action and spectacle tend to dominate your attention at first.The cast likewise is an interesting combination of talent, and most of them work quite well in defining their characters. Kirk Douglas makes a very suitable movie version of Spartacus, and several of the other cast members get the chance to stand out as well. In particular, Peter Ustinov and Charles Laughton both steal more than their share of scenes.It's very easy to understand why a director of Kubrick's stature would have been disappointed not to have complete control over a project like this, and given the opportunity he could surely have produced a different version of "Spartacus" that would have been worthwhile in its own way. Alternatively, they could have filmed a more strictly historical version of events. But the "Spartacus" that they did create is more than worthwhile, as an interesting and often enthralling drama with many memorable sequences, and one that also contains some interesting observations on its subjects and themes.</fullReview>

A powerful achievement. A film far better than the over-hyped ,produced ,cheesy and lame in terms of performances , but with glorious Production design and a chariot race,BEN HUR. Those 11 Academy awards should've gone to this film.For 12 million dollars of budget it creates a film with a scale that is unimaginable.No CGI effects used for its spectacular battle scenes. Those who say that Stanley Kubrick films lack emotion should watch this film. There were many touching and emotional moments in the film especially towards the end. With Scenes that look like as if they were shot in present days with modern technology rather than in the 60's.The Sets were elevating, and performances were strong.Kirk Douglas leads the whole film without trouble. At over 3 hours this film never feels like a boring film ,with the exception of some scenes that could've trimmed(Blame the writer).It is Kubrick that enriches every film of his.He brings the utter realism and beauty to every shot and never makes it look like a cheesy 50's film.This unrated Director's Cut is splendid and surpasses all swords and sandal epics we come across nowadays.Before there even was The Gladiator ,there was Spartacus.Although it is a major disappointment that this film wasn't even given as much nominations or awards as Ben Hur got and that performances in that film were lame and weak.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfocused and simplistic. This is a Stanley Kubrick film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPARTACUS can be described in a few words:Spartacus: slave, family man, husband &amp; lover, freedom fighter = good. Romans: hedonists, no families to be seen, hang around the sauna all day, scheming = bad.That's it. The treatment is that simplistic. I expected more from Stanley Kubrick. Yes, the film was made in 1960 but even so I thought the film was too one note about everything, including Kirk Douglas' pseudo saintly character. The pacing was rather slow which is typical for a Stanley Kubrick film. What was surprising was how unfocused the direction was. Kubrick films (2001, CLOCKWORK ORANGE, SHINING...) are probably the most focused films ever made and to watch SPARTACUS wobble here and there, with no discernible idea of what it wanted to be, was really odd. The film feels like it had just too many cooks working behind it. The cinematography is also unusually unspectacular for an epic film. The sets are sorta grubby looking. Add all of this with the monotonous score, which was way too bombastic for the dour looking film and well, there wasn't much to enjoy for me. It's not a disaster by any means. It's a well made but it's average, for a so-called spectacular epic but also because of who directed it. Watching SPARTACUS was surprisingly underwhelming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spartacus is one of the best epic of all time, and one of the best films already made, not to mention that a year earlier had released Ben-Hur, and the public may attend expecting a movie or the same level or better, if someone ask me which epic I think better, Spartacus or Ben-Hur, I would answer Spartacus, even me finding Ben- Hur incredible, Spartacus suffered much in production, Anthony Mann directed the opening scene of the film, and then was fired for fighting with own Kirk Douglas that besides acts is producer, in his place entered yet unknown to much of the world, Stanley Kubrick, that even without much artistic freedom, managed to make a spectacular movie (even if he did not liking the movie), Spartacus already caught my attention, the photo caught my attention, excellent, the production is excellent, even not being level of Ben- Hur (what it is almost impossible), the cast is great, Kirk Douglas this excellent as Spartacus, even at times be a bit forced, more he sent too well, Jean Simmons is very well as Varinia (which does not exist), Laurence Olivier, in my opinion is the best thing in the movie, he's incredible, you feel anger Crassus, so was weird the scene he's a slap in Spartacus, the cast still has John Gavin, John Ireland, Tony Curtis, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov who won the Oscar for best supporting actor, he is well, but I think anyone who deserved to win an Oscar was Laurence Olivier, and Kirk Douglas deserved an indication at least, the soundtrack is excellent,the dialogues are very good, the script Dalton Trumbo is excellent, even some dialogues being longer than it should, the film has great moments, plus has two striking to me, the scene of the I Am Spartacus, which is incredible, see slaves shouting it, even knowing that this act would they be crucified, and the end when Varinia with the child is under the Spartacus cross is very exciting (even in real life, Spartacus actually died in battle), which left exciting in that final scene was the soundtrack is amazing, along with Varinia saying that his son was born free, Spartacus is too much in battle, is well done, even being a 1960 movie, the final battle is very good and very well done, the costumes are also very good, are various types of clothing, the film improves every time the first act is the slowest, since have almost no battle over the other two are excellent, it is quite shocking see all slaves on the cross, Spartacus is one of my favorite movies, this in my Top 10, is exciting, has great battles, great dialogues, a good direction of Stanley Kubrick, even he did not have much artistic freedom, and we see Kirk Douglas in his prime, I particularly think Spartacus along with the best Braveheart epic already done, with Lawrence of Arabia and Ben-Hur ago.

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's Hollywood Calling Card</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kubrick's films are sleepers. Not that Spartacus didn't make money on it's initial release in 1960. It was successful, both critically and commercially, but I had little interest in the film when I first saw it on TV when I was young. Much like 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Shining and Full Metal Jacket, Kubrick's films, for whatever reason, took a while to grow on me, and I'm not alone in this. Spielberg, Scorsese and other film making legends agree. But my local cinema had a season of Kubrick, playing 2001 and Spartacus. For the first time I saw them on the big screen, with the strident, thundering score, the amazing battle scenes and incredible cinematography, and I now love this film. 2001 as well. Kirk Douglas is great as the title character. Peter Ustinov's performance was fantastic, his Oscar win was well deserved. The most well known scenes are of course, the "I am Spartacus!" scene and the gladiator fight. But there's so much more to this film. Is it Kubrick's best? No. Kubrick disliked the film, and later disowned it, citing studio interference and what he considered to be a dumb script as the reasons why. I don't disagree, it is a flawed film, but still thoroughly enjoyable.Is it his most personal? No, but it is better than Ben- Hur and a lot of films from that era, and it's aged a lot better than other sword and sandals epics from the 50s and 60s. And the reoccurring themes in his films where man is made into a killing machine would reappear in Full Metal Jacket. Kubrick's films are in my opinion, some of the greatest ever made, they just take a while to creep under the skin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun Ride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spartacus is a historical epic that follows amongst the footsteps of prior historical epics such as Ben-Hur and the Ten Commandments. I have to admit this film is not nearly as great as those, but I am certainly not bashing this film. The fact is, the film is a tad overlong and the dialogue does not hold up well by today's standards. I can appreciate the fine performances, especially Ustinov's Oscar-winning performance, as well as the steady direction of a legend, Stanley Kubrick. The film has some great action sequences and as a history student, I can appreciate the historical aspect of this film. I also like, unlike other films of its time, where we are not stuffed the obligatory happy ending. Thus, that makes me appreciate this epic even more.Kubrick's film talks about a slave uprising during the Roman era. Spartacus is a slave who does not take pleasure at the fact he is being used to fight at a gladiator school only to receive spoiled girls. He and the rest of the slaves revolt which causes other slaves in the countryside to do the same. Crassus, who is aiming to become a dictator, decides to meet Spartacus and his men in battle.I really enjoyed the performances in this film. I liked Kirk Douglas's strength and perseverance as Spartacus. I liked the comedic timing in Peter Ustinov's performance as the head of the gladiatorial school, Batiatus. Jean Simmons gives a mighty fine performance as Spartacu's lover, Varinia. Finally, I really liked Laurence Olivier's deep, intense performance as Crassus, who wants nothing except for political power.Overall, Spartacus is a fine, entertaining historical spectacle. It features some majestic battle sequences and many fine, if perhaps a little outdated performances. The screenplay was excellent, as it was written by none other than the black-listed screenwriter, Dalton Trumbo. Compared to today's quality, the film doesn't live up to it. But I had a fun time watching this historical epic. Not Kubrick's best, but that doesn't stop it from being a fun watch.My Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hail, Spartacus!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit I am always taken aback when I see how many negative reviews there are about "Spartacus" on IMDb. But of course, I also appreciate that many generations of reviewers have been born since it was made who didn't stare up at that Super Technirama 70 screen as a 12-year old boy in 1960 to be totally overwhelmed by the experience.Nostalgia plays a huge part in the way we remember movies, but I'm obviously not alone in my love of this one. I remember one of the guys who restored "Spartacus" for its 40th Anniversary saying that it was one of the reasons he got into movies. I can totally relate to that.There was just something more immediate, more intense, even something more modern about the movie. From Alex North's opening fanfares to Saul Bass's crumbling Roman statue behind the main titles, you knew you were in for something different.Just compare the costuming in "Ben Hur" with "Spartacus". In "Ben Hur", everything had a shiny, glitzy look that almost suggested costumes made by clever parents for a Christmas pageant while "Spartacus" had a more muscular, functional look. Then there were the actors. Kirk Douglas as producer had for the most part given British actors the parts of the Romans, and American actors the roles of gladiators and slaves to create an interesting language scheme; it worked well. Ustinov and Laughton got the most out of Dalton Trumbo's urbane and often witty script while Olivier conveyed much with just a look. You sense that although his Crassus knows he will defeat Spartacus in battle, he will never defeat his spirit.And Douglas stands up to all those esteemed British actors, gutsy really, but he wasn't outclassed at all and such intensity, I believed him; he was Spartacus. Now this was a pretty adult movie for it's time (some scenes were cut), and the audience went very quiet indeed during the heavily-shaded scene where Jean Simmons took off her clothes in Spartacus' cell. I'm surprised they even let a 12-year old in; it was such a tightly-buttoned era. There have been other attempts at "Spartacus". A version with Gorin Visnjic was so lacklustre I don't know why they bothered. Then there's the recent Kiwi mini series. I know some like it, and it does weave more of the real history throughout the series, however, it goes for a graphic novel approach, which I find very repetitious. Along with everyone yelling like they are dealing with strangulated hernias, I didn't see one scene in all its monochromatic, CGI weirdness that remotely approached those sunlit scenes in the 1960 version of the slave army on the march propelled along by Alex North's stunning score.As for all the political criticism levelled at the film at the time; 'Marxists in togas' etc., it just went straight over my head ? it still does to be honest. I know there were battles between Douglas and Kubrick behind the scenes; two strong characters butting heads, but between them they achieved something unique even if they didn't go to each other's dinner parties ever again. No, it's the original "Spartacus" for me. Whenever I watch it I can still feel its power.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie review analysis and critique: Spartacus (1960):</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**This review contains spoilers but I will warn you when they come up."He(Spartacus) was a man who began all alone, like an animal. Yet on the day he died thousands and thousands would have died in his place... He wasn't a god, he was a simple man, a slave"-Jean Simmons or Varia.Spartacus was Kubrick's 5 Movie and it holds up very much to Stanley Kubrick's legacy.At first glance the movie seems like just another slave movie, but as thee movie continues there's exponentiation growth in suspense, development and the evolution of Spartacus. Taking unexpected twists and turns. But before we go on and glorify Stanley's 5th movie I must point out the few flaws.The movie gets boring from time to time with some bad pieces of dialog and some very slow scenes, The 3 hour length of the movie is unwarranted, not once did i find myself checking the time. It would really help the movie to be say, a half an hour short. Now that that's over with I will glorify Stanley before the mob kills me. I cant stretch how much the plot amazed me it was simply a work of art that you don't come across often. The plot of the movie continues to make unexpected changes and the suspense only grows. The effects are in par or even better then allot of what you see today, the whole universe of the film was constructed ingeniously and crafted carefully. The music in the film reflects the scene, as you'd expect from Kubrick. Even though I said there's some bad pieces of dialog there are also some amazing and extremely quotable one to.**Now here comes the SPOILERS and the analysis skip this if you didn't watch the movie.As we know the character played by Kirk Douglas (Spartacus)starts out as a 'simple man',-notice the simple- a slave with no hope no will and no desire and while the character evolves and achieves unimaginable goals he always remains a slave throughout the film, I will explain. As the movie points out there are more Romans then slaves hence making slaves the normal ones and thus simple hence 'simple man'. Even when Spartacus has an army he is still in the query, the starting point of the film. Even in his death he died happy with a smile showing that hes not afraid of dying, the movie previously pointed out that that's a death of a slave "When a slave dies he is free,but when a free man dies he loses what he had" its a rough quote but it holds the same point. What I'm suggesting is that on the broad picture Spartacus seemed, changed but if you look at the details you find, that is simply not the case. Now, the obvious question remains "who is he a slave to". Hes a slave to himself, the fact is hes still in the query and still is "fighting to the death", but there's a difference hes not doing it for Rome and I think that's Kubrick's message. Its better to fight or to be a 'slave' for freedom then to be a slave for 'Rome'. Slave meaning citizen and Rome meaning any corrupt government that doesn't take there citizens seriously, as depicted in doctor strange love. **NO more SPOILERS** No wounder the movie won 4 Oscars. Spartacus is a timeless work of art that I hope wont be forgotten, because "people die, ideas don't"- V for vendetta. The movie is a great time though you need time to fully enjoy it I think its worth the time.Anyway this is my first movie critique whatever this is. I hope you enjoyed the read if you have any objections please reply and I hope you gained some more insight or respect for the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliantly written and acted tale of freedom, political machinations and love in the Roman Republic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the 1951 novel by Howard Fast rather than the events of the Third Servile War directly, the film depicts Spartacus' slave rebellion with all the flair and grandeur that 1960s Hollywood could muster. Directed by Stanley Kubrick, it is a thrilling story of freedom, political machinations and love set in the ancient world. It is a very well written film with often marvellous dialogue.At 43, Kirk Douglas was perhaps a little old to play the title character but he is very good as the dignified, principled man who wishes to free every last slave in Italy. Like Charlton Heston, he has a face that looked as if it was chiseled from marble which gave him the perfect look for historical epics. More importantly, Douglas' performance effectively communicates Spartacus' intelligence and courage and I never doubted why so many would be willing to follow him anywhere. To his followers, he is a symbol of hope or even a Messiah but, for the audience, he is humanised through his relationship with Varinia, played by Jean Simmons. They meet in Batiatus' gladiator training school and soon fall in love. It is a gentle, tender love story and Douglas is at its best in these scenes. He and Simmons have great chemistry. One of the most gifted actresses of her generation, Simmons excels as the proud, brave and intelligent Varinia. As good as she is in her scenes with Douglas, her best moment is the scene towards the end of the film after she is recaptured and sold to Crassus, played by Laurence Olivier, in which he threatens to kill her newborn son if she does not submit to him. Varinia realises that he is afraid of Spartacus and disturbed by the fact that he inspired so much love and devotion, not least of all from her. Simmons, who previously played the Ophelia to Olivier's Hamlet, plays this scene wonderfully and we get a real sense of Varinia's strength.Speaking of Olivier, he is characteristically excellent as Crassus, one of Rome's greatest generals and one of the wealthiest men to have ever lived. A patrician from a very old Roman family who despises the mob, he is an extremely shrewd military and political strategist who manipulates the threat posed by Spartacus to substantially increase his own political standing. He is eventually named Consul of Rome with Julius Caesar as his protégé, thereby beginning the transformation of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. On the battlefield, he manages to defeat Spartacus by forcing him to march on Rome where not only his own legions but those of Pompey and another general are waiting for him. Crassus is a very dangerous man of fierce intelligence, which makes him a very compelling character. In his penultimate film before his death in 1962, the great Charles Laughton is excellent as Gracchus, the (fictional) leader of the Senate and Crassus' hated rival. Gracchus is an interesting character who is even more shrewd than Crassus. He does not believe in the gods but worships them publicly and is perfectly willing to make deals with criminals, namely the Cilician pirates, if he believes that doing so is in the interests of Rome. He is part of the corruption that plagues the Roman Republic but considers that better than a dictatorship and I certainly can't disagree with him there. Gracchus is not a particularly good man but he is a far better one than his rival.As strong as the film's cast may be, it is the one and only Peter Ustinov who steals the show as the cowardly slave trader Batiatus. He won the first of two Best Supporting Actor Oscars for the role, the only actor to win an Oscar for a Kubrick film. Batiatus is scornful of Crassus in private but extremely obsequious to him whenever they meet. He has a very strong sense of self-preservation or, to put it another way, he is a complete coward. This is best demonstrated when Crassus orders him to remain in camp the night before the final battle with Spartacus so he can identify him. When Batiatus asks what will happen to him if Spartacus wins, Crassus tells Batiatus that he has no doubt that he will help Spartacus to identify him. This is one of Batiatus' best scenes as it perfectly illustrates that his first loyalty is most definitely to himself. He possibly becomes a better man after being flogged on Crassus' order but he never comes to regret his earlier actions and only agrees to transport Varinia and her son out of Rome in exchange for two million sestertii. Tony Curtis is good as Antoninus and I love the father-son relationship that develops between him and Spartacus but he is underdeveloped, making him the least interesting of the major characters. With his tough guy image, Curtis may have been miscast as a singer and poet with no practical experience of fighting before joining Spartacus' army. The only weak links are Charles McGraw as Marcellus and John Dall as Marcus Glabrus but neither of them have particularly big roles.Overall, this is an extremely intelligent film. Spartacus is crucified, meaning that it lacks a traditional Hollywood ending but there is still a great sense of hope as his son has been granted his freedom. My main historical area of interest is about 2,000 years after Spartacus' death but I think that the film sticks to the general thrust of events while admittedly taking quite a few liberties here and there. However, these are only minor issues which in no way detract from a brilliant film, one of the best of the historical epics which dominated 1950s and 1960s Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mirroring The Brutality Of Today's Post 9/11 World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WE CONFESS TO being awfully ignorant, but, up until several years ago, we did not know that there was a real life Spartacus; who did lead a revolt of slaves in the Roman Empire. The years in question were 73-71 B.C., and we read this was the 3rd and last of what have been called THE ROMAN SERVILLE WARS.THE STORY IS a natural subject for a Big Screen, Sword &amp; Sandal epic and also a most desirable role for Executive Producer, Mr. Kirk Douglas to portray. Being what we now call a "Blockbuster", the procuring of a top rate, international cast was in order.IN RESPONSE TO this need we have: Lawrence Olivier, Jean Simmons, Tony Curtis,Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov, John Ireland, Nina Foch and Herbert Lom. Rounding out the players' roster are some very talented people; who are perhaps appearing in what may have been their most visible roles. Charles McGraw and Harold J. Stone come to mind and are excellent in their portrayals of brutal Trainer and Slave/Gladiator, respectively.IN CONSIDERING THE screenplay for this huge undertaking, the choice of Exec Producer was Dalton Trumbo. Although the writer had been blacklisted following the House Un-American Activities Committee's hearings for Leftist political leanings, he had continued to work; albeit with the use of Pen Names. Kirk Douglas insisted that he use his real name in the credits.* BECAUSE SO LITTLE is known about the events of that era, the personal lives of those involved and the political climate of Rome, a lot of filling in with supposition and fictionalization was called for.AS WITH SO many other story lines, it became a sort of surrogate morality play for us in the modern world. The behind the scenes conniving in the Roman Senate and the arrogance displayed by the military could all be easily portrayed as pariahs of the United States in the mid 20th Century.THE BEST EXAMPLES of this last hypothesis are the characters of Crassus (Olivier) in the military and Gracchus (Laughton) in the Senate. Mr.Laughton's characterization, in particular seems to be carefully crafted to be representative of a sort of caricature of what we think of as being a "Politician" in the worst sense. He makes a beautifully on the money statement to support our statement.MR. CHARLES LAUGHTON, as Senator Gracchus, states that privately he believes in none of these gods; but publicly he worships them all.NOW THEN, AIN"T that a "Politician" for you? NOTE * Contrary to a widespread misconception, the 'Blacklist' was not a governmental edict; but rather a creation of a consortium of the Hollywood Studio Big Wigs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spartacus: Always best on the big screen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently, a local neighborhood theater (I'm not at liberty to name the theater chain for reasons of copyright violation, you understand) showcased a major theatrical road show trifecta: I was able to thrill at the sight of seeing such epic greats of a Hollywood long since passed as "The 10 Commandments" (1956), "Ben-Hur" (1959), and, of course "Spartacus" (1960). I'm given to understand that Kirk Douglas along with others being considered for the title role of "Ben-Hur" such as Paul Newman, Rock Hudson, and several unknown hopefuls, were tested for the role, including Douglas, before Charlton Heston landed the coveted role but as consolation, Douglas was offered the role of the Ben-Hur's erstwhile friend, and, later foe, Messala. To counteract his disappointment, Douglas, through the auspices of his own production company Bryna Productions and securing the rights to Howard Fast's bestseller, produced and crafted "Spartacus". Displeased with director Delbert Mann's efforts, Douglas discharged him and hired the new kid on the block, Stanley Kubrick (who, was constantly at odds with Douglas, and, it is alleged, disowned the film). The only concession Hollywood was forced to make was Douglas' choice of screenwriter to adapt Fast's novel, the grey and black listed Dalton Trumbo. In point of fact, with all the obstacles presenting a troubled shoot, i.e., choice of acting styles, arguments on the set, etc., it's something of a minor miracle that Douglas was able to pull it off at all. But the net results are truly outstanding. And while I personally own "Spartacus" in Blu-ray, seeing it up on the big screen once more was like visiting an old friend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"May fortune smile upon... most of you."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seen three decades later in a lovingly restored version, "Spartacus" still plays like an extraordinary epic, and its intellectual strength is still there. But other elements of the film have dated. The most courageous thing about it, from today's standards, is that it closes without an obligatory happy ending, and an audience that has watched for 187 minutes doesn't get a tidy, mindless conclusion.The movie was inspired by a best seller by Howard Fast, and adapted to the screen by the blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo. Kirk Douglas, who produced the film, effectively broke the blacklist by giving Trumbo screen credit instead of making him hide behind a pseudonym. The direction is by the 31-year-old Stanley Kubrick, who realizes the ideas of Douglas, Fast and Trumbo but cannot be said to add much of his own distinctive style to the film.Two things stand up best over the years: the power of the battle spectacles, and the strength of certain performances - especially Olivier's fire, Douglas' strength, and Laughton's mild amusement at the foibles of humankind. The most entertaining performance in the movie, consistently funny, is by Ustinov, who upstages everybody when he is on screen (he won an Oscar). Some of the supporting performances now seem dated and the line readings stilted, as well as some cheesy dialogue.Balancing against those dated elements are some that were ahead of their times, including a muted but sophisticated understanding of sexual motivation. Olivier's character becomes more complex in this revival than it was at the time, because of the restoration of a key scene, cut by censors, in which he and Tony Curtis share a bath together, and he confesses, "I like both oysters and snails," leaving little doubt where either is to be found as far as he is concerned. That brings his desire for Jean Simmons into focus: He wants her not merely to possess her, but as a form of victory over Spartacus.Perhaps the most interesting element of "Spartacus" is its buried political assumptions. The movie is about revolution, and clearly reflects the decadence of the parasitical upper classes and the superior moral fiber of the slaves. But at the end, Spartacus, like Jesus, dies on the cross. In the final scene, his wife stands beneath him and holds up their child, saying "He will live as a free man, Spartacus." Yes, but the baby's freedom was granted him not as its right, but because of the benevolence of the soft-hearted old Gracchus. Today, that wouldn't be good enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memorable and Iconic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's sword &amp; sandal epic, Spartacus, is a film that should not be ignored as it holds an importance place in the director's catalog. This was not one of the films that introduced me to Kubrick's works and I came into this thinking it may surprise or immerse me that it would rise at the same level as my opinion on Kubrick's masterpieces. Sadly, it did not hit me with much force as I wanted it to.The plot of Spartacus is the rise of Spartacus from the shackles of Rome's slavery. It is a story that I indeed enjoy but since the film, at times, drifts away from Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) and focuses on Crassus' (Laurence Olivier) goal for power and dictatorship of Rome, it took me out as that half doesn't hold up to the strength in Spartacus' story. It doesn't get to the point that the film becomes dull, so it is still tolerable. I felt Dalton Trumbo's script lacked interesting dialogue and sometimes doesn't create that sense of importance in what they are saying. I believe in a film like this, it is dialogue that should keep the audience invested, as it serves in supporting the plot and intentions of the characters on screen. The rivalry between Gracchus (Charles Laughton) and Crassus is very entertaining as it explores the paths of what Rome can become. It is the screenplay that holds most of the issues I have with this film and if it have been maybe revised or spent a little more time on it, this film would have been a masterpiece.2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, The Shining, Eyes Wide Shut, Full Metal Jacket, Lolita and Barry Lyndon, are films of Kubrick that I felt were all daring as they have imposed either controversy, antagonizing characters, exploratory themes and risk for low financial gain. Spartacus on the other hand was something of an epic which had extremely high expectations and was easy to market to the public. This film in his catalog definitely seems like an oddball. I felt that Kubrick did not have that creative control in this production as compared to his other projects but he did the best he could with what he had. Kubrick understood the material enough to convey what is needed to tell this tale. He also knew that this film had to be big as the story's themes of hope and freedom had tremendous weight.As I said, this film is large and to convey that, you need to have a cinematographer who can deliver. Russell Metty showed he could handle a project this big. Metty's photography showed the scale of film and, along with Alex North's score, carried significant weight. The battle scenes are example that shows just how big the production is. Metty did not only create beautiful and large long shots but also handled the intimate moments between characters delicately. Scenes with Spartacus and Varinia (Jean SImmons) are captured with such elegance that it is at par with Metty's large ambitious shots. Metty is an important aspect in making Spartacus an epic film that rivals classics like Lawrence of Arabia and Ben-Hur.The film's length, 3 hours and 17 minutes, is a stretch and some scenes could have been a bit trimmed. I felt that the pacing was a little on the slow side for me and with the issues of the film's script, it made it a bit more of a chore. To me, the length of a film is not the issue but rather the content within that length is what determines the necessity of longer running time. If the film explored a little more with the Senate and make it very entertaining and smartly executed then I would satisfied with the running time, maybe even longer.The score of the film is conducted and composed by Alex North, who I recall also did the score for Cleopatra. North's score definitely has a presence in the film and screams out to be noticed but it isn't the grand moments like the battles that gets me listening but rather the intricate moments between Spartacus and Varinia that shows off a memorable tune that creates the element of romance between the two. His score definitely goes hand in hand with Russell Metty's photography and delivers something that will be remembered in the long run.For a character to become believable, the actor must be deeply attached and understand the role that they are embodying. Kirk Douglas definitely shows that here and is one of the big reasons that makes Spartacus' cause all the more believable. While Douglas is the strongest aspect of this cast, it is not without the help of fantastic supporting actors like Charles Laughton, Jean Simmons, Peter Ustinov and Tony Curtis. They really connected with their characters and brought their A-game to the film. The downside of the cast is sadly, Laurence Olivier. Olivier brought as much as he could with the character Crassus but the character is written so thinly that it Olivier couldn't show off his abilities. There is one seen which I thought explored the character Crassus for a bit, and that was the restored scene of him in the bath being washed by Antonius (Tony Curtis).The film has it's weak point but it doesn't place the film as the weakest of Kubrick's films or even within that decade or genre as it is solidified it's classic status with it's iconic score and photography, strong story, and a powerful cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proof that the 250 is a list of popularity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On almost every movie established in the Top 250 I see this one post that claims a variant of "Overrated, does not deserve it's place". They feel the movie in question lacks quality. It may be true, it may not be, most often I disagree. However, the list isn't a list about quality, it is about popularity, and "Spartacus" along with "Ben-Hur" proves it in this genre; The Epics. This does not mean that the list hasn't quality, it has loads, it just means that it must have popularity too. There are loads of evidence, but I have already digressed enough. As long as everyone votes honestly there is no over- and underrating since everyone is entitled to their opinion no matter what the cause. As long as everyone votes honestly the IMDb Top 250 is never anything else than it should be.Now to why they prove it: "Spartacus" is a great movie, so is "Ben-Hur", so is "Braveheart" and so is "Gladiator". They all have superior quality, but modern blockbusters will always appeal to more people. That is why the latter two, though not better movies, are 8.4 and 8.5 while the classics clock in on 8.0 and 8.1. And so it should be on a list of popularity.I don't give 10s or 1s, they are repressed when IMDb calculates the weighted rating, and so if I were to give them, I wouldn't have my say about the movies I love and hate the most. Which I naturally don't want. Also; no movie is perfect (10) or without redeeming qualities (1) anyway."Spartacus" I give 9/10, my highest, it is an excellent picture. For reasons why it is so, watch it or read another review, I decided to point out something else in this one. You'll find excellent reasons in the other excellent reviews by other excellent film lovers here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disowned by Director Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amongst the plethora of Roman epics that graced/disgraced Hollywood in the 50s and 60s, it's all too easy to overlook Spartacus. But why? and why isn't it considered to be Kubrick enough to be better known as one of his and indeed, as my title suggests, a quick check through the best- selling Kubrick box-sets, none includes Spartacus.Firstly, Anthony Mann was the original director and started off with the project, he's still accredited as co-director in some listings. His set- pieces include the early scenes set in Libyan desert. Star and executive producer Kirk Douglas fired Mann and enrolled Kubrick, from then on. It has been said that Kubrick since disowned the film as he considered himself a hired hand, finishing off someone else's project.Kirk Douglas, does actually have too much control over this movie, to me, the elongated speeches and lingering slushy romance with (admittedly with the very attractive) Jean Simmons bloat both the film's already long length and but also Douglas' ego, a bit. Having said that, like in his role in the excellent The Vikings, he is perfect for the role, physically - like Charlton Heston in Ben Hur, he towers above everybody and everything and takes the film by the scruff of the neck and drags us all the way through.There's more than a whiff of Gladiator in this - more ponderous and talky but the action really does shine - instead of some over-pampered American superstar getting stunt doubles Douglas really does seem to relish the hand-on-hand combats that epitomises what we conceive today as being the Romans at their best - and worst - the Gladiatorial fight to the death, in the ring.For many my age, it's the seeing the greats such as Laurence Olivier, Tony Curtis (as a willowy magician) Peter Ustinov, whose part is almost perfectly replicated by the late (great) Oliver Reed aforementioned Gladiator, that of a slave dealer, who first sees the potential of Spartacus, the slave and how he can fight to save himself from his inevitable plight. But mainly, for Charles Laughton, with his chubby cheeks and curly locks - look at any Roman coin or actual Roman artifact and we have the epitome of the well-fed, pleasure-seeking Roman aristocrat.A rousing musical score by Alex North sounds great in the stereo we now enjoy but obviously did not get when seeing this on our parent's TV. The battle-scenes toward the end are exciting and well choreographed, long before CGI trickery, of course. The rolling flames down the hill are particularly effective and whilst being PG certificate, it is often really quite violent - not for small children, this.So, a lot better than many of the Roman epics that Hollywood churned out but not necessarily one for Kubrick fans wanting actual Kubrick. Yes, he did his job supremely well and no-one could have asked more from him, but William Wyler (who directed Ben Hur) could have done it equally well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic of the evils of slavery in any era, any location, any culture....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ancient Romans prided themselves on their democracy, provided that you were a free man, and that you fell within a certain social structure. So in over 2000 years, times haven't really changed, only the names of what "slaves" are referred to as now are. Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece is a document of slaves saved from certain death for uncertain death by becoming gladiators, the ancient version of today's prize-fighters. Spartacus (Kirk Dougla) is discovered enslaved on the rock pile and is bought by upperclass Peter Ustinov and made a gladiator. His training is rough and dangerous. Seen jumping to avoid being hit on the legs by a rotating wooden plank, he then has to duck to avoid being hit in the head. The wheel turns faster, the planks are removed, and sword-like objects are revealed. The next thing you know, he is in the ring, afraid of ending up fighting one of his new found pals. But when one gladiator refuses to execute him as ordered, he is killed by the vicious Roman nobleman (Laurence Olivier) and Spartacus escapes to gather the gladiators together to form an army against these practices. Meanwhile, Olivier reveals an attraction to one of his slaves (Tony Curtis) who escapes and joins forces with Douglas, now married to Olivier's former house servant (the lovely Jean Simmons). The gladiator's army increases in size, and prepares to leave Rome, but Rome won't leave well enough alone as Olivier teams with Julius Caesar (John Gavin) to bring the gladiators to their knees.Brutally filmed to show the inhumane treatment of these strong men living as "slaves of entertainment for the bored rich", their exploitation at the hands of the upper class isn't made to look pretty or glamorous. They rebel as they realize that they are going to die anyway, so they might as well die with their integrity intact. Then, there are the noblemen who find their places in society diminishing because of decreasing resources who end up protecting those they used to exploit themselves. Along with Ustinov, that group includes the legendary Charles Laughton (who years earlier played Roman emperor Nero) in one of his last films. Watching the wealthy Roman women get into watching gladiators being basically torn apart reminded me of the evil Livia (Sian Phillips) in the BBC mini-series "I, Claudius", and her scene with gladiators almost a hundred years after this took place demanding real blood, a good show, with plenty of coin for the living and a decent burial for the dead. Nina Foch and Joanna Barnes are Olivier's wife and daughter who act like the female fans of prize-fighting films of the 40's, screaming and drooling over the scantily clad gladiators (leaving little to the imagination) in a lustful manner, much like Myrna Loy in "The Mask of Fu Manchu".Even at over three hours long, "Spartacus" is never boring, and has some truly amazing battle scenes and a final confrontation between Douglas, Curtis and Olivier that is ultra-chilling. Jean Simmons, even playing a basically supporting role, has a lot to do as Douglas's devoted spouse who must stand up to Olivier after the battle between the gladiators and Roman army. The final scene is a heartbreaker and is one you will remember long after the film is over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Stanley Kubrick classic appears to have it all. The set decoration, cinematography and costuming are all superior. In fact Oscars were given for each of these along with one for Peter Ustinov as Batiatus. Also excellent was the editing, score, and, of course, the direction by Kubrick.The cast was superlative. Kirk Douglas (Lust for Life, The Bad and the Beautiful, Champion) as Spartacus really gave us an outstanding performance as the man who took on Rome. Not until Gibson gave us William Wallace do we see a similar champion of the people fighting for freedom.We cannot neglect mentioning Sir Laurence Olivier as Crassius, Jean Simmons as Varinia, and Woody Strode (The Quick and the Dead) as Draba.The restored version of this film goes 3 and a half hours. I guess sitting through Grindhouse wasn't so bad after all. If a film is good, then the time flies by.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite at the level of "Ben-Hur", but still spectacular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is said that "Spartacus" was Kirk Douglas' answer to the rule he didn't get -- "Ben-Hur". And, this is a magnificent film. But it is no "Ben-Hur", and that is because of one thing that is lacking in "Spartacus" that "Ben-Hur" had...the same thing that made "Raiders Of The Lost Ark" and "Indiana Jones And The Lost Crusade" super special, while "Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom" was something far less. And what was that factor? The magical hold religion has on us.While I've never been a particular fan of Kirk Douglas, that's not to say there haven't been a number of films of his that I enjoyed. If I were Douglas and I was asked to say which of my films should be my legacy, I would say either "Paths Of Glory", or this film. Douglas is superb here. Some of the most gentle acting I've seen him do is, surprisingly, in this film.Laurence Olivier, who in this film plays a real life character -- one of the patricians who helped bring Julius Caesar to power -- is also superb here...clearly the "bad guy", but not over the top at all...more like reality.Jean Simmons is superb as the wife of Spartacus, and this film reminded me of just what an important actress she was. Almost certainly underrated.Charles Laughton, the actor many of us wanted not to like, but who consistently turned in brilliant performances, is just as good here as ever.Peter Ustinov certainly had a better role here than in his previous Roman film, Quo Vadis. John Gavin plays Caesar here, although a comparatively minor character in this period of Rome's history. But, what a hunk! I was always sorry Gavin left films.In terms of casting, if anyone got cheated here, it was Tony Curtis. His only truly impressive scene is at the conclusion of the film.Odd, since Curtis was at his prime around this time.The sets are lavish, the color extremely pleasing. There are a few places where things look a tad cheap, but generally the opposite is true.No, a "Ben-Hur" gets a "9". "Spartacus" gets an "8", still a rare rating for me to give. I'm very glad to have finally seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Hollywood epics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Spartacus" arrived in theatres in 1960, a time when epic movie-making was at or near its apex. The film tells the story of a slave who leads a fierce revolt against the might of the Roman Empire.Helmed by the great Stanley Kubrick, the film is naturally chock full of eye candy. However, besides the undeniable visual appeal the film also tells a story that's above average in terms of depth and originality. Yet, surprisingly, neither Kubrick nor screenwriter Dalton Trumbo were honoured with Oscar nominations.Peter Ustinov was more fortunate, snagging an Oscar nomination and then seeing it turn into a win on Oscar night. He gave what is perhaps the best performance in a film that has no shortage of stars. Kirk Douglas ably carries the film in the title role while esteemed British thespians Laurence Olivier, Charles Laughton &amp; Jean Simmons all deliver characteristically fine performances. Tony Curtis stood out in a relatively small but memorable role and recognizable faces like John Ireland, Woody Strode, John Dall &amp; Herbert Lom also popped up from time to time.As mentioned before, Kubrick's direction is impressive, as is the Oscar-winning cinematography, art direction &amp; costuming. It should be clear that, visually, the film is a treat while Alex North's stirring, Oscar-nominated score shows that the musical aspect was also skillfully handled.Yet, despite all of the film's strengths (not to mention its 6 Oscar nominations) it wasn't even nominated for Best Picture. Luckily, time has been kind to this film and it is justifiably lauded as a classic these days. By all means, see it in order to experience Hollywood spectacle at its best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No man should be a slave,and there is no more noble cause to fight for than freedom.This very idea alone should intrigue potential viewers to watch this epic.This is a very engrossing film from start to finish,with Kirk Douglas valiantly leading the way,but what I find most interesting about Spartacus is director Stanley Kubrick's penchant for pushing the envelope as far as he could when it came to what was allowable in films at the time in terms of violence and sexuality,those familiar with Kubrick's later films know that he would go on from pushing that envelope to bursting it wide open as Hollywood gradually became more liberal with it's approach.That being said,Kubrick's Spartacus is riveting storytelling that will keep you engrossed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood's greatest Roman epic!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spartacus has become part of pop culture. Its dialogue, characters and some of its visuals have become almost clichéd, so it is hard to imagine a time when the film was far from a sure bet. It was actually a gamble of significant proportions.Star and project shepherd Kirk Douglas, drawn as he was to martyrs, had had an eye on this story for some time, and now - "now" being circa 1958 - at the peak of his fame and power, he decided to wrestle it into existence. Not one to ever take the easy approach to anything, Douglas secretly entrusted scripting duties to blacklisted scribe Dalton Trumbo (adapting a novel by Howard Fast), landing himself a surprisingly rich and sophisticated epic, the first Roman Epic to bear no mention of the character Jesus.He then gathered a dizzying cast of powerhouse names: Laurence Olivier, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov! Any one of those titans could of headed the bill, thus Douglas promptly lied to each one of them, promising them each the biggest part. With legal action and mutiny within reach before cameras even rolled, he chose to go one further - three being the charm - and fired veteran director Anthony Mann. His replacement? Recent Paths of Glory collaborator Stanley Kubrick.What on paper has the makings of a mad disaster magically morphed into not just a hit and Academy Award Winner, but also the greatest Roman epic of all time. The actors all turned in career-best performances, and while Kubrick was not able to enforce his will as strongly as anywhere else in his filmography, you can argue that having Douglas focusing him on the heart of the story allowed the film to have a heart of its own.After Spartacus, there was nowhere for the genre to go but down, and down it went with alarming speed, straight to a period of hibernation that lasted until Ridley Scott's Gladiator over three decades later. Despite that recent mega-hit, this is still the one to beat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful and moving testament to the eternal fight for freedom. (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spartacus is one of the few movies to truly deserve the title of epic. The first time I saw it I thought it was a little too long and I actually got bored around the halfway mark before being drawn in once again by the powerful and dramatic ending. I recently saw it again, and this time I never got bored once, thanks to the magnificent storytelling and the excellent performances of the main cast. Kirk Douglas made a heroic Spartacus, and Laurence Olivier was at least as good; you could really get a sense of the coldness of Marcus Crassus. I'm not sure how close to the truth either depiction is, but they certainly work for the movie. Some other things about the movie aren't as good (the fight scenes generally aren't very impressive to today's audiences, although the part with the Roman legions moving into their positions was well done). Some other performances aren't as good and some dialogue gets a wooden reading (the "I don't know how i will ever be able to repay you" guy can't act)but these are minor elements and minor characters that don't really detract from the overall quality of the film. The film celebrates the spirit of freedom and revolt without beating the audience over the head with some hidden political message (with the possible exception of the bathtub scene with Olivier and Tony Curtis), and caps it all off with an ending which is simultaneously tragic and uplifting. The slave army is crushed and its leader killed, but as Douglas says near the end of the film, just thousands of slaves standing up and saying no was something, and those ideas will live on and still flourish when Marcus Crassus and the Roman Empire are ancient history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, thats correct, my favorite out of all the movies of this genre. This movie served as the blueprint for movies such as, Braveheart, and Gladiator. Those movies had something in them that came out of Spartacus one way or the other. However, the Direction in this movie was of course by the legendary Kubrick, and when he directs, the acting is always great. This movie has no happy endings, its sad but uplifting. It is a dark fictional story with amazing sets, hundreds of extra's that fill up the screen make this the most realistic of all the movies. Gladiator was great but it was more comic book like. Braveheart was great also but it didn't come close to the movie that set the standard, and that's Spartacus. BenHur is the only movie that is better. 4stars ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fans of Gladiator really owe it to themselves to see this movie, which is not one of Stanley Kubrick's masterpieces (at least in my opinion), but still rousing entertainment. The differences between the two movies are clear: Spartacus features no posturing by its leading man; no computerized effects; and a script which is a lot more intelligent and has a sly sense of humor (Gladiator just took itself so damn seriously!) Kubrick came on board after the movie started shooting, and did not have final say in the product (this was Kirk Douglas' baby). So it doesn't really FEEL like a Kubrick film. However, movie fans should see it, and on a big screen if they can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this film very watchable, even if it took me a few sittings to complete watching it. Although it is not a genuine Kubrick film it favourably compares with his much-acclaimed body of work, and is indeed preferable to later Kubrick films, "The Shining" and "Full Metal Jacket". It is, I gather, largely Kirk Douglas' film directorially, and it must be said, he does a good job. The effective, humanistic story is given full breadth by the largely unobtrusive, static camera, and is embellished by some effective shots. It is a good thing that the actors are allowed pretty much free reign to entertain here, with a steady script that characterizes well. The Romans are the best played; by Peter Ustinov, Charles Laughton and Laurence Olivier. Olivier gives a nigh-on inscrutable performance as the villainous, but believable Crassus. Ustinov impresses as the slightly out-of-place, deceptively bumbling Batiatus, while Charles Laughton, a quite wonderful actor, gives a typically nuanced and compelling performance. Indeed, it's refreshing that two of the Romans -are portrayed sympathetically. The scene where the hefty pair discuss the merits of "corpulence" is a delight, and is followed by the odd, suggestive bath scene between Curtis and Olivier. This middle scetion of the film is perhaps the best, although I like the end passage. Much depends on how successful the romance between Simmons and Douglas is; it works very eloquently I feel, Simmons giving a subtly affecting performance, and the scenes between them well written. The excellent score and cinematography should be noted as major plusses in this epic. The battle scenes are quite well done, although that part of the film feels a little muddled to me. The political and personal themes are quite well linked, both the portrayal of Roman court and in the interactions within Spartacus' army. To paraphrase; "I think we've just started something that has no finish" and other such scenes are all very effective. A stately, grand film that draws you in to its drama and romance effectively, "Spartacus" impressed, even moved me.Rating:- ****/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A seminal epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This epic film was obviously the provenance for later historic-dramas such as Braveheart and Gladiator (in fact the similarities to the former are numerous in both style and content right down to the torturous death scene, alleviated by emotional fulfillment, that ends the movie). But the makers of both those flicks were prescient in using this Stanley Kubrick classic as an archetypal base. A strong cast consisting of Kirk Douglas, Laurence Olivier, Jean Simmons, Tony Curtis and the enjoyable Peter Ustinov impels the vision of Kubrick, resulting in a magniloquent saga of the slave who fights the good fight. Of course it's not Spartacus' self-solicitousness that endears us to his plight, it is his struggle for the manumission of all his brothers in bondage. His dedication to his comrades is reciprocated in a cinematic highlight that swells the soul as his defeated soldiers defy the power of mighty Rome by unifying in impending death (`I am Spartacus' they all shout) rather than condemn their leader to a lonely demise.Kubrick would go on to make more important films, but none as august as this work. Spartacus stands as a salient film be it for its precursory effluence or its own sublime qualities.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Laurence Olivier, Kirk Douglas, Jean Simmons, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov... with such an assembly of actors, how could this film not be extraordinary? Well, it is extraordinary. I am not going to go into a long history of the slave revolt under Spartacus; see the film and enjoy every minute of it (and if you like that, there are many different academic books on the real life of Spartacus, as well as classic Roman texts to be found). Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) is a stalwart, reticent, but bravely rebellious slave-turned gladiator whose spirit cannot be broken, and yet he finds it in his heart to love the lovely British slave, Varinia, (Jean Simmons) with a fierce loyalty and tenderness that really gets the emotions going... Laurence Olivier (Crassus) has never turned in a finer performance in my opinion (a bare description could hardly do it justice), and Charles Laughton (a fine actor virtually unknown outside the acting world of today) *IS* the licentious senator, Gracchus. Tony Curtis does seem a bit out of place in the cast, but he makes at the very least, a sincere (though somewhat stilted-sounding) Antoninus. All in all, this is one of classic cinema's best. My rating: 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every once in a while, I will watch a movie that just totally blows me out of the water. Spartacus was one of those movies. Everything about it seems perfect to me. I was not bothered by the length, as the story required a lengthy movie. After director Anthony Mann was fired, Stanley Kubrick was brought in to work as director. If he had been the original choice for director, perhaps we would see a Spartacus with the flashy long camera shots and the deep, haunting scores, and the abstract art we have become used to from Kubrick's 2001, A Clockwork Orange, and even Full Metal Jacket. Kubrick's style is much more restrained in Spartacus. The only time when Kubrick really shines through is the battle scene, where the troops of Casuss' army asssemble to make symmetric shapes. But since Spartacus is not really the kind of movie that requires that kind of work, since a ray of hope shines over the entire thing. In the hands of a lesser director (notably Cecil B. DeMille, king of the mindless epics) it might have turned into just that, a mindless epic. But Kubrick saved that from happpening. Critics of the romance between Spartacus and Varinia may be right when they say that there is no passion there. I disagree with this, though. Besides, the love scenes gave an excuse to hear the traditional score. The score (basically consisting of 3 notes being played in the same pattern but in different keys and by different instruments) is perhaps the most touching thing about the movie, and its simplicity drives what is going on on screen home. The movie's screenplay and story takes the best elements from such movies as Braveheart, Ben-Hur, and even the Ten Commandments and gives it to much better actors. Though the story may have many factual errors, it gives the actors a chance to shine in their work. The acting is top quality. Almost every legend of the silver screen had his role that made him one, the role that when one thinks of the actor, they must think of the role also. Marlon Brando had his Vito Corleone, Clark Gable had his Rhett Butler, Orson Welles had his Charles Foster Kane, even Anthony Quinn had his Zorba the Greek. Well, Kirk Douglas has his Spartacus. Although his character required little acting, and he was not oscar-worthy in it, he gave Spartacus an identity. Other acting standouts are oscar-winner Peter Ustinov as Spartacus's former owner, Laurence Olivier as the evil dictator Cassus, and though most people would disagree with me, Tony Curtis as Antoninus.This is a 5-star movie, see it soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweeping epic of revoltin' slaves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece - which is saying something, considering Kubrick's work, which includes "2001," "A Clockwork Orange," and "Barry Lyndon" - covers quite a bit of historical ground, but no director before or since has told the tale of the strong slave Spartacus inciting his fellow chained men and women to rebel against the arms of Italy. It's movies like these, along with De Mille's "The Ten Commandments," that really defined the term "sweeping epic." Kirk Douglas stars as the resilient leader Spartacus, and gives an unusually commanding and convincing performance. He's supported by an all-star cast, of course, including a magnificent Peter Ustinov, who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his work. The toughest part for Kubrick probably wasn't filming the movie, it was keeping all of his stars' egos in check - he had Charles Laughton, Ustinov, and Lawrence Olivier, to name three. Such heavyweights in a movie today would provide some amiable gossip column fodder, but it's a testament to Kubrick that there weren't more problems on the set. As for the movie itself, you won't find many movies with the same level of cinematography, which also garnered an Oscar. A must-see.</fullReview>

Superb acting all around from the leads, and Peter Ustinov is wickedly delightful. Definitely has to be seen in the restored, letterbox version; to watch it in TV size format is to miss half the movie. It is quite possible that battle scenes such as the climactic one here might never be filmed again. Devotees of the score are directed to jazz pianist Bill Evan's treatment of the love theme in his great recording, "Conversations with Myself". A classic; yes, even a 'timeless classic'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even not writing, Kubrick still awesome!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Does it possible that the rebel Kubrick could make another masterpiece, even without writing it? "Spartacus" was the only film in which Kubrick was hired to direct, but he still managed to make another classic masterpiece for his resume."Spartacus", after "Ben Hur" is another grand epic in the history of cinema. It doesn't reach his feet's clearly but with Kubrick, the film managed to give a great sense of history and the same time originality. The story, obviously, talks about the slave Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) who was born from a line of slaves under the Roman Empire and one day he came to be a gladiator. But he couldn't take-it anymore so much injustice around him to all the other slaves beginning a gigantic revolution within the powerful Roman Empire that caused major damage into the heart of the empire.While the film can be a good adaptation of the true historical hero that was Spartacus, but what leads to the problem of the film is that with so many characters together, ranging from gladiators to Roman senators, their relationship of them seems to be at the background having little character's developing, even Spartacus himself, but not everything is lost.Dalton Trumbo (script) gives the film an excellent writing and great dialogs between the characters managing to keep the film on a very realistic style (which later served as inspiration for "Braveheart" and "Gladiator"). But even with Dalton writing the film, it is obvious that Kubrick rummaged around giving an intriguing human philosophy into the film.This is more clear at one scene with the cruel senator Crassus (Laurence Olivier) talking to his slave Antoninus (Tony Curtis) in an indirect way the definition of what is a slave and their obedience to the master and to Rome, with a dark and somber tone with the Kubrick style. But even with the somber tone and the slave and master philosophy, the film also gives a philosophy to the cause of Spartacus. That their fight for freedom its not only a physical victory, but also a moral one.Not only Kubrick gives the film a great philosophy, but also gives a great direction with fantastic and lush scenery. It also delivers fierce and realistic fighting scenes giving the film a certain brutality (very advanced for its time)."Spartacus" despite the failure on the characters developing it managed to be amazing. A fantastic direction and excellent writing with an intriguing human philosophy alongside with a superb cast full of lecherous performances by Kirk Douglas, Laurence Olivier and Charles Laughton, "Spartacus" is one of the most beautiful epics ever made in the cinema history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Slave Revolt of the year 71 B.C. was set to record by several Roman authors. The primary source was said to have been Plutarch, the Roman Historian. Now centuries later a masterful novel, written by Howard Fast and a spectacular film directed by Standley Kubrick, brings the ancient warrior hero " Spartacus " to life. Because the sketchy sources of his life and actual military accomplishments are so wrought with inaccuracies and speculation, much of it, serves only as a collection of supposition or historical conjecture. Still, with that as a foundation, the movie makers have done what they could in creating a viable film version of the man's life and death. Like many other Blockbuster movies, this story is packed with Hollywood superstars all jocking to be the most visible on the silver screen. Kirk Douglas plays Spartacus, the ancient Gladiator who refused to accept the yoke of slavery and caused all Rome to fear for it's safety and political republic. Laurence Olivier plays Crassus, the wealthy, autocratic and power hungry General who needed his Triumverate and Eight Roman legions to confront the Slave rebellion. Charles Laughton is Gracchus who tries to prevent Crassus from becoming a Dictator in Rome. Together with Tony Curtis, Woody Strode, Peter Ustinov, John Gavin, John Ireland, Herbert Lom and Charles McGraw as Marcellus create a monumental cast and a solid foundation of what has become a True Classic for all audiences. Very little is left to chance when we see the enormous effort which went into this magnificent version of the man and his slave army. Thus, despite the lack of historical accuracy, this movie allows modern audiences the chance at witnessing what would become a creative Tribune to a slave who would not bow to the might of Imperial Rome. Recommended to anyone wishing to see a Historical Classic for all time. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly an epic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Epic is a word that's always brought up when people talk about Stanley Kubrick's 'Spartacus'; and those people aren't wrong. Not even counting the fact that it's over three hours long (making it the longest movie I've ever seen), everything about this movie is grand. The locations, the imagery, the cast, the battle scenes ? it is, without doubt, an opus.Spartacus is about, well, Spartacus, a slave during the Roman Empire. Always the rebel, Spartacus manages to escape from slavery and, together with the other slaves, starts a revolt. A rebellion turns into an army, and Spartacus is soon battling the entire Roman army.What can I say about this movie that hasn't been said already? It's a stunning film, definitely one of the best period pieces in cinema history. Don't let the length of the movie fool you: yes, it's a bit of a chore getting through it, but your reward for persisting is a well-written, beautifully-shot, brilliantly-acted film. Deservedly so, everyone points to Kirk Douglas' performance as the titular hero; he is fantastic in it. I'd say, though, that other actors outshine him in the movie. In a small but emotionally charged role, Tony Curtis is brilliant. So too is Peter Ustinov as the greedy Batiatus. And we haven't even mentioned Jean Simmons and Laurence Olivier. This is a film made up of legends.What really resonates for me, though, is the aesthetics of the whole film. It's a visually pleasing film. Whether it's the gladiator training scenes, or the climactic battles at the end, Kubrick shoots them with such majesty and beauty. It's interesting that Kubrick directed this. This is the same man that gave us films like 'The Shining' and 'A Clockwork Orange', where everything is a little bit left of centre. Here, it's all played pretty straight up; it doesn't feel Kubrickian at all.But regardless, it is his movie, and he's made a brilliant one. I don't think it's the best Kubrick movie, but that's like saying 'Come Together' isn't the Beatles' best track. It could be, if there weren't so many other ridiculously good songs. I've seen a few 'epics' in my time during which I've fallen asleep halfway through. Take it for it's worth, but I didn't fall asleep during this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One man is not followed because he's strong, but he's strong because he's followed ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"This campaign is not alone to kill Spartacus. It is to kill the legend of Spartacus." states Crassus (Laurence Olivier) to his centurions before relieving them. There is a hint of pessimism in the way he delivers this quote, as if he was indeed aware that a figure like Spartacus would leave a great impact in the world even after his death. Crassus' fear was Spartacus' faith, that's the poetic beauty within the antagonism between the patrician tyrant and the leader of the slaves' rebellion.Spartacus, immortalized by Kirk Douglas, has an unforgettable face; it seems like sculpted in a Greek semi-God's mask, so fitting for the Thracian gladiator. And between the man who defies Rome and the man who represents Rome, it's not just a battle of weapons, but of ideals. One worships the ideas of liberty, freedom and brotherhood, one the divine incarnation of Rome. For Crassus, "Rome in the eternal thought in the mind of God", a powerful quote. How many people fallaciously advocated God or Gods when it came to justify the cruelest actions in order to dominate the world? Crassus' vision was archaic precisely because it was the incarnation of a period where Rome's fate was sealed by paganism and slavery. Spartacus, on the other hand, embodies an ideal that could only be fulfilled two thousand years later. This is why he lost his war in his lifetime, but this is why he's remembered now. The legend is still alive, and much alive. And the greatest thing about Spartacus is how incredibly fresh and modern his story remains.Even now, with all the revolts that plant the seeds of liberty in the third-world streets, Spartacus is still relevant. And the script written by formerly blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo was even more significant in the years of its release during the escalation of Civil Rights' movements and McCarthyism. The film's most emblematic scene depicts the polar opposite of whatever the blacklisting stood for: naming names and condemning a stranger, a friend, for infamy and disgrace. Slaves stood up and started shouting "I'm Spartacus!" refusing to collaborate with the enemy, even if that applied their crucifixion. This brotherhood has forged Spartacus' aura in history, and it contributes to a heart-breaking climax when Spartacus and his friend, Antoninus (Tony Curtis) are ordered to fight to the death, and the winner shall be crucified. Ironically, it turns out to be their most ruthless fight because one's death implied the other's suffering. The scene occurs at last when we had more than a glimpse about the solidarity between the gladiators, so, we feel the devastation in Spartacus' heart when he kills his friend.Spartacus was one of Karl Marx' most admired figures because he incarnated the same values to inculcate to the workers from all over the world, the modern slaves of his period. How about now? Has slavery that disappeared, it's not a system of course but it reunites many people victims of a same injustice: people who can only live by providing their working value and thus cannot enjoy the fruits of another's labor, those who incarnate both virtue in the Latin meaning of quality and force, a sort of honorable modesty that deprives them from the decadent enjoyment of wealth. "Spartacus" is a film that divides the world in two distinct entities: slaves and oppressors, such a simplistic dichotomy can find echoes today, where one percent of the planet still rules the other 99 percent. But much more than a political statement, the film speaks something nobler, deeply rooted in the heart of Spartacus and his slaves, the idea of a community, of a powerful unity. And Douglas' performance is crucial because he manages to betray an ounce of vulnerability all through the film.In one of the most memorable scenes, Spartacus is picked to fight Draba (Woody Strode), the Ethiopian gladiator. Unexpectedly, Spartacus loses the fight and only owes his life to his opponent's suicidal move. Draba throws his stick to the same women who wanted to be entertained and asked for a fight to death just for sheer entertainment. But it's a pivotal moment for Spartacus as he understands he'd rather die fighting this criminal injustice than live in such dehumanizing conditions, like an animal. But as vulnerable as he is, Spartacus drains his strength from community. That's the key, people don't follow him because he's stronger, but he's stronger because people follow him. He's conscious of his legend and accepts the heavy weight on his shoulders. During a poignant conversation with his pregnant wife, former slave Varinia (Jean Simmons), he fears weakness but she finds the right words to reassure him. "You're strong enough to be weak" While heroism in movies implies a sort of loneliness, Spartacus acts for a collective ideal. His humanistic aura even outshines the film itself and almost makes us forget we're watching a Technicolor big-budgeted swords-and-sandals epic, quite an accomplishment if you realize how much less fight scenes and much more conversations it features. But what conversations! And what a casting! Beyond Douglas and Olivier, there are two remarkable performances that drove my personal enjoyment: Charles Laughton as the plebeian senator, Gracchus, Crassus' greatest rival, and Peter Ustinov as the slave trader and gladiator's impresario Lentulus Batiatus (he rightfully won an Oscar for that role). Both of them, with the same tendency for corpulence and this endearing capability to shamelessly admit their flaws, added a certain dimension of humor and human depth in a rather solemn film. They're essential as counterparts to the grave tyranny of Crassus and Spartacus' flamboyant heroism. Together, they provide half of the enjoyment, something that all the beauty of Jean Simmons couldn't have satisfied.And since the film is still listed in his glorious filmography, kudos to Stanley Kubrick! It's not the most Kubrickian of all his films, but it still stands alone on its own as one of the most thrilling, inspiring and fascinating American classics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"He'll be back. He'll be back and there'll be millions of him." Such is Spartacus, an achievement in film, with massive scale and thousands of soldiers, but also moving: several 'manly tears' were shed. Spartacus is inspiring.It's a story that by today you've heard several times before, of one standing against many with impossible odds. But Spartacus isn't about winning, its that even a small person can make change; in this case freedom. Freedom, which the film points out, isn't eliminated for another 2000 years.Leading the charge is Kirk Douglas as the heroic, immortal Spartacus. This is his film- he looks like a revolutionary, he sounds like it, and he acts like it. Kirk shows finesse, as a capable fighter but more often a capable leader. He laughs, intimidates, sheds a few tears, and explodes on a few occasions, but he's completely believable and that is why the film is so successful.I've mentioned how epic the film is: battles, while sparse, are gigantic and all the fights are intense and really well organized. With its Roman setting, the sets are extravagant and luscious, the costumes equally remarkable. It's a beautiful film.Spartacus will get to you- seeing him on his quest, growing stronger, growing happy, seeing the loyalty of the freed slaves. By the time the climax comes, you feel the immeasurable daunt of the challenge. Then, THE scene arrives, and the past two and a half hours become 100% worth it. The ending is excellent, not cheesy and happy or completely miserable, but very fulfilling and satisfying.Spartacus is phenomenal and relevant. It's a great tale with dramatic irony (Caesar!) that shows the cruelty of a superpower. Timeless. 8.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm a sucker for old sword-and-sandals epics... so this one is right up my alley!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just an all-around classic! Best film of 1960 (no small feat when the competition is Hitchcocks's best film - PSYCHO) and one of the greatest epics ever put on celluloid. Next to BEN-HUR and THE TEN COMMANDMENTS I can't think of another more worthy epic than this one. The cast is to die for! Kirk Douglas is perfect as Spartacus and Jean Simmons has never been better than here as Varinia (although she was also great as Diana in THE ROBE) but the real scene-stealers are the magnificent trio of Sir Laurence Olivier, Charles Laughton, and Peter Ustinov (who won the Supporting Actor Oscar). Choosing between these 3 is like choosing between your favorite children. Sometimes I really want to say that Olivier is my favorite but it's really difficult. All 3 are great! The battle scenes are some of the best you'll ever see from that time. Heck, there's a scene where a man's arm is hacked off completely. I mean that's BRAVEHEART material right there! But this was 1960! Great stuff. No CGI. Just hordes of men engaging in epic warfare! The interesting thing is that I am not a fan of Stanley Kubrick's. Not at all. But this one is an exception. Probably because it's not really a Kubrick film. Sure he directed it but it's not the type of film that he would normally direct. He was only brought in by Douglas to replace Anthony Mann after Douglas fired Mann. So it's basically a non-Kubrick film directed by Kubrick. And that can only be a good thing. At least for me. Kubrick is a master of the craft but the subject matter he chooses to tackle never interests me in the least. That's why SPARTACUS works so well IMO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rome is no example but a slave society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film of the young Kubrick is of course rather simple in subject and inspiration. What's more Kubrick was following the fashion of the big peplum films that were both long (two parts) and of biblical or Roman inspiration in his time. Kubrick wants to propose us a cinematographic opera with an overture and a musical piece between the two parts with nothing on the screen, that is to say the curtain down and probably slowly rising at the end.Apart from that the means and the subject are rather banal in our minds, and yet Kubrick is already pushing his footprint on the story. He insists as no one has done before him on the slavery society the Roman empire was, in which some 80% of the population were slaves and nothing but slaves on which their owners had all rights to exploit them, punish them even for fun or even kill them for the pleasure of one's senses, the revulsion, the sickness watching one man killing another can bring in your stomach or the sadistic pleasure of killing someone and cutting him up into pieces.We have quite the opportunities, in fact many opportunities to check on the practice of crucifixion in Roman society both in long lines of such crucified slaves and on the close up vision of Spartacus on his own cross. The method used here is both cruel and effective, the legs dangling pull on the body and the arms ties to the cross in three places each make breathing more difficult and lead to rather fast lack of oxygen and some more or less comatose state.This realistic vision, these realistic details are shown over and over and the division of the Roman society is really in two classes of people: the ruling minority that is sadistic and cruel and only interested in their possessions and interests on one side, and the slaves on the other side and most of the time the punishment or crucifying of slaves is a spectacle for the mass of the slaves themselves that are walking in front of them and are thus reminded how fragile their life is in the hands of their masters.In between these two classes, the legions, the soldiers who are in fact most of the time indentured people, temporary slaves who can suffer at the hands of their officers the same fate as gladiators or slaves at the hands of civilian masters.That's by far the best element in that film and that's the signature of Kubrick himself. Then the story is banal in its very dramatic tragic dimension. Slaves, here gladiators trained to fight and kill, refuse to be animals any more and go on killing one another on command and they spearhead a rebellion of slaves. Of course gladiators are good fighters and can easily defeat professional soldiers especially when the officers consider the enemy are nothing but slaves in their segregative arrogance.But to defeat whole armies you need more than a few gladiators and you need a lot of training and know how, and simple slaves do not have that training and that training cannot come overnight. They are thus bound to be defeated and they all are condemned to die on the battle field or be crucified along the roads to serve as examples to fellow slaves and fodder to the birds who will get their eyes long before the crucified person is dead.Kubrick adds to that some melodramatic love and even a child who will be generously freed by some master of the mother. That's just the spoonful of sugar that is supposed to make the drama pass in your throat without strangling or choking you, but it is also used by Kubrick to emphasize the death of Spartacus on his cross seeing his woman and his child walk away, free but for how long? That's probably what is best in this film, the way Kubrick uses standard Hollywood means and styles and methods to amplify the message: all these Roman and Greek free and democratic models from Antiquity are nothing but barbaric slave countries and societies. He even adds some innuendo about how the masters could use the male slave sexually if they just wanted to. That was part of the "job" for both male and female slaves to be used for the pleasure of their masters that could lead to the small death or the big death on the spur of the moment's inspiration of the master. That too could be seen as some "avant-garde" detail in 1960. But can we say Kubrick produced a spaghetti peplum? I am not sure.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Benchmark historical epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kubrick's retelling of a Roman slave revolt remains fresh and exciting over fifty years since it was first released. Kirk Douglas, in one of his most iconic turns, plays the titular role as a low-born but noble hero and the opening sequences of gladiatorial combat are excellent - truly this was the GLADIATOR of its day (and then some).Once the revolt comes about the film veers into the murky waters of politics, detailing the power-hungry machinations of Crassus (a sinister Laurence Olivier) and his enemy Gracchus (Charles Laughton, clearly having a ball as the corpulent senator). The actual front-line battles between slave and Roman armies are mostly kept off-screen, at least until the climatic set-piece which is tremendously well executed (I'd take the burning logs over any of Michael Bay's empty explosions).Unfortunately, the film is undoubtedly overlong, with far too many sentimental/repetitive romantic interludes with love interest Jean Simmonds. Kubrick's talent as director is sometimes wasted in the many exposition scenes which are no better than those in your average peplum. Think of this as a film with a great opening, great climax and middling mid section and you'll be right. Watch out for memorable turns from Woody Strode (compelling), Herbert Lom (slimy), John Ireland (tough), Tony Curtis (fey) and Peter Ustinov (hilarious).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lord Larry likes oysters and snails</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sword and sandal epic finds Spartacus (Douglas), rising from servitude to king of the rebellion and the bane of would-be supremo Crassus (Olivier) misled at every opportunity by the wily and politically savvy Gracchus (Laughton). Joined by fellow slave John Ireland, he sets out to escape the continent, emancipating the chained masses along their way, much to the chagrin of the Roman senate. When John Dall's appointment as garrison to Rome fails to subdue the rebellion, Laughton's democratic grip is over-awed by Olivier's potency as a charismatic warlord and purveyor of the romantic ideal of Rome. But the canny Laughton still has one last master stroke to play.The intense rivalry between Olivier and Laughton's characters is perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this film. Watching the titans trade barbs and try to out manoeuvre the other as they position to instill their ideology for Rome in my opinion dwarfs Douglas' title role, relegating it to that of virtual bystander. Jean Simmons is radiant as Spartacus' wife and later, Olivier's bargaining chip, while the supporting cast including Ustinov, Curtis, Ireland and Dall, all execute well (sans John Gavin, wooden as Julius Caesar). Special mention to Woody Strode in a silent but expressive role as a gladiator against whom Douglas must fight to the death. His dignified presence and integrity are character defining of both Olivier's psychopathy and Douglas' pacifism.Sharp and sometimes poetic script by Dalton Trumbo, colourful sets, costumes and location work complement the aforementioned acting credentials resulting in a truly grand spectacle that even at three hours remains compelling. The quirky sexual undertones aren't especially subtle (don't miss Olivier's "I like oysters and snails" metaphor to Curtis, who promptly high tails it to the rebellion); Nina Foch &amp; Joanna Barnes' apparent interracial fantasies for Woody Strode and Laughton's own chubby-chasing fetish nods to the decadence of ancient Rome, but also adds the unique Kubrick watermark, a signature of his distinct, eccentric style. Worthy of its reputation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The strengths far outweigh the weaknesses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story takes place in the first century B.C. at the tail end of the Roman Republic and just prior to the era of the Roman Empire. The historical accuracy of the film has been questioned (for example, any Sempronius Gracchus had been dead before Crassus arrived on the scene), but history does confirm that Spartacus led a slave revolt at the time and he was defeated by Crassus. That historical backdrop was enough history for me to forgive any fictional embellishments.There is such a wealth of things to appreciate in this epic movie that I am willing to forgive most all of its weaknesses. Laurence Olivier's performance as the Roman general Crassus is estimable. Given Olivier's enormous talent you might think he might just go through the motions in this role (and even that would probably have been worth seeing), but his Crassus is truly captivating--he plays the part with such gusto that you believe he would really like to have been Crassus. Peter Ustinov is here in an Oscar-winning performance as Batiatus, a trainer of gladiators. Ustinov plays the obsequious and avaricious Batiatus with such gentle humor that he steals almost every scene he is in. For example, when Crassus and his retinue visit Batiatus he tells his servant to serve the "second-best wine. No, the best, but small goblets." Charles Laughton, at the top of his form playing the devious and wily senator Gracchus, is a pure delight. He is prone to making cynical comments like, "We buy everything else these days, there's no reason we shouldn't pay for patriotism." And when Batiatus claims to be seized with an attack of integrity, Gracchus comments that in the current political climate it is easier to die from that than from disease. Tony Curtis is well cast as the sensitive "singer of songs" who wants to be a soldier. Kirk Douglas has some fine moments, he looks the part and has probably never been better. One weakness among the main actors I felt was Jean Simmons as the slave Lavinia. Though she and Douglas have some fine and tender moments together, like when Spartacus first meets her in the gladiator school, Simmons often looked a bit too fresh and lovely for a woman in her situation. John Gavin, as Julius Caesar, did not project the strength one associates with such a historically powerful man. But, if you cannot appreciate the acting on display here, then I think you cannot appreciate acting.Alex North's score can be a bit intrusive at times, but overall it's impressive and suitable for such a grand epic. The four minute overture and the intermission could be cut from the DVD without much loss I think.There is some sharp dialog throughout. For example, Crassus to his wimpy son-in-law: "One of the disadvantages of being a patrician is that occasionally you're obliged to act like one." Or this exchange between Gracchus and Caesar:Caeser: So, now we deal with pirates. We bargain with criminals.Gracchus: Don't be so stiff-necked about it. Politics is a practical profession. If a criminal has what you want you do business with him.The day before the big battle scene is cleverly filmed with Spartacus' speech to his troops being inter-cut with Crassus' speech outside the Roman Senate. Spartacus' speech was a little odd in that his troops stretched for what looks like a mile or more, so really only the first few people before him could have heard him. You have to accept this as movie-making for effect.The climatic battle scene between the armies of Spartacus and Crassus is truly spectacular. I have never seen anything more transfixing. The combination of the score and the way it is filmed, cutting back and forth between the two camps as the Roman army approached, built the tension to a fever pitch. It was hard not to think of Branagh's excellent filming of the Battle of Agincourt in his Henry V--but this is better. Spartacus walking among his army the night before the big battle also reminds one of a similar scene in Henry V that has Henry walking among his troops.One test of the quality of a movie for me is how well I remember it. I had not seen this film since I saw it in its original release, but I was amazed by how many of the scenes I remembered after fifty years, and even remembered some of the dialog.The Blu-ray print is pristine, it renders the richness of the colors, costumes, and sets to full effect. Seeing this on a small screen in anything but its 1.85:1 aspect ratio would significantly reduce its effectiveness I would suspect. While this film does not illustrate Stanley Kubrick's signature style, the meticulous attention to detail and artful camera work indicate that there is a keen artist behind the proceedings.</fullReview>

The famous "I'm Spartacus" scene depicts one of the finest acts of defiance ever recorded on film where a defeated Spartacus and the men who followed him refuse to bow down to the Romans knowing the horrific punishment which awaits them.

		<fullReview>This is a review of the 184 minute version; note that this includes the then-typical(for this genre) opening overture and intermission. Being that I love the work of Kubrick, I do what I can to watch all of his work, and thus I was thrilled to finally find a copy of this. In addition to the big part this played in bringing down the blacklisting of McCarthy's reign of terror as it were, this continues to be an important film with an excellent message that ought never to be forgotten. It can be recognized as one of Stanley's pictures, (well, almost as much as any of them can, anyway); we get the long takes, some of them with vast camera pans and dolly trips. He did not get to alter the script, but it is quite good. The women in this are strong(and not merely for the time it was made), and yet credible and not excessive. In general, the characterization is impressive. The acting is marvelous, and the casting is spot-on. Douglas shows that a performance can be amazing even with extended periods of not talking. There is an astonishing amount of extras in this, and the little moments of life seen in the camp scenes help make the cause seem all the more worthy. The visuals are stunning, and the editing and cinematography deliver unforgettable images. This is epic in scope and the music fits this. It feels authentic and realistic, and effectively conveys the atmospheres it goes for. The combat sequences are well-choreographed, exciting, incredible, unpredictable action, driven by the terrific FX and stunts. Dialog is spot-on. There is a lot of moderate violence and disturbing content, a little mild language, occasional obscured nudity, and one brief suggestive exchange. The DVD comes with production notes and a three minute trailer. I recommend this to anyone interested in the story, and any other fans of the director. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very entertaining movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick entered the big time here, being asked to substitute for director Anthony Mann, who was the first choice for Spartacus, in and fact did direct the opening scenes of the movie. Kubrick clearly has to work within certain creative boundaries, imposed by either the studio or Douglas, as the films producer. Some scenes are melodramatic and some of the moralising is a bit too obvious, particularly the scenes with Douglas and Simmonds and Douglas to the masses, albeit Olivier does make his scenes with Simmonds more interesting and less saccharine. In fact Olivier, Ustinov and Charles Laughton are the best performances in the film, with Olivier's Crassus oozing power, but becoming more vulnerable when seeing its impact (or lack thereof) on Spartacus; Ustinov's opportunist who nevertheless evokes sympathy as the 'survivor' character and Laughton's character's clever manipulations of gullible senators and his political sparring with Crassus in the 'Republican v Dictator' duel. Douglas is solid enough, albeit in archetypal Hollywood Leading Man mode, and certainly a role that is not quite as interesting as say for example, his performance in Paths of Glory, his previous collaboration with Kubrick.Despite this, and the obvious flamboyant approach to the design and photography, which was to show "look at the money we are spending on this" ($12 million, a lot at the time), Kubrick brings competent direction and more fleshed out (supporting) characters than usual for a film of this size and scope. Editing is first rate, as is Alex North's music, and the action sequences are generally well handled. The best sequences are the gladiator combat scenes in front of the Crassus character early on in the film, and the arrival of the Roman Legions on the site of the films final battle, where image, editing and music come together brilliantly. The films climax is a bold and interesting choice, and works so well partly because Douglas plays his character in a more understated fashion in this part of the film. Its also interesting to see Crassus try many times, and fail every time to get one over Spartacus, even though at first glance it looks like Crassus does.The plot, while loosely based on history, is the best part of the film, and while there are one or two convenient co-incidences, is doesn't mar the film and is no more than in any populist large scale Hollywood Movie. The political machinations that Spartacus becomes involved in are very prescient and still apply to situations seen by holders of power today, and this key subtext was clearly articulated, especially the handing over of more power to a leader in the interests of 'security'.Overall, a very entertaining action film, with an atypical but highly effective climax. It was Kubrick's last experience of the Hollywood System, and from now on Kubrick would work independently out of England, which would give his subsequent films a very different look and feel</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No doubt that, technically speaking, Stanley Kubrick is maybe the greatest director of all time, he can create an atmosphere like no one else, but he tends to ruin his screenplays, like he did with "A Clockwork Orange". But there are only two of his movies, that I don't have any complains about the script, "The Shining" that, although it's a wonderful movie, didn't scare me at all, and the movie that I'm reviewing now, so I can say that this is for me Kubrick's finest movies, and it was was very hard to choose.With wonderful performances by Douglas and, specially, by Olivier, this is a true classic epic. Now let me explain the real meaning of classic. It's not only a good movie, a classic is a movie that, regardless being a good movie, it's a movie that inspire future movies, it's not that's saying this, it's the real meaning of it. So when you an excellent movie like "Braveheart", that took a lot of elements of "Spartacus", you see that this movie is a truly classic.It's romance can make the film a little boring sometimes, but without it, we would miss powerful scenes in the movie, like the last one, if there wasn't all that love story, it would take a lot of it's impact, that moving scene would appear fake. But when we're talking about action, this film does not disappoint, considering that I watched "Ratatouille" in the same day I watched this one, the rebellion remembered me a lot of the rat rebellion in Pixar's movie, the image of slaves rebelling, and getting away of the training area, like mouses running away from human is very striking, and well filmed, with Kubrick making a wide shot so we can have and idea of the quantity of people were running away is admirable.Verdict: A classic, by one of the best directors of all time, indispensable!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best of the ancient world epics...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spartacus has just been announced for release on blu-ray May 25th, 2010. The disc is set to have a slew of supplementary material included although whether this is as extensive as on the earlier Criterion Collection release is unclear.There was an excellent article written for the magazine Cineaste a few years back that explored the "artistic license" utilized by Dalton Trumbo when he wrote the screenplay for this film, based on a true story. That said, I think it's fair to say that no-one expects absolute fidelity to facts when they watch a historical drama, and these sorts of movies are notorious for playing loose with their particular facts.As a film, it's definitely the most impersonal of Kubrick's works, not that this is necessarily a bad thing given the genre he was working in here. Kirk Douglas gives one of his signature performances (ranking with his Colonel Dax from Paths of Glory) and the subtexts are handled with more directness than would have been allowed if this had been made just a few years earlier.</fullReview>

And, it is a regret that how Spartacus rises from a slave gladiator to a leader and his many defeating of Roman armies are not given proper due.Furthermore, I am wondering that if Stanley gets full control of directing this movie, what it will be?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historically inaccurate, but just so darn entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie does some weird stuff to the Roman time line (the special appearance by the by that time long-dead Gracchus comes to mind), but that's not really the point of the whole thing. It just wants to show you a beautiful spectacle, and it really delivers. From the first minute in this movie is incredibly compelling, mainly because of the portrayal of Spartacus, which strikes exactly the right tone. Kirk Douglas gives him a lot of different aspects, a lot of good and bad points, which really helps showing of his human side. Kubrick directed, but he never really manages to put his own identity into the movie. However he does manage to create some really marvellous battle scenes, which I guess is the next best thing. This movie isn't better or worse than his later works, it's just really, really different from them. Overall I really enjoyed this movie, totally worth the three hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First Really Big Non-Christian Themed Sword and Sandal Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actor &amp; producer Kirk Douglas wanted to star as the protagonist in director William Wyler's ancient world epic movie "Ben-Hur: A Tale of Christ." Of course, Wyler had other ideas. Basically, Wyler wanted Kirk to play the villainous Roman soldier Messala opposite the Charlton Heston hero. Kirk rarely played second fiddle to anyone unless it was Burt Lancaster. Consequently, since he did not get top billing in "Ben-Hur," Kirk Douglas decided to not only star in "Spartacus," but he also would produce it. "Spartacus" was an ancient world epic about a legendary slave who escaped captivity, organized a huge slave army and challenged the Roman Empire. Despite its distant past setting, "Spartacus" dealt with an issue that at the time of its release that weighed heavily on the minds of America: race relations. The theme of "Spartacus" was the dignity and freedom that every individual deserves as his or her birthright. Good films can span centuries because they mean something to us. The universal need that all men must be free lies at the heart of this blockbuster film. Indeed, "Spartacus" represented a liberal, Democratic sensibility.Originally budgeted at $4-million, "Spartacus" proved to be a costly film with its budget reaching $12 million dollars. Today a medium budget movie runs about that price. When "Spartacus" came out everybody had something to say about its enormous budget. Ironically, MCA brought Universal-International Studio where Kirk was producing "Spartacus" for about the same price. "Spartacus" coined $30-million domestically at the box office and earned $60-million worldwide. This would be the biggest Kirk Douglas project. He turned heads in more ways that one. He allowed Hollywood Ten blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo to use his name on the credits for the first time. Trumbo had been blacklisted by the anti-Communists in Hollywood and Washington so that he could only pen scripts under a pseudonym. Mind you, he wound commanding lesser salaries as a result of this problem. Nevertheless, Douglas and Trumbo argued about the script because Douglas?a zealous Zionist?wanted "Spartacus" to reflect the travails of the Jewish people. Trumbo was more interested in how "Spartacus" reflected modern-day politics and the Cold War.The version of "Spartacus" that most will watch is the restored version with the notorious "oysters and snails" scene between Sir Laurence Olivier and pop cult icon Tony Curtis. You will probably never be able to think about "oysters and snails" in the same light after you see "Spartacus." Religious groups complained about this scene with its conspicuously obvious language about bisexuality. Indeed, this movie is as secular as most standard issue Italian muscleman movies. British actor Peter Ustinov won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role. Lenser Russell Metty's widescreen photography received an Oscar, but Kubrick actually composed most of the shots while a disgruntled Metty sat nearby. "Spartacus" also won Best Costume Design Oscar and the Best Art Direction and Set Decoration Oscar. "Spartacus" received Oscar nominations for Best Editing and Best Music. Meanwhile, "Spartacus" won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture of 1960."Spartacus" is an epic adventure about a troublesome Thracian slave, "Spartacus" (Kirk Douglas of "Champion"), who is saved from sure death by slave trader Lentulus Batiatus (Peter Ustinov) looking for new candidates for his gladiatorial training camp. It does not take Spartacus long to make an enemy out of thuggish Marcellus (Charles McGraw of "The Narrow Margin") who runs the school like a boot camp. Spartacus tries to befriend Draba (Woody Strode of "Sergeant Rutledge"), but the Ethiopian refuses to embrace him as a friend because he might have to kill him. Batiatus trains gladiators and sells them. However, things change when Marcus Licinius Crassus (Laurence Olivier of "The Entertainer") shows up with two women and Marcus Publius Glabrus (John Dall of "Rope") to see a gladiatorial battle. Lentulus doesn't like to pit his gladiators against each other, but Crassus pays him more than enough and Draba and Spartacus fight to the death. The outcome of this hand-to-hand combat scene is surprising, especially Crassus' role of killing the gladiator who tries to scale the walls with a trident and kill him. Lentulus sells Varinia (Jean Simmons of "The Big Country") to Crassus but Crassus tells him to deliver her to him later. After the gladiatorial duel, Spartacus starts a fight with Marcellus when the latter informs him that Varinia is being sent away. These two struggle, and Spartacus drowns Marcellus in a bubbling hot pot of stew. Lentulus decides to deliver Varinia to Crassus personally, orders his men to suppress the uprising, and hurries off in the cart to Rome with Varinia.Not long afterward, Spartacus launches a revolt against Rome. Along the way, he meets Varinia and they fall in love. Initially, Spartacus and his army try to leave Italy, but their plans are thwarted when two Roman armies try to trap them on the coastline. Spartacus decides to turn his army north and confront Crassus, a wealthy and devious Roman soldier who has become Rome's new dictator. Ironically, Crassus doesn't know what Spartacus looks like so he has Lentulus brought to him. Lentulus reminds Crassus that he saw Spartacus fight the Ethiopian. Mind you, the weakest thing about "Spartacus" is the lack of hate between Spartacus and his mortal enemy Crassus. Several scenes occur in the Roman Senate with Sempronius Gracchus (Oscar winning actor Charles Laughton of "The Private Life of Henry VIII") chewing the scenery with John Gavin standing nearby as Julius Caesar. Gracchus and Crassus are mortal enemies, too. About an hour into this 197 minute marathon, Atoninus (Tony Curtis of "The Vikings") shows up as Crassus' slave who bathes the wealthy Roman. After Crassus' "oysters and snails" speech, Atoninus flees and joins Spartacus."Spartacus" is a rare, big-budgeted spear and sandal movie without religious references to Christ, though "Spartacus" is clearly a messianic hero. Kubrick does a great job of cross-cutting between the speeches given by Spartacus and Crassus to their public.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Master of Epics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After many, many viewings on TV and VHS, I finally was able to watch "Spartacus" on a big screen, in all the Technicolor glory of the 1991 restoration. What an amazing film, it still moved me, even though I know many of the scenes by heart.I question those who watch this, and then comment, "What was the point? After all, everyone associated with the rebellion ended up dead, except a woman and a baby." These people are missing the entire theme of the movie, I believe. As Kirk Douglas himself says, late in the film, "When a free man dies, he loses the pleasure of life. A slave loses his pain. Death is the only freedom a slave knows. That's why he's not afraid of it." The many scenes of Spartacus' motley army of all ages emphasize the joy that these people experienced during their liberation, however brief it may have been. They follow Spartacus willingly, enthusiastically, because he has restored their human dignity.I must praise the acting in this film. Ustinov, Laughton, Douglas, Simmons are all fantastic, but Olivier just mesmerized me, every second he was on screen. So smooth, so cunning, so ruthless yet charming and polite, his Crassus is an unforgettable character. Just observe his body language throughout "Spartacus", he leaves no doubt that this man is in command. His vulnerability when he is romancing Varinia at the end is a stark contrast to the bemused arrogance that is his normal attitude. Those scenes actually allow us to see Crassus as human, and therefore, incredibly, Olivier makes us sympathize with his frustration at his rejection by Varinia.A great epic film, featuring several outstanding performances, I recommend "Spartacus" to anyone who likes grand adventure served up with a measure of intelligence, intrigue, and dry humor. A true classic."I shall not violate Rome at the moment of possessing her"</fullReview>

Kirk Douglas (Lust for Life, The Bad and the Beautiful, Champion) as Sparticus really gave us an outstanding performance as the man who took on Rome. Not until Gibson gave us William Wallace do we see a champion of the people fighting for freedom.We cannot neglect mentioning Laurence Olivier as Crassius, Jean Simmons as Varinia, Peter Ustinov as Batiatus, and Woody Strode (The Quick and the Dead) as Draba.The restored version of this film goes 3 and a half hours. I guess sitting through Grindhouse wasn't so bad after all. If a film is good, then the time flies by.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"They Were Just Slaves ..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with "The ten Commandments", "Ben Hur", "Quo Vadis", "El Cid" and perhaps some other one this film stands as one of the best spectacular epics of the genre's golden age back in the 50's and early 60's. In spite of some inaccurate historical events (Spartacus died in battle and was not crucified, for instance) director Stanley Kubrick clearly succeeds in transmitting the spirit of the Tracian gladiator's famous revolt against the powerful Roman republic in search for freedom, that became a myth.Kirk Douglas if not rendering a perfect performance all along the film deliveries his incredible and magnetic screen personality and fits perfectly as Spartacus. Laurence Olivier handles easily his role as the arrogant and ambitious Crassus in love with Rome and himself. Charles Laughton (as populist senator Graccus), Peter Ustinov (as the gladiators training school owner Bathiatus) and pretty Jean Simmons Varinia (Spartacus woman) conform a really impressive and strong cast. Tony Curtis as the poet slave and Charles McGraw as the tough gladiator's trainer are very convincing too. Perhaps the weak link in this aspect is John Gavin's young Julius Caesar, too wooden and definitely lacking the "phisic du rol" (Ceasar was not a tall man and he was bold already in his youth). Nina Foch, Woody Strode, Harold Stone, John Ireland and mainly Herbert Lom as the treacherous sylesian pirate Tigranes Levanto complete a high quality supporting cast.Good action and battle scenes, lots of extras (no computers back then) perfect settings, well designed gowns and armors and a powerful and accurate musical score by Alex North are also highlights in this great movie.A true classic in its genre!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very good epic produced and acted by a H'wood legend (Douglas). It starts off strong and just continues on that wave-length right through the conclusion when the lead is crucified. The performances that support this epic are all-around excellent. One possible quibble is that Curtis' character could have been built up somewhat so that in the last combat scene there is a stronger current of tension between Antoninus and the slave-king Spartacus. Strode is superb in his smaller role, as are Ireland and Gavin. I was born a decade after this film played in theaters, but it's a film that deserves a definite theatrical viewing. The scene that shows Spartacus leading the salves is expertly inter-cut w/ the Olivier character speaking to Romans. The battle scene is a HUNDRED TIMES better than all the CG-effects used in the over-promoted turkey 'Troy.' They just don't make Epics, like they used to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The tale of a Roman man born in to slavery like his father and his before him - but breaks out to lead a rebel army against his former slave masters. Based on a true historical story.My first problem with this review is that I don't like "swords and sandals" generally and maybe this is a chance to get of my chest why. Well, for a start I don't envy anybody in these things. What is wealth when you have nothing to spend it on but houses, women and wine - and even then you have to be very lucky. In those days everybody was poor - even the very rich!Given the above paragraph it might surprise you that I actually like this film, although with grave limits. This is Hollywood Rome where day-glow teeth abound and even female slaves look like they have wandered out of the beauty salon. Given that Kubrick (a late replacement director) was an intelligent man he must have been having a laugh when he presents props such as maps that are almost perfect.Like all of these sword-of-justice products the hero (Kirk Douglas in the title role) seems to have wandered in from another age and can point out all the errors, foibles and injustices that those in power perpetrate. Naturally such heroes have few faults themselves and never say anything non PC.Douglas enjoys running, jumping and fighting - so he spends a lot of time doing just that. Tony Curtis fancied himself as a magician (he even did an act on stage) and he shows us that he was quite good at it. Here he plays a rather effeminate man who learns to fight rather than entertain.Lawrence Olivier is often described as the greatest actor in the world. At his peak this may even have been true. He dwarfs everyone as bisexual warrior and diplomat Marcus Licinius Crassus. Years of stage of experience allows him to say things in a way that you believe that something important is being said - but have no real idea why!Peter Ustinov (Lentulus Batiatus) loves playing callous snakes and here he really goes to town as a slave-master. What a trophy cabinet the two of them have! Generally the film falls in to the trap of having the villain doing something interesting - or at least something that looks interesting and political - while the hero does little but fall in love and make speeches to men who seem to hang on his every word. This doesn't make him very interesting and the script seems to know that - happy to push him in to the background until Sparticus is actually needed.Without entering in to spoilers the end is downbeat rather than triumph. A hint at a better world, but little more. This was rare for films of the time and a brave step.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Powerful Indictment of Statist Tyranny; Memorable and Vivid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a large-scale movie with fairly good acting, splendid production values and an intelligent script that tends toward socialism and has a few problems at the opening scenes that mitigated its otherwise relentless power Apart from these two problems, it is a film that can be watched many times, it has fine dialogue and is an interesting fictionalized biography throughout. Stanley Kurbrick's direction is generally good, and his habit of mounting historically-accurate sets such as the Roman Senate chamber, Crassus's house, the gladiatorial school of Lentulus Batiatus etc. is a great asset i this case. I found the experience of the film to be quite realistic, despite the necessary telescoping of characters and the introduction of allegorical types. The period of the historical adventure is the youth of Julius Caesar, when Rome was dominated by the party of Marcus Crassus, the mine-owning would-be dictator of Rome; his political opponent in the narrative is the populist Gracchus, a telescoping of the earlier Gracchi brothers who had been executed for trying to end the oligarchy of Rome legally. The other element in the film other than a huge revolt of the slaves of the late Republic, already become totalitarian, is the presence of the Cilician pirate fleets as a thorn in the Republic's leaders' sides. Spartacus, a Thracian, leads the revolt against the empire after escaping with his fellow slaves of the arena from the gladiator school in Capua where they had been being trained; the catalyst for the revolution is a double fight to the death, something they had been promised would not happen to them, staged to please Crassus and his protégé and their two women. Gathering slaves as he goes, Spartacus swiftly hones a gladiator-trained army on the slopes of volcanic Mt. Vesuvius. He takes several cities including the port of Brundusium, but he cannot lay siege to Rome, lacking the machineries to do so; and when he reaches the sea, the pirates with whom he had dealt to buy ships with looted money so he might disperse his men back to their homes have been defeated...there will be no fleet to meet them. The pirate factor offers Spartacus and his leaders escape; Spartacus tells him to go away. Then he leads his men in battle one last time against the army of Crassus. But Lucullus returns from the pirate wars and the slave army is trapped between several forces. They fight bravely but lose a disastrous final battle--and Crassus then offers many men escape from crucifixion if they will give up their leader. Thousands rise up, crying, "I am Spartacus!" as their answer. Crassus recognizes the leader from his prior appearance in the arena and forces him to fight a final duel to the death with his protégé, Antoninus. He kills him, and Antoninus says, "I love you Spartacus--as the father I never had." "I love you," Spartacus tells him, "as the son I will never see." But he does see his son; his wife and Batiatus find him on a cross as they flee Rome, and show him the son who will live free. The music by Alex North is superb, and the cinematography by Russell Metty is very fine. Costumes were created by Bill T, Valles and William Ware Theiss of "Star Trek" fame. Alexander Golitzen did the beautiful production design. The script was adapted by Dalton Trumbo from Howard Fast's rather short novel. Among the actors in Kirk Douglas's mammoth production, accolades should have gone to Laurence Olivier and Charles Laughton as the marvelous antagonists in Rome's political death throes as a Republic. Instead a good performance by Peter Ustinov was somehow cited. This is not really an actor's movie, however; since it is played mostly on an adventure level so that those who come off best have medium-sized parts or smaller--such as Charles McGraw as Marcellus the sadistic gladiator-master, Herbert Lom as the Cilician ship-factor, John Gavin as the young Caesar, Joanna Barnes and Nina Foch as the two patrician women, John Dall as Crassus' second, and John Ireland as Crixus, Spartacus's second...Jean Simmons is quite good as Varinia, Spartacus's slave wife; Tony Curtis gives an intelligent try as Antoninus, except for his Brooklyn accent. As Spartacus, Kirk Douglas does very good work except for the two set speeches which his lack of classical training defeats. Ignoring the altruistic gesture that mars the film's grim opening, this is a film being better and better appreciated with time both by critics and by film-goers. And deservedly so in my view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Great Sword and Sandal Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spartacus is probably the best of the sword and sandal movies of this era. The film is taut, thoughtful, well-acted and not overly long. There is equal measure of action, love scenes, and Roman political intrigue; therefore the film doesn't bog itself down in any one area or cliché as some of these epics do. This makes Spartacus a well-balanced movie that is really watchable.Great sets, great costumes and great actors compliment a brilliant script. The film is very well produced and effectively directed. The fight scenes are extremely absorbing - especially the fight-to-the-death pairings watched by Crassus (Lawrence Olivier), Glaborus (John Dall) and the Roman ladies; the love scenes are touching (first time around anyway); and the scenes of political intrigue in Rome are an excellent off-set to the plight of the gladiators.By including the political scenes, Kubrick added a tremendous depth to Spartacus. The political play-off between Crassus (an optimate), Caesar (a populare) and Gracchus (head populare) add a great historical flavour to what was going on politically in ancient Rome at the time, and help no end to take the weight off the 'fighting for freedom' motif of the film. These scenes also provide us with a great subplot involving Gracchus (Laughton) and Bataiatus (Ustinov). The research for these scenes was done well, and the script is very intelligent, incisive and sharp.The film fails in some areas though. The good versus evil motif was clearly intended as American Cold War era propaganda. Note the monologue at the start of the film which states that Spartacus was dreaming of an end to slavery "forty years before the coming of Christ" and "2000 years before slavery would end." The monologue infers that Christianity does not favour slavery, but freedom. This was not the case in the ancient world - bishops kept their own slaves, and Jesus Christ and St. Paul themselves do not denounce slavery, but instead use it as a metaphor for being a 'slave of god.' To the early Christians, and Jesus Christ, the social position you held in life was not important, what was important was if you had been a good person and served your master well, for it was the afterlife which counted.It was also impossible for someone in the ancient world to envisage a world without slavery. Spartacus would not have had the slavery-free world of our own, in which freedom is a right and not a privilege, to compare his own to. Slavery had always been a normal, intrinsic part of ancient society. Slaves may not have liked to be kept prisoner, but they would not have been able to comprehend a world in which such a condition did not exist. This heavy-handed aspect of the movie is an American manufacture - creating a protagonist and antagonist situation to suit the times in which the film was made.Nonetheless, this is a minor quibble that can be overcome by the merits of the rest of the movie. Spartacus is a finely crafted outing that takes the audience along in an involving and sweeping story that is well-acted, well-scripted and which takes the trouble to add a good amount of depth to its otherwise engrossing subject matter. A solid 9/10.</fullReview>

Laurence Olivier gives a masterful performance as Crassus, a powerful military man enjoying the fruits of his labor. Kirk Douglas in intense and human, Peter Ustinov (OSCAR winner) is hilarious, Charles Laughton majestic, and Jean Simmons beautiful and touching. The battle scenes are intense and incredible.A 9 out of 10. Best performance = L. Olivier. Except for LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, the best epic of the time period. Blows away Charlton Heston's BEN-HUR.

		<shortDescription>History vs. Modern Politics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The release year of 1960 is significant. America was still living in the long and shameful shadow of the actions of the House on Un-American Activities Committee. This was followed quickly both by the Korean War (a struggle for freedom) and the Civil Rights Movement (yet another fight for freedom, but this time in a supposedly already free America). It was noted at the time that all these events had parallels to the wars in the period of the late Roman Republic. Howard Fast set his novel SPARTACUS during that time for obvious reasons. It wasn't just a novel of an ancient uprising, but a political statement on his own times. A few years later, novelist Taylor Caldwell would dedicate her 1964 novel of Cicero ("A PILLAR OF IRON") to the memory of President John Kennedy. She also stated that any similarities between ancient Rome and modern America were intentional.Producer Kirk Douglas' deliberate choice of Dalton Trumbo (a blacklisted American screenwriter) to write the script for SPARTACUS was a bold political move. Douglas' choice of a book source was just as deliberate. Howard Fast was also the author of "April Morning" a very patriotic and heroic tale of the American Revolution.For an interesting, and different, take on the story of Spartacus, read Colleen McCullough's third novel of ancient Rome, "Fortune's Favorites" which she insists was based on reliable ancient sources. Here, Spartacus is not an ignorant slave but a Roman officer who, found guilty of a crime, must choose between execution or life as a gladiator. Being a former officer, he is thus able to understand the tactics of the legions sent against his slave armies. The conclusion also shows Spartacus and his wife sailing off on a pirate ship into a luxurious exile in a foreign country hostile to Rome.We should be clear, in our praise and admiration of Kirk Douglas' heroic version of Spartacus, that we are not giving in to an idolized legend rather than the true story of the real man. The script's message is simple and straight-forward (or, perhaps too simple?): tyranny must always be fought and defeated by brave warriors fighting for human freedom. Thus the story of SPARTACUS could be set in any age, especially America at the beginning of the decade of the 60s. Such messages raise up heroic figures, composed of unequal parts of truth and legend. It will never be possible to present a true and accurate picture of the ancient past in movies. Movies create images, shadows - legends. They are not historical truth. They are "movie truths." We must be certain that we know the difference.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The life of the Roman slave who almost toppled Rome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, no other movie has said so much about the values of freedom, courage, integrity, honesty, commitment and love than this movie; nor said it so well. Spartacus, played by Kirk Douglas, is a Roman slave who is sold to a gladitoral school - with the intent that he will some day fight and (most likely) die in the arena to entertain Roman citizens. He leads a revolt at the school and achieves freedom with the other gladitor/slaves. They build an army with the intent of fighting their way out of Rome and going back to the countries of their birth, where they will live as the free men they once were. His commitment to freedom, his loyalty to his friends, his love for Varinia (his wife, played by Jean Simmons) and his courage shine through ever moment of this magnificent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pre-Lawrence of Arabia epic has naive characterisation of Spartacus, but still, doesn't get enough credit in Kubrick's canon.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spartacus is a slave... He wants to be a King... There's only one way to go about it...Its love story, and the character of Spartacus, belong to that old-fashioned school of naive epics, where the hero is relentlessly deified and praised as perfect.Its just too damn simple. The revisionist epics, like Lawrence of Arabia, are much more interesting - they are an investigation into the character of the hero. They do not therefore have to be perfect, only interesting. They are more interesting, therefore, and realistic, if they are imperfect.But all the same Kubrick fans don't give Spartacus enough credit. I always figured the most amusing thing in it was Tony Curtis' Brooklyn accent in the middle of this ancient Roman epic. But then I realised many of its characterisations are done with humour: Laughton and Olivier give performances which are tongue in cheek and camp. But best of all is Peter Ustinov, who lights up the screen with a very unique character.Kubrick's mastery at choreographing mass crowd scenes is evident here. It is a gorgeously photographed epic - and, if you're a Kubrick fan, a sumptuous and satisfying experience.Its musical score also has a gorgeous love theme.8/10. Spartacus is without a doubt an accomplished and above-average film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Epic Success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Spartacus" remains an epic success even on DVD. It was released in 1960. This was at a time when the modern computerized imaging was not available. The mob scenes are made up of real people, and this cannot be accomplished any longer because of the overwhelming cost to the studios. There is truly a need to see this film on the big screen. However, with a good sound system and big screen there is adequate appreciation for the film. Kirk Douglas plays the lead role in Howard Fast's greatest novel. Jean Simmons plays Verinia, the slave woman with whom he falls in love. Charles Laughton and Peter Ustinov give perfect performances as Roman senator and Gladiator school director respectively. If one has not seen it before, it should be on their must see list. It is a classic for all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's true, Kirk Douglas' Spartacus is one of the strongest and most convincing heroes in movie history (maybe second only to his performance in PATHS TO GLORY, also directed by Stanley Kubrick).Still, there are two characters stealing the show: Peter Ustinov's slave dealer and especially Charles Laughton's Gracchus. Their scenes together are a rare gem. Never have serenity and tragedy been blended so perfectly. What a fine actor Laughton was!P.S.: Don't you ever compare this one with the dreadful GLADIATOR. It's an insult. In GLADIATOR the focus is on endless and cruel fight sequences. In SPARTACUS, in spite of 10,500 extras, the focus is on the actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A really great film...not at all like any other "gladiator" film. The film takes its power from the book by Howard Fast (who was an admitted communist) and the writer, Dalton Trumbo, (blacklisted for 15 years as a communist). This relationship must have given everyone on the set another context in which to conceive of the film, considering that this film broke the blacklist, and several blacklisted actors were used as well. The movie is really about humanity, the joy of freedom (however fleeting) and the tremendous hatred the slaves had for slavery.A lot of the film is made in Spain...interesting considering that Spain was run by a fascist dictator (Franco) at the time. There are a strange bunch of extras used in the film...elderly twins, dwarves, really elderly women, etc. It was a good technique to give a feeling of reality.... The love scenes between Spartacus and Vorynia are just beautiful, and I love the music which accompanies them. Kirk Douglas' finest film, bar none!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story of the Roman slave that attempts to lead a slave revolt against the might of Imperial Rome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Spartacus" used the talents of Kirk Douglas and the other members of the cast to invoke a strong message against the ancient practice of slavery. Based in part on an actual time in the history of Rome, Spartacus, the slave portrayed by Douglas, does remain true to the times of this screen epic.Kirk Douglas did have a hand in some of the production tasks of the film, but the major part of the work goes to Stanley Kubrick. While on camera, Douglas delivered a performance that should have won an Oscar, but did not. However, Douglas did a lot of the physical stunts involved with the film, and delivered a very fine on-screen performance. Other members of the cast that made this film stand out were Jean Simmons, as his wife, Varinia, Charles Laughton, as a Roman senator, Laurence Olivier, as Crassus, the one that ultimately captured Spartacus, John Gavin as Julius Caesar, Tony Curtis as a friend of Spartacus, John Ireland and in a role that many actors relish, Peter Ustinov, who trained the slave as a gladiator, and then saw him lead the uprising against Rome. Battle scenes are first-rate, the gladiator contests are well staged, and the viewer is taken back to the city streets and arenas of Rome, when that location controlled all the known world. A lengthy film that gets better appreciated after each and every viewing.</fullReview>

It was the first name element in the three part "Tria Nomina" naming convention used by citizens of Rome. The Praenomen was frequently the same as the father's. The nomen was termed as the "Nomen-Gentilicum" and was the family name of the "gens" or clan and almost always ended in "-ius". It was the second of the three names normally adopted by a Roman Citizen.THE COGNOMEN - The cognomen was the third of the three names of a Roman Citizen. It was a nickname or personal name.

		<shortDescription>The story of a slave fighting for freedom.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far the best movie that Kirk Douglas ever made. Douglas plays the part of Spartacus, a Roman slave on death row who is sold to a gladiator school. At the school, he is put through many exercises to turn him and the other misfortanat slaves into gladiators who will have to fight to the death when they are finished with their training. But before they could get sold to the statium there is a fight in the mess hall and soon the gladiators have broken out. Spartacus has a plan to go and free all the slaves in Rome and fight back against it until things are the way they should be. Another face in this film is Tony Curtus who plays another slave who escapes and becomes a warrior for the gladiators in the war for freedom against Rome. The film was directed by the one and only Stanely Kubrick. This was one of his first films but still one of his best. The film also being executive by Douglas was a way to get back at Ben-Hur for not giving him the main role but merely offering him the role of Charlton Heston's enemy, Messala. Not being allowed the main spot light Kirk found a way to hit back at Ben-Hur with Spartacus.Over all I give this film a 4 out of five.</fullReview>

The film, about the huge slave uprising against the Romans sometime before the birth of Christ, bursts will extravagant settings, fantastic costumes, and thrilling warrior scenes that make GLADIATOR look like SESAMESTREET. Not only does the eye candy help in gaining the viewer'sattention, but the acting by everyone involved is first rate. Kirk Douglas is typically great portraying the movie's namesake, the slave determined to bring down the Roman empire. Laurence Olivieris equally masterful as Spartacus' Roman nemesis, while Tony Curtis and Jean Simmons supply sentimental material as the people closest to Spartacus' life. In the director's seat, Kubrick scores high inhis second big-budget epic film following PATHS OF GLORY, which also starred Douglas. When you've got a fluid combination of actor and director, it's an unbeatable mix. Douglas and Kubrick have proved that.</fullReview>

Performances like Ustinov´s, Olivier´s and Douglas´we don´t see anymore. Are they overacting? How could they not dressed up in those gorgeous roman costumes. This story has the content and the form, actors who are legends today, Kubrick´s magic and his abity to portrait the roman universe: the greed, the pride, the suffering of the slaves, the beauty and how it could´ve changed the fate of thousands and the joy of freedom, some of our basic spiritual needs put together in a 3-hour bright-dream that always keeps you thinking how the basic struggle of manhood (the privileged vs. the unsheltered) some 2000 years ago is perfectly up to date in the 21th century. Unluckily I don´t quite remember the first time I watched this picture so I can´t recall my first and my true feelings towards the plot and the drama, luckily I´ve gotten to watch it several times and I often think it could be the best ever made, but that, of course, always happens after watching a unique masterpiece like this one and perhaps a bunch of another 50. I refuse to rank any of them since this sort of constraint doesn´t fit timeless pieces of art (could you give a mark to Picasso, Garcia Marquez, Mozart, Maradona,...?). In terms of comparison I could say that Braveheart, Gladiator and others like that deserve 0 out of 10 if you already know what Spartacus is about.</fullReview>

The musical score is amazing and all of the main characters are played very well. CHARLES LAUGHTON and PETER USTINOV are a pleasure to watch. In affew likable scenes it tells of the bonding between the slaves and their attitude towards ROME and its empire.

It's authenticity is pretty good, although the American accents and glaringly "Hollywood-ized" dialog do hurt (as well as Jean Simmons' "slave-girl-with-the-hour-long-makeup-job" look). These burps are more than equaled by the spectacular battle near the end and the engrossing political games played in Rome. As far as actors go, it's a mixed bag. While all of the performances were good, I was never able to accept Kirk Douglas and Jean Simmons in their parts (mostly because of the above-mentioned Hollywood corruption). Still, it's proves that while Stanley Kubrick could make thoughtful and left-of-center films, he could also make huge mainstream epic ones as well. The film world will miss him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really a film at two levels. Kirk Douglas and chums clad in designers slave sack cloth take on the might of Rome, while two great classical actors - Lawrence Olivier and Charles Laughton - grapple politically for control of the Roman state. Around both sets of characters moves the not inestimable Peter Ustinov as a trainer of gladiators. Implausible as it may seem, the film works at many levels. The writer and director both suffered during the McCarthy communist witch hunts in Hollywood and their experiences are allowed to come out during the film. Many are not aware of the way most of those persecuted, as well as those who associated with them, were black listed by Hollywood. Kirk Douglas showed some guts both in using the duo and in allowing them so much free rein. This said, the film does not suffer for this input in any way. The suffering of the two gives a strong air of reality to the picture.The film has three action scenes, the Gladiatorial contest being by far the best. This is an impressive piece of cinema, where two athletic actors stage a fight to the death for a group of half interested Roman nobility. The ultimate battle starts well with the Roman army marching up in a massive chequer board formation which then forms into a great useless square ready for Spartacus to break up with blazing log rollers. This aside the battle is still worth watching and it does finish as it really did. Only the ending lets the film down. Do we really believe it was worth all the suffering to free one woman and a baby?</fullReview>

That said, it is very well made, with sweeping cinematography, beautiful costumes and well constructed sets. The score is triumphant and bombastic, Kubrick's direction is secure and the script is surprisingly intelligent and knowing. Also the action is brilliantly done, and the performances are to be much applauded, with Kirk Douglas believable and sincere in the title role, Jean Simmons alluring as Varina and Laurence Olivier, Peter Ustinov and Charles Laughton stealing every single scene they are in.Overall, maybe not Kubrick's very best, but a fine historical epic. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stanley Kubrick's early-career epic strikes satisfactorily with both spectacle and emotion, particularly with the latter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like with many epics, the production for 1960's "Spartacus" was not an easy one. The film went through two directors, many troubling cast decisions, and other grueling filming procedures, however, the final result is by all means pleasing. "Spartacus" was the first great film for acclaimed filmmaker Stanley Kubrick who would later go on to direct films such as "2001: A Space Odyssey" (1968) and "A Clockwork Orange" (1971) and while his slavery gem does not par with epics such as "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962) and "The Ten Commandments" (1956) it is a very interesting motion picture that while dated, seems somehow more effective and mature than its modern day mimickers.Kirk Douglas stars in the title role as Spartacus: a Thracian slave who revolted against the tyrannical Roman Empire during its greatest years. Not much is known about the real Spartacus, but Douglas's portrayal, which very well might have been an influence for Mel Gibson's William Wallace in "Braveheart" (1994) and Russell Crowe's Maximus in "Gladiator" (2000), as a freedom-hungry but bloodthirsty nationalist is certainly the model for what many like to base their ideal heroes from. Opposing Spartacus is the vicious Marcus Crassus (Laurence Olivier) of Rome, whose goal ultimately becomes not to destroy Spartacus, but to destroy the name and goals of Spartacus.At a length of more than three hours, "Spartacus" is a tad too long, but there's not a single uninteresting moment throughout its running time. Perhaps it has too much for its own good and MAYBE some of the cuts from the past releases were necessary or did it some good, but ultimately there is no better way to see a film than the way its creator intended for it. It is held up by a very strong cast, especially by a performance by Peter Ustinov as a conniving, opportunistic slave trader. A common error of many historical epics are strong supporting characters and weak leading characters. But here, "Spartacus" does not fault. I was very intrigued by the performance by Kirk Douglas and saw him as a fleshed-out human being and since so little is known about the man he's portraying, there's no room for complaints on accuracy. Laurence Olivier, too, was very compelling as the tyrannical Crassus who taunts and torments with more than just his armies and his declarations for destroying the slave revolts.Stanley Kubrick was only thirty-one years old when he directed "Spartacus" after the first director was removed from the production and already one can see the early stages of his visions for spectacle and emotion. But in this case, the most interesting thing about Kubrick's film is the latter. While the glorious battle scenes in the film are by all means riveting, I was more compelled and interested in the genuine human stories that went on between the slaughters, especially with the romance between Douglas and Simmons, which never overstays its welcome and has an effective, pleasant atmosphere surrounding it. Alex North's Academy Award-nominated music score really finds the right note and volume for these surprisingly tender and poignant moments. And note how Kubrick wisely did not cast young actors for these performances and how he chose primarily middle-aged people for his principal cast members. Ultimately, this is more effective than going with the stereotypical approach that only the younger generation can wage a battle and the older ones mostly sit around and lecture. That is where it becomes more mature than its contemporary mimickers, as I noted earlier, and it's more convincing.Unfortunately, it was not until recently that audiences saw "Spartacus" the way Stanley Kubrick intended it to be. Twenty-some minutes were cut before the film even premiered, some more was cut later on, and there are still some small pieces that are lost to us, but thanks to Robert Harris and James Katz, who saved other masterpieces such as "Vertigo" (1958) and "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962) from the ravages of age, the film has been magnificently and commendably restored and the missing scenes have been put back where they should have always been. There are still some glitches and color problems left in the film, but of course, it was stored under the most deplorable of conditions since its original 1960 release.Is "Spartacus" what I would call a great epic film? No. But is it an entertaining and good one, nonetheless? Absolutely. My only real complaints for the film is the long running time, which I feel is a little too stretched, some underdeveloped supporting characters which were meant to strike with, I think, more emotional impact. And save for the romantic cues, I didn't find Alex North's score particularly passionate and majestic. But these small complaints aside, "Spartacus" is an altogether strong epic and a very satisfactory motion picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Roman State, was a God Less conquerer of any peoples with whom it fought.A virtual slave state whose slaves were not Jews, they were not Negroes, these were the peoples of conquered nations.Rome was without hope,and slavery bore this out.In the beginning there was Spartacus for whom the end of his place on this earth was drawing near.Spartacus,played by Kirk Douglas was seemingly spared death at least for a time when a slave trader played by Peter Ustinov purchased him and a number of other slaves.They were spared the indignity of dying without dignity though now they were to be trained as gladiators.A fierce fighter who training skills were like a well mannered butcher.The often times grueling training that these persons,slaves one and all was having an affect as some knew better and swore by a code that they would not kill the other.This virtual brotherhood was thematic in its treatment with Spartacus very early on nearly dying in an attempt to relieve the suffering of a slave who had just fallen to the ground when Roman Guards struck blows about the body of Spartacus for the attempt to assist a fallen slave.The slave was not necessarily a male, women,or even child.It is interesting to watch how Spartacus and a women named Varinia(played by Jean Simmons)get to know each other.There scenes for the most part are very dramatically portrayed,often moving even to the touch and if eyes could talk they surely talked the talk if you will.Jean Simmons as Varinia was moving dramatically and on par with some very excellent emotional interplay with the man whom, all called out, I'am Spartacus I'am Spartacus.Though this is not in jest this is a real romance and it is convincing.There is such detail and care that it would not matter when you were to look upon their scenes together,though the crucification is difficult to own up to.It is a real tug and a real sentiment that I did not disagree with.It is further worth mentioning of how decadent a world it is when it looks upon the human kind as slave.It is this terribly innocuous folly that is conducted at the gladiator school when guests the like accompany General Crassus(played by Lawrence Olivier) stop by and want two pairs of gladiators to fight till the death.The persons in attendance are Roman Elite and though money is paid for this exhibition it provides a change in the atmosphere at the school where there motto was that no gladiator would die in training at the school.The thematic material is here made evident and a heroic position is taken front stage.I believe it is Woody Strobe who plays Draba(triton-weapon).It serves to further the unrest though I would guess you can push a human being just so far before a revolt occurs and the gladiators never look back.The revolt spreads and though payback is a bitch it is highly any the more of what it was until that point in time when Spartacus becomes the leader of this revolt.Spartacus is interesting because the landscape requires a broad stroke and it is a broad stroke that this film never seems to fill.There is much to this film which is the equal to mob rule and though Spartacus leads,he leads an army of slaves(free or not)(some children,women,elderly)against what is a most certain death.The end draws near and helpless as the lot of humanity may be they still are lead to near annihilation.There is effective storytelling that is portrayed by one Antoninus played by Tony Curtis and yet the end indeed is again portrayed as a most certain death.If there is any point would it not be that Rome was a murderously ruthless thug whose predilection for the perverse and the corrupt are here made real.Rome is again ruled not by the rule of presumably the Law but by the conquering while all the while maintaining a slave state.There is much to the conceit of this film,that Rome knew no lover and that the inability to love at all though a lessor trait Rome possessed.It was not able to provide something that was not its by way of a conquered state.Slavery you see is without life with Spartacus leading not unto glory but unto a most certain death.Is this a film worth anything at all? There are more than one scene whereby the film put forward a sentiment that we are told is real and that even upon death Antoninus expresses a Love that is endearing upon the heart, forever does this abide.There is an attempt to provide a time ago.Antoninus at a fireside chat shows that bravery is more than a loud voice but of a tender heart as well.He tells of the longing to go home.He tells of when it was that he could go home.With this slave state, life for these hundreds upon thousands now had no home, and life was at a very effective juncture.This is not entirely seen however that was not to last as like the beginning the end was drawing near.This film possesses those worthwhile attributes and it is those worthwhile attributes that allow this film to achieve a bit of a victory in defeat.Rome was a soul less entity whose idea of imagination bore witness to a theft like the world even up to this very day had never scene.Rome pillaged the very world that it sought to enslave and not much more was her legacy outside of her call for Roman Law.This is a long day indeed.The lot of humanity that is told of hereby knew now that a long day had come. A time from a time ago was about to pass without knowledge of our way and our day with our father who art in heaven.It provides the telling of the beginning and the end to a slave revolt.It certainly was not ignored and at least for a time it wont be again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite possibly the best of the sword and sandals epics but doesn't feel like Kubrick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Kubrick's films from as early as "The Killing" to the last, the near miss that was "Eyes Wide Shut" all demands that the audience keep their focus on the screen through every scene, through every shot, through every frame of film. This film however feels pedestrian in certain scenes as if directed by an ordinary Joe not the great Kubrick. Apparently Kubrick came in after production had started, even so the majority of the film was his.Two moments that stands out as being Kubrick's happened during the gladiator combat. One when the gladiators were fighting and our focus is on Crassus (Laurence Olivier) and Grabus (John Dall). The other is when Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) tries to see gladiators fight each other as he wait his own turn. Some of the battle scenes and scenes of slaves marching toward freedom look nothing special. But the pivotal battle sequence was outstanding. However some of the more quieter moments is nothing special, such as when Antonius (Tony Curtis) performs a magic trick or moments with Spartacus and Varinia (Jean Simmons). They could easily be from any other movie. The main story of course is a slave revolt is started by the slave/gladiator Spartacus. The gladiators free themselves and free other slaves and attempt a mass exodus out of Italy is planned. In Rome however the politicians debate the crisis while jockeying for position of power. Key among the Romans are Crassus who represents the Patrician (who believes that the right to rule is a birthright) and Gracchus (Charles Laughton) who represents the Republicans (who believes in democracy). This is probably the first and only time in the History of Hollywood that the word 'Republican' ever represent something that might be good. Ironic that it was written by Dalton Trumbo a victim of blacklisting. Anyway forget about that, the whole Roman subtext is about how politicians exploit a crisis to gain power.Although this is an epic and the characters are suppose to be larger than life I thought there were very good human moments. Among my favorites are the father-son like relationship between Spartacus and Antonius especially in the end. Some of the moments among the gladiators while they were in the school, when Betiatus (Peter Ustinov) offers to take Gracchus with him as he is about leave Rome. even the controversial snail and oysters scene was very well done.The performances were good especially Olivier, and Laughton, although I think Peter Ustinov gave the best performance although it did feel like it was comic relief. On the whole I thought was very good but is not prime Kubrick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spartacus should be on everyone's Top Ten list. It's a classic that has held up very nicely after 45 years. The entire movie is great and, even though it's three hours long, you'll savor every minute. Two comments though on the beginning and the end. First, I believe the opening credits, along with the Alex North opening musical score, are the greatest opening credits in movie history. And the ending is still the greatest tear-jerker in movie history, with Verinia (the gorgeous Jean Simmons) and her newborn son at the feet of the crucified but still breathing Spartacus (Kirk Douglas in his most memorable role).

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly excellent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surprisingly, because *Spartacus* belongs to that awful genre of the sword-and-sandal epic. (Lately -- and woefully -- revived by that excruciating *Gladiator*.) Surprisingly, because the film was born of many fathers (Dalton Trumbo as screenwriter, Anthony Mann as original director, Stanley Kubrick as replacement about half-way through the production, and Kirk Douglas basically making all of the creative decisions). In other words, *Spartacus* should have been an expensive mess.But, while imperfect, it's a generally glorious epic, the "thinking man's epic" so many strived for during the Fifties and Sixties. Most of those attempts failed miserably, but this one worked out. Who really knows why. Perhaps it's because this story takes place in Republican Rome, so there are none of those wet-blanket, moon-faced Christians lurking about yet. Or maybe it's because the movie avoids being a tensionless biopic, and instead focuses on the slave rebellion -- which is clearly enough material for a 3+ hour movie, anyway. Perhaps it's the performances, all of them very good, with Peter Ustinov managing to outdo everybody as a nouveau riche dean of a gladiatorial school. In fact, the movie could've used more of Ustinov: the character is such a true-to-life conception that the actor manages to make mincemeat out of Laurence Olivier's bad guy, and even puts Charles Laughton's pompous Senator in the shade (no easy feat, that). Perhaps it's even that infamous scene between Olivier and Tony Curtis. I still aver that watching Tony Curtis bathe and oil a naked Olivier remains one of the most outrageous things you'll ever see in cinema. And that's followed by Olivier demanding of Curtis that the latter should "love Rome as a mother. You must serve her!" ("Rome" being Olivier's Crassus, of course.) Perhaps the greatest scene in the movie is the impromptu gladiatorial match between Douglas' Spartacus and another gladiator played by the ultra-dignified African-American actor Woody Strode. Exciting in and of itself, the scene then becomes poignant social commentary, as Strode hurls his trident at his oppressors up in their luxury box -- food for thought for an audience in the midst of the Civil Rights struggle. And it should be mentioned that the love story between Douglas and Jean Simmons as the slave girl from Britannia is performed with unusual sensitivity, backed up by a lovely score.The "Kubrick touch" in all of this is rather hard to discern, except perhaps in the Olivier/Curtis scene and in certain points of visual composition. Kubrick's ready-steady, static camera style gets the most out of the grand, climactic battle near the end of the picture. But Kubrick-worshipers would do well to remember that about half of this movie belongs to Anthony Mann, and in any case, ALL of it belongs to Kirk Douglas. A purely Kubrick film would doubtless have been worse. On the other hand, I also suspect that the marvelously downbeat finale would not have existed without the dour Kubrick's insistence. *Spartacus* is probably the only sword-and-sandal epic without the mushy Christian uplift, the "spiritual happy ending", despite the overt Christian symbolism in the final shots. Kubrick's meanness proves to be a bracing tonic in this otherwise sappy genre.</fullReview>

Kirk Douglas built his reputation up in the 50's by portraying hard man roles with angst, and culminated all of that in this film where he would need angst to get him out of slavery. Tony Curtis renews his alliance with Douglas by playing a supporting role with Laurence Olivier. But without a question of a doubt, it is a Kirk Douglas film, and belongs in the Kirk Douglas canon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating, cerebral (if flawed) historical epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Rome circa 55 BC, Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) is a Thracian slave who is purchased as a gladiator by the sniveling Lanista Lentulus Batiatus (Peter Ustinov), and along with his colleagues is trained in the art of killing. Falling for a slave girl, Varinia (Jean Simmons), and motivated by the death of one of his colleagues, Draba (Woody Strode), for refusing to kill him in a duel, Spartacus leads a bloody slave uprising that spreads throughout Italy. In Rome, political rivals Marcus Licinius Crassus (Laurence Olivier), a Patrician with dictatorial ambitions, and Gracchus (Charles Laughton), a Republican "man of the people", along with their subordinates Glabrus (John Dall) and Julius Caesar (John Gavin), manipulate the rebellion for their own gains. As army after army is defeated by Spartacus, the situation grows more desperate - until Crassus is given the ultimate authority to deal with Spartacus, and leads three huge Roman armies to trap him in a final showdown.The stories behind the making of "Spartacus" are legendary. The firing of director Anthony Mann, the clash of ideas between screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, novelist Howard Fast, director Stanley Kubrick, and producer/star Kirk Douglas, and the attempts of various right-wing groups in Hollywood to block the film's release, are as interesting as the film itself. With all these troubles, it's hard to believe that "Spartacus" is such a good film. It's flawed, yes, but nonetheless several notches above most films of its type.Most historical epics of the '40s and '50s were superficial spectacles which relied on casts of thousands, huge sets and scenery, giant battles, and star-power to (hopefully) overlook poor period writing and ridiculously formulaic stories. In 1959, William Wyler's "Ben-Hur" began to elevate the epic above mere shallow entertainment; in 1962, David Lean would take the genre to its pinnacle with "Lawrence of Arabia". "Spartacus" is very much in the mold of these films, rather than the empty spectacle of C.B. DeMille Biblical epics.The film contains plenty of spectacle, with its use of gorgeous Spanish scenery (offset by the occasional back-lot scene), and the giant marching armies of Rome and Spartacus, whose army becomes so large that it literally blots out the screen. The film contains a few duels and fights (particularly the memorable trident-vs.-sword fight between Spartacus and Draba), but only one major battle scene: the climactic defeat of the slave army. The prelude to the final battle features one of the most awe-inspiring spectacles ever filmed, as the enormous Roman Army maneuvers into attack formation; this scene is so impressive that the failure to represent Spartacus's earlier victories is easily forgotten. Combined with Alex North's rousing musical score, this scene is one of the most memorable in film history.But it's the much-debated political aspect of the film which propels it to classic status. The film manages to preserve most of Dalton Trumbo's notion that Spartacus is a genuine people's hero; he is motivated by the cruelty that he sees, the love of Varinia, and goes from an almost animalistic brute to a humanist who genuinely loves his followers. At one point, he refuses a request from his turncoat ally, Cilician pirate leader Tigranus Levantus (Herbert Lom), to evacuate Spartacus and his family to a life of luxury for themselves. The revolt may be futile from the beginning, but Spartacus feels that "just by opposing Rome, we may have won a victory." This is definitely a liberal point-of-view, but I don't see it as particularly offensive; then again, it was released in the aftermath of the McCarthy era, with a previously blacklisted screenwriter, so it was definitely more sensitive at the time.Even more interesting than Spartacus himself is the intricately woven chess match between Gracchus and Crassus. Gracchus is old, crooked, and venal, and yet he recognizes the threat that Crassus poses to Rome: "I'd rather have a little Republican corruption, with a little Republican freedom, than rule by Crassus and no freedom at all!" Crassus, as written by Trumbo and portrayed by the great Laurence Olivier, is a fascinating character. At first glance he is simply a power-hungry egomaniac, but upon examination he is a much more complex character. Unsure of himself, and of his abilities, he feels threatened personally by Spartacus's rebellion and wants to gain power, we suspect, more to assuage his personal insecurities than for power's sake. Even after his victory, purging Rome of its enemies ("Lists of the disloyal have been compiled" - a line which must have really resonated in 1960) and marrying Varinia, Crassus is still unable to feel secure. The acting is generally top-notch. Kirk Douglas gives a sterling portrait of Spartacus as a man who grows to have deeply-held convictions. He is more than a simple rock-jawed, noble hero; he is a complex character who grows over the course of the story. Laurence Olivier proves himself the brilliant actor he was with his wonderfully subtle and layered performance as Crassus, with Charles Laughton, in one of his last roles, a brilliant counterpart as his ultra-pragmatic rival. Tony Curtis is also fine as Antoninus, the romantic slave who becomes Spartacus's right hand man, and Peter Ustinov does a fine job as the sleazy Batiatus, who cares not a wit about politics, viewing the whole situation as a mere inconvenience to him. Smaller parts are ably handled by John Ireland, Herbert Lom, Charles McGraw, and Woody Strode. On the other hand, Jean Simmons, while gorgeous, is rather one-note as Varinia, while John Dall and John Gavin are given one-dimensional characters and play them accordingly.Despite some flaws in its execution (too long, poor pacing, leaving out important battle scenes, undeveloped subplots involving supporting characters), "Spartacus"'s reputation as the "thinking-man's epic" is well-deserved. Skillfully weaving a tapestry of complicated political messages, well-rounded characters, and the usual pomp and spectacle expected of the genre, Kubrick's film, if not a masterpiece, is still a classic.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible Spoiler?This is a fine movie, no doubt about it. Douglas was performing as well as he ever did at this point in history, and it shows in the movie.However, while grand in scope and certainly original, Spartacus is still flawed. First of all, the story is vastly over-romanticized, a fact due most likely to Trumbo's dialogue (which has a surprisingly high level of tripe, unlike most of his works). Kubrick, for the most part is not in top form, although not bad. Certainly the scene inside the holding area before the gladiator fight is extremely well directed. Really (and I know others have mentioned this), the most important flaws is the romantic storyline, which, although gripping, is far too unrealistic and cinematized to be in a Kubrick movie.Nevertheless, a great film, and definitely worth at least one viewing.</fullReview>

Spartacus was born as a slave, but he dreams about being free.It is impressive with all the soldiers in this movie, it is before the time of computer technology, and the battles seem real.A problem with the movie is that some of the scenes are made in a studio, and it looks very fake. I don't understand why they have made these outdoor scenes inside a studio. Also other scenes in this movie look very fake, and I think that Spartacus loses one rating here.The overall impression is 7/10 - I think it would get 8/10 or maybe even 9/10 if Hollywood made a new updated version of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthwhile but uneven and poorly paced</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all the praise it's received, I really think Spartacus is a pretty flawed movie. Basically the film's scenes fall into two distinctly different categories. First, there are scenes following Spartacus as he suffers through gladiatorial school, rebels against his tormentors, falls in love, and leads a slave revolt that threatens to topple the power of the Roman empire. These segments succeed in everything they seek to achieve-- they entertain mindlessly and viscerally, and somehow manage to be exciting and predictable at the same time. We all know, for instance, that the mean gladiator instructor is eventually going to get what's coming to him, but we're actually surprised and a little shocked when he finally does. Add an effective score by Alex North, some occasionally touching human drama, and a massive battle sequence that clearly served as inspiration for Braveheart's massive festivals of destruction, and you've got one hell of a movie.But then someone decided that the film needed about an hour and forty-five minutes of flat, uninteresting, irrelevant, utterly useless political intrigue among the Roman heads of state. Spartacus is one seriously lengthy movie, and during the segments focusing on the senate and the military leaders you can't help but look at your watch a few times. I went along with these scenes at first, but after a while I lost track of all the confusing different political figures and what they were trying to accomplish. I sat trying to figure out who everyone was and how the intrigues affected the Spartacus revolt story and found myself dozing off. Having seen the film again, I now know who everyone is, but I still haven't figured out why all this scheming and plotting is important to the story at all. It's just dead weight that slows the movie down right when it should be reaching escape velocity, and I really wish most of it had been left in the editing room.I can only half recommend this film. A movie made up of just the Spartacus story along with only a few, essential scenes devoted to the Roman leaders would really have been a true classic. But instead we have a movie that just gets in its own way for just about half of its running time. Good thing Kubrick had more control over the rest of his films...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPARTACUS is a solidly produced historical epic of the time, but unlike EL CID, BEN HUR, THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, or THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, it doesn't hold up as well under scrutiny. This may owe more to a poor script than Stanley Kubrick, who stepped in for original director Anthony Mann during the production due to a fight with Kirk Douglas. Had it been the other way around with Mann been kept on and Douglas fired, I doubt this CLEOPATRA-style grandiose-yet-awkward film would have suffered. Actually it might have been much better and more cohesive as too much feels as though the director lacked interest and most of the best scenes are more Mann-ish than Kubick-esquire.The film starts off traditionally enough ? Spartacus is raised in the slave pits and makes a seamless transition to gladiator. Somewhere along the line he manages to figure out a sense of unbreakable moral virtue and never strays from it the rest of the film, thus making his character 1-dimensional and unfortunately pretty boring. Despite all this, the film is fine up until the standout slave break-out scene where Spartacus begins his rebellion and our plot lines diverge. The film then cuts back and forth from following Spartacus's army to the political rivalry between Laurence Olivier and Charles Laughton as Roman senators looking to profit from the whole mess. It turns out that these extremely charismatic villains are much more interesting to watch than bland Kirk Douglas, who is completely overshadowed with his "subdued Heston" performance and Christ-like central character.The film does highly benefit from many colorful supporting characters and great performances. Some highlights include: Peter Ustinov as a stressed-out slave trader, Woody Strode as a stoic gladiator who snaps, Herbert Lom as a Phoenician pirate (!), and Charles McGraw as a hateful veteran gladiator/instructor. John Ireland and Tony Curtis don't get to do much as Spartacus's right and left hand, though Curtis has a disturbing yet slightly amusing scene where Olivier (extremely well-dubbed by Anthony Hopkins for the reissue) attempts to seduce him. Jean Simmons (no, not one from "KISS") is quite restrained and bland as Douglas's love interest, though she isn't really given much to do either.Usually epics like this are redeemed by massive battle scenes but (despite some heavy gore for the time) the big show-stopping fight is not the best of the genre, owing some to Alex North's pedestrian score and Kubrick's apparent disinterest. All throughout you'll be wondering if Kubrick really had much input on this movie at all as it contains almost none of the touches he brought to his films before or after this one. Add to that the fact that this "true story" really oversimplifies, skimps, and downright lies in its complete dearth of historical accuracy, this film may actually make you dumber having watched it. SPARTACUS is just a big disappointment all-round, despite some great performances and costuming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Kubrick's Lesser Efforts, But Still.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is really interesting to see why this film, Spartacus was made in the first place. Obviously, historical epics were massively successful during this time period. But this particular film was made as an answer to 1959's Ben-Hur. In fact, it was Kirk Douglas's answer to that movie. Douglas was originally set to star in that movie, but Charlton Heston was cast over Douglas at the last minute, giving Douglas a feeling of bitter resentment. Both films have a very common theme: one man rising against the mighty Roman Empire to fight for their beliefs. I think Ben-Hur is the better film, but there is much to admire about this film.The movie, based off the popular novel by Howard Fast, was written by Dalton Trumbo. Trumbo is a well-known screenwriter, not only for his writing talent but because he was blacklisted because of his associated ties with communism. Kirk Douglas and director Stanley Kubrick stood strong behind their screenwriter and they publicly announced Trumbo wrote their movie, instead of Trumbo hiding behind a pseudonym. I found that to be a very courageous move on the part of Douglas and Kubrick, because that could have easily hurt the movie's chance at the box office. Luckily, the film was a box office smash and was very popular with the critics and the audience alike.This film has a Roman slave named Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) as the film's central character. Spartacus is held at a gladiatorial school ran by the amusing Lentulus Batiatus (Peter Ustinov). One day, he starts a revolt because he became angered at the notion of fighting to the death for the entertainment of spoiled women. This revolt soon spread all across Italy, where thousands of slaves joined the cause. Their plan was for Silesian pirates to transport them away from Italy to new lands. Meanwhile in Rome, Senator Gracchus (Charles Laughton) schemes to have the slaves taken down by a Roman garrison. After they failed, his mentor Marcus Licinius Crassus (Laurence Olivier) decides to lead his own army against Spartacus's slaves. Now Spartacus must face the might and power of the Roman army.Now compared to other epics of the time, I didn't like this film as much. It's certainly not a bad film, not even close to being so. The problem is the movie is a tad overlong and the story drags at certain moments. Some of the dialogue was cheesy too. By today's standards, the dialogue does not hold up very well and some of the words are laughingly bad. These complaints dragged the movie down, but only to a very small degree.There are many things I did admire about the film. There are plenty of majestic battle sequences and I liked them very much. I loved watching how the revolt started and I was cheering for Spartacus the entire time. I liked the political backdrop of the movie. Obviously, Spartacus uprising has a major political undertone which is revolution, a very appropriate theme. We also get to go behind the scenes and see how Roman politics influenced the war. It's a common fact that Roman senators always schemed against each other. The film also did something different, when compared to other epics. These other epics usually provide the normal happy ending. Well, that is not much the case with this film. If you follow history, you'll know the fate of Spartacus. But I'm not going to spoil anything for those who don't know. But the ending was very powerful and memorable. Speaking of powerful, my favorite scene was when a Roman general asked Spartacus's army where Spartacus was. Each soldier stood up and said, "I'm Spartacus." A very powerful scene showing the loyalty the slaves had for Spartacus and his cause.This film was the first big film of Stanley Kubrick's career. He was 30 when he directed the film, but he already had 4 feature films under his belt before this film. He masterfully directed the film, but it is publicly known that he disowned the film. It's his most straightforward film, and it was nominated for 6 Oscars (and won 4 of them). But Kubrick didn't like the film he made. He is one of my favorite directors, and you'll see more reviews of his films down the line.The film features fine performances from everyone involved. One of Kubrick's strengths is getting the very best out of his actors. Kirk Douglas portrayed Spartacus as a strong man driven by perseverance. Peter Ustinov, who won Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars for his role as Batiatus, does a wonderful job. He is consistently funny and he has a great screen presence whenever on screen. Laurence Olivier delivers a deep performance as Crassus, who is identified as bisexual in the movie. Jean Simmons does a good job as Varinia, the wife of Spartacus. She delivered some emotional performances. Just watch the ending of the movie to see why I say so. Also, keep an eye on a meaty supporting turn by Tony Curtis as Antoninus, the man who loves Spartacus like a brother. Finally, Charles Laughton is great as the soft-hearted scheming Roman Senator, Gracchus.Overall, I liked Spartacus, but I didn't really love it much. It runs into some boring stretches and parts of the movie such as the dialogue and costumes don't hold up well. But I liked how the film strived to be more historically accurate than previous epics. This is a nice film to learn something about Ancient Rome. The film does feature wonderful, bold performances, great direction, good production design, and spectacular battles. Not the greatest epics ever made, but good enough.My Grade: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>after so many years, it is one of impressive models for theme and important mark for its cast members. not for to be heroic or example of remarkable acting, for costumes, details, different ingredients of a blockbuster but for the courage to be different. Kirk Douglas is Spartacus and that is a certitude, Charles Laughton does a splendid role and Laurence Olivier is himself in the skin of Crassus, the fight scenes, the dialogs are admirable but in middle of a wave of super-productions, it propose not exactly a show but a vision about reality. so, it is not Ben Hur or another sparkle movie but instrument for a noble idea who represents triumph of idea and not the lovely end. a film who must see it after a period, like a good book reading. for its fresh air, for its powerful symbols, as homage for Kubrick genius and for remember of ideals value. a model. not only for cinema art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During the early reign of the ancient Roman Empire, heroic slave Kirk Douglas (as Spartacus) rebels by biting a master's ankle. He will be roundly punished. Believing Mr. Douglas' strength and determination make him a good candidate for gladiator duels, Douglas is saved from a starvation sentence by wily slave-trader Peter Ustinov (as Batiatus), who is often employed by Roman dictator Laurence Olivier (as Crassus). Douglas and Mr. Olivier are attracted to beautiful house slave Jean Simmons (as Varinia). Cracking under the pressure whip, Douglas escapes to begin a slave rebellion...In Rome, proudly promiscuous Republican Senator Charles Laughton (as Gracchus) and his handsome young cohort John Gavin (as Julius Caesar) jockey for political gain. Mr. Laughton and Mr. Ustinov are just plain fun to watch. Meanwhile, Ms. Simmons finds her way into Douglas' slave rebellion, as does Olivier's poetic juggler boyfriend Tony Curtis (as Antoninus). This further irks Olivier. It all climaxes in a battle between the forces representing Douglas and Olivier..."Spartacus" plays like the story of Jesus Christ without the supernatural elements, which is quite original for a biblical epic. While Douglas' character seems too good to be true, he carries off the characterization with star power. Olivier is strong, as expected. The restored "oysters and snails" scene is tame, and tinged with evil. Were they subtle - immoral? Also, Douglas' reaction to Ms. Simmons' delicate condition makes you wonder if he was expecting an immaculate conception. Or, maybe he was counting months. But Douglas, director Stanley Kubrick and Dalton Trumbo have a spectacular sweep.******** Spartacus (9/22/60) Stanley Kubrick ~ Kirk Douglas, Laurence Oliver, Jean Simmons, Charles Laughton</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I am Spartacus"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With it's epic sweep and impressively staged battle scenes, "Spartacus" earns it's reputation on the American Film Institute's Top One Hundred Films List, revised in 2007 to include a picture overlooked ten years earlier in the Institute's inaugural dedication. Perhaps what's even more compelling in the picture than the slave revolt led by the title character, portrayed by Kirk Douglas, are the political machinations and intrigue involving members of the Roman Senate who jockey for power in a manner that would make Congressional leaders envious today. At just over the half century mark since it's original release, the film is well recommended for it's fine characterizations and excellent cinematography, and due to it's subject matter, does not have a dated feel having been made in 1960.At the center of the story is Spartacus, the Thracian who leads a slave revolt against his Roman masters, and rises to become a skilled warrior and brilliant tactician. Interjecting a love interest for Spartacus in the person of Varinia (Jean Simmons) does not distract from the main thrust of the story, as their romantic love slowly builds over time, overcoming forced separations and the demands of duty. What the viewer must ultimately contend with is the defeat of the slaves, and the tearful reunion of Varinia and Spartacus at the finale, he crucified for his role in the uprising, she having earned her freedom via a hastily arranged bargain by Lentulus Batiatus (Peter Ustinov). At least Spartacus learns that his newly born son will grow up free, a theme constantly revisited and stressed over the course of the story.Though Stanley Kubrick is nominally credited as the director of "Spartacus", one would be hard pressed to discern an identifying trait of his film-making technique here. Compared to his highly stylized films like "2001:A Space Odyssey", "A Clockwork Orange" and "Barry Lyndon", this picture approaches a much more traditional action/adventure style, definitely influenced by star Douglas' participation on the production end. His own interpretation of the film's hero is commanding and straightforward, leaving no room for wavering in his singular quest. In one of cinema's most powerful and dramatic moments ever captured on screen, the warrior hero is given the highest honor when hundreds of his followers rise in defeat to declare "I am Spartacus"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another 10 stars from Kubrick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"When a freeman dies, he loses the pleasure of life. A slave loses his pain. Death is the only freedom a slave knows." Before the groundbreaking sci-fi, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Stanley Kubrick did an unforgettable 3-hour classic epic about a slave who inspired other men like him to fight against the indestructible Roman soldiers headed by Crassus to gain their freedom. Kirk Douglas (Paths of Glory) starred as the man who fought bravely for his life and love, Spartacus. The battle scenes were brilliantly executed. Spartacus's will to give freedom to his fellow men (though he didn't achieve it) and his model as a leader to them made him one of the best of all Kubrick's characters in his films. This film had had more dramatic scenes than all of Kubrick's films put together, including the last scene. It is truly hearth wrenching when Crassus offered them to live and to be slaves again if they bring him the body of Spartacus, but in surprise they all admitted that they were Spartacus, they rather be crucified till death than to be slaves again. Spartacus's character is unbreakable and undeniably strong. Crassus did kill Spartacus, but he didn't kill the legend of Spartacus. Perfect!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting Kubrick epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Epic tale of slave revolt against the Roman empire is grandly filmed by Kubrick with an all-star cast. Douglas is well cast in the title role, Simmons is beautiful as fellow slave, and Laughton is great as usual as a senator. Ustinov, however, steals the film in his Oscar-winning role as a slave trainer. Gavin is given above-the-title billing but barely has five minutes of screen time. However, the film is too long at nearly three and half hours and, like the director's Barry Lyndon, would have benefited from tighter editing. Some of the scenes in Rome specially could have been trimmed. The early scenes in the training camp are the best although the battle scene is impressive. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragic story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An illiterate non-Roman slave almost defeats the best armies Rome has at her disposal. The same slave, before his "break out," shares his cell with a naked female slave, in full view of his Roman guards. And a Roman general has some kind of relationship with his male slave - in a swimming pool. Now, what does all this have in common? Answer: I don't know! It's all in the movie, however. I don't care about Spartacus's love life nor do I care about whether the Roman general had a special relationship with his male slave. The story is about the revolt itself, which is one of the most famous slave revolts in history. It's about an army of slaves who are fighting for their freedom. But that's not enough material for Hollywood, so here comes the sex, as if that had any bearing on the revolt itself. Kirk Douglas offers a powerful, albeit somewhat hammy performance as the heroic Spartacus and Tony Curtis offers an interesting portrayal as the Greek slave who is Spartacus's adviser, friend and scribe - and his master's lover. Okay, Spartacus rebelled against Rome, but was it really necessary for Rome to crucify thousands of men just to find Spartacus? That is truly tragic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great film, I think is underrated. Even if its like 3 hours long, its worth the time to watch it. Although not as grandeur as Ben-Hur, it has some touching moments. One of the incredibly touching moments was when the Roman General asked who was spartacus, and man after man replied "I'm Spartacus". It just shows the love of Sparatacus's group and their devotion and willing to sacrifice themselves for him.The story is about a slave who gets trained to become a gladiator and fight. He later starts a rebellion and gets killed. Kirk Douglass was good as Spartacus There isn't too much blood and gore in this film. It mostly happens around the Gladiator Fight. A scene that disturbs me kind of is when the black slave (forget his name), refuses to kill Spartacus, and instead throws the spear at the mayor or governor (whoever was listening). Then the black slave jumps onto his platform, and then the mayor takes out a dagger and stabs the slave on the back, thus killing him. This was a touching part, and the black Slave basically sacrifices his life for him.A great film. Some parts can be boring, but is a great epic film similar to Ben-Hur and around the same time period.9/10 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For some reason, this was the one of the great 1950s-60s classics I had never seen, not to mention the one Kubrick classic I'd missed. But I finally watched it (letterbox, of course) on DVD and have to say, I see why it's considered a classic. From what I've heard and read of the true story of Spartacus, it strays a bit, and some of the stars (Douglas, Curtis) stay a little too well-groomed throughout the movie, but overall, it is an incredible film. It is more David Lean than Kubrick, but there are some excellent touches that remind you it is Kubrick (the snail-oyster thing, of course). And, as with any film in which I've ever seen him, Charles Laughton is just a bulbous, but overwhelming presence. He is in charge of virtually every scene he's in.</fullReview>

He only achieved something on an individual level. They say at the beginning it would take a further 2000 years for slavery to be abolished so it all seemed like a big waste of time.

		<shortDescription>Sprawling inconsistent epic movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 12/6/2014 -- 5 out of 10(Dir-Stanley Kubrick): Sprawling inconsistent epic movie directed by Stanley Kubrick with a very good performance by executive producer Kirk Douglas as Spartacus and good cinematography, but a story that has it's good parts and bad parts but not enough of the good to carry it over the top. The story is about a slave in Italy who starts an uprising that eventually rises up to fight against Rome itself. Douglas portrays the main character with passion and a performance where the camera just placed on his face tells his character's story. Jean Simmons portrays another slave that tweaks his romantic interests at a gladiator training facility, which he is transferred to after being bought by Peter Ustinov's character, that trains slaves and treats them like Gods until they are transferred to another facility where they have to fight to their death's for entertainment purposes for Roman citizens. Laurence Olivier's character, who is a wealthy influential person, visits the facility and forces the caretaker to prematurely do a couple of fights to the death including Spartacus. He survives, of course, but then starts the uprising upon hearing that Simmon's character is being sent to another location. This is where the film doesn't do a good job, in my opinion, because it makes it look like it all started over a lover's spat when obviously Spartacus had a bigger idea in mind. Douglas and Simmons carry on a very powerful screen romance but this overpowers the bigger story. He then commands the slave army to try and accomplish the task of freeing all the slaves in the whole of Italy. The political complexities in Rome and the conflict between the Roman characters actually slows down the movie. Olivier's character's motivations are never explored so the conflict between him and Spartacus is not a watchable piece of entertainment. There are some wonderful moments of cinematography especially the initial fight between the Romans and the slaves but these small moments don't sustain a full 3 hours plus. Not a worthless piece of entertainment, but not good enough to keep your full interest throughout the whole length of this long epic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Freedom is worth dying for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spartacus is about a group of slaves rebelling for their freedom and ending up crushed, crucified and used as a political tool for a Roman senator to seize dictatorship. The main external plot, the slave rebellion, falls to a failure. The failure tries to convey the point of the story: that freedom is worth dying for, and the failure leaves us with a hint of hope for the future as a baby of a slave has been born free.The external plot is pulled to a failure because of another external plot's rise: that of a Senator abusing the slaves cause to capture dictatorship powers. This adds another dimension to the futility of the slaves' cause: that all their lives added together is worth no more than a politician's expediency.The external plot's hope at the end is given by an internal arc of another senator who turns moral and saves the newborn baby of the slave.The main plot of the story is powerful mainly because it unexpectedly fails when you expect it to succeed: the hero is spared by a "Negro" fighter instead of winning as we expect, thus showing him the compassion that he would bring to his army of slaves in fighting for their freedom. The ultimate failure and crucifiction of all the slaves is also quite powerful in that you expect a journey like this to end positively (I didn't read the wikipedia article on Spartucus until afterwards).The supporting plots that involve the power struggle in the Senate are also surprisingly engaging.The story mainly falls flat on the arc (or lack thereof) of the main protagonist. Spartacus has no arc: he is a rebellious slave from beginning to end. Sure his rebellious nature gains greater purpose as he seeks to bring freedom to all the slaves, but that is established in Act 1 (the first hour). So for the next two Acts (the next two hours), the story's energy is sapped and stalled every second we spend watching Spartacus alone: building his army, getting a wife, building a bigger army, the slaves getting along harmoniusly, Spartacus and the slaves dancing in the sunset etc... These scenes are a complete waste of time since it doesn't come with any turning point on any plot. Maybe audiences in the 60s expect these filler moments to go to the bathroom during this 3 hour marathon, or maybe the female lead demanded Kubrick shoot her with fuzzy focus to make her look good and had a contractual limit on the amount of screen time she got, but it does no service to the story. With these scenes cut you can probably have a powerful film in a compact 90 minutes.Tangential thoughts below...My theory is since the story was produced by and starred Kirk Douglas, who brought Kubrick in after a disagreement with the previous director (see wikipedia), maybe the actor had too much say in the storytelling. So much so that the director and editor couldn't leave the boring bits on the cutting room floor. Or maybe the producers wouldn't let army marching scenes be cut since they paid so much money for so many extras to fill the screen. Reminds me of the big boring fight at the end of the first Pirates of the Caribbean that ruined a great movie: no way the producers would shorten those scenes after millions were already spent on the computer graphics. Maybe that's why the Pixar films are so great and tightly cut: its all computer graphics anyway and they all cost the same amount of money to render so cut away. So this leads me to think its a good thing for Director's to have final cut. But then again, a lot of these extended director's cut versions basically put a lot of boring filler back in. So I guess its only a good thing for "good" Director's to have final cut, and they should only be allowed to make one cut, not a short one and (guaranteed worse) long one.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am not Spartacus.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some very impressive shots of Kirk Douglas's army of ex slaves and ex gladiators and their followers sweeping across the Italian countryside like a wave of army ants. This is Stanley Kubrick's first Big Movie. It largely succeeds as entertainment -- complete with Entr'acte -- because its colorful, splashy, and Kubruck is still in touch with his human roots. He was soon to be absorbed by technology as a food particle is absorbed by an amoeba.In brief, Douglas is Spartacus who, in the years before Christ, was a slave trained as a gladiator. He led a revolt and marched his army to Bridisium (now Brindisi) where ships were supposed to be waiting to spirit him and his thousand followers out of the country to freedom. The pirates who were to man the ships were bought out by Spartacus's enemies in Rome, leaving Spartacus trapped between two or three Roman armies led by the nasty and determined patrician Lawrence Olivier. Spartacus's men put up a good fight but they lose and all are crucified. That's why I don't watch the last ten minutes or so. Before his own torture and death, Spartacus is forced to kill the harmless Tony Curtis, his best friend. And when Spartacus is strung up there, his girl friend, Jean Simmons, looks up at him and begs him to die. That, I don't need.In fact, with the exception of two scenes -- the exhilarating rebellion at the gladiator school and the pastoral love scene at the pond between Douglas and Simmons -- it's pretty tragic all around. It's as if John Brown had succeeded in freeing the slaves in the South, then went around looting plantations, having a good time, and causing all sorts of discomfort until, finally, Washington sent the army down, led by Robert E. Lee, and crushed him. I don't know how closely the story matches historical reality but, if I remember, the march to Brindisi wasn't all wine and roses. Spartacus had a falling out with his friend and colleague Crixus and the group split up, didn't they? There's a hilarious conversation between Olivier and his body servant, Curtis, while Olivier is in the bath. It was cut from the first release print but has been restored. "Do you like oysters?", queries Olivier. "When I can get them, Master," replies Curtis, who is tenderly washing Olivier's back. "Do you like snails?" "No, Master." "You see, it's a matter of taste. I myself enjoy both oysters and snails." (Something like that.) It's all code for homosexuality, which was not exactly unknown, let alone condemned as immoral, in Ancient Rome. As a matter of fact, without any particular interest in the subject, I noticed among the principals in the cast one who was thoroughly committed to snails, one who apparently enjoyed both snails and oysters, and one who preferred oysters although he'd tried snails at least once. I can't speak for the supporting players or the thousand extras.Douglas does okay by the heroic but unlucky Spartacus. Jean Simmons is a nice lady but, once out of adolescence in Dickens and Shakespeare, she seemed mundane. Woody Strode, of all people, has a marvelous scene. (Strode's character, a gladiator, has hardly any lines.) He's sitting in the bull pen with Douglas. The two men, who are fellow slaves, are about to be forced to fight to the death for the enjoyment of a couple of really slimy aristos. We can hear the clang of swords from the arena outside and the gasps of the crowd. Strode and Douglas don't say a word. Douglas is biting his tongue and staring at Strode, and Strode slowly looks sideways at him with the sweetest, gentlest, most enigmatic smile you can imagine. It only last a minute but it's the best minute that Woody Strode ever committed to celluloid.The winner of tonight's prize of a whole Smithfield ham must be divided between Lord Lawrence Olivier, as the rabid Patrician who wants to be dictator, and Peter Ustinov as the comical and servile brown noser -- "Oh, yes, whatever you wish, Your Pulchritude." The two fight like gladiators to upstage one another.According to Kirk Douglas, who was Executive Producer, there was some argument over who should get writing credit on the movie. Dalton Trumbo had, after all, been blacklisted during the McCarthy era. Did they dare give Trumbo screen credit. Maybe not, but then who would get it? Should they invent a fake name? Kubrick, in all seriousness, piped up with, "Use my name. I'll take the credit." Douglas was disgusted.The score by Alex North is loud and martial, except for a saccharine love them associated with Spartacus and Varinia, but it's uninspired. I'd have preferred the borscht that was always served up by Dmitri Tiomkin -- those cow bells and flatulent trombones -- but North's score is an improvement over the ominous chords of Miklos Rozsa.It's a decent movie with some fine scenes in it but, Lordy, it's depressing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>more Kirk Douglas than Stanley Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never mind the supposed parallels between the slave rebellion led by Kirk Douglas against the Roman Empire and the embryonic civil rights movement; the real virtue of this pre-biblical epic today is the nostalgia it holds for the Golden Age of wide-screen entertainment. The film looks fabulous but, rose-colored memories aside, it never was much of a classic. Instead of following the gloriously trashy example set by Cecil B. DeMille, it tries (too hard) to give the sand-and-sandal genre a token measure of highbrow prestige, not an easy task with a cast dressed in togas. But the script is far too dull (to say the least) and except for some lively battle scenes the film moves at a snail's pace. Thank goodness for Peter Ustinov, who alone among the cast of thousands seemed to have enough wisdom not to take it all too seriously. When it was re-released in 1991 the film included a previously cut scene of patrician/pederast Laurence Olivier bathing with body servant Tony Curtis, and also restored the original pre-credit orchestral overture, which added nothing to the film except length, the one feature it already has plenty of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Undeniably Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spartacus has come to be regarded as something of an unknown entity in the Kubrick canon. He was an auteur who always claimed a writing credit; so on the surface this Kirk Douglas-produced Roman epic might appear to be a simple vanity project for its star after his failure to land the part of Ben-Hur.But Kubrick was clearly able to imprint his personality on the finished product: lengthy tracking shots and static long shots framed like classical paintings; meticulous lighting and chessboard floors. And not every director would pick up on screenwriter Dalton Trumbo's intelligent irony and subtext.Peter Ustinov has spoken of the lack of a Christ figure, and I would say this is to the movie's advantage. How easy it would have been to present Spartacus, self-proclaimed leader of the common man, as a figure to be deified, and the fawning poor as his disciples. But that would have cheapened the message, and patronised his followers to the extent that they become effectively imprisoned once more by blind allegiance. Indeed, religion is rarely mentioned at all; if it had been then the already murky politics would be muddied further and we would be watching a 5-hour cut.The cast is a colourful bunch. Douglas exudes a fierce and believable masculinity as the titular titan. Classical quality is provided by Laurence Olivier (Crassus), Charles Laughton (Gracchus) and the peerless Ustinov, whose Batiatus is the perfect rodent, snivelling somewhere between the stricken slave-world and the sinister senate. (A similar but arguably richer character than, say, Gladiator's Proximo.) The casting of Tony Curtis is less successful: his broad Bronx accent and dark heavy features aren't well suited to Antoninus' doe-eyed, silver-tongued minstrel.Speaking of heavy, Alex North's bombastic score is deafening; triumphant or obnoxious depending on your ear drums. (North would later commission an unused score for Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, before his work was replaced by memorable pieces from Strauss, Ligeti et al.) One could argue that Jean Simmons' Varinia is little more than a pretty plot device for much of the movie - a foil for Spartacus' rampant rage; proof that he is not merely D-Fens in a loincloth - but she comes alive in the final scenes, providing some much-needed hope in the devastating climactic meeting.Intelligent, broad of scope, cynical, horrifying and beautiful: this is truly a Kubrick war movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spartacus is a documentary about one man, a slave of some sort, and his struggle for respect and freedom. 'Why do you mock us?' he shouts 'We are men too. All we want are the same rights and privileges as everyone else'. Unfortunately for Spartacus, him and his friends are quite dirty, and in the olden days that was not good. I'm not sure when this was made- the clothes are obviously quite old, and there aren't any cars, but I'm a bit confused as all films before 1977 were black and white (with the odd exception). I'm pretty sure there were cars in 1976, maybe just not in the country this was filmed. Either way, it's a stark reminder of how lucky we are today as dirty people have the same rights as the rest of us, and some even go on to fame and riches after showing their dirt on 'reality TV shows'.The filmmaker follows the life of Spartacus from his days as a famous boxer- 500 fights all wins by KO is quite a record, even by today's standards. We see some stock footage of his most famous fights- beware, some of these are quite gruesome and all the more scary as we know they were real. I would have liked some interviews with the fighters and the managers, and perhaps some fans, but alas no. Maybe this will be included in future video releases. After a period of civil war or something- journalists weren't allowed into the country so about 10 years of Sparky's life are missing, we find our hero has lost his job and his money like many did, and has now resorted to slavery. 'Shine your sandals, ma'am?' we hear him cry. 'Scrub out yer barn, squire?' It's a sad story of how the great can fall. I though the documentary would end here, perhaps with a closing line about the futility of dreams, and that even great success can come crumbling down in an instant. But no, something surprising happened, which showed me the true quality of the man. Sparktickus decided he wanted to reclaim his former glory; he wasn't ready for the scrap heap just yet; he would be great again and if the government tried to stop him he would cause a rebellion. He gathers his former boxing friends as well as other slaves (presumably to make up numbers) and attempts to form a new boxing/wrestling/mixed martial arts league. I thought again that the documentary would end, with Sparky set up as a hero, an inspiration to all slaves and faded celebrities, perhaps with a closing line about the greed and desire of celebrity culture, but also the human touch and what even the smallest mind can accomplish with a strong will. Another surprise- it goes on, and the King decides that he has had enough of this little rebellion. He sends out all his armies to find Sparky and it is at this point the filmmakers really should have stepped in. They could have brought him and his friends to America and fame after the success of the film. But no, they lazily stand by and watch as our friends are literally ripped to shreds, and their heads put on posts down the motorway. The camera fades to black.This is one of the most stark endings I've ever seen, and of course as we all know it actually happened. I'm torn as to how I should feel about this film. Yes, the film makers do a great job of showing Sparky's life and how terrible people can be, but they went too far. Surely they could have avoided any pretentious nonsense about 'the camera showing truth' and 'not interfering with nature'. I mean these weren't spiders we were dealing with, they were people! A good documentary, but very long, and considering the ending you may want to stop an hour before the end and pretend it all ended OK.Favourite scene: When Sparky is training another young fighter by running along the beach. The camera fades to slow motion as they cross the line, and then jump into the surf in their shorts and frolic about, flicking water etc. Poignant.</fullReview>

Kubrick was in fact hired to direct it, and you can tell: it seems more like something that Cecil B. DeMille would have directed.That said, it was actually pretty good. The true story of Thracian slave Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) who led a revolt against the Roman Empire never drags itself; on the contrary, you want it to continue. With a supporting cast of Laurence Olivier, Jean Simmons, Tony Curtis, Charles Laughton and others, this is what sword-and-sandal movies are all about.

		<shortDescription>The gladiators revolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are several versions of Spartacus'life, and this drama was made based on the story written by Howard Fast seconded by the famous cinema writer Dalton Trumbo, blacklisted by the House Un-American Activities Committee, in the early 50s in Hollywood for his left wing ideas. For a film made in 1960, this is a very educative material and also very provocative for its time. The cast better cannot be, Kirk Douglas and Tony Curtis together with the long-experienced and efficient British actors/actress as Charles Laughton, Laurence Olivier, Jean Simmons and Peter Ustinov, simply the best. Probably someone like the Russian director/actor Serguei Bondarchuk (War and Peace, 1968) would have prepared several sequels of this film, but Stanley Kubrick and his group opted for a long film, everything in one shot. Due to its length probably Kubrick could not include some more historical facts. For example, the film starts showing Spartacus already as a slave, when he was first a shepherd in Tracia, then became a soldier of Roman army, he deserted and became slave, and later was sold to an school of gladiators. These sequences are not shown or were not prepared in the film. I do not know either whether Fast included these facts in his book. The other thing is that Spartacus moved with his army up to the Alpes then came back to the South looking for the sea, this was not shown. Crassus had three battles against Spartacus, and he was defeated by Spartacus in the first two. The film only shows the final one. Finally Spartacus body was never found after the final battle, and here you know what the end is. In any case, the material is excellent, useful for everybody to know a bit of history and how things went in despotic Rome at that time. In addition, acting of Charles Laughton as Gracchus and Laurence Olivier as Crassus were certainly the best. The rest did a very good job, but Laughton and Olivier, who were not friendly at all among themselves, excelled in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even today it is hard to visualise the scale of this epic or the efforts that went into its production. With all the computer generated effects of todays so-called epics eg Gladiator something stands out about this bench mark film. That Kirk Douglas did not win best actor oscar award for this film probably says more about the judging criteria of the day than it does about Douglas,s performance for when you stack it against that of Russell Crowes in gladiator what you are really seeing is the master &amp; apprentice. There is something about the raw boned straight from the hip performance by Douglas that sets it apart from the rest of the so-called sword &amp; sandal epics both past &amp; present. I consider the fact that Douglas did not win an oscar for that role is perhaps the single biggest injustice in the history of the oscars especially when one considers that the film was largely his own in more ways than. I have never seen such an example of an actor carrying a film as it were on his back as without douglas the film would never have worked.

		<fullReview>First off, any movie with Olivier and Laughton in two major roles has to have some redeeming value. They are two of the finest actors I've seen on screen and they lit it up in Spartacus. Yes, Gladiator ripped off Spartacus in many ways and then turned it into a melodramatic circus. For the critics of this film, you have to give it the credit of being realistic unlike Braveheart and Gladiator which were poorly done.This isn't a real Stanley Kubrick film so don't go into it thinking you're going to see something innovative and ground-breaking. This is just a movie. Kubrick inherited the movie and the script mid-production (I think the story goes) and wasn't super pleased with the result of this film. Too many people were pulling him too many ways. I missed the homosexuality references, but that's probably because they were disguised and I wasn't looking for them. Sadly, I'll probably never watch it again. Very long film, but worth a viewing. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Casts You're Ever Going to See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spartacus (1960) **** (out of 4) Born a slave and trained as a gladiator, Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) leads a revolt against the Roman Empire and the evil Marcus Crassus (Laurence Olivier) so that slavery can come to an end and his men granted their freedom. This story has become rather legendary due to the power of the film itself and even if you're not a movie buff there are so many sequences in this film that everyone knows. Of course, the biggest is the "I'm Spartacus" sequence and while this is a beautifully mounted scene, there are many others that are just as powerful. In this era of Hollywood it seems an epic was coming out every few months and it's my opinion that this here is among the greatest ever made. I mean, just take a look at the cast, which includes not only legends Douglas and Olivier but also Jean Simmons, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov, John Gavin, Tony Curtis, John Ireland, Nina Foch, Herbert Lom and even Woody Strode has a brief part. So many brilliant actors in one film certainly makes SPARTACUS stand apart but there are many other things that really help this.The epics of the silent era really weren't any different than those made in the 50s and 60s and there really no different than what's being made today. They contain great battle scenes and SPARTACUS is full of them. You can tell where the money was spent as we get thousands of extras and it's really amazing to watch a film with all of these people in real costumes and acting out these battles. One can't help but wonder what producer Douglas and director Kubrick would have to do in order to get everything ready to shoot. These mammoth battle sequences really are jaw dropping and especially the final ones and wait till you check out the burning logs that are rolled down the hill. One wonders how no one was injured or killed. Even the earlier stuff in the gladiator school is perfectly handled as we get some great battles to the death between slaves.Most epics featured these great battle scenes but to me what really makes SPARTACUS stand out are the brilliant performances and the incredibly touching personal stories. The love story to most films kill them because they're often not needed but the work between Douglas and Simmons is beautifully done and it features some of the greatest writing in Dalton Trumbo's career. The fireworks between the two stars really come across on the screen and you can't help but feel their passion as well as their love for one another as they try to gain their freedom. Both actors do a marvelous job as does the rest of the supporting players. Curtis probably wasn't the greatest choice for his role but he gives it his all and delivers a fine performance. Laughton is so lovable in his scenes and his final are incredibly touching. Ustinov is the master that he's always shown to be. Olivier delivers one of the greatest performances from any epic and he also makes this character one of the most hated in film history. If you can feel the love between Douglas and Simmons then you can feel the cold evil that is Olivier.There are a few problems with the film with one being its 197-minute length, which is a tad too long. One other problem is that the music score is often used in places where it would have been better left silent with the actors doing what they're there to do. I think there were a few too many times when the "LOUD" and "BANG" of the score took away from what was on the screen. The one objection that I've read that I'm highly against is that Kubrick wasn't the right man for this picture. I've heard some call him a "director for hire" on this and that he really couldn't deliver "his type of movie" but I find these comments laughable. This is very much a Kubrick picture as you can see that in the style and without him who knows how these movie would have turned out. I've heard many people say Kubrick was a cold filmmaker and that he had no heart but I think the final thirty-minutes of this film proves that wrong. The final sequences are so incredibly powerful and emotionally rewarding that one can't help but be brought to tears by their beauty. SPARTACUS, with its terrific screenplay, brilliant acting and strong direction really stands out in a crowded field of epics.</fullReview>

The documentary Trumbo suggests that the "I am Spartacus!" scene was meant to dramatize the solidarity of those accused of being Communist sympathizers during the McCarthy Era who refused to implicate others, and thus were blacklisted.Spartacus is a long, well-made, downbeat epic, rather talky in its first half, but with deeper than usual characterization and several bravura sequences. This is about as good as the sword-and-sandals genre got in this era. The original score for the film was composed and conducted by six-time Academy Award nominee Alex North.

Stanley Kubrick is a winning director though, his films stand out from everyone Else's. he's a visionary and musical genius. i love the camera angles and the colours he uses in the sets, remarkable. he can also bring out the best in actors. i think Spartacus does deserve 4 Oscars because it is a well made piece of cinema with a strong cast of characters.

		<shortDescription>Swords 'n' Sandals In Action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although a little wobbly in its production here and there, on account of the conflicting 'professional' interpretations between Douglas and Kubrick; this movie has certainly stood the test of time.Considered pretty bold in its day for the graphic representation of Roman cruelty, some of the scenes still hold up very well and help underline the slaves' motive for rebellion.There's a host of big names from that age of movie-making. Douglas has invariably played firebrands of one stamp or another and here he fits the sandals of Spartacus as well as any. His full and extensive remit of acting skills are put on show. Tony Curtis as Antoninus, his close friend, is rather less convincing; he doesn't do 'serious' quite so well as comedy.Ustinov bumbles along as Batiatus, owner of the gladiator school. Olivier brings a stately gravitas to Crassus, Jean Simmons is a scrawny but adequate Varinia. However, I believe the best part is played by chubby Charles Laughton, who is absolutely believable as the crafty, but basically decent political manipulator, Gracchus. In a script that is unusually intelligent for the genre, he definitely gets the best lines, and delivers them with convincing panache. He steals every one of his scenes, even those including Olivier.Indeed, you'd be hard-pressed to find a bum role here, with reliable Woody Strode playing a doomed gladiator stricken by misguided loyalties, and a cameo from excellent Herbert Lom as the fixer Levantus.The political squabbling is actually more entertaining than the fighting. Let's face it; we've seen hoards of men in a sword-wielding scrum so often it's almost a period cliché.But the set-piece deployment of the Roman army is wonderfully realised. I don't know how many extras were engaged in this all-too-briefly observed spectacle, but I've never seen an army look so believable or so bloody intimidating. We watch from the slave perspective at each separate legion marching steadfastly forward with lock-step precision over the rolling meadows, just as they must have done during the centuries of Roman rule, indomitable, irresistible, suppressing everything in their wake. And then a second army is seen in the distance, following on from the first. It required extraordinary visceral courage to stand in the face of this expert machine.When Laughton isn't amply demonstrating the decadence that is the other face of Rome, Olivier adds additional icing with an attempt to seduce Antoninus. In a sly metaphor, choices in food are compared to tastes in sexual appetite that could be an object lesson for sophisticated homosexuals the world over, and must have been astonishingly daring for 1960. Once again, the extremely clever script shines through.There are many other excellent set-pieces and situations. Camera work is as expansive as widescreen production demands, but there is plenty of subtle intimacy too, with well-judged lighting throughout. In general, I like the music; though the martial bombast of Roman anthems tend to batter your eardrums into submission. There's a nice 'romantic' theme for the scenes depicting Spartacus and Varinia.The more recent 'Gladiator' added absolutely nothing to the 'conflict of loyalties' story, or the sword 'n' sandals genre, except - as one might expect - in the CGI department. Quite the contrary; I thought it inferior in every other way. Certainly the latter's script couldn't hold a candle to this one. And come to that; neither could the lead roles.If you haven't already; give 'em a whizz and see what you think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Refreshingly dark epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The presence of two directors is quite noticeable, as is the lack of Kubrickian influence on the script, as it's almost like a tale of two movies. There's the dark, depressing, realistic Kubrick stuff (the scene right before the first fight to the death, where the gladiators hear the nobles discussing trivial matters, is right out of Paths of Glory), and then there's the sappy, melodramatic, happy Hollywood stuff (those terrible montages of life in the slave camp). Luckily Kubrick wins out (for the most part) and the end is suitably dismal.As with Paths of Glory, there's a lot of ideas thrown about dealing with the distinction between the higher and lower classes, and that couldn't be more obvious than with the political maneuvering of Crassus and Gracchus nearly outweighing the noble plight of Spartacus. Kubrick also likes three-way conflicts (Jack/Danny/the Overlook in The Shining, US/Russia/Ripper in Dr. Strangelove) and Spartacus and Gracchus uniting (in a way) to beat their common enemy is symptomatic of that. That stuff, along with that horribly depressing end with all the slaves crucified along the road, is vintage Kubrick.Unfortunately there's all that cheesy Hollywood stuff about hope and glory and freedom that really feels at odds with the realistic epic that the rest of the film is trying to put forth. The ill-fated romance, Spartacus' many speeches, indeed the entire epic battle all fall in line with this. Of course, we also get that great "I'm Spartacus!" scene, so maybe it's not all bad.The sexual innuendo and political drama which lie just under the surface are quite refreshing, and really distinguish this film from, say, Ben-Hur. It seems to me to be an epic more concerned with art than financial success, at least for the most part, and I really dug that. It's not perfect, but it's not mediocre like so many epics of the time, either.Definite recommend, especially for Ben-Hur fans so they can learn what life is really like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Spartacus" has many scenes of note, but it unevenly paced. The first segment of the film shows Sparatcus' life as a slave. This part is engaging as we see the animosities that develop between Spartacus and the slave-masters and the camaraderie that develops between the slaves. The second part of the film, showing the aftermath of slave revolt, starts with a number of tedious scenes as the slaves slowly formulate their plans. Occasionally Herbert Lom's character breaks up the tedium in the slave camp with his dealings with Spartacus, but usually seeing the politics and machinations on the Roman side was more interesting. All of this culminates in a well-paced and well-shot final conflict followed by a strong ending.Kirk Douglas is solid as Spartacus, who turns from difficult slave to revolt leader with conviction. Jean Simmons is also excellent and strong as the female lead, Varinia. Peter Ustinov is notable as the somewhat timid yet resourceful slave trader. Charles Laughton is perfect as the devious Gracchus and Laurence Olivier gives an intricate and compelling performance as Crassus."Spartacus" has a number of memorable scenes as performances, but is inconsistently paced and contains a number of tedious scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spartacus is unique among Kubrick films in that he was never meant to direct it, and he had little influence over it once it reached post-production, something which did not suit Kubrick or his style. As such it's a slightly botched, uneven work.Very little of Kubrick's style ? which was actually still developing at the time ? remains intact. It does often look like a typical studio job with the director being just a cog in the crew. You can still see Kubrick's sense of contrasting high and low with location. Just as he showed complete changes of tone between the trenches and palatial officer's quarters in Paths of Glory (1957), he here compares the ornate, spacious Roman palaces with the dingy, underground gladiator's cells. In fact, the films best moments come in the first hour set at the gladiatorial school.Taking the few known facts about the real historical figures concerned, Dalton Trumbo has woven a good story, particularly with the complex rivalries and loyalties between the Romans. The dialogue however is pretty poor. Kubrick dismissed the script as being too full of stupid morality, and he was right. There are lots of impassioned speeches about dying free, much of which borders on cliché. While it's a welcome change from the piety of the religious epics of the 1950s, this deal with making such a big thing of the hero being perfectly noble and principled can be almost as bad.In spite of the stellar acting line-up, there are only really three acting performances I really like ? the trio of English Romans. Laurence Olivier and Charles Laughton are both ideally suited to their roles as Crassus and Gracchus respectively. However best of all is my all time favourite actor ? Peter Ustinov who, as usual steals the show as the gladiatorial school owner Batiatus. Apparently Ustinov wrote most of his own dialogue, which explains why he gets all the best lines. Or perhaps it's just his deadpan delivery which gives lines like "Most exciting. I tingle," such brilliance.The musical score is instantly forgettable. In fact I even forget who composed it. Kubrick does make good use of it though, editing to the beat in two key scenes ? when Spartacus and Draba are waiting to fight each other, and in the build up to the final battle ? building up tension well.There are quite a few moments of sloppiness in Spartacus. There are plot holes big enough to drive a convenient character arc through. There is a hideous backdrop which makes what was supposed to be quite a warm, poignant scene look silly. I'll also point out rather smugly that, if you watch closely in the scene of the gladiators rebelling at the school, Spartacus actually defeats no less than four fully armed Roman guards using nothing more than a wicker basket. Mind you, it's cinema. You can overlook these things, sit back and enjoy.So, it's no small wonder that after Spartacus Kubrick moved to the UK and ensured he had complete control of all his pictures from thereon. You would never guess that it was the product of one of cinema's most stylised and meticulous directors. When there are moments of brilliance they are rarely a result of directorial style. It's not a bad film ? it has just enough good elements to hold it all together. But on the flipside it has far too many bad elements to make it a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, a pretty good film, I thought that Douglas had too many scenes of him just staring into the distance with that look of determination. I get it, he's determined. When I saw that Kubrick had directed this, I was a bit surprised at the final result. There was nothing that amazing about the camera work here. Some scenes, such as the large migration sequences amazed me not because of the cinematic power, but because there were a hell of a lot of extras. The musical score was weak, the same 4 or five notes played over and over again. I don't think xylophones have a place in that kind of score. I know I seem to be tearing down the film. I understand it is a classic and respect it for it's sheer magnitude but don't think I would ever watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great film. Kirk Douglas gave the performance of his career. Kubrick was very adept at filming Douglas's face...no joke - Kirk Douglas can convey deep feelings and moods without uttering a word and that chiseled mug of his is one powerful cinematic tool. Douglas's grimacing face, bright white teeth flashing, elicits more drama than Shakespeare ever could. When the lighting casts shadows accentuating all the angles and lines of that face and the piercing eyes.I tell ya, no other director utilized Douglas this way before or since. Kubrick was a genius. The first half of the film was filled with tension as Spartacus was tormented by the gravely-voiced trainer, Marcellus. When Spartacus finally snapped, the rebellion was swift and brutal.This came shortly after the gladiator match between Woody Strode and Douglas - the best gladiator fight ever filmed. All the conflicts and nuances of human behavior, whether from slaves or Roman gentry, seemed very authentic. Kubrick was able to depict the gathering of the slave army and how they trained and sustained themselves. Douglas was very charismatic and pulled it off well as a leader to whom thousands would follow. Olivier was flawless as the hateful Roman general, Crassus. Tony Curtis, Jean Simmons,Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov - all put in great performances. I would have liked to have seen several more sustained battles - they were few and much too brief in this film. The climactic battle scene was very powerful; I wish it had lasted longer. I also wish the film was more historically accurate - the true story of Spartacus was even more amazing and brutal. Two things that were flawed in the film were a lack of the development of some of the minor characters..they seemed like stock 1950-1960 cookie cutter characters. Also,the fake outdoor scenes filmed under a studio roof were out of place in such a spectacle - they were more suited for a TV show like Bonanza - come to think of it, this practice of having phony trees, rocks, and ground instead of actually filming outdoors ruined many TV shows and movies of the 50's and 60's. Anyway, Douglas's performance and Kubrick's direction made this film a classic. The soundtrack music was excellent - very original and it added a lot to the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The great director cannot save this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spartacus is one of those movies that's wonderful to look at, but completely lacking in real substance or gravity. As historical entertainment it beats anything on the History channel or for that matter most epics of its type. The production is excellent, some of the best matte work I've ever seen and some very nice costumes and settings.Then you have a cast which includes some of the great names in film -- perhaps gathered under the concept that the best way to simulate the Roman Empire is to stuff your film with venerable British stage actors. Here we get a U.K. all-star team including Charles Laughton, Lawrence Olivier, Peter Ustinov (and Herbert Lom for bench strength). I thought of the trio the best work was done by Laughton, whose character has surprising dimension. Ustinov does some nice work as well, and I really enjoyed the scene with he and Laughton at the end where they discuss Ustinov's newfound dignity. "Add some courage to that dignity" urges Laughton's character. I think Olivier's character was misconceived, and the attempt to give his character dimension by having him fall in love with Spartacus' wife (Jean Simmons, the female U.K representative, saddled with some of the film's most ridiculous dialog and scenes) falls flat for me. It's not a case of poor acting by Olivier but of poor writing. Kirk Douglas is all swagger as Spartacus. He's a poorly developed character. I can't imagine what they were thinking by giving us a central character in this story of corruption and intrigue who was basically a saint. The character is nothing but a walking Romanesque imitation of Abraham Lincoln, all speeches about human dignity and freedom. He's given a girl to sleep with but it's beneath his dignity to make love to her with the Romans watching -- as if Spartacus would be aware of any other way to do it. Basically the character is a walking anachronism; he's like a 20th Century union organizer dropped into the Roman world.Most of the blame for this film's failure should fall on Douglas' and Trumbo's heads. It's well documented that the director, Stanley Kubrick, wanted to change some of the dialog but he was not allowed to do so. Perhaps Douglas mistakenly thought that allowing script alterations would dull the glory that he hoped to gain by bringing Trumbo back to Hollywood as a reclaimed "genius". Presumably Douglas' courage in embracing the blacklisted author was supposed to mirror his character's saintly pro-freedom stance. This film emerges as a fable instead of a real story, because no intelligent person could possibly believe that Spartacus had no desire for revenge against the Romans in his heart and that he had somehow sidestepped 1500 years of social and political philosophy to come to a post-Lockian understanding of the essential equality of man. Yet it takes itself far too seriously in the way it presents its history to be acceptable as a historical fable.Compared to other "epics" of the sword and sandal variety, this is a good film. But that's not saying much IMHO. Compared to other films by Stanley Kubrick, this is an awful film. The only parts that even feel like a Kubrick movie are the battle scenes where you can see Kubrick's love of geometry and strategy in the overhead shots of the columns and phalanxes moving across the field. The gladiator scenes are also well directed though less distinctly "Kubrickian". But there are about a half dozen dialog scenes between Douglas and Simmons and I think this is where the film really bogs down -- although there are other problems such as Tony Curtis' poorly developed poet character. The scene with Olivier and Curtis is just embarrassing. We have this erotic image coupled with wretched dialog about how the Roman likes to eat snails AND oysters. The conversation is played as if it should be subtle but the dialog would only seem subtle to a 10 year old.I think out of all the muck and drek that this movie presents, the over-arching issue that I have with it is that it presents a morally simplified universe, yet pretends to be morally complex. The film presents absolutely no doubts about the moral righteousness of Spartacus' violent crusade and shows us former slaves who are so docile and get along so well that at times you feel like you're watching a beach party movie instead of a movie about a pre-Christian slave rebellion. One longing for the kind of moral ambiguity found in classic epic films like "Lawrence of Arabia" or Kubrick's own "Barry Lyndon" will be sorely disappointed. This movie is just "pomp and circumstance" -- well done as an action film, but with only the appearance of depth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Acting this wooden deserves some laughter! Even Olivier fell into the trap, though he mostly avoided it. This stuff was just pap for an audience that the producers held in contempt. A picture this bad wouldn't get much serious coverage today ... though Brave Heart did, so ... There was some very interesting cinematography, in setting up the battle scenes with the Legions, but on the whole, this picture was a waste of time, I thought. It was an early example of Kubrick's work, which has left me quite unmoved, quite amazed that he was considered a significant director. To me, his stuff is over the top and simplistic and this film is representative.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Holy Schla-moly. I can automatically understand why Kubrick disowned this project. There is enough "stupid moralizing" to make you gag. I know the amount of flak I'm going to get from these reviews, but I don't care.This is your only spoiler warning..."Spartacus" probably lost its impact, even the gay subtext and blood, by the mid-80s. By then the material was already spreading through the system.Kubrick (like Scott) never made a movie because he thought characters were interesting or because a plot sounded keen; those two elements are always the first thing that dates a film. Heck, James Stewart movies were better structured than this. That's first-level filmmaker work.Kubrick prefers thinking in a visual world where he can explore and shift perspectives. Kubrick managed to do what he wanted in 'Strangelove' and '2001.' That's when he changed from studio slave to independent thinker. Interestingly enough, this and 'Troy' suffer from the exact same problems: 44 years and some people still don't learn.The sets are as fake as 'Gladiator''s (and this really hurts after the dynamic 'Paths of Glory'), but the narrative is plain and dull. Scott kept a similar perspective, but was not concerned with the plot. He just wanted photography and, by golly, he got it. It didn't matter if he made it happier and more crowd-friendly/antagonizing.Alex North is possibly the worst composer from this period. His sonic garbage here is nothing inventive. Hermann would do that with 'Psycho.' That got the ball rolling.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't want to come across as a philistine, but Spartacus doesn't half go on a bit and is one hell of a downer. I know that the film is intended to make the viewer feel inspired by the indomitable spirit of man in the face of terrible persecution and oppression, but after three hours of such, I found myself struggling to care. The dull political machinations of the Roman senate and the aimless wandering of the slave army do little to help matters; I've never been so grateful for an intermission (the DVD retains the original mid-movie break, during which I splashed my face with cold water to wake myself up).It all starts off well enough, with slave Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) sent to gladiator training camp, where he gets a crash course in survival before escaping his confines to lead others in revolt. But then it really starts to go pear-shaped, star Douglas doing his utmost to outdo Heston in the historical epic stakes by spouting over-sentimental, moralistic dross about the importance of freedom in countless maudlin scenes that virtually deify his character?after which he lets down his thousands of followers by leading them into battle against the Romans like lambs to the slaughter.The best thing about Spartacus is its impressive cast, which not only includes heavyweight performers like Olivier, Laughton and Curtis, but also includes tens of thousands of nameless extras, allowing for some wonderful vistas of the Italian countryside swarming with slaves, and a brilliantly staged (and brutal) battle scene, proving that, as clever as CGI is these days, nothing looks better than the real thing.

		<fullReview>I certainly think this is one of Kubrick's weaker movies. Or more correctly, it was Kirk Douglas' movie. Kirk Douglas was good in this movie and there are parts of the movie that are quite astonishing. It must have been hell of a job to direct an epic like this one. It was a very large crew after all. But kind of falls short with its "a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do" thing, being stretched too long although it could have been better if the movie was 120 minutes long. I mean, I love long, slow movies. Just as an example 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Once Upon a Time in America'. I just felt it overemphasized certain Things.It has a good story but the plot was kind of unfocused. Especially considering Kubrick directed it. It has a tendency to drag, focusing on things that are already clear. Also like Kubrick felt, it was full of stupid moralizing. All the "a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do", always being righteous with decisions although it is about a man who started a revolution. Sure it's a movie and it has the right to show what should be, instead of what was but it tended to go to ridiculous lengths about it. Spartacus, the way he was portrayed was exactly that.But I admit that it was a romantic movie and the battles in the movie were quite grand, with stunt men and extras doing pretty dangerous stuff. It was also very touching with Varinia, romantic and tender since there was chemistry between Spartacus and Varinia. Also their child. I shed some tears at the end of the movie. Also the story was very lively and I was amazed at the cast and extras of the movie. But overall, I feel that this is an above average movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I like epics, but this wasn't among the best I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to Rome last fall and I'm now amusing myself by watching lots of movies set in Rome, both present-day and ancient-history oriented. I enjoyed "Ben Hur" and "Quo Vadis", but "Spartacus" was kind of difficult to sit through. Maybe it was too much of a Kirk Douglas overdose. Maybe it was Peter Ustinov (who I usually enjoy) hamming it up to the point where he was out-hamming Charles Laughton, a neat trick in itself. Ustinov apparently won an Oscar for his performance; personally I thought his humor was misplaced and overdone in this context, although he was certainly funny.I've read that up to 10,000 people were associated with this film, and I think I saw them all in one scene where the slaves are coming over the hills towards the Romans. For a moment I automatically thought the effect had to be CGI, but then of course I remembered this was 1960 and those were in fact real extras running down the hillside like thousands upon thousands of ants. That shot was absolutely breathtaking; I'm glad I saw the film just to be able to experience the awesomeness of that scene.One of my favorite character actors, Harold J. Stone, had a significant supporting role as one of Spartacus' advisers; it was fun to see him in his prime doing drama.I'm sure I would have gotten less out of the film if I hadn't had the "I was in Rome" focus to hang it all on. The sight of the crucified slaves, dozens of them, hanging all along both sides of the Appian Way was rather sobering, to say the least, since I couldn't help but recall the moments I spent walking along that same road.I've seen "Ben Hur" a couple of times and I would certainly consider watching "Quo Vadis" again, but I think once was enough for "Spartacus".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most intelligent and moving of the epics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are of course flaws in this film and they are detailed in other reviews. Some of the exposition is leaden, the women have ridiculously elaborate hair styles, and the dialogue at times is weak. There is a sentimental streak, though it's nowhere near as intrusive as a Spielberg version would be. But its excellent qualities more than make up for this. First the acting. The slaves are not that impressive but the Romans more than make up for it - the Brits Olivier, Laughton and Ustinov make a phenomenal team. Then the action sequences, brilliantly staged and among the best ever filmed. Most important, though, is the handling of the story which manages to be equally moving and thought-provoking. We know hardly anything about the Third Servile War and nothing at all about Spartacus's character and motivations. The overtly Marxist take on the revolt is, well, as convincing as any (freedom for all blah blah) but the way it is woven in with the politics of the day is brilliant. For my money this is the best of all the epics - more consistent than El Cid or Ben Hur, which have dated much more. Incidentally, the novel on which the movie is based, Howard Fast's Spartacus, is awfully heavy going, and I admire the way the script writer Dalton Trumbo gave it the necessary tension and momentum. The music too is excellent and the direction, well, it's mainly Kubrick so enough said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Titanic Than Any Story Ever Told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of its tagline says, "More titanic than any story ever told!" which actually isn't very far from the truth &amp; also notorious for being the only feature in the legendary film career of director Stanley Kubrick on which he didn't have complete artistic control, Spartacus is breathtaking in both scope of its ambition &amp; scale of its production, and just like every other Kubrick film, is an influential example of its genre.Based on Howard Fast's novel of the same name &amp; set in 1st century BC, Spartacus tells the true life story of its titular character; a rebellious slave being trained at a gladiatorial school, who begins an uprising which soon spreads across the Italian Peninsula, resulting in the freedom of thousands of slaves but when his plan to flee the country is disrupted, he decides to challenge the might of Roman Empire.Directed by Stanley Kubrick, the film has all the trademarks of this auteur yet feels remarkably different &amp; unique compared to his previous works. The film is the first big-budget production of his career &amp; yet the manner in which the then-young Kubrick handles its huge cast &amp; epic scope is a testament to his skills as a filmmaker. Written by Dalton Trumbo, the screenplay isn't very accurate to its historical facts but it does make the story more relatable with current events.The technical aspects are always gold-standard in Kubrick films &amp; Spartacus is no exception. The set pieces are amazing to look at, locations are elegantly chosen, Cinematography makes fab use of its camera, the panoramic shots are spectacular, colour composition is vibrant &amp; the level of detail is quite extensive. Despite running over 3 hours, it kept me deeply invested in its story &amp; Alex North's majestic score provides an epic feel to its narrative.Coming to the performances, Spartacus features a star-studded cast in Kirk Douglas, Laurence Olivier, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov, John Gavin, Tony Curtis &amp; others. Douglas gives his all in the role of Spartacus &amp; delivers a fantastic performance, Olivier plays Crassus with fine elegance, Laughton as Gracchus ends up stealing every scene he's in, Gavin doesn't do much as Julius Caesar, Curtis is brilliant as Antoninas &amp; Jean Simmons does a good job as Varinia in a film dominated by men.On an overall scale, to know that the screen being filled with thousands of people doesn't have one pixel of CGI in it, to know that each one of those extras was a real person indeed &amp; to know that Kubrick managed to churn out an epic that more than lives up to its word are amongst a few things that makes me admire Spartacus all the more. Grandeur in scale, highly entertaining, very engaging, and covering love, betrayal, corruption, slavery, mutiny, civilization &amp; leadership with finesse, Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus comes strongly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The evocati and the spatial logic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film, and by extension life, is a matter of ranges of truth, never a single one. Here we have three principals following their idea of what ought to be conveyed by struggle.Douglas at around this time went looking for a stage sufficiently big for his ego to strut. He had campaigned for Ben Hur, when that failed he set out with his production house to make his own. What he demands of the film and gets is by far the least interesting range here, a Braveheart of its time; the lowly hero who revolts against oppression, gets the pure girl, addresses and inspires the crowds with a message of freedom.It's not clear from a little research I did if Douglas set out to make a political statement or if the possibility for one emerged when the option of involving Trumbo landed on the table. Trumbo was still blacklisted at that time and jailed prior so hiring him in the open was a bold move. It's more clear that the film wouldn't have drawn the same attention without it; JFK wouldn't have had to cross picket lines to see the film.The message is that only when you embody the idea does it acquire presence and truth, more interesting this. We can see this in the film here, the one that ended the blacklist. No court decided prior, the film revolted anyway, dismantling it in practice. And why this film? The ground was of course prepared by circumstances but still why this and not any other? Because its own push is against intolerance and oppression written by someone who actually embodied its message in his own story. It's not however a view to really contemplate now; we still have heroes and villains on clear sides, an unambiguous struggle against evil. It's not, only because this particular evil is now, or seems now, to be much more distant than even then.Kubrick was the latest addition to the fold, hired on two days notice and with production already underway (the Libyan scenes had been filmed).It's easy to see what he may have balked at to the point of later disowning the work, and easy to retrospectively think that had it not been for Douglas this would have been a 2001 or Barry Lyndon of epics. But this was still 1960 so just as L'Avventura (and soon Marienbad) were redefining the planes of narrative. My notion is that Kubrick had as much of an ego as Douglas and simply disowned this for not having overseen every single element, it doesn't look 'ruined' in some way.Kubrick does solid work in the classical scenes of the epic, more so for someone so young who came into it so late. I saw it together with Fall of the Roman Empire (by the guy who was fired by this) and there's a clear difference, that one stale, this energetic.His real work however is in the sculpting of a more embodied space to have presence. Trumbo wrote in a more intimate vein, quite apart from the loud overall message. It's closer to how we do things now than say Ben Hur, trying to place us (to an extent) in the unfolding life. Kubrick extends in the eye.During the bouts in the gladiatorial school for the indifferent amusement of Roman visitors, we stay with Spartacus in the wooden box and watch the first pair fight through planks of wood. Another is after Spartacus has amassed his makeshift army, as Douglas gives one of his speeches our eye wanders off among the crowd. The whispered seduction in the bath and that is followed by a view of the legions quietly tiptoeing out of Rome at dawn. All well known scenes, all of them about creating presence. We've taken the next step to where they are now commonplace and perhaps disappear in the spectacle, for the time though they were more forward-looking than usual in this niche. The spontaneity has gone out but the desire to portray in a more intimate way still shows.And then there's the final battle which curiously stands out more. Here it becomes all about arranged space, purely architectural. The shape of the arranged armies on opposite crests of hills that look like calligraphic scrawls on green, the choreographed cuts of far and close, abstract and concrete; it's so good it rivals Welles in his own game. Watching this is to get a sense of what we potentially missed in his Napoleon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly entertaining epic, yet one almost ruined by the producer's ego.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a bad film but certainly one badly made. The writing is unfocused, containing superfluous subplots, scenes, which may have pleased Douglas, Kubrick, but that didn't do anything but add time to a film already long, without bringing anything to it. For ex., after two world wars, do we need to be shown how people live in refugee camps? Also, it could have done without Antoninus, who doesn't add any meat to the plot--except maybe a gay love triangle--and the time saved could have been better spent exploring, for ex., a clash of personalities amongst rebel chiefs. But it looks like that was the last thing KD wanted, to expose his hero to anything that could have reveal a conflictive or conflicted personality. That is a flaw that plagues the entire flick, Spartacus' overbearing goodness, which ends up making of him an unrealistic, lame character. Also Sps. lacks of any underlying source of tension, with the result that we watch it with interest, but without enthusiasm, we are never carried away by it. I remember a far better packaged, yet much underrated film, Helen Of Troy, which impressed me so much with its impeccable show of human pathos: the Fate of the doomed brought about by an eerie convergence of human behavior and pure circumstances. Troy is doomed because his leaders &amp; inhabitants are destined to act in a given way, faced to a given situation, and the ensuing tension comes from the fact that, even if we already know their destiny, we keep hoping they will be able to change the assigned fate. We keep hoping because we know the last decision is entirely theirs; they have their collective fate in their hands. That is a tension of which Sp. completely lacks. Spartacus' fate is made clear long before the end; it's even predicted by some character. The cards have been stacked against him so we never doubt things will happen that way. That is what robs the film of any tension and that's Douglas' fault. It would have been far more exciting if, for ex., at some point Sp. had victory within reach but then, at a crucial point, he was betrayed by some personal flaw, weakness of him. That would have added to the complexity of the character but KD wouldn't have any of that. He wanted his hero to be uni-dimensionally good and nice and that is what he got, with disappointing results.But this is not a bad flick. Rather entertaining, it got at least three saving graces. The cinematography?the scene of the Romans covering in formation the hillside is unforgettable?superb acting by 3 monsters of English stage and the meticulous set designs, the faithful reproduction of Rome and its palaces. Most of the cons come from what I mentioned: Spartacus' overbearing goodness, loose writing and the miscasting of some important characters.Simmons's terribly miscast, not because she didn't belong here but because she was ideal for another role, that of Claudia. Logic would have wanted her Claudia to be the same she-patrician we met in the beginning and who falls in Spartacus' hands, later in the film. That would have put a sharp edge to her character and made explosive her interaction with him; and also given enormous tension and emotional energy to their inevitable coming together. Instead, their "love", as shown here, is predictable, lame. We all love love stories but perfect love stories are boring. What proves my point is that, when we see her in regal trappings we realize that that's her real identity, that of a she-patrician who up to now was disguised as a slave. But K.D. didn't see it that way most likely because that would have forced Sps. to be somewhat rough with her which would have gone against the idea of the perfect gentleman he had in mind.But as badly as Simmons was miscast, Gavin is even worse. You can't believe this is the same Julius Cesar we all know. He not only looks clueless but also devoid of all charisma, which is compounded by bad acting. Sp. would have been much better with Dall as Cesar and Gavin as Glabrus. Dall, criminally underused here, would have perfectly made for a conniving emperor in waiting, menacingly hovering over Crassus' back. Looking like a younger George Kennedy, Dall displays in his facial features that unique GK brand of jovial, mischievous innocence, which can turn into a menacingly, cold-as-steel, stare in a moment's notice. Strode was also wasted here; the saddest thing about his Draba death's being that it took him off the screen for good. As for Olivier, Laughton, Ustinov they are here in top form, though my choice for best is Olivier's Crassus, a man of incredible psychological complexity who, no matter how scheming and cruel he acts, we can't bring ourselves to see him as just bad, he's always inviting us to explore more of him. I loved every one of his scenes, his shots. He's always giving you the impression there's a lot more there than he's showing.Despite all his contemporary, 1960's sound bites, Spartacus is more a pathetic than a tragic hero. He starts slave, he ends up slave. Through all his struggles he hasn't learned the first thing, which Draba taught him when saying "no". Instead, when ordered to kill each other, he and Antoninus start arguing about not wanting to see the other crucified and then proceed to try to kill each other, doing what Crassus wanted. What would truly free men have done? Exactly what Draba did. Draba's the real hero here. With all his pompous, self-important speeches about freedom, Spartacus ends up exactly where the Romans wanted him, on a cross. He's not tragic, just pathetic. In all, 7/10, mostly for its entertainment value.BTW, Spartacus' demise is due to the simple fact that he couldn't put a sock on it. Telling all his plans to the Romans...? Come on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth it just for Peter Ustinov</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just finished watching Spartacus on my modest home cinema system and can say that I enjoyed it despite its many flaws. I will consider these now: The film is terribly dated and very kitsch. The score is triumphant and overbearing or soppy and annoying, some outdoor sets are obviously fake, and I did not have a great deal of liking for Spartacus' girlfriend nor even for Spartacus himself. Cruel as they are, I prefer the evil Romans - much more to my taste. Tony Curtis is very camp in this film, and it's obvious that this is a late fifties film in terms of design choices (released in 1960). The acting is quite hammy overall but that is quite fitting for a production of this kind and of that time. Caesar in the film is not at all convincing as Caesar the great tyrant-in-waiting; he is played in far too a good boyish way.As a classicist, I am able to say that there is very little factual truth in this film - Crassus was extremely rich, yes, but never became dictator and in many senses was not as much of a heavyweight as is made out in the film. The Gracchus character is an anachronism as he died years before Spartacus and Crassus and never had power in the senate. The slave revolt led by Spartacus was never aimed at ending slavery - they wanted the rights of citizens and perhaps would have gone on to own their very own slaves. I do not believe it was their intention, as in the film, to go "home" as, for all intents and purposes, Italy was their home. I realise this film was based on a novel and not on history books but it's interesting sometimes to see the liberties historical films can take for the sake of entertainment.Now the good points. For obvious reasons, I was very sensitive to how the film-makers captured Rome, physically and spiritually and some of the set pieces were stunning although perhaps not accurate. My favourite scene, however, has to be the plain scene with the legions marching in formation. I was glued to the screen. But, saving the best for last, Peter Ustinov as Spartacus' owner was just wonderful - funny and incredibly good to watch. He deserved the Oscar he won for this part. I enjoyed watching the legendary Lawrence Olivier and I really liked his style but he is very much of an Ac-tor. Still I found he had the right combination of haughtiness, presence and, dare I say it, vulnerability. I also think the story half-manages to bring a slightly epic feel to the film.It's odd because the negatives seem to outweigh the positives but I really enjoyed this film for sheer entertainment that is not instant and fast like so much modern pap.8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spartacus!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spartacus is the story of a slave who became a great gladiator then broke out of the mess hall with the other gladiators and killed the guards and ran out of the town and busted out slaves from farms and slave markets. Spartacus started with a hand full of men and ended up with about 40,000 men and he made a rebel army out of the men. The story is true but not much is known about Spartacus himself. The movie was made without computer effects so the whole movie was filmed with stunt men and extras. The movie would have taken a couple of years to make and the director was perfectionist and he would make everyone do it again and again. The last battle was an amazing inventive spectacle with the burning rolls and the Roman formation. I watched the movie and thought it was fine but too long ( 3 hours punk! ).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although Kubrick didn't have complete control over this film it still has the ambiance that he later perfects in his other masterpieces. I feel that this is easily his most tender film, which is a rare emotion for him, mostly due to the relationship with Spartacus and his consistent love interest. The factor I appreciated most was Kubrick's control over in front of the camera; every frame is busy and authentic, truly embodying the scale it so desires to be effective. It is a real treat to see Lawrence Olivier, Charles Laughton and (the right-fully award winning) Peter Ustinov, in delightfully developed supporting roles. The contrast between these men is the key factor and ultimately rewards in the climax. The score and cinematography are also outstanding. However, I do discredit it quite a bit for dragging too much in pace.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick's Take on the Hollywood Epic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent and sprawling epic drama that is one of the most under-rated films ever produced. The titled slave (Kirk Douglas) leads a revolt against the evil Roman Empire, trying to win freedom for himself and all those like him. Laurence Olivier gives a show-stopping performance as Douglas' mortal enemy. Charles Laughton, Tony Curtis and Jane Russell also add great supporting turns. Peter Ustinov took home Oscar gold as he steals every scene as a self-absorbed slave trader who eventually has a change of heart. The massive budget, amazing cinematography and breath-taking art direction are just super. Stanley Kubrick's patented attention to minute details is truly uncanny. A great achievement that is somewhat forgotten on Kubrick's list, but is arguably his finest work. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes in this movie. I thought since it was so acclaimed and since I liked Gladiator so much, I would enjoy it. Kirk Douglas and Tony Curtis are also two of my favorite actors. I enjoyed it up until the end. The movie was very good, but turned out very bad.Director Anthony Mann directed the first hour, which was very good, but then he was fired and the great Stanley Kubrick was hired. For what? So they could push him around. He had no control over the rest of his film and ever since that he has disowned it. Maybe that's why the movie turned out to be so terrible. What is the point of this movie?Spartacus shows slaves escape and it shows how they are determined to fight the Romans for their freedom. They fight and lose.In their agony of defeat they are crucified. As I said, what is the point of this movie? What a terrible ending this movie had. What a terrible movie this turned out to be. This movie is a downer. Not the best story for a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally saw it and I've got to say, in a lot of ways it was pretty bad. The Roman power politics, and the final battle scene were great but not enough. Why would anyone follow Douglas' Spartacus? He doesn't appear to have been a very bright general, or even a particularly good gladiator. We keep hearing about the great victories his army wins, why don't we ever see one. Any scenes with Spartacus and Varinia were atrociously get-up-and-rummage-through-the-fridge bad. And the score was deadly, even embarrassing at times. Why put an extended version in the director's cut? I've got to assume Kubrick had little control, the music he chooses is usually fascinating and none of his touches caught my eye.

		<shortDescription>A disappointingly conventional effort from an all-star production team and cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably Stanley Kubrick's most conventional film, "Spartacus" lacks the intensity and creativity that usually characterize his work. His and star Kirk Douglas's earlier collaboration, "Paths of Glory" (1957), has these elements in abundance, so the fact that they are absent from "Spartacus" feels like a regression. Co-star Tony Curtis's accent is not quite as bad as reputation would have it, but his character is largely extraneous. Douglas gives an almost too understated performance as the reluctant rebel leader, while Charles Laughton and Laurence Olivier are compelling as classical patricians in their classical, patrician way. As if to mirror the reserved acting, Dalton Trumbo's script is thin, with little of the deep character analysis, historical insight, or contemporary commentary that writers like Gore Vidal brought to 1959's "Ben-Hur." The production is effective enough, but its visuals and pacing are staid, conservative, and unchallenging. Most of the movie may as well have been made by an old-school sword-and-sandal auteur like Cecil B. DeMille rather than a New Hollywood experimentalist like Kubrick. The film's battlefield sequences, so stunningly executed in "Paths of Glory," suffer the most from a failure to cut loose or try fresh approaches. They are ponderous, more so even than the rather obvious dialogue that takes place in the Senate chambers and baths.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Spartacus" verges on war epic greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Spartacus" (1960) and "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962) were the two great epic war films of the 1960s. That said, the latter is superior, but not for the former's lack of trying. The backstory of "Spartacus" explains a lot: Executive producer and star Kirk Douglas fires director Anthony Mann and brings in his "Paths of Glory" (a phenomenal film) director Stanley Kubrick. Problem is, the eventually infamous Kubrick really had no experience working with anyone's work but his own, even if the script was written by blacklisted two-time Oscar winner Dalton Trumbo. Basically, Douglas did his best to make the most of "Spartacus," including the corralling of a distinguished cast, but it results in a very good -- not great -- film.For one, Trumbo's script is a crowd-pleaser, and I say that implying that it was for the '60s. Rarely does a war epic focus so heavily on the protagonist's romantic interest. As impressive as Jean Simmons is as Spartacus' lover and wife, Varinia, the subplot of these two slaves falling for each other has too much clout in a story that should focus sternly on Spartacus as the inspiring leader of a slave rebellion against the Roman empire. His love for Varinia ultimately makes him more likable, but it comes at the cost of part of the film's thematic boldness.Sadly, one of the scenes that was most interesting was not part of the film until it was remastered in 1991. In it, Laurence Olivier, playing powerful Senate leader Crassus, tries to seduce a young slave played by Tony Curtis as they are in the bath using a cunning metaphor. Naturally, this was deemed inappropriate by the Legion of Decency. Few scenes are as memorable as that one and only a couple of Spartacus' speeches on freedom are standouts as well. "Death is the only a freedom a slave knows. That's why he's not afraid of it" is one of just a handful of powerful moments in three-hour film.For Kubrick fans, this is that one asterisk in Kubrick's grand career. There's very little director trademark in this film and there is very minimal hands-on work. If anything, the cinematography --namely the shadowy interiors -- is most noteworthy. And interestingly, most of this was Kubrick's doing and not that of Russell Metty because of alleged disagreements.The unarguably great part of this film are the performances. Sir Peter Ustinov won an Oscar for his role as Lentulus, owner of the gladiator school where Spartacus is sold at the film's beginning. He is a comical man just trying to do whatever he can to insure he's buried head out of the sand rather than in. He's the pawn of the Roman powers and he earns much of our pity as the film wears on. Olivier is of course commanding the the Roman leader and Charles Laughton perfect as his rival senator, kind-hearted yet distinctly amoral.It might be Alex North's score that sums "Spartacus" up best. It's theme-driven music perfectly suited for an epic film, but feels completely out of context. Whereas Maurice Jarre's epic "Lawrence of Arabia" soundtrack captures the greatness of that film, North's is a reminder that "Spartacus" was an idea born in Hollywood and shot mostly in California. It just doesn't convey a sense of time or place, only that this film was made to be a head-turning film with thousands of cast members and extras. Once again, it is a film of tremendous talents, but only verges on epic greatness.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com **all facts in this review courtesy IMDb trivia page</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic in every sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 8 when Spartacus was released in 1960. I cannot understand how I managed to get to 2009 without having seen more than snippets - I even have it on my DVD shelves, for heaven's sake! But I'm glad that my first full viewing was of the restored print at my local multiplex: this is one of those movies which demands to be seen on a really big screen. The advent of CGI means that we have got used to computer generated hordes fighting epic battles, but Spartacus features thousands upon thousands of real people ranged across real landscapes in the days when films like this were a real event.For all its epic sprawl, the heart of Spartacus derives from the love between Spartacus and Varinia, and I was surprised to see this movie from Kubrick - demonstrably such a cold fish in so many of his films - have such a moving centre. Even the key Roman figures are noticeably less clinical than is customary with Kubrick.The main performances are, for the most part, very good (although the less said the better about John Dall's dreadful, dreadful turn as Glabrus), and I was particularly surprised at Olivier. I have found most of his movie work to be mannered, almost self-conscious acting (bordering on thesping if you follow what I mean) - here he gives a naturalistic performance which is by far the best performance I have ever seen from him on film. Jean Simmons is luminous and lovely. Ustinov gives us a comic quasi-villain with a heart of gold with a schtick which collared an Oscar for him on this occasion, despite the fact that we have seen it from him on a number of occasions.But these are quibbles. This is a film which deserves its epic status, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Roman slavery epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wonderful, operatic film that must have inspired swathes of Ridley Scott's celebrated Gladiator. Kirk Douglas is the heroic, enduring slave Spartacus, struggling blindly towards freedom through a dangerous political web of scheming Romans who see him alternately as threat and opportunity.It's a fantastic cast, an embarrassment of riches. Where Douglas is a bristling hulk, Tony Curtis occupies the gap created for the younger, impressionable hero. Lawrence Olivier and Charles Laughton ooze feudal self-assurance. Jean Simmons is plays her love to Spartacus with grace and resolve; Peter Ustinov is a quiet, witty liberal bulwark to the drama.This was, in effect Kubrick's big break. It turns out well given its scale, maintaining the vernacular and standard essayed in the recent hit Ben Hur with success that clearly endures to date. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I'm Spartacus!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spartacus is that genuine rarity, an epic that successfully combines the intellectual with the emotional, giving it an edge on almost all of its contemporaries - even Anthony Mann's superb Fall of the Roman Empire, which is never able to fully reconcile the two in its leading characters.It was Mann who shot the striking opening sequences in the Libyan salt mines before being replaced by Kubrick, allegedly for losing his grip on the gladiator school sequences (though it seems everyone involved offers a different reason), and his trademark use of landscape to define character is very much in evidence. Spartacus begins the film as a virtual animal, mute, biting his guard, a creature of pure instinct. Yet through his fight for his freedom, he learns dignity and becomes more of a human being than his civilised masters.Ironically, it is his doomed slave revolt that provides the spark to turn Rome into a totalitarian dictatorship, a development hinted at in his gladiatorial combat with Woody Strode, where their duel to the death is simply a background for the political backbiting of its noble Roman audience. Even after the rebellion is brutally crushed, the seeds for further change and disruption are sown in the shifting allegiance of a young Gaius Julius Caesar (Gavin), who moves from the side of Laughton's populist Plebian to Olivier's ruthless Patrician.Despite this, Spartacus is an incredibly hopeful film. Its belief in the value of life and in people may be frowned upon as naive now, yet through its portrayal of the Romans' ignorance of the responsibilities of their civilisation in their endless manipulations and power plays remains painfully aware of reality. In hindsight, it seems impossible to separate it from the civil rights movement of the late fifties-sixties (JFK was a great admirer of the film), with Spartacus a Thracian composite of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. The solidarity of the slaves in refusing to identify Spartacus to the victorious Romans and choosing crucifixion over their chains is an image at once universal myth and very much of its time.Most unusual within the constraints of the genre is that it makes us feel its concerns rather than just think about them. The fight to the death between Spartacus and Antoninus (Curtis) is played as a personal scene rather than an action set piece, each trying to kill the other to Spain them the pain of crucifixion. And when he takes his place on the last of the crosses that pave the road to the gates of Rome, the final scene where his freed wife (Jean Simmons) shows him the son he has never seen for the first time and begs him to "Die, please die!", is one of the most intensely moving moments in cinema and carries an emotional charge that Kubrick's work never again attained or even attempted.Despite his genuinely imaginative direction, Kubrick's erratic attitude towards the film is well documented (although Douglas claims the director originally wanted to take blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo's screen credit, he subsequently vociferously disowned the film). Unfortunately, the 1990s cinema re-issue of this original restored version met with some of the worst reviews in recent memory: Douglas' reputation had faded while Kubrick's had soared, rendering it an act of critical blasphemy to disagree with him.Nonetheless, the film endures even if its reputation has not. Trumbo's script is both intelligent and involving and filled with memorable and beautifully constructed scenes, the cast uniformly excellent, with Olivier giving one of his last great performances before he turned to intermittent silly voices and self-parody. Aside from the now infamous attempted bathtime seduction of Tony Curtis (far less explicit than the subsequent speech about 'debasing yourself' before Rome), the extra footage in this restored version is largely violence - more crucifixions, the burial of a baby in the snow, gladiator Woody Strode's blood squirting onto Olivier's face as he slits his throat and a lot more of the climactic battle (itself shot as an afterthought after an unsatisfactory rough-cut).Sadly, it is here that one of the film's most visually powerful moments, when the Roman Legion stops to a man in their advance on the slave army, just does not work even on the largest of small screens. Whereas in 70mm on the giant screen you could feel them approach foot by foot, here they barely seem to be moving, rendering the jolting shock and ominous dread of their sudden halt (actually achieved via freeze frame) barely noticeable. The prelude to the main battle does remain an incredible musical tour de force by North, however, predicting both the savagery and hollow victory of the coming carnage with brief, brutal crescendos on vicious sharp cuts. Even in a strong field that year, it is amazing that North did not win an Oscar for his contribution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Far, FAR better than "Ben-Hur," which came out the year before, "Spartacus" still doesn't quite shake some of the same epic movie shackles that made William Wyler's film such a dismal bore. The point of this film is the sets and costumes; the studios denied Kubrick the freedom to direct this movie in his instantly recognizable style, so while it's certainly solidly enough crafted and easy to sit through, it also feels anonymous, which wouldn't be so bad if you didn't know that someone as distinctly NON-anonymous as Kubrick helmed it.Can you imagine how much better "Spartacus" would have been if Kubrick had been able to direct it in the same style as that other piece of eye candy he created, "Barry Lyndon?" Best not to think about such things that can never be.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hit and Myth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Stanley Kubrick was brought in late on this sprawling epic, which is probably why it possesses few (if any) of his touches; nevertheless it still qualifies as one of his better movies and as perhaps the best of the epics from the 50s/60s. Kirk Douglas stars as the eponymous hero, a troll-like biter of Roman's ankles when we first meet him, who is transformed into a svelte and charismatic leader of an army of slaves. Needless to say, this being a Hollywood studio movie, the story told here plays pretty fast and loose with the truth. Major characters, such as Verinia and Antoninus are pure invention, and the film has created something of a myth about the real Spartacus who was apparently a Roman deserter who was sold into slavery upon his capture and sent to Batiatus's gladiator training school. Gracchus (a wonderfully written part played with typical skill by Charles Laughton) did exist ? but about 50 years before the slaves' uprising. It's a shame that writer Dalton Trumbo and executive producer Douglas felt it necessary to add these invented characters, as they provide the weakest strands of the story. Jean Simmons is miscast in the part of Verinia: she's too demure and fragile-looking, too much the English lady you'd expect to find pouring tea in the garden instead of wine in the atrium. Her part is not particularly well written, either ? too passive, even in her scenes with Olivier after the final battle. The character of Antoninus, played with little distinction by a too-old-for-the-part Tony Curtis ? whose occasional forays into historical epics were never successful ? is superfluous to the plot, and his only function seems to be to provide the writers with a means of demonstrating the sexual mores of Marcus Licinius Crassus (Laurence Olivier ? another strong performance), the political foe of Gracchus, who represents the autocratic alternative to Gracchus's democratic ideal. Having abandoned his position as Crassus's body servant, Antoninus joins up with Spartacus and accompanies him to the very end. It's difficult to understand why Trumbo didn't simply merge the characters of Crixus (John Ireland), Spartacus's fellow gladiator and friend, and Antoninus, and find some other way to convey the nature of Crassus's character and ambition for Rome.The political intrigues provide by far the more interesting aspect of the story, and were probably more important to Douglas than the emotional side, which seems to have been incorporated as a sop to the studio's need for a box office return. The intrigue and machinations of Crassus and the wily old senator Gracchus are never less than completely absorbing, whereas the emotional sub-plots rarely rise above the level of some biblical potboiler. For me, Laughton's performance far outshines that of Oscar winner Peter Ustinov (who nevertheless gives a terrific performance as Lentulus Batiatus, the cowardly owner of the gladiator school in which the slaves' revolt is born) and it's a mystery how he never received even a nomination for any major award for the part. Kirk Douglas, resists the temptation to grandstand for the most part in what could so easily have become a showy role, and works hard to show the man behind the myth. Russ Metty's superb cinematography never fails to do justice to the scale and scope of the story, and Alex North's score is justifiably celebrated.While it's not without its shortcomings ? not least of which is its protracted running time ? SPARTACUS is deserving of the praise it has received over the years, and its reputation will no doubt continue to be enhanced in years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ALMOST a fantastic epic (some spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, this was a very good film. First thing is the cast. It is excellently casted. Second thing is the story: wonderful, passionate and tragically heroic. But there were somethings for me which perhaps spoiled it a little. But first let me praise the excellent things. Kirk Douglas, as the rebellious slave Spartacus; was terrific and most convincing. Jean Simmons as the lovely Virinia, was perfect in character as she was in beauty. Laurence Olivier, as always, was perfectly casted as the cruel ambitious General Craccuss; it was he that really made the film what it was. Peter Ustinov was also very good; and Charles Laughton was convincing to. So there you have a range of very fine actors; all suited to their parts. Well done Stanley Kubrick. But there were a few actors casted I did not like. First was Julius Ceaser. In this film, Ceaser is at the very start of his reign. Despite some moderate convincing portrayal, a nineteen-year-old looking Julius does not do much for me. He looked as though he had just rolled out of some American football team. Good looking though he was, he was in no way near the character which we know Ceaser to be; nor did he act like any sort of ruler. Secondly was Marcus Glaborous. Glaborous was drawled American-style by John Dall. Once again, despite some convincing acting, this ruined it for me. Every time he spoke, I felt I was being pulled out of the might of Rome to the yanky style of a western. Thirdly, and least importantly; apparently none of it is historically correct to the original tale. But despite all of this, I must say I enjoyed it; and prefer it considerably to the modern take-offs like Gladiator. The finest for me was Laurence Olivier, who sort of patched up some of the poorer cast. Despite all this AGAIN, I recommend it if you enjoy historic tension, romance, and a devastating battle... and its great to see Olivier in his blood-thirsty role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great director serves up spear-and-toga propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Keep your finger on the fast-forward button. The basic story (only sticking with the facts occasionally) is great, but Kubrick added so much boring "color" that much of this well-meaning movie is unwatchable. A sappy and implausible love story burdens the movie almost from the beginning. Part of the problem is that the lovely Jean Simmons was utterly miscast as a pretty and prim slave girl in love with ruff n' tuff Kirk Douglas. The other is that these characters, after staring interminably into each others pupils, deliver some of the schmaltziest lines in the history of film.Every time the plot gets going, it's interrupted with hundreds, nay thousands, of quick cuts showing Spartacus' brave and happy escaped slaves enjoying their newly won freedom: men working, cute children playing, women washing, Tony Curtis leading a singalong around the campfire, and so on. Liberal as I am, this stuff has the odor of leftist propaganda. Worse, because it's so staged, it's meaningless as film. You don't believe it for two seconds. Along the same apologetic lines is the seeming beneficence of Spartacus' slave army. In real life, he celebrated a victory by pitting 300 captives against one another in gladiatorial contests. Here, he hates that stuff and will have nothing to do with it. In real life, his troops raped and pillaged, burning farms and slaughtering their occupants. Here, he steals a few trunks of jewelry and other valuables. In this film, there isn't much truth telling going on.And let's not forget the costuming and makeup. In keeping with the 50s provenance of the film, Kirk Douglas wears a ducktail hairdo. (You expect him to pull up in a lowered '50 Merc. The women's rigid, metallic coifs are doused with shiny hairspray. It all looks very un-Roman.Mercifully, the film is saved by some mighty fine acting. The supporting cast is spectacular, especially Peter Ustinov and Charles Laughton, who, as far as I'm concerned, is the star of the movie. And Ustinov certainly deserved the academy award he got for his role as a likable trainer of gladiators.Worth seeing, but don't put down the remote.Note to reviewers: This story didn't take place during the time of the Roman Empire, which began with Augustus in 14 BCE. The Empire was preceded by the Republic. That's when the slave revolt took place in southern Italy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kubrick has been snuffed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Make no mistake, Spartacus is a very strong epic and one that deserves to be called one of the best historical epics in American cinema, yet I can't help but wonder what might have been if director Stanley Kubrick was given more control over production. With Kirk Douglas in the starring role as well as producer, he seemed to sort of take over the look and feel of the movie in order to push forth his agenda that he was fighting for. Indeed, because of this, Spartacus has the feeling of more play and light-heartedness than other epics such as Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago.The supporting cast is very strong with Laurence Olivier, Jean Simmons, and Peter Ustinov all giving great performances and bringing these characters to life. However, Tony Curtis as a minstrel-type slave does not feel right and for the most part feels very out of place with this story. It is obvious with this film that Kubrick had his own ideas on how to present it but was snuffed by the studio system that still loomed above in the early 1960s. After this, which made plenty of money but also made Kubrick upset at Hollywood, he decided to move to England and finance his projects independently. Watch his films after Spartacus and judge for yourself whether he made a wise decision or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unjustifiably long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After many failed tries of watching SPARTACUS, I notice it is being shown on TCM on Christmas day and sit through the 3+ hours. I realize a small screen / pan and scan version is not the way to watch this movie but I find it rather disappointing anyway, specially when comparing it to later films which it obviously influenced but also in which special effects were leaps ahead (Braveheart, Gladiator) and so was common sense. Here's why: 1) Plenty of action sequences take place off-camera, there is only one really big, epic battle. What we do get are endless talking scenes with very little dialogue spread over long stretches, in other words, the epic lenght is hardly justified. 2) Absolutely ridiculous scene in which Douglas addresses hundreds of thousands of people without the benefit of a single microphone. I guess off-camera he said something in the likes of "pass it on". 3) Also ridiculous scenes with thousands of death people, all with healthy looking faces, the same applies to SPARTACUS when he is being crucified, hardly showing any pain. 4) How can we admire SPARTACUS fighting skills when he doesn't even win any of the gladiator fights ? His ability in the training machine hardly counts. 5) I wish I could say I was moved by the leading lady's looks or presence but this was hardly the case. There are also scenes in which she is supposed to be carrying a well covered SPARTACUS' baby which looks so stiff it is more than obvious they filmed it with a doll. My recommendation, watch GLADIATOR or BRAVEHEART instead !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too plain to be entertaining and artistic which contradicts Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Weirdly, Spartacus is out of Stanley Kubrick's style, a plain epic, visually plain, the content is plain, direction is plain... I don't know why, but I always see Spartacus and Ben Hur as like as two peas, may be so that they come from the same period. I don't compare Spartacus with Ben Hur, but it cannot be another Ben Hur, Ben Hur was much better, if you ask me. Spartacus is not a spectacular epic. The movie is not boring, I did not get bored at all, but it is not interesting enough throughout and as I said, everything is plain, in addition, there was nothing great. Except the final that I will mention later, there is not any scene memorable or impressive that I would talk about. May be I should mention the sword fight scene. There is a sword fight in the movie and it was really engaging and entertaining. However, the rest is like a straight, plain line. As for Stanley Kubrick, he is one of my all time favorite directors, but Spartacus is not like a Kubrick movie at all, you know almost every movie he made was different, extraordinary, but Spartacus is not. As you know, may be he is the most perfectionist director ever lived and his style was not distinguishable, but just impressive. In fact, it would be enough, if I just said perfectionist. However, Spartacus is an exception in his filmography. Kirk Douglas is also one of my all time favorite actors too, but unfortunately cannot save the movie. Before watching, I had known that Spartacus is not a historical action movie, no battles scenes etc. so I did not disappointed on this count, otherwise, Spartacus would have been a bigger disappointment to me. As for the final, one of the most unforgettable finals ever seen, I couldn't forget it for years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Of His Work, The Least Influence of Kubrick's on Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spartacus is Kirk Douglas, and he doesn't mess around. He escapes the Romans and wants to kick their booties. Oh, and he has plenty of slaves to help him. Like, thousands. That's a whole lot of slaves.The film is pretty straightforward as far as the story goes -- slaves escape and return to kick butt. But it's some of the dialogue that is interesting. One man debates the moral difference between eating oysters and eating snails. To him, there is none, and that is analogous to sexual tastes... an interesting and probably enlightened perspective.The film is supposed to be anti-slavery, with Spartacus dreaming of a day where slavery ceases, which the narrator says will take another 2000 years. One wonders if Spartacus was all that concerned about the slavery of other races, or if slavery has truly been abolished. Over the years, it has risen again and again in different societies throughout the globe in various forms. Are we so advanced today we have entirely removed the shadow of slavery?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I found the music abrasive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the accompanying musical score to be offensive at many points.In the many scenes with large numbers of people moving across the countryside, the composer used too much brass. Brass instruments tire the ear very quickly.His use of syncopation seemed repetitive as the movie went along, like he was working according to tired, very predictable formulas.After a while, my thought was, "Oh, no. Not another scene shot from a distance of people moving across the countryside, with this grating, intrusive, too noticeable brass instrumentation and trite, too obvious use of syncopation." Worst of all was the composer's inability to write longer melodic lines. Everything was made of short (one measure or less) motives, which he then repeated endlessly to fill out a group of four or eight bars.As for the movie, Ustinov and Laughton were great. As was Woody Strode. Probably the most effective acting in the entire movie was Strode sitting in the pen before he and Spartacus went out to fight.One thing I did not understand was when Spartacus' men took the Roman camp in the first battle. Was my copy missing something? I saw them approaching the camp, then the next thing was their burning the camp and dragging out the Roman commander. But I saw no fighting with the Romans there. Could that have been cut because of the very oppressive censors of the time? Jean Simmons is a very good actress. She had two scenes that stood out: 1-with Spartacus the first time, and 2--her scene with Olivier in his home near the end.I was glad to see John Ireland get a mildly prominent role.Some of the dialogue was embarrassingly bad. Specifically, scenes in the middle of the movie where Douglas repeats the same words or short sentences for no effect except to make me wonder why they had him say the same thing three times, four times.Meanwhile the dialogue involving Ustinov, Olivier and Laughton was top level.The starting section of the movie done by director Mann was excellent.All in all a top level movie, despite my having to turn down the sound repeatedly to avoid the abrasive, interminable brass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Little Long But Worth It.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only know part of the complex story behind this production. Thewriter, Trumbo, received his first credit after being jailed by theHouse Un-American Committee. Some of the most crucialscenes were removed because of the MPAA. Thankfully, therestored extended version is amazing. Kubrick came to the projectlate and didn't like the script or the lead actress. Unfortunately, hereplaced her with Simmons; she's a decent actress, but the plotdepends on her being a gorgeous woman, which she's not. Thisis Douglas' finest performance (that I've seen). A great epic moviewith a famous poster by Saul Bass. This is the story of a rebelmade by rebels, and they changed Hollywood in the process. Bravo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ranks with Ben Hur among the greatest biblical epics.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Ben Hur, one of the two greatest biblical epics ever. Douglas is at his peak as the hero. The other stars- Simmons, Olivier, Curtis, Laughton and Ustinov are perfect in their roles. Simmons is absolutely gorgeous. Also, look for John Gavin( as Caesar) and John Ireland in key roles. One of the rare movies where Olivier did not get top billing. I will always remember two lines at the end: Olivier-" They will fight here now, for me, and the winner will be crucified." Douglas-" He'll come back, and he'll be millions." Ustinov won Best Supporting Actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historical epic from the hands of a movie mastermind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(85%) One of Kubrick's non-surreal historic classics which has become the cornerstone of all ancient Roman based epics. And it really is an epic at just over three hours long, but its length does suit the subject matter so it's not really a big issue. Kirk Douglas fits the role of a true hero very well, and the strong supporting cast who actually get a good majority of the screen time add a large layer of clout to the production thanks to the ability of Laurence Olivier, Jean Simmons, Tony Curtis and Peter Ustinov just to name a few, as well as a very well written, richly constructed script. The pacing at times is a little too sluggish though for what is a pretty simple overall plot, but if there's a movie worth putting in the effort in to watch from beginning to end and really focus on, then this is it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I change my mind, I'm not Spartacus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is entertainment. It is very broad and lenient with facts. But why not? No one really knows a lot about a guy who lived 2000 centuries ago. Scholars can't even agree on Jesus, and he had more identified eye witnesses than any character before the printing press. Spartacus leads a rebellion against Rome composed of gladiators. How they are initially formed is hypothetical. Once you get several hundred, it is easy to recruit more and more, however. It isn't a spoiler to say Spartacus eventually gets caught, but not before he has several victories. In this, the film is pretty accurate. Kirk Douglas isn't the epitome of Spartacus. Most gladiators who were slaves from conquered lands were from the East, and would be darker than the Romans, who had a lot of blonde and fair citizens at the time. Their dark skin and hair really evolved later when they began intermingling with what they called the "Orientals". However, some slaves were from the North, so it isn't beyond possibility. Douglas doesn't seem large enough, however, to be a leader of gladiators. One would expect a towering figure to be Spartacus. That said, this has a lot of adventure and intrigue. Most of the story deals with Spartacus as an alien force, focusing more on two factions of Roman citizens trying to win control of Rome. Of course, one must mention the famous line, when the gladiators are caught, and Spartacus is told to identify himself. I doubt that when the film was made that they realized this scene would become one of the ten greatest known of all time. A fun movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expansive but not really expressive; Kubrick's spectacular is entertaining but awfully dour...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kirk Douglas plays headstrong slave in the Roman Empire who revolts against the tyrannies, forming his own army made up of fellow slaves. Overlong epic directed by Stanley Kubrick and adapted from Howard Fast's book by the prolific Dalton Trumbo; terrifically entertaining for the most part--but, like all sagas, it has its peaks and valleys. Douglas consumes his role with relish, but Spartacus is a one-note character: all dour anger and downbeat proselytizing. Nevertheless, it's engrossing and certainly visually astounding (with Oscar-winning cinematography by Russell Metty). Other statues went to Best Supporting Actor Peter Ustinov for a predictably colorful performance as Batiatus, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, and Best Costume Design. Tony Curtis does well as Antoninus (a singing slave!), and has a subtly kinky encounter with ruler Laurence Olivier's Marcus that was deleted at the time but has now been restored (with Anthony Hopkins dubbing Olivier's lost vocal track). **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stanely Kubrick's Spartacus is a good epic of a film, but it is by no means perfect. Especially because this is Kubrick's only true Hollywood movie. Luckily, Kirk Douglas comes to the rescue as Spartacus. The gladiator who wants to be free. With his terrific acting abilities and gets the film going when it lulls. And even though the film does go over long, Kubrick still makes it work and gets a damn near close masterpiece here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ALMOST great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a wonderful film! It, along with PATHS OF GLORY and DR. STRANGELOVE, are my favorite Kubrick films. However, while I could find no fault with the other two films, there is ONE flaw that prevents this movie from being truly great: it just didn't know WHEN to end. When the Romans capture the rebels and announce that they will kill Spartacus but spare the others if they turn him over, the movie SHOULD have ended just AFTER all the rebel slaves stood up and announced "they were Spartacus". This would have made this movie PERFECT. Instead, it drug on for another 20-30 minutes trying to needlessly tie up all the loose ends. It was as if Hollywood would not allow the movie to end any other way.Just imagine the impact of ending the movie earlier followed by scenes of the thousands of impaled rebels as the closing credits rolled!!As for the rest of the film, the acting and screen writing were superb--as good as it gets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spartacus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched it in History, and then again on TV, and it is a fantastic film from Golden Globe nominated director Stanley Kubrick. Michael Douglas's Dad, Kirk Douglas is Spartacus, one of the greatest heroes well known for freeing and trying to save the slaves of Rome. The basic plot is that Spartacus and his friend Antoninus (Tony Curtis) used to be gladiators (obviously the inspiration for the Russel Crowe film), and when they escape Spartacus is the man who leads an army of men and women who have escaped slavery, and he is determined to help all those people get their freedom. He also wants to find real happiness with his true love Varinia (Jean Simmons) and their expected baby. The pretty evil Marcus Licinius Crassus (Golden Globe nominated Lord Sir Laurence Olivier), along with Sempronius Gracchus (Charles Laughton, in one of his last roles) and (slightly, although not fully evil) slave owner Lentulus Batiatus (Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated Sir Peter Ustinov) are determined to stop Spartacus, even when they do not know what he looks like. Oh, and I can see why the censors got rid of that scene between Olivier and Curtis, it is a bit of a homosexual moment, aka something gays will enjoy, but it is only a servant serving his master. Also starring John Gavin as Julius Caesar, The Ladykillers' Herbert Lom as Tigranes Levantus and Golden Globe nominated Woody Strode as Draba. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography and Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing and Best Music for Alex North, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Original Score. Spartacus was number 22 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains, Kirk Douglas was number 17, and Lord Sir Laurence Olivier number 14 on on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, Olivier was also number 21 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 3 on Britain's Finest Actors, and he was number 4 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for all the slaves standing and claiming "I'm Spartacus", it was number 62 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 25 on The 100 Greatest War Films, it was number 44 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, and it was number 64 on The 100 Greatest Films. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to understand why SK would associate his name with this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truly I find it almost impossible to understand why Kubrik signed this junk. Eyes Wide Shut was not his, but he had no power to oppose the studio decision because he was not alive at the time of the release. But why Spartacus?Take the opening scene which I'm not even sure it's his. The audience can see Ustinov coming with a black man. We know he is a slave because the outstanding racism. After all African men could be citizens in Ancient Rome, but not on the pure American screens. Now, the black man holds an umbrella only for himself as the shadow is only over him. Should this imply that the Roman slave owners were so stupid as not to direct the slave or only the director was so stupid not to notice that? Probably it was because the African man was too sensitive to be exposed to so much suffering going on and the slave owners were such animals that they did not feel the need for such a disguise.The above just happen after a KD who stops working before the very eyes of three Roman guards, than drops his load, under the caring eyes of the same guards and only after he starts helping up another slave they interfere. All this happens on a narrow path where slaves are going both ways - strange for a people who kept its name over ages because of their wide roads.And the viewer gets 3 painful hours of this kind of stupidity.</fullReview>

So let's make a list huh? Spartacus was NOT a white man. He was most likely a dark-haired olive-skinned Slav. See the A&amp;E miniseries to see how Spartacus should have been cast.The Gladiator from da bronx. "Yo spa-da-gus"...Enough said.The slaves taking on all of ancient rome. If you watch the Hollywood version you would think the Roman armies were incompetent clods who were mowed down by a rag-tag group of slaves. WRONG!! The slave revolt while initially successful, withered in the face of the Roman military. They did not take on 6 legions and beat each and every single one of them. THAT NEVER HAPPENED!! THEY DID NOT NOT HAVE FLAT TOPS IN ANCIENT...Wait, I mentioned that already.The Gladiator combat was ALL WRONG!!! Spartacus was NOT crucified. NOBODY KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM but he was most likely killed in the battle against Crassus.LAURENCE OLIVIER sucked!!!1 tHERE YOU GO</fullReview>
