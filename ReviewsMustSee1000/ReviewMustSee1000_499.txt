		<shortDescription>I'd pay Cash to see this Tango</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kurt Russell and Sylvester Stallone are the reason why this run-of-the-mill action flick actually works. There's nothing innovative or special about the film, it's nothing we haven't seen before (maybe just Russell in drag) but the film is entertaining as hell thanks to it's two stars.Stallone is Tango and Russell is Cash, two cops who get set up and sent to jail. They break out and go after the bad guys to clear their names.The film has got some excellent action scenes, particularly inside the prison and during the break out. It's got some nice eye candy courtesy of one Teri Hatcher. The script also delivers some very funny lines now and then. Couple that with the fact that I actually do like Stallone do comedy and Russell has always been somewhat of a mini favourite; Tango and Cash is very worthy of my time every once in a while.Downsides; Excellent actor Jack Palance is horrible in the cliché ridden bad guy role (I can't figure out if he's trying too hard or not at all) and the film has a really silly final 10 minutes where the action goes from cool to basically slapstick. Still, early 90's action fans should enjoy this flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely piece of kitsch from the 80's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the 80's, kitsch cinema had two main sections - gory horror movies and daft action films, of which this film obviously fits into the latter. While the gory horror movies of the eighties often lacked credibility, that section of kitsch movies beats the daft action films because of the much higher content of inventiveness; but more often than not, the daft action movies make for good entertainment, even if they're somewhat less than brilliant. Tango and Cash is a notable action movie because it stars two of the eighties most popular action stars - Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell, whose antagonistic partnership makes up the core of this movie. The plot device to get the maverick cops to work together is hardly important, but nevertheless it follows the two as a corrupt state buys into a plot by a criminal kingpin to land them both in jail, which promptly sees our hero's in with the masses of criminals they themselves have sent to the clink. As you can imagine, they're not the most well liked of inmates. Especially not by 'Maniac Cop' himself, Robert Z'Dar...The action in the movie comes thick and fast and this, when combined with the one-liner packed script make the movie feel more like a parody than a serious take on the genre. This is all good, however, as this movie is pure entertainment, and seeing two of the 80's hottest action stars fire off silly dialogue at one another is a treat to say the least. The action is over the top, and we get to watch our hero's do such things as slide down electrical cables and drive a souped up SUV around an explosion packed warehouse, and it makes for great entertainment. Of course, what the movie packs in action and snappy dialogue, it lacks in other areas such as credibility and depth; but nobody tunes into a kitschy 80's action movie for plot depth and sophistication, so blaming the movie for not offering these things is ridiculous. On the whole, if you're after a good two hours of solid action fare, you could certainly do a lot worse than Tango and Cash. This movie packs a lot of punch, delivered by two strong leading men. Thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unadulterated Sheer Brilliance, the Perfect Film?..Tango and Cash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This masterpiece of Americana is perhaps the Greatest film ever made. The amalgamation of Sylvester Stallone's sheer magnetism, and Kurt Russell's commanding stage presence, has yielded a sonnet the likes of which all Films aspire to be. Stallone portrays "Raymond 'Ray' Tango" a highly decorated narcotics detective from Beverly Hills, who penchant for the stock market, has granted him not only the finer things in life but also a means to express his sophisticated nature and aspirations of financial independence. Stallone masterfully shows the dichotomy of a character who is highly educated and well mannered, yet is beset in a cesspool of crime and depravity, Tango yearns for a better society yet will not rest on his laurels of law and order. "Gabriel 'Gabe' Cash" portrayed by the immaculate Kurt Russell, is the antipodean of Stallone's level headed Tango. Cash is pugnacious, assertive, and zealous yet his diligence to enforce law and order at all cost define this tortured soul. Although this crass inner city detective has a disheveled appearance and tough exterior he is simply trying to hide his true feelings and desires for true love in an otherwise barbaric society. The story begins as these two rival officers are competing for the title of LA's best cop. Although their methods and approaches differ, their goals are the same; to imprison Yves Perret a diabolical drug lord who catches wind of the duos escapades. With his Criminal Empire in danger of being toppled, Perret masterfully played by Jack Pallance, enacts his plan to destroy the two. In an act of carnal malevolence he frames them for the murder of an undercover FBI agent. Perret's corruption and debauchery know no bounds, as he weaves a duplicitous web of conspiracy the likes of which have not been seen since the Warren Commission. Evidence is tampered, so-called experts bribed, and in an attempt to save their lives, Tango and Cash agree to a plea bargain, under the guise that they will be sent to a Minimum Security prison, not amongst the general population. Perret then has them sent to a Maximum Security faculty amongst inmates that have been jailed by the two supercops, in an attempt to have them assassinated. Tango and Cash must then set aside their petty differences and discover the true meaning of friendship to escape the prison to clear their once proud names, and stop Perret once and for all, in a conclusion that will rattle even the sternest of men. The chemistry between Stallone and Russell is reminiscent of Redford and Newman, if not greater, with snide remarks being made by both parties. The action, adventure, and violence are non-stop, yet the humanity of the characters is prevalent throughout the film, adding a much needed dimension to an otherwise cliché and tired genre. Tango is not just a mindless cop, he is multidimensional protagonist, who hearkens to the days of Bogart and Cary Grant. Cash desires the admiration of a women to complete himself, which he finds in Catherine "kiki" Tango, he is not simply a generic action hero who shoots guns and makes wise ass remarks, Cash has a quintessence and Russell pours his soul into the character. All in all this film is the crowning achievement of Stallone and Russell and the Hollywood film industry. It is a cut of history, when master Artisans the like of Russell and Stallone are brought together at their peak with visionaries leading them to produce what is their destiny??..FUBAR!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not real in the least...but still fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of the reviews for this film use the word "fun", which is code for "unreal", "ridiculous", "silly". That pretty much sums up this umpteenth foray into the cop/buddy flick. The slight difference is the two guys aren't partners, but city rivals. But, as usual, they detest each other, battle a big bad guy, and have a sexy girl caught between them. One of the zillion unreal elements begins with these two guys constantly grabbing headlines in LA. Now, I've lived near LA all my life. Not once has there ever been an officer who was a superstar/celebrity type of superior abilities. And, as we usually see in movies, these guys are non-uniformed, fancy car driving studs. Anyway, off to the plot. The two guys are hated by an aged, wealthy drug runner (Palance). For reasons only known to him, he doesn't want the two simply capped in the head and out of the way. I assume he wants to physically and mentally torture them, so he orchestrates a, yet once more unreal, frame-up that lands the two in jail. There's even an obligatory "You're goin' down for this" from a fellow officer at the scene of the crime. Then, on the inside, ALL the guards are corrupt, which allows prisoners to roam the grounds at will, the powerful drug guy to pay visits, Russell and Stallone to be tortured in a boiler room, etc. Each guy has a friend on his side, Russell the warden, Stallone his captain. Now it's odd that the captain, who knows Stallone is innocent, fails to share this with other authoroties. Even the address of a henchman that he's obtained. After a prison break, there's the big bad finale where the two take on armies of machine gun blasting toadies of Palance's. Then a dopey final gunshot that puts an exclamation point on the list of unreal moments. Now, with all that said, why did I still like this? The dynamite script. Feldman provides a ton of one-liners and comic moments, which aided the implausibility of the proceedings. Not to mention some nicely shot moments of action. So, for a good "turn off your brain" adventure where you'll be asked to go easy on quality, give this a shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take time and watch this, you won't regret it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite what the rating says here at IMDb, take time and see this action flick, you'll enjoy it. Ray Tango (Stallone) and Gabriel Cash (Russel) are two rival Los Angeles cops, considered the best, that get framed for a murder they didn't commit. They get put away in prison, facing some of the criminals they've busted! Tango and Cash become, um, sort of "buddies" while in jail. The convicts have their fun with the both of them for awhile until they devise an escape plan, and do get out. Once Tango and Cash escape, they must find out who it was that framed them and find a way to clear themselves from that crime they've been wrongfully accused of while trying to not get caught.This is a good action flick, with a lot of comedy put into it, perhaps more than the directors would have anticipated. This movie will keep you glued to your television. It is predictable but it has good action and as I said very good comedy. 7/10, recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Who's The Best Cop In LA?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It looks to me like everyone was having one rollicking good time making Tango&amp;Cash. This is the kind of film that you have to take as seriously as an Indiana Jones adventure. After all their can be only one Indy.But in this case we've a pair of cowboy cops who work in different parts of Los Angeles. Sylvester Stallone as Ray Tango and Kurt Russell as Gabe Cash are certainly known to each other however due to the headlines they've gathered smashing various criminal enterprises. They're also known to master criminal Jack Palance the Professor Moriarty of the film and he's rigged one elaborate plan for their disgrace and downfall and death.As much as Stallone and Russell are enjoying spoofing their own action images, this film is absolutely stolen by Jack Palance. With tongue firmly in cheeking and hands twirling some imaginary mustache ends in the best Snidely Whiplash tradition, Palance is having a ball with his part.Of course even when they're in the worst of trouble there's still that oneupsmanship that Russell and Stallone can't shake. And when Russell shows an interest in Teri Hatcher whom he later finds out is Stallone's sister, things could really have gotten interesting if it weren't for the joint problems they both were having.When you watch this film, do not for one instant take it seriously and I guarantee a real hoot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheesy, dated, clichéd, predictable and basic but the lead performances and silly dialogue make it silly fun for those in the mood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tango is a smooth cop who dresses like a banker, deals in stocks and shares but loves the action. Cash is a rough and ready action man who lives life fast and dirty but is a better cop for it. Each man serves on opposite sides of the LA and both are thorns in the side of crime kingpin Yves Perret ? accountable for losing him millions in seized drugs and weapons. Rather than just have them killed, Perret sets them both up for the murder of an undercover cop supposedly in a sting operation. With all the evidence against them they cop a plea for minimum-security sentence ? which they don't get. With a violent and angry welcome for them, Tango and Cash decide they need to escape soon or be carried out ? plus, bringing down Perret is now their sole focus.Although I know just what this film was going to be like, I thought I'd try to give it a chance and watch it again with a fresh pair of eyes. Nothing about the plot summary would lead you to expect anything other than a clichéd action movie and all that comes with it. And that is almost exactly what you get with this. The plot is predictable and really you are just watching it go through the motions and do just what you expect it to at almost every stage. The action is typically over-the-top and lacking the touch of realism that is usually needed to make it really engaging and exciting ? instead it is noisy and overblown, managing to be quite fun but certainly not gripping or involving. The character dynamics are also clichéd ? it is love/hate, bantering, mismatched cops stuff but ironically it actually works pretty well. The main reason for this is that the script shows that at least Feldman wasn't taking it too seriously ? the dialogue allows both to mock each other and stops them settling into their macho images too much.Happily both Stallone and Russell buy into it and let themselves be made fun of as much as they get to give it. Neither are brilliant but at least they seem to have got the joke and avoid playing it too straight or just going along with the macho clichés. Of course they eventually get back to basics and (along with the film) eventually just gets down to big bangs and action movie traditions but for the majority of the film they just about do enough to make it fun ? albeit fun in a silly, rather guilty way. Hatcher doesn't add a great deal but it is interesting to see how good she looked then and how well she has aged in the past 15 or so years. Palance hams it up something awful and is a little painful to watch ? but he is matched by equally poor bad guys from James, Hong and a few others. Pollard does his usual stuff and is typical comic relief.Overall this is a dumb action movie and if you hate that type of film then you will hate this. I must admit that, by the end, the sheer cheesy stupidity of the whole thing had started to grate on me somewhat but up till that point it had been silly and quite fun. The amusing banter is one plus and at least Stallone and Russell aren't taking it too seriously for the most part and provide enough to stop it being a totally predictable genre film ? even if it is a close run thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Although a poor man's Lethal weapon, this is a lot better than you might think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so this isn't the greatest film ever made. In fact, it isn't even remotely the best buddy-buddy flick ever made. But surprisingly enough, this is actually quite a winner, and succeeds far more in being a parody of the Lethal-Weapon style films than say... Loaded Weapon does. This is for several reasons.Firstly, Stallone is the star of the show here, turning in a self-mocking parody of his own screen persona. He is flash and indestructable, yet the film acknowledges and exploits this to comedic ends. Secondly, Palance is excellent as a sneering and menacing bad guy, plotting the two cops downfall. He deserved more screen time than he actually got, and actually did a good job of being the obligatory stereotypical bad-guy.However, the best thing of all about this film is the snappy dialogue. There is so much good banter between the two-cops that no matter how bizarre the film's scenario's get, the dialogue rescues it.The first time I saw this, I enjoyed it and was only really let down by the ending, which feels hollow and unsatisfying in comparison to the first two reels of the film. However, this nagging problem alone, I have no hesitation in recommending this to any fan of the action-genre.Overall: 6 1/2 out of 10.</fullReview>

Stallone does a pretty good job being the low key guy here, Russell the loose cannon, there are gun fights, fights, escapes, the great prison getaway, fun byplay between the two leads, oodles of belief suspending needed and scads of stunt doubles used all through here.My memory is mostly of Sly in the glasses, the Pickup from Hell, a lotta car chases and a real 'this is a spoof' air to it all.

		<fullReview>Excellent action, intense suspense, and a great action/comedy story line.This is an excellent fast-paced action/comedy. I truly enjoyed all aspects of this production, from the screenplay to the set design.Russell and Stallone turn in top notch, professional work in this enjoyable endeavor. While the action was good, fluid, and well executed, the movie never once loses its main focus: that wonderful plot. The plot is extremely well written. While there are two major flaws to the credibility of the story line, I found this attempt to be at least as good as Lethal Weapon 2.I found this production to be innovative, fun, and highly entertaining. It had everything a good action movie needs to make it successful; excellent character development, imaginative direction, professional performances by the cast and crew, a clever and witty screenplay with intelligent dialog, and action...lots of good fast-paced, well-delivered action. It had a fresh comedic element, and, even though at times, director Andrei Konchalovsky does turn to juvenile antics to solicit a chuckle from us, the comedy was mostly about as intelligent as you can expect from Sly and Russell, and expertly-delivered.It rates a 6.3/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite a very problematic ending, Tango and Cash still has plenty to make it an at least enjoyable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tango and Cash is one of those films that people can get a huge amount of enjoyment out of when taking it for what it is, or there will be others who'll find it not to their taste. From personal taste, there are a number of shortcomings but I cannot bring myself to hate it.Pros: It's stylishly made, if very 80s, and competently directed, nothing comes over as amateurish. The soundtrack does pulsate with energy and is easy to remember, if a little intrusive in places(not that that is uncommon in action films). The script is snappy and delivered like dynamite, the banter between Stallone's Tango and Kurt Russell's Cash is a lot of fun. The story on the whole while very silly and predictable but it doesn't really ever become dull and it is easy to follow, the standout scenes being the opening, which is one of those scenes that sets things up so well it makes one excited for what will happen next and the brilliant prison escape, the prison scenes in general are among the better scenes in the film actually. The action, while very over-the-top, is decently edited, cool and endearingly kitsch without feeling too much. Sylvester Stallone is charismatic and effectively low-key and shows that he is at ease in the action scenes, his comic timing while much criticised in general is pretty good here, while Kurt Russell is a witty, soulful partner, the two of them being a well-matched pair. It is not everyday where you see Russell in drag, don't worry it is not as weird as it sounds.Cons: Tango and Cash does have problems. The biggest problem is that it falls apart in the final 10 minutes, an ending so disappointing that it's easy to bring the film down more than one notch. It loses the energy that the rest of the film has and it goes well overboard in the silliness factor, with the slapsticky final fight feeling out of kilter. The main villain Perrett's comeuppance is also very anti-climatically handled. Teri Hatcher is probably at her sexiest here but her acting feels vapid. More problematic are the villains, here are very stereotypically written(especially Perrett, the drugs baron stereotype has been done a number of times and nothing interesting is done here) and only Brion James, here looking as if he is having so much fun, is memorable. You'd think that Jack Palance, a master of suavity, deadpan and intimidating menace, would be, but here he gives one of his weakest performances but it is not helped by that he is very underused and that he is the most clichéd character in the whole film. Palance was a great actor, and excelled better than most in villain roles but this is a portrayal where he does try way too hard that he's almost pantomimic, it also manages to be quite bland compared to his usual standard. His henchmen are even more blandly written, and sees James Hong in a rare completely uninvolved performance.All in all, won't work for some and it is a long way from flawless but still incredibly entertaining and has a good deal of charm. Don't expect sophistication, anything new or depth, you'll be disappointed. In its defence though Tango and Cash never strived to be that kind of film. But if you are looking for an enjoyable, switch-your-brain-off-at-the-door film, there is a good deal to like. 6/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is NOT F.U.B.A.R.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is not F.U.B.A.R. However, it did teach me what that term means. It's not often that a film this cheesy, this good can enter your heart. "Tango &amp; Cash" isn't just a movie. It's an institution.The common mistake many people make when they view this film is that they judge it in a conventional way. Bad move. Why? Because when you judge it in a conventional way, you get a seemingly bad film. For example, one-dimensional characters, cookie-cutter plot, one-liners every minute, etc.However, this film rises above the conventions of film making. Sly and Kurt have a good chemistry, and that more than carries the film. However, this film has the added benefit of cheese.Why are cheesy films looked down upon? Sure, in real life criminal masterminds can't lease/buy a former military base. Of course they never have a mechanized infantry. Surely even if they did, two men with a fully armed SUV wouldn't be able to conquer such a criminal empire.I suppose I should have labeled that a spoiler, but is it? Is there any doubt how a movie like this is going to end? No, and that's the beauty of it.If you like cheese, you will LOVE this film. If you don't like cheese, then you should probably watch your copy of "Titanic" for the 100th time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe it's the passing of time but one of my old favourites...is simply not anymore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember back in my early teens when my movie watching obsession really broke. I discovered Stallone and 80's action films and just was completely hooked. I remember Tango and Cash being paramount to that obsession. It was a buddy cop film with Stallone and Russell and it was just awesome. So I decided after probably a decade or more since I'd seen it last to try it again. Imagine my surprise when I was nearly completely disappointed. I still remember my favourite parts but they didn't have the same effect on me. I found the film really vapid, empty, pointless, silly and the constant barrage of homosexual innuendo humour was honestly more than I could handle. Maybe I was too young to notice it then but it was irritating. The story is so weak its unbelievable. Even the action scenes lack a certain punch and the final showdown in the gravel pit (which I fondly remembered being AWESOME) wasn't so awesome this time around. A lot of stuff explodes for no reason and it is so over the top that it loses credibility. The film starts strong because the opening scene with Stallone chasing a tanker truck is undeniably awesome as well as his "Rambo...was a p***y" line which was truly outstanding. There are many, many one liners in the film, some are good, some are forgettable so it has that going for it. But it was a total miss for me this time around sadly.I am a huge Sylvester Stallone fan and I did enjoy his Tango character. He is sort of uptight and proper and looks very dapper in his suit and glasses in the beginning. I found him sort of weak though further on in the film and really lacking that Stallone charisma. Kurt Russell is the wild and unpredictable Cash. He is good as the unhinged, scruffy and crude street wise cop. Together the two of them have decent chemistry but not outstanding. Their banter feels a little forced and his sarcasm almost becomes too much. Their moments when they work together are awfully cheesy (high fives?!) but with a better script I think they would have been great together. Teri Hatcher has a mostly small role as Stallone's sister and the object of Russell's fascination. Her role barely makes a blip in the film and she's only recognizable because of what she has become now in Television. Her character is to give them something to fight for and she does that and only that. The legendary Jack Palance should be the absolutely perfect 80's action film villain. He seems absolutely ideal and his few scenes are done well with his trademark suave personality. The problem is that he is underused and almost made comical instead of a worthy adversary. Brion James was almost a better villain and used far more properly as Palance's number one henchman. There is a great fight scene between him and Stallone.Tango and Cash has become an 80's cult classic and I suppose I am being so hard on it because I remember loving it so much. Maybe I just have higher expectations now or maybe it doesn't hold up well to time. Russian director Andrey Konchalovskiy has a lot of credits but it would seem this was his only mainstream action flick so that a bit of an odd choice for director. I would hazard to guess that his heart wasn't really in it. I suppose when you're looking for the quintessential buddy copy films that in many ways this fits the bill but I just felt like I held in such high regard that seeing it now left a bad taste in my mouth. It has shoot outs, fights, a prison break, car chases and explosions galore but it all felt mostly empty. It has some killer one liners and some genuinely good action sequences but something was definitely missing. 5.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tango &amp; Cash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ray Tango (Sylvester Stallone) and Garbriel Cash (Kurt Russell) are both cops and good at uncovering illegal drug deals but they can't stand each other. Tango - the fine dressing gentleman - and Cash ? the guy from the hood ? have to work together to save their lives and careers after they both get framed by a drug lord (Jack Palance) and get sentenced to jail.I really like Kurt Russell and Stallone isn't a bad actor either but in here they both really lower the bar in their acting, way low. The buddy-cop premise doesn't work between the two ? and the two actors don't seem to care as long as they're getting paid for it. It doesn't help that the script isn't really working either. Teri Hatcher as the compulsory eye-candy also does the only thing she knows how to ? which is looking good. Jack Palance does the same routine as he did in Batman (1989); 1989 must have been a pretty convenient year for Jack: playing one character and cashing two checks from two different films. Thet's real Hollywood Magic for you.The good thing with the film is that it has a nice 80's -vibe in it. The music, the visual style ? so generic but comfortable and entertaining. So, you watch the film once...What keeps you from watching it again are the action sequences, the script and the editing which all lack quality very badly; plot holes, incoherent action sequences, poor directing ? the film's bewitched. The final showdown (it's a 80's action movie, what else there could be other than a showdown at the end?) for example is horrible; for no reason the film turns into Carmageddon (or something) by bringing cars with mounted assault riffles and rocket launchers to the screen ? it's ridiculous. Also there's a lot of cars and security who just disappear into thin air due to some odd editing in that scene...In conclusion, the film was a nice idea on paper which turned into something hellish in production. Some of it was bad luck (I assume), some of it was lack of talent, some of it just poor judgement. Whatever the case might have been, the film's bad, it's simple as that. Even Kurt Russell couldn't walk away from this car-accident on his own two feet. 1/4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stallone Ends The 80's With A Camp Whimper, Rather Than A Bang!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Continuing my plan to watch every Sly Stallone movie in order, I come to 1989's Tango &amp; CashPlot In A Paragraph: L.A's top two cops Tango (Stallone) and Cash (Kurt Russell) are jailed, after being framed for murder, and must escape to clear their names. Suited up and wearing his own glasses Stallone looks great in this (and he should since he had someone fired since the were not lighting him well enough) Russell is at his wise cracking charismatic best, whilst Palance is in full pantomime villain mode. In a world where no matter the situation, a hero always has a funny quip, and an unlimited supply of bullets, it's easy to watch with your brain in neutral, but it poor film making, and just not very good.How on earth did this movie miss like it did?? Sly and Kurt Russell in a buddy cop movie, with Jack Palance as the bad guy and Teri Hatcher as a love interest. Well the production was beset with problems from the start. The intended star, Patrick Swayze, dropped out to star in Roadhouse. As with 'Lock Up' principal photography began without a completed script. Sylvester Stallone had the original director of photography, Barry Sonnenfeld, fired. Then, the producer, Jon Peters, fired the director, Andrey Konchalovskiy. The film ultimately went $20 million over budget and had to be completely reedited by Stuart Baird prior to release.Once again, Stallone altered the script!! One example on this occasion was when Brion James was originally hired to play Requin, it was a very small role with only two lines. In an effort to give the character something that would make him stand out, James decided to speak in a cockney accent. Stallone loved it, and rewrote the entire script to give Requin a much bigger role.It's one of the worst movies in Stallones post 'Rocky' filmography!! Utter none sense, but camp fun. When it could have been the start of a Lethal Weapon style franchise. Instead it's a missed opportunity and a mess like Cobra.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic 80's action/comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sly and Kurt bring down the thunder in this 80's buddy cop classic. As far as action/comedies go I regard Tango And Cash as one of the best. Tango And Cash are LA supercops that get set up by a narcotics kingpin. They escape from prison, bust some heads, shoot many bad guys and crack a lot of jokes. While this is par for course for the genre, this was done well and of course Kurt and Sly are fantastic. The support cast is super solid with Teri Hatcher as Ray Tango's gorgeous sister as well as Geoffrey Lewis, Brion James and Jack Palance as main super villain. In the beginning of the film there is Sly's homage to Police Story. For those that don't know, Sly is an admirer of Jackie Chan's work and they are real good friends as well. Anyway you slice it Tango And Cash rock the house and is a timeless action classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the first real action flick I ever watched as a kid, so maybe it's nostalgia.Maybe instead, it's all of the awesome one-liners in this movie.Don't get me wrong: this is a super campy 80s action flick, and the cheese is very thick.But it's still an absolutely wonderful movie.Between Brion James' laughably bad cockney accent, to Jack Palance's eminent awesomeness, this movie has everything: completely unnecessary nudity, plenty of profanity, people jumping from explosions, and a little bit of the awesome Clint Howard!This is one of the few movies I can watch again and again and again.So if you want an evening with a little bit of 80s campiness, and you've already watched Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles recently, this movie's for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Corny Yet Satisfying Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you go to the movies to see an action movie you can expect there to be action and along with it usually cheesy lines. This movie does both of these with style."Tango &amp; Cash" is the story of when the two best cops in L.A. (the titular characters) are framed for committing murder and are forced to go on the run. These cops are very different in the ways they go about their work and will have to work together if they are going to find and attain their unknown enemy.This movie was made in the 80s and you can definitely tell that just by watching the opening scene where Tango (Sylvester Stallone) stops an oncoming truck by shooting it and then saying a quick punchline to the situation. This is continued into the future of the movie with the corny dialog and situations getting better at times and then being absolutely cringe worthy. Although the movie is extremely cheesy something that sticks out in this movie is that the movie doesn't take itself too seriously with the situations that they get in being crazy and the characters often being sarcastic and seemingly aware of how ridiculous what they're doing really is. The sort of comedic and almost parodic way a lot of the film is shot just levels up the quality of this movie rather than lowers it because it was done very well. This is better than if it was a completely serious slug fest that had these crazy actions sequences that just didn't make sense trying to make you think it was a realistic.Speaking of the action, well it's great. The action in this movie is great from the start to finish because it's unrealistic but a whole lot of fun. There's a great feel to the action because you obviously know they're not going to get killed but you ride through the bumps and turns as they go through them and you enjoy them immensely. The stunts and the shoot outs are really quite awesome and if you enjoy a good old 80s action movie you will assuredly like this movie.The acting in this movie isn't exactly a work of art with the movie more focusing on action and comedy rather than how the actors delivered their corny lines. Stallone does an OK job but at times it slightly felt like he drifted in and out of character with him during the action sequences not being the character that was set up early in the movie. Kurt Russel as Cash does a good job and is the highlight of the acting in this movie with the portrayal of his character both being entertaining and bad ass. The two lead's chemistry is just about first rate with the two of them playing off each other and together spewing out classic puns and punchlines. The acting by lead actress Teri Hatcher who plays Kiki however, is in one word awful. She delivers her lines in a monotone voice and doesn't do a good job in anyway shape or form.Overall "Tango &amp; Cash" is a 'good leave your brain at the candy bar film' with good comedic scenes and fabulous action but corny dialog and bad acting. If you do forget to put on your smarty pants and enjoy it for what it is you will have a much better time with it. I recommend this movie to people that love action films that aren't too serious and can have a laugh at themselves. If you want a serious cop drama you may be looking in the wrong place with this movie.I rate this movie a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tango &amp; Cash come together to stop a very smart crime lord</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tango &amp; Cash Tango &amp; Cash (Warner Bros., 1989) tells the story of two men looking to be the best LAPD detective there is by going about different ways. Ray Tango (Sylvester Stallone) is a top L.A cop who works the big time and makes a lot of money which he shows off by the clothes and car he drives. The film starts in a fast car chase with Tango chasing a gas truck down the highway. He speeds in front and shoots the window, which in turns stops the truck. Police swarm in and start yelling at him for stopping a truck for no reason so he shoots the tank and cocaine pours out. One cop says to Tango he's reckless and thinks he's Rambo, Then Tango replies Rambo is a pussy. The action and the comedy at the start sets the tone for the rest of the movie. Gabe Cash (Kurt Russell) is a L.A cop who thinks he's the best and lives a lower class live. He goes after the guys that Tango won't waste his time on. These two end up pissing the main villain crime lord Yves Perret (Jack Palance) off, who sets in motion a plan to get Tango &amp; Cash arrest and sent to a prison to have them killed, with the help of dirty cops. While in prison they end up joining forces to escape alive. They are tortured and beat up pretty bad, but with the help of Gabe Cash's friend and former commanding officer they make it to the top of the prison and use their belts to slide down a power line. They then go to Tango's sister's work, Katherine "Kiki" Tango (Teri Hatcher) helps them to her house. Cash and Kiki start to fall in love which pisses Tango off and there's a quick fight between the two. Soon Tango &amp; Cash come together with a plan to stop for good Perret. They go to Cash's friend Owen (Michael J. Pollard) who loan them a weapon equipped truck and then they storm Perret's compound. Once inside they find out Perret's henchmen has Katherine, they end up killing the henchmen and then see Perret holding a gun to Katherine at which time Tango &amp; Cash shoot him. They escape before the building explodes in the truck and joke about Cash wanting to date Katherine. It was a great movie with a lot of action and comedy. Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell play well of each other and use real life issues in their lives in the movie, like When Tango and Cash escape from the prison, Cash turns to Tango and asks if he stopped "for coffee and a Danish." Tango (Sylvester Stallone) says, "I hate Danish," an in-joke referring to his recent divorce from Danish actress Brigitte Nielsen. All in all a good movie in the action genre and worth seeing for any fan of Kurt Russell and Sylvester Stallone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely macho cult classic that it's hard not to enjoy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The production of this movie was full of problems from the very beginning. Firstly, the intended star, Patrick Swayze dropped out to make "Road house" instead , then principal photography began without a completed script. Sylvester Stallone had the original director of photography Barry Sonnenfeld fired and replaced by Donald E. Thorin. Then, the director, Andrey Konchalovskiy was fired by producer Jon Peters and replaced by Albert Magnoli. The official reason is that Konchalovskiy went 20 million $ over budget (which is true) , but the unofficial reason were the creative differences between Peters and Konchalovskiy (producer wanted to make a spoof , director wanted more serious movie). Stallone was working unofficially as producer, director and writer and held the project together. The film had to be completely reedited by Stuart Baird prior to its release. It explains why some of scenes from the trailer are deleted. Gary Chang provided additional music to the film because Harold Faltermeyer could not return to re-score the final reel of the film as it was constantly being edited. Behind the scenes work must have been an absolute nightmare , yet the ending result is an incredibly entertaining piece of kitsch. "Tango and Cash" is as good as it gets when it comes to cheesy, violent, exciting action movie escapism. It's not a serious film and it nearly verges on parody. It shouldn't be viewed in a conventional way ? the characters are one-dimensional, one-liners appear every minute, plot is illogical and unrealistic , etc. There's nothing innovative (OK , they aren't partners, but city rivals )or special about the film, it's nothing we haven't seen before , but the film is entertaining as hell.From the very beginning we are experiencing a live action cartoon atmosphere . The characters are larger than life and the overall atmosphere is nicely over the top. "Tango and Cash" not only parodies other films of this genre ("Lethal weapon" , "Police story") , but also realizes that it's silly and makes fun of itself. Director Andrey Konchalovskiy keeps the movie moving along at a nonstop breakneck pace. There isn't a SINGLE dull moment here , the energy is never dropped .The action is loud and over the top in delicious way ( the final showdown at warehouse feels like a computer game). The witty script by Randy Feldman has tons of memorable and quotable one liners and dialogue ( ""I'd pay cash to see this tango" , "FUBAR" , "Ok, let's do it" , "Rambo is a pussy"). The chemistry between Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell is FANTASTIC. The banter is so good and quick and feels completely natural. They make an excellent team. Stallone wears real glasses (his own) and is convincing as the gentleman cop , while Russell steals the show as the cop with too much energy. The supporting cast is good too . Teri Hatcher is HOT , Jack Palance and Brion James are fun villains. It was also good to see Geoffrey Lewis and James Wong.The cinematography by Donald E. Thorin is slick , while Harold Faltermeyer creates a funky and catchy soundtrack (the main theme !). There are 2 great songs here : Yazoo "Don't go" and Bad English "Best of what I got". There is lot of destruction and humor."Tango and Cash" delivered what it promised: popcorn entertainment. It's pure escapism and fun. It shouldn't be taken too seriously (just like Indiana Jones movies). Big action and hilarious banter between the two leads ensure full satisfaction on every viewing. It's a masterpiece of brainless entertainment and the true essence of a guilty pleasure, which really deserved a sequel. I give it 8/10 because I'm trying to be objective , but deep down in my heart it's a strong 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A small film to just laugh at the na?veté and superficiality of action films. But it is a good think to laugh from time to time. The only serious thing is that the police in Los Angeles, LAPD as well as FBI, is rotten to the core of the core, the heart of the heart, soul, mind and brain, and even probably the tripe and the gut. But that is no secret and it is not close to changing in the near future.The two cops are heroes, then framed, then thrown into prison among the criminals they have managed to send to prison, then they escape, then they clean themselves up and destroy a whole drug cartel, and finally they are heroes again.The action is both spectacular and not too expensive. It is a film for teenagers, teeny boppers if I can say so, in the summer or something like that. Parents can sleep peacefully, there is nothing that can be seen as or said to be in anyway off the straight line of don't ask don't tell don't say don't do and any other don't you may think of.Enjoy the trip into mentally-challenged Hollywood productions, where big wheels means little brainsDr Jacques COULARDEAU</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An immensely entertaining late 80's buddy cop action comedy treat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Neat, dapper, suave Ray Tango (a pleasingly wry performance by Sylvester Stallone) and loud, boorish, scruffy Gabe Cash (Kurt Russell in peak slobby form) are the two top cops in Los Angeles. The mismatched "Odd Couple"-style pair get sent to prison on trumped-up charges by cunning crime kingpin Yves Perret (essayed with deliciously hammy brio by Jack Palance). The duo escape from the joint and go after Perret. Director Andrei Konchavlovsky, working from a witty script by Randy Feldman, keeps the snappy pace hurtling along at a nonstop breakneck pace, stages the rousing action set pieces with rip-roaring verve (a protracted prison breakout and the wild pull out all the stops explosive finale rate as the definite heart-pounding highlights), and maintains a cheerfully ridiculous tongue-in-cheek tone throughout. The excellent cast of familiar faces further energize the lively proceedings: Stallone and Russell have an absolute blast sending up their larger-than-life macho screen images, the insanely foxy Teri Hatcher lights up the screen as Tango's sweet hottie dancer sister Katherine, Brion James sports a red ponytail and an alarmingly atrocious British accent as Perret's slimy limey henchman Requin, the enormous Robert Z'Dar displays all the galvanizing ferocity of a rabid pit bull as vicious hoodlum Face, and Michael J. Pollard contributes an amusing turn as flaky weapons master Owen. Moreover, we've got nifty support from Geoffrey Lewis as Ray's disapproving superior Captain Schroeder, Eddie Bunker as the gruff Captain Holmes, James Hong as smooth crime lord Quan, Marc Alaimo as antsy fellow underworld boss Lopez, and Clint Howard as deranged psycho convict Slinky. Better still, there's even a hysterically over-pronounced streak of rampant homoeroticism complete with the inevitable prison shower scene and an especially gut-busting piece of cross-dressing courtesy of Kurt Russell. Donald E. Thorin's slick cinematography gives the picture an attractive glossy look. Harold Faltermeyer's jaunty, rousing score likewise hits the exciting spot. A really fun flick.</fullReview>

Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell are two hero cops who seem untouchable until a big time crime lord (Jack Palance in yet another bad guy role) sets them up and lands them in prison.The idea and initial plot premise aren't bad, but they are soon completely ruined by the ridiculous chain of events that make up this film. Although we're never really meant to take it seriously, the lack of real entertainment coupled with an over the top approach which takes things way too far, means the audience is left disappointed.Look for the funny opening scene when Sly actually manages to send up his own tough guy image with one line. After that, it's downhill all the way.Monday, August 2, 1993 - T.V.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever been on a trip without a map?That's what "Tango and Cash" feels like; everyone knows where they're going, but they just don't know how to get there.There are a lot of laughs in this movie. In fact, the laugh ratio scores higher than the action, explosions and buddy elements do. That may not be what they had in mind, but it kept me entertained most of the way.Stallone and Russell do what they can, Hatcher is window dressing and the worst fate is held for Palance (as it usually is). Does he look like an Yves Perret? No, he doesn't act like one, either. He just looks and acts like Palance: hitting his marks and saying his lines, earning his paycheck like a good trooper. He saved the good stuff for "City Slickers", most likely.As far as good acting goes, look to Lewis as Stallone's commander and Pollard as a little guy who makes stuff for Russell to battle crime with. Do LA cops really need guys like Pollard? Maybe not, but they do come in handy.The rest of this is just action scenes that are pretty boring if you're familiar with cop movies, buddy scenes that don't quite mesh and a shower scene in prison that, as far as laughs go, is the highlight of the whole thing. Should you brave "Tango and Cash", you'll agree: as a cop buddy movie, it makes a great comedy.Five stars, and don't flatter yourself...Pee-Wee.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so maybe 'classic' is a little generous to describe Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell's collaboration 'Tango and Cash,' but just because it isn't up there with 'The Godfather' doesn't mean that it isn't a whole load of daft fun. Our two action heroes play the two titular characters ? both 'hero' cops in L.A. who get framed by a mob boss for a crime they didn't commit and have to then go about proving their innocence.Stallone and Russell make it watchable as they're both clearly enjoying themselves in their roles (special mention to Kurt when he dresses up in women's clothes!) and that's about all the film is good for. Jack Palance is the villain whose scenes seem to have been filmed after the filming and then just dropped in afterwards. He does his best to be menacing, but because he never properly interacts with our heroes, he seems almost a bit redundant.You may have heard the phrase 'suspend your disbelief.' Well, this is one film where, if you're to get anything out of it at all, you have to do just that. Nothing really makes sense if you scrutinise it. The story bounces from one action-packed ridiculous scene to the next with no real explanation for what has gone on in order to get our protagonists to that stage. It almost feels like a computer game where you're watching one stand-alone level after the next.I enjoyed 'Tango and Cash,' but I'm quite aware that some people will find it too ridiculous to appreciate. When I watched it, my group were laughing at just how bizarre and totally stupid things were getting. Take, for example, the scene where our cops are finally sent to prison ? the head mob boss visits them one night ? yes, he actually 'breaks in' to prison ? then, when the fighting starts, he just 'breaks out' again and no one really says anything. Then you have scenes involving car chases where the heroes' vehicle changes from one scene to the next. It's just bad. But, like I said, if you're in the mood to suspend your disbelief, it's actually quite good fun.Sure, it may be a 'poor man's Lethal Weapon' but if you like your 'buddy cop' movies loud and dumb, you should get something out of this. Did I mention Kurt Russell 'drags up?' Just don't get me started on one of the henchmen's awful attempt at a cockney accent!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ray Tango (Sylvester Stallone) is a neatly-dressed rich Beverly Hills cop. Gabriel Cash (Kurt Russell) is a street-tough disheveled L.A. cop. They are both outstanding narcotics detectives and thorns in the side of drug lord Yves Perret (Jack Palance). They get set up for killing an undercover federal agent in a drug deal and sent to a prison with criminals the pair locked up over the years.This starts with a couple of big action scenes. However, it's not until twenty minutes when the duo gets together. It also seems to be their first meeting. These two are set up for a standard combative buddy cop duo. It's missing the buddy part for too long. The trial rings false and the plea is even worst. On paper, this duo is a fun buddy cop movie. It doesn't turn out that way on the screen. It is so broad (not a pun on cross-dressing Kurt Russell) that it does have some camp value. The Teri Hatcher reveal is fun but this is a generally bad movie.</fullReview>

There's nothing innovative or special about the film, it's nothing we haven't seen before but the film is entertaining as hell thanks to it's two stars. Both Actors managed to play off each so perfectly it is a surprise that we never saw sequels or the two do another movie together.Stallone is Tango and Russell is Cash, two best cops in their respected precinct, once the mobsters get sick and tired of being busted and their business being targeted they decide to set up the two cops. once that is done the two are sent to jail. They break out and go after the bad guys to clear their names.The film has got some excellent action scenes, particularly inside the prison and during the break out. It's got some nice eye candy courtesy of one Teri Hatcher. The script also delivers some very funny lines now and then. Couple that with the fact that I actually do like Stallone do comedy and Russell has always been somewhat of a mini favorite; Tango and Cash is very worthy of my time every once in a while.</fullReview>

And there are moments that had me in genuine laughter.And I do say that that's all down to the two leads. Stallone and Russell are what make this work. You can tell they didn't come to set every day hating their work, that it's all just a gas, and that's what keeps the movie light and easy on its feet.

The "witty" one-liners, the bad music, the incredulous situations, ridiculous bad guys with terrible fake accents, Kurt's big boofie mullet -very reminiscent of Mel Gibson's hairdo in 'Lethal Weapon' actually and gay innuendos all over the place including a lengthy homoerotic shower where they make fun of each others junk in a weird sort of cock-off.Anyways, Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell play two rival narcotics cops in L.A. Sly is the wire rimmed, fancy suit wearing banker type -fun to see him in this role and Russell is the loose cannon with a gun in his cowboy boot?! They wind up getting framed by a powerful drug dealer (Jack Palance) and must work together to escape a prison under his control and get their revenge.The prison is the craziest thing; with a distinct lack of prisoners, great showers, the bad guys come and go as they please, there are meetings in the basement, and live electrical wires all over the place.Following their escape the insane situations continue including Russell dressing as a woman then going to a lab that not only has several guns hanging about but a pile of laundry on the floor that fits him perfectly, they visit to a stripper bar, gun fights, bombs, a monster truck rally! and the bad lines go on and on. It's hilarious. 1/14/16</fullReview>

There are so many great one-liners in this and the back and forth between Stallone and Russell is brilliant.Yeah the plot is a little ridiculous and some of the characters are a little over the top, but damn it if it doesn't put a smile on my face every time I see it. Add in an awesome score that I hum every now and then and a smoking hot Teri Hatcher and you've got yourself an unbelievably entertaining buddy cop film.Ending with the greatest high five in movie history, Tango &amp; Cash is an action film that is borderline a parody of the action genre.

		<fullReview>"Tango &amp; Cash" is a witty cops and bad guys story with an unusual twist. The back-and-forth between Stallone (as Tango) and Russell (as Cash) is quite good. The two cops are framed for murder and then sent to a real convict prison, not the country club that's more usual for cops. This is because Jack Palance has lots of pull. In this prison, they are really under threat, and escape is the only way. So we have the novelty of seeing a prison escape sequence by two cops in the midst of a crime movie. After their escape, which almost claims their lives, they naturally seek the man behind their frame-up, and that's Palance. For romantic interest, there's Stallone's sister (Teri Hatcher). Michael J. Pollard appears as a supplier of weapons and impregnable autos.There's nothing at all deep about this story or movie. It's heavy on action, explosions, impossible stunts and close escapes that cause the two heroes only to keep wisecracking. It's pure escapism of an aggressive masculine sort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stallone and Russel's best buddy Action film from the 80's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the last Action film from the 80's that Stallone made and it become my favorite Action thriller from my childhood. I grew up with this film. Tango &amp; Cash is 1989 underrated Action "classic" film. The amalgamation of Sylvester Stallone's sheer magnetism, and Kurt Russell's commanding stage presence, has yielded a sonnet the likes of which all Films aspire to be. Stallone portrays "Raymond 'Ray' Tango" a highly decorated narcotics detective from Beverly Hills, who penchant for the stock market, has granted him not only the finer things in life but also a means to express his sophisticated nature and aspirations of financial independence. Stallone masterfully shows the dichotomy of a character who is highly educated and well mannered, yet is beset in a cesspool of crime and depravity, Tango yearns for a better society yet will not rest on his laurels of law and order. "Gabriel 'Gabe' Cash" portrayed by the immaculate Kurt Russell, is the antipodean of Stallone's level headed Tango. Cash is pugnacious, assertive, and jealous yet his diligence to enforce law and order at all cost define this tortured soul. Although this crass inner city detective has a disheveled appearance and tough exterior he is simply trying to hide his true feelings and desires for true love in an otherwise barbaric society. All in all this film is the crowning achievement of Stallone and Russell and the Hollywood film industry. It is a cut of history, when master Artisans the like of Russell and Stallone are brought together at their peak with visionaries leading them to produce what is their destiny FUBAR!!!!!!!!! It is my favorite best action film and the second Stallone best film along with Cobra from the 80's. I love the action sequences, the prison sequences, I love Robert Z'Dar as "The Jaw" in the film he is more memorable for me Matt Cordell as Maniac Cop from the 80's. That is why I love the films from the 80's and 90's more than I do now.Tango &amp; Cash is a 1989 American buddy cop action comedy film that was mainly directed by Andrei Konchalovsky, although Albert Magnoli took over in the later stages of filming.[3] It stars Sylvester Stallone, Kurt Russell, Jack Palance, and Teri Hatcher. The film was released in the United States on December 22, 1989.The film describes the struggle of Raymond Tango and Gabriel Cash, two rival LAPD narcotics detectives, who are forced to work together after the criminal mastermind Yves Perret frames both of them for murder.Two cops are framed and must clear their names. this was the only film directed from Andrei Konchalovsky that stayed in my memories from him. The director for me in unknown, sorry. Sylvester Stallone did great job portraying his character L.A. Cop Raymond Tango. Kurt Russell was awesome as L.A. Cop Gabriel Cash. Teri Hatcher as Katherine "Kiki" Tango was excellent as Ray's sister. Yes she was his sister not his mistress, girlfriend or his wife, she was his sister which I love in this movie! Jack Palance as crime boss Yves Perret was excellent villain. Brion James as Requin was amazingly tough guy villain. James Hong as Quan another villain was also awesome. The most awesome to me was Robert Z'Dar as "The Jaw" he was terrific in this film.I love this film to death I love it is my favorite film and I love it to death!10/10 Grade: A+ Studio: Warner Bros.

		<shortDescription>Delivers Nothing New Except Having Stallone And Russell In A Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tango &amp; Cash is buddy cop action comedy film that features Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell in the title role together with Jack Palance and Teri Hatcher. It tells the story of two rival LAPD narcotics detectives - Ray Tango and Gabriel Cash.Both are forced to work together after criminal mastermind, Yves Perret, frames them for murder.Their partnership struggles at first due to difference in personalities as well as clashing egos.But they eventually learn to work together to bring down the drug lord who framed them.The film was definitely a bad buddy cop movie that is definitely not at the level of Lethal Weapon as the action is overdone and the comedic scenes provides little laughter.Despite the fact that both Stallone and Russell play each other very well,it does not provide anything new and groundbreaking except the fact that we have both actors playing together for the first time in a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sylvester Stallone has made a career of breaking out of prison in movies. He's busted out of jail/confinement in First Blood, Rambo II, Lock-Up, Demolition Man, Judge Dredd, and this 1989 "classic".This time around Sly is wealthy Beverly Hills Cop (er...) Ray Tango, the second best cop in LA. Kurt Russell is Gabe Cash, a grubby, shaggy haired renegade who is also the second best cop in LA (depending on your perspective). Both of them are lured into a trap by evil criminal mastermind Yves Perret (Jack Palance, who is entertaining, but has nothing to do) a man who...um...runs a criminal empire? From a warehouse? In a quarry? On an old Air Force base? Perret and his business partners (exactly what this means and who these guys are is never properly explained ? they're bad guys because they're bad guys) are fed up with Tango and Cash/Cash and Tango spoiling their evil schemes and plot to have them framed and thrown into the worst prison imaginable. Any logical mastermind would just kill them but then we would not have a movie.As a child I never understood this film. I was a smart kid and I was into complex movies well beyond my years. Yeah, I rented a lot of PG-rated stuff but I also consumed lots of grown-up movies. It was only when I was an adult that I realized the reason I didn't understand Tango &amp; Cash was not that it was above me, but that it was BENEATH me. I wanted a serious adult's movie and instead I got a childish shoot-em-up.That's not to say that it's all bad, Tango &amp; Cash DOES have a strong set-up and a great middle act with the two of them breaking out of prison, but by the time the third act comes around it falls apart completely with a confusing monster truck demolition derby, driven by bad guys that come out of nowhere, while Jack Palance sits around watching it on a bank of CCTV monitors (operated by who, exactly?) despite the fact that he's obviously just looking at b-roll 35mm footage.Director Andrei Konchalovskiy brings whatever coherence he can to the film under the insanity of producer/hairdresser Jon Peters. The film was in danger of never seeing the light of day after he was fired but editor Stuart Baird stepped in and stripped the film down the bare essentials, leaving a lot of plot excised. Maybe it's for the best, maybe it's for the worst.All that remains is a promising, yet ultimately disappointing, 80s cheeseburger buddy cop movie with a snappy Harold Faltermeyer score, anamorphic photography with some frequently striking shots, brainless action, and a young Terri Hatcher as a stripper who shows neither her breasts nor her vagina.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Far too easy to call this a piece of sh*t, although it obviously has the look and smell of it. People will want to wax poetic on the 80's action genre and in doing so will often include this movie, I won't try to stop them. It is a movie that was released in 1989, some of the money amassed and put forward to make this movie had trace residue of cocaine, but then it was after all the 1980's. Something typically Hollywood, that when brought up never fails to upset somebody, neither Stallone nor Russel stand over 5'9", that's really short for a tough guy. Have you seen this movie? If your answer is "no" may I recommend a hundred other movies before you see this one- if your answer is "yes", then what are you doing here?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's an infectious junkie Stallone hit, where comedy really works well for it. Stallone looking quite dapper, is Tango, a hot shot lawyer (quit with nominating this poor guy for Razzies). Russell is a loose cannon cop, and a slob, who lives one could say, a messy and adventure filled, bullet dodging existence. These two pain in the asses stand in the way of a drug kingpin crime magnate (Palance) who wants to see em' fall and sets em' up good. And we know how big boy prisoners like Robert D Zar and Brion James, donning an impressive Cockney accent, hate cops, and a lot of hate is shed in the prison shower block, and in the prison workplace. We scream revenge, where the two must escape, and that they do, in a breathtaking and suspense filled sequence, quite hair rising one would say, to avoid any more knifings, or death attempts, where these big fish don't muck around. They go after the son of a b...h Mr Palace, who does bad great, and doesn't need to show much either, doing it. This action flick is very well staged, it's start with Stallone stopping a tanker hauling coke, is the most perfect of openings, where from here it's just keep managing to be entertaining. Russell has great comic timing as Cash, and his forceful and funny way of interrogation, makes for another entertaining scene. This is a another stamp of approval actioner for Sly, where him and Russell work well off each other. I love action adventure films and this is just another one, where Stallone, treads a partially similar atmosphere here, after doing the less successful Lock Up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Still very refreshing movie. I was teenage when I first saw this and didn't quite get all the dialog jokes and more, VHS tape and subtitles in Finnish, it don't usually work with this kind of movies.The plot is pretty simple; two hardcore cops seeing who do not like each other, end up working together. This has a lots of funny moments. Like the plot says, they are both framed so they get liberty to clean up their names.Script isn't bad at all for this kind of entertainment/action/comedy/crime movie, one of the best ones in year 1980. Yes they are both still pretty young and nice to see something different again.Acting is fine and makes you laugh many times by the dialog, some clichés here and there but not too much. This movie keeps you awake if you like the genre.Nicely put together different sessions in the movie, I'm not going to spoil them but it's not like they just go blowing up everything.Directing is well done, effects don't fail, at least for me.So... Funny, entertaining and makes you smile a lot.Give it a shot if you want little nostalgic and few laughs and action...8/10 in it's own genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tango &amp; Cash is a good movie with a decent storyline and a cast that clearly had a lot of fun making this movie.It is nothing spectacular,there are several good action scenes and some very funny parts as well.The highlight of the movie was without a doubt the chemistry between Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell,the two were clearly friendly with each other and were looking forward to making the movie together.It was interesting to see Teri Hatcher in one of her earliest roles,but it was very obvious that she was very new to acting and did deliver a very good performance,but she has gone on to prove that she really is a great actress,this movie just isn't a good example.Tango and Cash is a quick and fun movie,it's not great but I would recommend it to anyone looking for a decent action or comedy.Ray Tango (Sylvester Stallone) and Gabriel Cash (Kurt Russell) are the best cops in LA but when they're framed for murder,the pair must work together to clear their names and bring down those responsible.Best Performance: Kurt Russell Worst Performance: Teri Hatcher</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lethal Weapon meets Die Hard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is old school now. Good to watch, by now it already has the dust that flavours what is generally known as a "classic".The odd thing about this is that if this was made today, it would hardly be considered to be action. Except for the last sequence, of fancy "watch me shoot" ordinary motion, the majority of the film is spent with funny, witty dialog. That's because the film is built on the Lethal Weapon tradition. Two figures, opposed personalities, united by their justice beliefs, separated by their methods. A woman in the middle, conveniently placed (as Sly's sister) to enhance the dispute between man (Glover's daughter in LW). The difference is that instead of Gibson/Glover, here we have Stallone/Russell. The first pair was action versus commodity, and there lied the fun; here we have two guys already known for they physical looks, and the friction comes in the competition, because each one tries to prove better than the other. On a deeper level, it is fun to watch this because both Sly and Russell laugh at their own character in this film, so there's a sense of irony and relaxation regarding the 80's action films that appeals to me. All the rest goes with those premises, stylish shots, designed to photograph muscles and the dialog supports the thing here. A kind of Rambo meets Die Hard.The other thing that matters here is the interest to watch the direction of a previous Tarkovsky collaborator! A man who started his career sharing writing credits with one of the most meaningful filmmakers ever, and indeed participated in some of his first really important experiences. Than, Konchalovsky moved to the US, and made a career with one step in Hollywood. That is already surprising. That he comes to direct Kurt Russell and Stallone makes this worth watching on its own terms. The disappointment is that apparently, what one might expect of Konchalovsky and his Russian heritage is absent. The direction is firm, but not especially inspired. His career is, nevertheless, interesting for its specific and unique path.My opinion: 3/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"He thinks he's Rambo," sneers an upset criminal as nattily dressed Beverly Hills cop Sylvester Stallone thwarts yet another drugs deal. Meanwhile, on the other side of town, slobbish detective Kurt Russell is doing an equally effcient job - so Jack Palance's Mr Big frames them both for murder. Quick-fire mismatched buddy banter livens up their short but brutal spell in a maximum security jail and then it's on to breathtaking stunts as they make their escape and high-octane action sequences as they arm themselves and prepare to get their own back and clear their names. All this, plus Palance's regulation bad-guy turn, a spot of romance between Russell and dancer Teri Hatcher and lots of humourous digs at Stallone's macho image.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, plausibility has no place in this action movie, but who cares? It's a fun ride and you won't be disappointed! Sly Stallone and Kurt Russell are very good in their roles, as is Jack Palance as drug lord Perret. Much hilarity is often provided by the late Brion James as cockney thug Requin, whose accent is so fake it's unbelievable. Robert Z'Dar is also menacing in his scenes as brutal convict 'Face' (or 'Conan' as our heroes nickname him). The final assault on Palance's stronghold in the 'RV from Hell' is a highlight. Although, one thing I did NOT need to see was Kurt Russell in drag! The two leads work well with each other, hurling gentle insults at each other throughout the piece. There really should have been a sequel. In the end, a great action film for any genre fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By rights this movie should be a stinker of the first order! All the ingredients are wrong. From Stallone and Russell's cringeworthy macho posturing and Jack Palance's pantomime, moustache twirling villain to Brion James' preposterous cod cockney accent (somewhere between Dick Van Dyke and Paul Hogan). Somehow though put them all together, add a sprinkling of gloriously tongue in cheek dialogue and a dash of the delicious Teri Hatcher and you have a sure fire smash hit on your hands. The chemistry between the two leads is a dynamite combination of wise cracks and sheer musclebound, knuckle headed bravado. The story line involving a plot to stitch up our two heroes is pretty much irrelevant as they lurch from one chaotic punch up to the next narrowly avoiding getting FUBAR'd (don't ask!) in the state pen before escaping to prove their innocence. Okay, we're not talking Academy awards here or even anything approaching intellectual stimulation but as lame brained, unpretentious action movies go this delivers the goods and then some! The whole movie is riotously O.T.T. right from the start and never once makes the mistake of taking itself too seriously (Kurt Russell's hilariously unconvincing drag act being a good case in point). The script is chock full of delicious one liners and cheeky put downs (rendered even more comical in the censored for TV version, "Rambo is a Primitive" anyone?)to keep the whole gleefully testosterone fuelled enterprise afloat for the duration. Basically forget Freebie and the bean, forget Lethal Weapon, this is the Citizen Kane of all Buddy cop movies. Or maybe I'm just FUBAR'd?</fullReview>

Plus some parts are filled with humor lines, like "Rambo is a pussy" -Stallone. That's why it's a movie, watchable more than once. Secondly, both major players share some charm; it seems that this is one of the best Stallone's role. Not to mention Kurt, to whom, that kind of roles are written to a skin (Bird on a wire, Tequila sunrise). Otherwise, enjoyable movie, light-weighted story, shallow, though sometimes funny dialogs and action all the way, without unnecessary love scenes. On the other hand...nothing special, so that's why a6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tango and Cash may not have invented the buddy-cop genre but certainly set a high-water mark for witty banter, at which no movie has done as well since. Stallone steps out of his typical intense-palooka character and seems to enjoy a more laid-back role, a tendency he also indulged in Oscar and the forgettable Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot. Sadly, he is back to his old style these days. Kurt Russell is his usual loopy self, the same character he plays in every movie that doesn't have 'Escape From' somewhere in its title, but is nonetheless infectiously appealing. Veteran character actor Brion James turns in a weird performance as Requin, and Terry Hatcher is, as usual, delicious. The plot clips right along and fans of the genre should not miss this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There have been few films that disappointed as much as this one did. I didn't expect "Shawshank Redemption," but with Stallone, Palance, and Russell, I thought the script, etc. would be pretty first rate. When I saw the two guys fly out through the windshield of their truck, because of braking too hard, I said to my wife, "I hope it gets better." I can't say that it ever did. I suppose that it really didn't get any worse, if that means anything. How Tango and Cash were set up, and that the police department etc. swallowed it all is ludicrous. The battle with all the felons and Mr. Palance inside the prison, ditto. . As I watched the film it became apparent that it was not going to change, and I began thinking how the different things could have been done well, without changing the basic story. It could have been much better. It certainly could have been a better movie. And yes, I have seen worse. I managed to sit all the way though it, and there are some films I could not. But with the quality of the actors involved, it was a waste of their talent and time; very disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty cool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tango &amp; Cash is not exactly a great film, but as far as pure enjoyment goes, it is a pretty good movie. The plot may be weak, and Stallone isn't much of an actor (although I may be the only living person who liked Over the Top), but the writing was great for the dialogue if nothing else. There were cheesy lines, sure, but some of the interaction between Stallone and Russell were great. "We're gonna jump to those wires, slide down the other side and we're home free" "That's your plan?" "yeah" "we're gonna fry" I hate movies like this, but I gotta say, there were enough funny lines to make it pretty entertaining. Kurt Russell is by far the funniest and most entertaining member of the cast. "How come I get the little gun?" "Genetics, pee-wee"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admire Kurt Russell. From the days of the Disney movies, to romantic comedies like Overboard, to his action movies such as Big Trouble in Little China and Escape From New York, I have always considered him to be a fine actor. I thought Tango &amp; Cash was a tongue-in-cheek affair, with no-one taking themselves too seriously, but none as much as Kurt Russell. This movie had all the action, suspense, quirky one-liners, but best of all, Kurt Russell in stilettos, stockings and a mini skirt. Bravo to a man carrying on the fine traditions of Monty Python!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tango &amp; Cash is a laugh - simple enough. Stallone is the best thing in the film by far. Russell is perfect as Cash, and the two leads hit it off surprisingly well. Jack Palance and Brion James (with a hilarious attempt at an English accent) do their bit for the film, looking completely ticked off when they discover that T&amp;C have escaped from prison. The plot may be substandard but the action sequences are directed with panache, especially the prison break. Disconnect your brain for a couple of hours and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true deranged sweatpant fantasy by far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hilarious! A sweatpant fantasy by two inimitable retards acting within an unparallel series of deranged scenes, a film that would have served far better in a fictional novel, focused to tell the story of the bedtime delusions of an overdosing drug addict, plunged within the depths of an unending state of paranoid dementation.A movie inundated with stereotypical absurdities at nearly every moment, is no wonder why the only viewers to cite this movie with any realistic appreciation, could only suffer from an immense degree of infinite gullibility.Hollywood must be in utter admiration for a musclebound airhead to leap the stage, that thinks as if his brain was lodges up his ass, and utters every word from his mouth as if his tongue was swallowed in his throat, but what about those big arms of his? The film would have been much more fit for view, if the two of these flagrant neanderthals tied bandanas around there hollow heads and screamed cowabunga, but how could they well have done that without ripping off a classic youth movie, no less a cartoon, that yet displayed far greater intellect and creativity to it's viewers?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had its moments but otherwise hasn't aged too well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back when buddy cop movies were box office gold such as 48 Hrs., Lethal Weapon, Red Heat, among others, the teaming of Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell together in an action movie was a dream come true for audiences. Both actors in their glory days were great. Unfortunately Sylvester Stallone had a hit and miss career in the 90's and had a string of box office flops next to his name (Judge Dredd, Assassins, Get Carter, Driven and D-Tox) before having his career resurrected with Rocky Balboa in 2006, and Kurt Russell is not the box office drawcard he used to be.Getting back to Tango &amp; Cash, I first saw this as a 12 year old and I thought it was a really cool movie. Great action, great story, awesome actors, everything. Fast forward 12 years later when I decided to watch this again and I was left very disappointed. Tango &amp; Cash certainly hasn't aged too well over time. Although the action is still good, the story is very predictable and many of the lines are very corny. There was too much comedy and it was as if the movie was trying too hard to be a comedy which almost ruined the quality of the movie.If you like "leave your brain at the door" fun, you will enjoy Tango &amp; Cash. Otherwise, steer clear.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Searching round for an Action movie that I could give to a friend as a Christmas present,I suddenly remembered hearing about a Kurt Russel Action movie,shortly after seeing him star in John Carpenter's delightfully animated Action film Big Trouble In Little China.Talking to a family friend,I discovered that the movie which I was trying to find out about was one which had Russel star opposite Sylvester Stallone,which led to me excitingly getting ready to discover how much "big trouble" Stallone and Russell could cause for each other.The plot:Returning to his flat delighted that he is one of two LA cops, (the other being Ray Tango) who are successfully chipping away at infamous crime lord Yves Perret's empire,Gabriel Cash is attacked by a would be assassin,who shots Cash in the chest.Surviving the attempted assassination,thanks to wearing a hidden bullet vest,Gabriel grabs the surprised would-be assassin,and begins to unleash his own brand of negotiations. Giving in to Cash's negotiating skills,the assassin gives him Yves's current location.As Gabriel rushes to the hideout,Ray receives details from a fellow officer that Perret's latest shipment of drugs will be reaching a hide out later tonight.Entering Yves den,Tango is left shaken,when he stumbles upon Gabriel searching around for Perrret.Following Gabriel,Tango enters a room which contains a dead man,who has a microphone taped to his chest.As they both attempt to get to grips with what they have just walked into,a gang of police officers rush into the room,and arrest Tango &amp; Cash for murder.Relising that they have been set up from the start,Tango and Cash begin to plan their most ambitious tango yet.View on the film:Despite the behind the scenes work being an absolute nightmare,which went from crew members, (including future director Barry Sonnenfeld) being given the sack,to Stuart Baird being rushed in as an "emergantcy" editor by the studio,the screenplay by Randy Feldman surprisingly zaps along at a lightning-fast pace.Opening with a delightfully bonkers action scene,Feldman creates a live action cartoon atmosphere by making all of the characters overly exaggerated, (with Yves Perret's being as closed to an end of level boss from an 80s console game as it possible to get)which along with giving the dialogue a real bounce,also leads to Cash &amp; Tango's increasingly dangerous situations being given a real flight of fantasy about them.Not receiving the most cheerful welcoming from Hollywood, (he got booted and replaced with director Albert Magnoli for the last stages of filming) director Andrey Konchalovskiy shows a real zest for the movie's off-beat cartoon feel,with Konchalovskiy making each of the films action scenes explosive by using an eye-catching,stylised slow motion rain effect,and also giving the film a charmingly "sun-kissed" appearance.Delivering each of Randy Feldman's lines with a clear joy,Kurt Russell and Sylvester Stallone each give excellent performances,with both actors smartly staying away from showing signs of being "in" on their animated world,which happily allows the cartoon side of the movie to fully come alive,as Tango &amp; Cash go from playing the stock market in prison,to having "intimate" moments with each other,which lead to this being a tango that you wont want to get out of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Terrific,Action-Packed And Hilarious Buddy Cop/Action-Comedy. Sylvester Stallone And Kurt Russell At Their Best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tango &amp; Cash is a terrific,Action packed and hilarious Buddy Cop/Action-Comedy that is filled with great direction,wonderful performances from Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell,fantastic Action,laugh out loud Humor and a memorable score making Tango &amp; Cash an entertaining Action film from the late 1980s and 90s and is Stallone and Russell at their best.Set in Los Angeles,California,Tango &amp; Cash tells the story of LT. Ray Tango(Sylvester Stallone)and LT Gabriel Cash(Kurt Russell),two L.A.P.D cops who are considered two of the best L.A.P.D cops in L.A making many drug busts and capturing criminals which angers crime lord Yves Perret(Jack Palance)who frames Tango and Cash for the murder of a fellow cop. Now,Tango and Cash have to team up together and clear their names with thrilling and funny results.By the late 1980s and early 1990s,Action-Comedies and Buddy Cop Movies were becoming popular sub genres with Action fans thanks to the Box Office successes of Action classics such as 48 Hrs(1982,The film that started it all),Beverly Hills Cop(1984)and Lethal Weapon 1(1987)and 2(1989)and then after the releases of those films came Tango &amp; Cash in 1989,an entertaining,Action packed and hilarious Action-Comedy that was the only film where Sylvester Stallone(Rambo series)and Kurt Russell(Escape From New York)teamed up and while Tango &amp; Cash doesn't match the greatness of the other films I mentioned above it's a solid and underrated Buddy Cop/Action-Comedy and one of the better Action films of the late 80s and early 90s. For 104 minutes,Tango &amp; Cash is a wonderful movie that while not very groundbreaking or revolutionary gives viewers an Action film that keeps you glued to the screen with solid entertainment and a good time with Action,thrills and laughter and is one of those films when you're watching television and they're is nothing on you watch Tango &amp; Cash,a movie that is not a bad way to kill time. One of the things that I like about Tango &amp; Cash is that it's an Action film that defines an era of Action films in 1980s and early 90s with elements like a the buddy cop duo,an over the top villain,big Action gunfights and explosions embellishing every Action trademark in the book and never taking itself seriously. The Action scenes in T&amp;C are amazing and explosive with each Action scene being loud and fast never slowing down or taking a break with non-stop intensity and wild energy that Action movies of the 1980s and 90s were known for and you can tell that every cent went into making every Action sequence work. The Comedy and laughs in the film are fantastic whether it's the back and forth banter between Tango and Cash or the interactions they have with other characters and some of the dialog and situations that happen in the movie are so over the top and silly that will make you laugh until you have tears rolling down your eyes. Tango &amp; Cash combines Action and Comedy with great perfection and The characters Tango and Cash are a great duo that you will love and are very much in the wonderful tradition of Lethal Weapon's Riggs and Murtaugh and 48 Hrs' Jack Cates and Reggie Hammond the two don't have much in common in terms of personalities and styles(Tango dresses in suits like a banker where as Cash is more rugged dressing in t-shirt and jeans)but as the film goes on the two begin to like each other and start to work together. The scenes Tango and Cash have together are hilarious and fun with both characters spouting off great one-liners and dialog that is sarcastic and memorable. Tango and Cash are one of the reasons if not the main reason the movie works. The ending of Tango &amp; Cash is amazing and filled with great Action and explosive thrills and will make you smile and cheer at the screen. A brilliant conclusion.The whole cast is great. Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell are excellent,hilarious ans at their best as Tango and Cash,with Stallone and Russell having great chemistry and wonderful scenes together. Teri Hatcher is wonderful and sexy as Katherine 'Kiki' Tango,a dancer and Tango's sister. Jack Palance is terrific and memorable as Yves Perret,a crime lord that doesn't like Tango and Cash. Brion James is outstanding as Reguin,Perret's right hand man. James Hong and Marc Alaimo are great as Quan and Lopez,associates of Perret. Geoffrey Lewis is fantastic as Captain Schroeder,Tango's commanding officer. Michael J. Pollard is funny and memorable as Owen,a friend of Tango's. Robert D'Zar is menacing as Face,a criminal Tango busted. Lewis Arquette(Wyler),Eddie Bunker(Captain Holmes),Clint Howard(Slinky),Roy Brocksmith(Fed. Agent Davis)and Phillip Tan(Chinese Gunman)give good performances as well.The direction by Andrey Konchalovskiy and Albert Magnoli is fantastic and stylish,with Konchalovskiy and Magnoli keeping the film going at a great pace while doing wonderful jobs with the Action scenes. Fine direction,Konchalovskiy and Magnoli.The score by Harold Faltermeyer is great,intense and memorable matching the energy and pace of the movie. Fine score,Faltermeyer There is also a song during the end credits by Bad English(Best Of What I got)Great song. In final word,if you love Action-Comedies,Buddy Cop Movies,Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell,I highly suggest you see Tango &amp; Cash,a terrific,entertaining,Action-packed and hilarious Buddy Cop/Action-Comedy that is Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell at their best. Highly Recommended. 9.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ludicrously brainless, but in all good comic action pulp that delivers on what counts. Violence (cartoon-like, but pulsating) - check. Cracking one-liners (oh there's plenty and they're quotable) - check. Likable good guys (can't go wrong with Sylvester Stallone's starch and Kurt Russell's charm) - check. Super evil bad guys (a game-playing Jack Palance stroking his pet mice in providing plenty of ham along with Brion James' stone-cold English henchman) - check. It's the usual buddy cop routine (opposites trying to work together, despite their qualms) that the 80s did spew up, where it's the case of two highly regarded cops being framed, finding themselves in jail and then breaking out in a race against the clock to clear them names, while also trying to stay alive. The chemistry between Stallone and Russell is a complete blast amongst the witty exchanges and macho posturing. There are thrilling set-pieces and over-the-top stunt work in that when it eventuates it's nothing but high octane. Another names to fill the cast; Geoffrey Lewis, James Hong, Terri Hatcher (looking great - but an amusing cross-dressing moment with Russell gives her a run for her money), Edward Bunker, Michael J Pollard (whose character had me thinking of James Bond with the devices his character created), Michael Jeter, Clint Howard and the impressive square jaw of Robert Z'Dar. "Tango &amp; Cash" is primitively basic, quick moving and predictable, but still effectively well-done for what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the worst movies ever. The acting is terrible, the script is beyond bad. A pure vanity piece for both Stallone and Russell. I mean, if you nitpicked all of the faults with this movie, you would need a week. The story centers around two rival cops, who seem to make all of the arrests in Los Angeles. You have Tango, played by Stallone, who dresses in Armani suits and drives a Cadillac, he also makes references to Rambo and Bridget Nielsen (hardy har har). Then you have Cash, played by Kurt Russell, a mullet wearing badass who is oozing with machismo. Well, these two make the front page of the paper every day, with big pictures of them, you know, after they make big arrests (geez!). Well, the rivalry is alive and not too realistic. Well, there is a shady figure (Jack Palance), who has a plan to frame the two supercops for murder and put them in prison, where they will be killed. He does not want to just kill them. Look, this is an incredibly stupid film, without a sense of reality at all. This being said, it is weirdly compelling. You just want to keep watching it, to see if it can maintain the awfulness. It does! Tragically entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revenge of the 80's:The cop buddy flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tango and Cash (1989) was one of the many cop buddy films to come out throughout the 80's. But unlike most of them, this one was funny and entertaining. Sadly films like this one tend to fall apart because the film-makers do not know how to end a movie. Stallone and Russell make a very likable duo, too bad they never made a follow up to this one. Tango and Cash not only parodies other films of this genre, but it also pokes not only fun at themselves but other films that they were in. Jack Palance co-stars as the creepy villain who "Doesn't like the two very much". He doesn't happen to be a fan of the two from what it appears. The film-makers also "pay homage" to the Hong Kong films Police Story and Royal Warriors. Teri Hatcher (when she was hot), Brion James (switching from an Aussie to Cockney accent at will) and the ever reliable Clint Howard co-stars as well.This big budgeted film didn't make as much money as the producers thought it would. Tango and Cash was trashed by the critics (I guess they weren't in on the joke). Not only was their turmoil at the box office but there was trouble behind the scenes as well. The original and credited director was replaced during the final stages of production. He's left for his homeland never to return. If you like homoerotic cop buddy action comedy films, then this one's made just for you!!B+Not a great film but an entertaining one.xxx</fullReview>

The first two action scene's were cool, the part when Sly parked in the middle of the highway to stop the a truck, and when the chase with Kurt Russell in the underground parking lot was good, but after that the movie went downhill until the final battle at Jack Palance's hideout. The problem with the middle of the film are there are too many unnecessary comedy bits, especially when Kurt Russell dresses in drag.

Naturally Palance plans to take control of everything with the two out of the way, but a daring escape means that the two very different detectives must work together to bring Palance down.

		<fullReview>Nostalgia can be a great thing. I watch movies like 'The Goonies', or 'Star Wars', or 'Hook', and I get nostalgic and it feels great. Nostalgia can also turn out to be very misleading and delusive. This is pretty much exactly how I felt as I endured an hour and forty-five minutes of 'Tango &amp; Cash'.For those of you lucky enough to not have seen it, it's about Tango (Stallone) and Cash (Russell), two of the best cops on the force, who also happen to be extremely competitive and hateful of each other. When they're framed for a murder, they are forced to pair up and find the real culprit.There's nothing original about the story. Its standard odd couple material, the sort of plot you'd expect from an action comedy (I use that term loosely) in the eighties. But, basically, there's nothing original about anything in the movie. It's all cookie-cutter stuff, with not an ounce of originality. The acting, the characters, the storyline, the action scenes ? it's all so predictable and boring.Probably the one decent thing about the movie is Sylvester Stallone. We all know Kurt Russell has the comic timing but, at that point in his career, Stallone hadn't really gone all-out with comedy. Here, he gets to quip those one-liners usually reserved for the Schwartzneggers of the world. He does a valiant job, and it's fun to see. Teri Hatcher's there, nobody cares. The legendary Jack Palance is there, and nobody cares.My vivid memory of 'Tango &amp; Cash' is a scene where Stallone stops an oncoming lorry simply by standing in front of it and refusing to move. I always get really nostalgic about that sequence. What I'd forgotten was that it's literally the first scene of the movie and, more importantly, I'd forgotten how bad the movie actually is. I really wish I hadn't forgotten.</fullReview>

They have some modest chemistry between them and watching Russell with a mane is always fun. Most of us have seen it by now on TV or videotape so we know what it's all about. Cheesy buddy cop stuff about two hero cops who are framed by their drug-lord nemesis, with the twist that the two cops are thrown inside a prison filled by scum they have picked off the streets.But it's got to be one of the most stupid, implausible, formulaic scenarios even for cheesy 80's action. It's all so mechanical and so filled with inane action that nothing sticks. It's over before you know it and nothing is developed in the meantime.I'd rather watch Cobra again, where the cartoon fantasy of male aggression is at least complimented by a marvellous sense of place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>works best as a goofy star vehicle, not as a knowing parody of Lethal Weapon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is any reason to watch Tango &amp; Cash today, and there is, it's because Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell work excellently on screen together. There's Jack Palance too, of course, mugging and doing his Jack Palance thing so much his performance in this and his performance in Batman should have a face-off to see who's the gnarliest villain (this one might win just due to his penchant for senseless mice torture in mazes). But for all intents and purposes, this is a fun guy knock-off flick dependent on its stars for a lot of the heavy lifting. The plot and dialog are only so clever; one knows for sure that because Lethal Weapon was the huge smash it was they decided to go down that route: give us characters that are not too over the top or too serious (albeit Lethal Weapon took itself more seriously AND had some genuinely funnier bits). It is also incredibly, occasionally painfully, 1980s. This is so 80s that Russell can not only be forgiven for the mullet, it's actually kind of cool.This is also the one big shot that the director, Konchavalesky, who previously had knocked it out of the park (or at least to the fence) with his movie Runaway Train. He directs it with some flair, maybe even an over-abundance of wretched action-movie style. But his skills as an action movie director are put by the wayside for his leading stars (the original DP, Barry Sonenfeld, was fired midway through production by *Stallone* for not giving enough 80s light on him), so if there's joy in watching the movie it's all in credit to the beefy and sometimes very funny actors. We've seen so much of this before that only the limited twists and the charisma and talent of the cast drive it along to some redeemable fate.If you're up for some reason at 3:30 on a weeknight and decide to say "screw it" to your next day's work and Tango &amp; Cash is on... there's certainly worse things you could be doing other than sleeping. At the least there's a near perfect self-knowing Rambo joke.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Popping this movie in your DVD player makes about as much sense as shoving cottage cheese in your ears. Sure, it might feel nice and cool for a moment, but in the span of two hours, those curdles start to bother you. That said, I have to point out a few of the odd premises in this movie.First and foremost, Stallone is the "smart" guy? Who made that decision? I'm sorry, that just ruined my suspension of disbelief. It's not like both characters were rich, smart, suave businessmen/cops. Russell played the same role he played in "Big Trouble in Little China": a mullet. If you've seen "Rambo III," you know Stallone could have easily filled that part. Besides, Russell's character has to dress up in drag. Stallone does a good job as an ugly, muscular, broad-shouldered gal in "Nighthawks;" I think he could have done it again here.A major part of this movie is the fact that Tango and Cash are such great cops that their exploits are front-page news every time. Thats not so bad, but the articles name and show pictures of Tango and Cash. I don't know about you, but I have read the Chicago Tribune for many years and have yet to see a front page headline naming a police officer in any positive context. Clearly, Chicago needs better cops, cops like Tango and Cash.It's weird...Jack Palance is the bad guy in this movie, and he's exactly the same character he plays in "Batman." Only, instead of loving Jerry Hall, he loves mice in this one.So, the basic premise of this movie is that Tango and Cash are busting drugs like crazy. This makes them celebrities. Jack Palance has the great job of being the shadowy underworld boss that nobody knows about or even suspects of existing. Clearly, he needs to come out in the open an take care of Tango and Cash to get back at them for all the drug busting. However, he can't kill them because that would make them martyrs... or dead cops. Jack seemed more concerned with the former, but I would guess the whole "murdering-celebrity-cops-bit" would be the bigger problem. Whatever. So, Jack sets up Tango and Cash, sending them to prison for something they didn't do. When they break out (of course they do), Jack's minions want to kill Tango and Cash. Jack says no, and then sends out someone to kill them anyway. Well, what kind of plot logic do you expect from a movie that has Kurt Russell dress up as a "sexy" woman and get away with it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sylvester Stallone stars as Ray Tango a straight laced cop who teams up with Gabriel Cash (Kurt Russell) a renegade cop on the edge, they both wage war on the mobster who framed them, and tons of carnage ensues. Tango And Cash is certainly a typical cop thriller, but some high energy action setpieces as well as Stallone's enjoyable relaxed performance make this a fun shoot'em up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good action/cop movie with two Hollywood heavyweights.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tango &amp; Cash isn't the best movie alive but it provides so much action and thrill scenes that you certainly will enjoy if your in to that kind of thing. This movie also has a ready supply of hilarious one-liners which makes many scenes appear funny so a mixture of laughter is present with all the action. A movie with two Hollywood heavyweights such as Stallone and Russell must be liked by any movie fan because veterans like these always can make a movie interesting. Both are rival cops who become buddies Ray Tango and Gabe Cash these rival L.A. policemen have one thing in common: each thinks he is best. You frame these two for a crime and the two matched get ready to explode. The Stallone character of Ray Tango is a stylish cop who thinks things out on the other hand Kurt Russell's Gabe Cash is a reckless blue-collar type both become equally the same and break out of prison together then they go after the ruthless crimelord (Jack Palance) who set them up. The beautiful Teri Hatcher is very sexy in this film like that's a surprise! Teri plays the sister of the Stallone character who wants to become romantically involved with the Russell character. Poor Teri she once again suffers from being tied up and gagged. Teri is held hostage in the final minutes of the movie before being rescued by Tango &amp; Cash, if you remember from " Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman" in several episodes Teri is either tied up and gagged or has her mouth taped and in other shows Teri has this happen and the same is in Tango &amp; Cash, Teri must get upset of having to do so many scenes in which she is tied up and gagged or has her mouth taped. Tango&amp; Cash in my opinion is better than the Lethal Weapon movies and with great performances of Stallone, Russell, Palance, and Hatcher and the fact that this movie moves fast and is funny, smart and tough it becomes a great pleasure movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tango &amp; Cash -- A Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Tango and Cash" is simply a film about macho detectives. In the opening scene, Ray Tango (Sylvester Stallone) stands before a moving truck and miraculously stops it with the force of his personality. Why? Because he rightly suspects that the tanker is filled with cocaine. My question about this scene is why did the hardcore drug traffickers not run Tango over. I guess they were in a good mood on that day. Then we are introduced to Cash (Kurt Russell) a few scenes later chasing a Chinese man who tried to kill him. Now when a movie starts with a chase scene, that is not a good sign, because it means the producers are already relying on cheap gimmicks to generate excitement.With Tango and Cash causing so much trouble, crime boss Yves Perret (Jack Palance) frames both men for police misconduct. Now why on earth would this be a good plan when the judge, after finding both Tango and Cash guilty, sentenced them to 18 months in a minimum security facility? Because, as Tango explains to Cash, all policemen are corrupt, which is why they are going to be sent to a maximum security facility where they stand a good chance of getting killed.I could go on like this, but suffice to say this film shows Hollywood at its worst. The most glaring flaw in most Hollywood films is that the plot is so simple that you do not have to see the film again to understand it. "Tango and Cash" definitely meets that criteria. This film is dumbed down because Hollywood assumes that most movie-goers are stupid and would be offended by a film that challenges their intelligence. A second flaw is no character development. Tango and Cash are the same people at the end of the movie as they are in the beginning. The fourth flaw is the use of slapstick to generate easy laughs, though none of the jokes here work. The fifth flaw is the not-to-subtle attempt to rip off a blockbuster. Tango and Cash tries to copy some of the best material from James Bond, such as when the American version of "Q" and his gadgets are introduced. There is no problem with this shameless attempt at ripping off James Bond, except that the American version of "Q" is done all wrong. The producer does not seem to understand that what made the original "Q" so amusing that was he was a no-nonsense school master who(much to his chagrin and frustration) had to work with a rebellious James Bond. Now for the sixth and final flaw: shoot em' ups and explosions. This film is replete with scenes of gun battles and scenes of buildings being blown up real good as the lowest common denominator way of generating entertainment. Ironically, however, these scenes also happen to be incredibly boring because the heroes involved don't show any sign of urgency. It's all a video game to them.But most shameful of all, "Tango and Cash" is the result of Hollywood producers forcing a gifted film director to compromise his art to achieve wider distribution for his film. Film maker Andrei Konchalovsky, a legend in Russia, knows how to make an action film better than almost anyone. Just take "Runaway Train" which was not only a brilliant action film, but a profound study of the human condition. But here Konchalovsky has decided (after considerable pressure from the Hollywood establishment) that you have to deal with distribution first and the film later (a cynical view that he voiced in interviews). The result is a movie that comes nothing close to his best work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a pretty dreadful movie although Stallone and Russell obviously have a great deal of fun. All sorts of bizarre situations get thrown into the mix as these self-styled 'best two cops in LA' find themselves framed and incarcerated.A notably homoerotic film, its also rather self-aware and makes light of the marginal interests that come with jail-set torture scenes and a shower sequence. Teri Hatcher offsets this guy-on-guy (non-)action as Kiki Tango, Stallone's sister who hooks up with Russell (presumably not the first time the character has agreed to take the Cash). Jack Palance is the dependable wheel-him-in bad guy Perret. Lots of things get blown up. You get the idea. 3/10</fullReview>

Tango and Cash is certainly among the most brainless of the genre, indeed the beginning hints at some 80's action fun but then the movie becomes a gab fest between who can be more macho. Also sadly Stallone tries to act as if he's an intellectual, truly this is painful to behold. I don't want to give off the impression that I hate Sly Stallone or Kurt Russell, I don't. In fact I loved Cobra and Escape From New York, however I hated their turns here. Indeed the ending is just so stupid and the heroes are so invincible that I was too bored to even care about what was going on. Nothing of course was.* out of 4-(Bad)</fullReview>

The scene at the beginning when Sly gets out the car to fire at the truck is awesome. And it is the only way to see the two top Hollywood stars in the same movie. The first half of the movie was excellent, the humour is wisely done, scenes in the prison are satisfactory. But the second half is not so good, since there is some overdrawn action. But it's true a classic, Sly and Kurt do a great job. It must have been sensational when it was first released as the two top stars of 80s and 90s in the same movie.

		<shortDescription>Derivative action movie, competent in the destruction department but pretty weak in all other areas.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised to see Andrei Konchalovsky's name on the original poster advertising the cinematic release of this 1989 action movie. Konchalovsky was the director who in 1985 had made the existential thriller Runaway Train and in 1986 had followed it up with the moving drama Duet For One. Not really, then, the type of film-maker you'd expect to direct a buddy-buddy actioner along the lines of 48 Hours and Lethal Weapon. In some ways, I was quite excited at the prospect of Konchalovsky tackling a film of this kind. Could he bring something new to the genre? Could he stamp some of his directorial flair on stale and predictable material? Could he twist a few conventions on their head and create a fresh breed of action film? Unfortunately, Tango &amp; Cash is a thoroughly disappointing and familiar addition to the genre. Not only does it derive all of its inspiration from earlier (and usually better) films, it also makes itself excessively foul-mouthed and violent into the bargain. Konchalovsky has not done his talent any justice with this one.In L.A, two cops from different precincts dominate the front pages of the newspapers for their constant drug busts. One is Ray Tango (Sylvester Stallone), the other Gabriel Cash (Kurt Russell). Both good cops, both hell-bent on preventing drug traffic from making it onto the streets of their city, and both enormously competitive with the other. One notably mean drug baron, Yves Perret (Jack Palance), decides he's had enough of them meddling into his criminal activities, so he arranges for them to be framed for a murder. Tango and Cash fall into his trap and are duly imprisoned. Their only hope is to team up to bust out of jail, and to nail Perret before the cops nail them.Stallone and Russell trade off each other quite nicely (though not as brightly as Gibson and Glover in the Lethal Weapon flicks), and Palance once again brings raspy menace to one of those villainous roles he could play in his sleep. But the plot is totally derivative, with nothing fresh or original to get excited about. And the action sequences are totally soulless and excitement-free, with plenty of scenes of destruction but no raw energy to bring depth and emotion into the fireworks. Tango &amp; Cash is a real disappointment in so many ways, but the biggest is probably the fact that, from this director, we've come to expect so much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cheese Factory Work Overtime Here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been ages since I last saw "Tango &amp; Cash",a buddy action-comedy from 1989. I thought back then that this was a rip-off of other buddy-cop films like "Running Scared" and "Lethal Weapon". After seeing it again years later, nothing has changed. It's still just another formulaic buddy-cop rip-off of the "Lethal Weapon" series and has all the right ingredients for the cheese factory workers to work double overtime here. We have the corny, awkwardly disjointed one-liners. We're treated to an exhibition of noisy, inept badly choreographed action and lots of oily, sweaty muscles that reek of perspiration. Lots of bad jokes about certain parts of one's manhood. And most of all, a story that has no direction going for it. I'm sure there was a story arc around the surface somewhere, but the details are rather iffy for me to fully explain, but then again this movie did not really depend on a solid storyline. What stands out plot-wise is Ray Tango (Sylvester Stallone) and Gabriel Cash (Kurt Russell) were sentenced to jail for a crime they didn't commit, so they try to escape in order to claim their innocence. Sadly, there's no real motive behind the drug-lord Yves Perret's (Jack Palance)road to madness, however the movie takes a turn for the worst when it becomes indecisive as to whether it wants to feel like a crappy video game or a formulaic Saturday action cartoon show (some were good, others were the pits). It's up to Tango and Cash to stop this villain Perret from going into his fortress, with the help of their vehicle, the Tango and Cash Mobile. The Mobile is an armoured truck with guns attached to it and rapid boosters useful for taking down Perret's gang of goons (with no explanation why he has them in the first place) but they too have similar vehicles too as well. Yes this where the climax of the film takes place. The performers behind this jilted buddy-cop duo are Sylvester Stallone as the Roger Murtaugh-like immaculate cop only he loves to play dirty. While Kurt Russell plays the Martin Riggs character who also neglects the book and takes his job over the edge. In other words, they're both mirror images of themselves, but wearing opposing clothing. Once again, Stallone's performance is no different than his other roles he's done before and after offering the same dead fish delivery that refrains from expressing any kind of emotion. His job is to deliver brainless one-liners and blow up things. Call me biased, but I truly enjoy Kurt Russell (I mean he's Captain Ron for Christ's sake), but I can't help but feel bad for him every time when he and had to complete Stallone's unfinished jokes or telling jokes about their man jewels. One minute Russell is Snake Plissken a ruthless SOB and now he has to shower with John Rambo. Yes there's a shower scene with these two in it, so homophobes beware. So even though I ranted a lot about this movie, but the flaws that I referred to and many more are actually what makes this movie very entertaining. I find there's nothing wrong with laughing with stupidity as long as you don't laugh at stupidity all the time; unless you are a retard. But it does open a debate with your friends if the director of "Tango and Cash" deliberately made a stupid movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is what I call a fun movie. It is not a spoof but it is not a serious police drama either, but rather it is an enjoyable buddy movie about a couple of very good cops who are set up and have to go out and clear their names. As I said though, it is not a serious movie, which means that we have to suspend or disbelief quite a lot (particularly since they seem to escape from gaol a little too easily, drop such distances that would normally result in broken legs, as well as driving an RV with a mini-gun mounted to the side through the streets of Los Angeles).Basically Tango is a millionaire who dresses like one and is a cop simply for the action. Cash is the opposite, a lot more crude, a lot more rough, and a lot poorer (due to his $9.00 shirt that lands up with a hole in it). They have managed to disrupt the organised crime in Los Angeles to a point that the three king pins of the city get together and develop an elaborate plan to put them out of the way, for good. As such they land up in gaol, in general population, and have to deal with the fact that most of the people there are there because they put them there.I actually quite enjoy this movie, more because of the throw away lines (who does he think he is? Rambo? A cop says referring to Sylvester Stalone) and the fact that Stallone plays a much more dignified role in this film than in many of the other films he has been in. I guess it is because he wanted to try to shed the image of the actor that could only play roles where the lines simply consisted of grunts. As such he has, I believe, succeeded in demonstrating that he is able to play much more articulated characters.There were rumors that this film was going to have Swartzenegger and Stallone playing opposite each other, and apparently Patrick Swayze was also going to star, but what I am glad about is that they ended up picking Kurt Russell, because, to me, he is a much better, and much more colourful actor, as can be seen in other films he has starred in, such as Big Trouble in Little China. Mind you, for all of those who are waiting for a film with Stallone and Swartzenegger, one is coming out soon ? Escape Plan.Oh, and if there is one thing that I do love about this film, and that is that it added a new word to the English language ? FUBAR.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ray Tango and Gabe Cash are two L.A. based cops who work in different precincts. They have seized millions of dollars of drugs and weapons that belong to Perret. Realising that they have to be dealt with, Perret frames them. Sensing that the evidence against them is too overwhelming, their lawyers advise them to take a plea bargain, on the guarantee that they would be sent to a minimum security prison. But Perret arranges for them to be sent to a hell hole and it's there that he plans to have them killed and make it appear that one of the men they sent there killed them. One of the prison's officials, who is an old friend of Cash, tells them that they have to escape, which they do. They then go out and try and find the man who framed them....This is one of those movies that, if you saw it at the right age, it would stand the test of time, and still be as good as the first time you saw it.I was thirteen when I first saw this, and it never gets boring, but one thing I have learnt in the twenty four years since its release, it's not a serious film, and it nearly verges on parody.Russell upstages Stallone in this, and whilst both are very good, Russell's character is the most fun and interesting. He's the Riggs to Stallones Murtaugh, and this hereby lies the main problem, you cannot see this film without comparing it to Lethal Weapon, why, Russell and Gibson have the same wardrobe and haircut.The action is good, and way over the top, and Palance is as pantomime as he was in Batman, but thankfully he's not in it that much to make it too hammy.James has a ball as the awful cockney villain, and its your typical Summer movie, albeit released at the wrong time of the year.If you see this film with Last Action Hero, and even Loaded Weapon 1 in mind, rather than Lethal Weapon, you will enjoy it more.The true essence of a guilty pleasure, which really deserved a sequel.</fullReview>

It has a comic element to it that's hard to find elsewhere, helping to make the movie both unique and rewarding, in its own way. Many have complained that Stallone looks stiff and uncomfortable when required to crack jokes... but Ray Tango as a character is supposed to be uptight... so even though he may not be acting that far away from his own persona, Stallone's ego still works, here.It's all mega cheese, but the material has a knowing wink to it that knows it's silly, but unabashedly makes the most of it, anyway... For example, how can you not love a villain who uses mice in an elaborate maze to demonstrate how much he really dislikes our heroes - especially when said villain is played by a master of deadpan such as the legendary Jack Palance?A comic book, with two larger than life 80's action figures...

		<fullReview>"Tango &amp; Cash" is as good as it gets when it comes to cheesy, violent, exciting action movie escapism. It's snappy stuff, with hilarious banter that flies back and forth, and is acted to perfection by some of the genre's regulars. It ain't Shakespeare, but it sure is a hell of a lot more fun. If you're looking to turn your brain off for a well paced 104 minutes of awesomeness, it more than fills the bill. So many things simply come together very well in this tale of two very prominent L.A. detectives, Ray Tango (Sylvester Stallone) and Gabe Cash (Kurt Russell), who tend to compete with each other for the role of top dog detective in the city. A conniving criminal mastermind, Yves Perret (Jack Palance) devises a trap to set them up and have them sent to prison, but fortunately, despite all the assorted goons in their way, they have their muscles, their wits, and the technical wizardry of Cash's "Q" like friend Owen (Michael J. Pollard) to help them out.It seems appropriate to do a point by point summation of what makes this a solid bit of entertainment:1) Harold Faltermeyer's sometimes familiar sounding but funky musical score,2) That perfectly cheesy end credits rock song, 3) My introduction to that wonderful phrase known as FUBAR, 4) A nicely over the top nature, with assorted characters suffering glorious demises, 5) The highly quotable dialogue spoken by our charismatic leading men, 6) Stallone going for a great change of pace, playing a more reserved, dapper character than usual and Russell having fun with the more conventional kind of genial slob we see in this sort of thing, 7) A terrific supporting cast, including foxy Teri Hatcher as an exotic dancer, and Brion James as the pony-tailed baddie with the priceless, ridiculous accent, as well as James Hong, Marc Alaimo, Robert Z'Dar, Lewis Arquette, Edward Bunker, Clint Howard, and Michael Jeter (with cameos for Roxanne Kernohan and Shabba-Doo), 8) A great prison break sequence, 9) The chance to see Russell in drag, and 10) That rousing rampage of destruction at the end.Fans of the genre should be more than adequately entertained with "Tango &amp; Cash". It has no pretensions of being anything more than what it is, and is anything but boring for its entire running time. Plan A, B *and* C for the prospective viewer should be to check it out as soon as possible.Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cult meets machoness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kurt Russell is known for making a lot of cult movies. Sylvester Stallone is known for making big macho muscle films. So when you hear the name Tango &amp; Cash (1989), one should always think of it as a macho cult classic. And it is just that. I once read in a blurb about this movie from another critic, "I'd pay cash to see this tango", and I feel that it summed this movie up very nicely (even if it was a cheap pun). Both Russell and Stallone are credited for their own special movies, but has anyone ever seen them on the same screen together besides this one? No. So take it for what it's worth.Ray Tango (Stallone) and Gabe Cash (Russell) play as two of L.A.'s best cops who patrol both the east and west sides of the city. It's when they receive a lead to the same place (which is actually a set-up) that they confront themselves and are forced to work together. This pairing is a more pumped up version of the odd couple. Tango likes to do things simple and dresses up like he's a bank manager. Cash does whatever he can to get a job done and he really doesn't care what he wears. But either way, both cops are the best of their department.Along with these two actors is Teri Hatcher who plays Katherine or Kiki Tango, Ray's sister. Kiki Tango is a dancer and plays a love interest for Cash, which ends up making some great scenes between him and Ray Tango later (when he finds out). Playing the main villain is Jack Palance as Yves Perret. Even Palance has a few comical scenes that make this film a joy ride. Perret's right hand man is Requin (Brion James). James stands out from the rest because of his well-performed accent that he gave his character. He's still vicious though and that's good.The action in here is expected to be loud and over the top for a couple reasons. The first would be that it was made in the 80s. That's a given but it's still fun to watch. The second is that this movie doesn't take itself seriously which is also a good thing. The comedy is also well acted too. Never have I ever seen such good, quick, banter between two different actors before. Stallone and Russell share a lot of great lines together. And even when they're alone, the energy is never dropped and I liked that a lot. And finally the music behind all this was constructed by composer Harold Faltermeyer. Faltermeyer is a good key player too because his soundtrack does create suspense, meshes in with the action sequences nicely and sounds rather goofy too when it needs to be. I don't really understand how a Stallone or Russell fan couldn't like this movie. As buddy cop films go, this is a rare gem in the whole bundle. And guess what? Thanks to Stallone and Russell, this movie has become a "macho cult classic"!To think that Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell wouldn't make an excellent tag team is a gigantic understatement. The dialog is crazy and the action is big dumb entertaining fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Good 80's Action Flick!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sylvester Stallone, Kurt Russell, Jack Palance and Teri Hatcher star in this 1989 action film. Two rival cops are framed by a madman playing a deadly game with them. This starts off with wealthy madman, Yves Perret (Palance) deciding to play a deadly game with cops, Ray Tango (Stallone) and Gabriel Cash (Russell). Tango and Cash are rival cops who try to make a bust and are framed for murder. They are sent to prison, but soon escape trying to clear their names and find Perret. Hatcher plays Tango's sexy sister, Kiki who's an exotic dancer. I've always liked this film and Sly and Kurt are great together. Jack was also a great villain and I recommend this good 80's action flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this movie has a bit of everything in it...it is a buddy cop movie, a movie about opposites, a set up movie, an escape from prison movie and even a super truck infiltrates the enemy compound movie. You also get to see a rather good pairing of Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell, though I have to admit I have to say Kurt kind of steals the show a bit, but Sylvester does all right himself. So what we have here is two cops that are arresting people left and right, these cops do not really care for each other or work together, but they are busting the same guys...guys who work for a head honcho type. Well they get framed and sent to what they believe will be a minimum security facility, but the guy pulling the strings gets them sent to a maximum security place instead where a lot of the inmates know our two heroes quite well. They end up escaping and start searching for the one behind their setup. Good movie, rather good action and humor too. I love it when they get to the guy behind the fake voice recording and the good cop/bad cop routine with a grenade. Jack Palance plays the bad guy, and though he is okay his character is a bit underdeveloped. He also has a bit of an anti-climatic finish. Still, for the most part this movie is a hit as there just are not to many movies with super trucks in them now is there?</fullReview>

But the 2 had also very common things too , they both had a tendency to work things out in their own way, regardless of rules and because of their so much pursuance of anti social , outlaw elements they both at a time were the center of target by the same mafia. When they are involved wrongfully , framed and convicted of man slaughter at the same time together , both had to work out together and join hands while also saving themselves from the fugitives they apprehended in the prison. On all these occasion , the film contained quite humor and laughter carrying all the way till the end.

		<shortDescription>The Cop Buddy picture by the two best in the business</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tango and Cash is just your normal Cop Buddy action movie which drowned theaters in the 80's. However Tango and Cash has Stallone And Russell two of the best Action icons in the movies today. The only thing better would've been to have Scwarznegger play off of Stallone. The Acting is good the script is tight and the dialogue is crisp and witty. Tango and Cash's dislike for the competition is worth checking it out as Stallone and Russell play off of each brilliantly. Jack Palance is sinister as the villain as he executes his master plan to be rid of Tango and Cash once and for all. Palance adds that spice which rises this movie above all of the other cop buddy genre he is an actor who can act and make you believe it. Stallone gives a reserved performance as Ray Tango a stock brokering cop who loves his wardrobe and his rich way of life looking for excitement. Kurt Russell is great as the everyman kind of cop he's not rich he works for his check kinda guy. Russell steals the show from Stallone every chance that he gets which is a good thing for us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good cop action comedy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tango and Cash is an entertaining movie that will hold the viewers excitement. Cash (Russel) is a rash, somewhat flamboyant cop who nevertheless gets jobs done and is very effective at his field of duty. Tango is a somewhat older and wiser cop who has put hundreds of criminals behind bars. These 2 cops are regarded as the best cops in the city, and are also rivals. However, when someone frames the two of them for a murder, they end up in prison and are forced to work together as to escape the corrupt jail guards and prisoners, who hate Tango and Cash for putting them in jail in the first place.This movie has some action and some dark moments, but not to dark, and has some comedy. Some of the comedy gets a little bit old towards the end and some of the larger action scenes seem pretty fakey. Other than that, this movie is an entertaining movie to watch, it will keep you awake and alert but not to much so, and it's an easy movie to follow if you don;t want to watch anything too complicated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Ok, let's do it." "Tango &amp; Cash" is a buddy cop film with comedy. It's a fun film to watch. It's got some very funny parts which work and chemistry with Stallone and Russel. It's like other cop films which were done during the 80's like 48 Hours,Red Heat,Lethal Weapon and Die Hard. The score's great and the action is so good for an 80's film. They could have made a sequel which would have been fun to see. It could be possible for Stallone and Russel to team up again for a sequel. Rating 9/10. A film that still entertains when you're bored and it's an entertaining film from Stallone and Russel. One of the best cop films for one-liners and humor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two cops with very little in common are framed for a crime they didn't commit and must escape from the dangerous prison they holed up in and get revenge on the drug baron who put them there in the first place.Ray Tango(Stallone) is the smart suited,city slicker cop who's very successful at catching crooks. Gabriel Cash(Russell) is the rough and ready,don't give a damn wide boy who is equally successful at busting criminals. They are as different as cops can be but they must work togetherThe opening scene involving the truck was pretty cool and was a good start to this 80's action movie.The entire film is filled with good action and never lets the viewer down in that aspect.Stallone and Russell are both pretty convincing in their roles and the fast flowing comedy dialogue between the two provides good entertainment.Look out for the late Brion James as a psycho henchman.I felt the plot kind of strayed a lot during the middle but the ending was adequate and made up for any previous lapses.The theme tune is awesome and fits in well.Overall despite some minor flows this is a fine 80's action film and is worth a watch</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked Stallone in "Lockup" and the Rambo films and possibly "Driven" and maybe a few other movies (but not "Cliffhanger")... but I think I like him best in slicked back hair and a suit.Tango and Cash are two cops who like to bust drug dealers. What they don't know is they're busting different dealers working for the same man. And then, this man gets upset and frames both of them to be arrested... and then... and then... it's a "buddy cop" movie with lots of action, a little sex, and some interesting twists (though nothing deep, so just sit back and enjoy the popcorn).This film was very likable. Lots of action, plenty of humor (most of the jokes are subtle references to other films) and some great appearances by Jack Palance and a young Teri Hatcher (looking the best I've seen her since "Lois and Clark"). If you have an intense hatred for Stallone or Kurt Russell, you might have a problem with this film. But otherwise, you'll have to agree this is in both of their "top five" films on their resume.Oh, and wait until you see the armored SUV... this beast makes Robocop look like a pansy. This film is super-recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the few movies I can stand to watch staring Sylvester Stallone. He is used to good effect(meaning little acting is required of him) in this action comedy, teamed with the ever charming Kurt Russell. It is sad to know that Kurt would have to wait so long to get recognition as an actor. John Carpenter believes, as I am sure we all do, that Captain Ron was his best work. This may be second. The duo of Stallone and Russell make a good pair taking on the scenery chewing Jack Palance. The movie is stupid, but by so much that your brain automatically shuts down higher thought about fifteen minutes in and you go on auto giggle. There is enough obscure or too little known actors to make me swoon. Brion James, James Hong, Michael J. Pollard, Geoffrey Lewis, and the always funny haired Clint Howard make appearances. There are many more, so keep your eyes sharp. Teri Hatcher is just three short years from The Cool Surface and Brain Smasher. The music by Harold Faltermeyer(Beverly Hills Cop, Fletch) keeps this movie going in dry spots and is some of the better synth music from the only(?) great synth movie composer. See Russell and Stallone in the shower, Russell in drag(creepy), and Howard slinkied to a prison bed.*Tango: What are you doing? Cash: Soap...and don't flatter yourself, Pee-wee.*</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tango and Cash 1989 * * ? Police detectives Tango (Sylvester Stallone) and Cash (Kurt Russell) are both framed for murder and thrown in jail. However, they try to find a way to escape so they can find the real killer (Jack Palance). This buddy flick isn't so good, but it's not bad, either. Stallone and Russell are both very funny and obviously enjoying themselves. The two also make a good team. Not quite Riggs and Murtaugh, but good nonetheless. However, the opening scenes and the climax are horrendously stupid. Most of the action scenes are dull and most of the scenes in between them are just as boring. However, every now and then, it revs up; the prison escape sequence is great, and the interregation with the grenade pretty good. Overall, fairly enjoyable if you like 80s action flicks. Otherwise, a complete waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like me are a Sly Stallone megafan, then this is one that you wouldn't want to miss. With Stallone riding the crest of his Rambo and Rocky waves at this juncture, he chipped in with a little gem of a film alongside Kurt Russell. The two cops from different ends of the spectrum are equally effective at combating crime and tearing down the cartel-style dealings of the arch-villain, Jack Palance. The villain, who soon tires of their successes, concocts a sadistic plan to frame the two super-cops. After their daring jail-break, they decide to bring closure to the matter and ruthlessly pursue the man who put them behind bars in the first place. With their names smeared over the press and their careers brought to an end, they must salvage what is left of their lives and bring honor back to the PD and themselves. They team up in a cracking and spectacular fashion, in this action-galore film. Great viewing!</fullReview>

Meanwhile, on the other side of town, slobbish detective Kurt Russell is doing an equally efficient job - so Jack Palance's Mr Big frames them both for murder. Quick-fire mismatched buddy banter livens up their short but brutal spell in a maximum security jail and then it's on to breathtaking stunts as they make their escape and high-octane action sequences as they arm themselves and prepare to get their own back and clear their names. All this, plus Palance's regulation bad-guy turn, a spot of romance between Russell and dancer Teri Hatcher and lots of humorous digs at Stallone's macho image.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely "NO CREDIBILITY" in this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, it's true, this film has got not one single believable scene in it. The opening scene is a rip-off from Jackie Chan's "Police Story". In an attempt to establish Stallone's character as a courageous and reckless policeman, Tango(Stallone) parks his police sports car!!! and himself in front of a speeding oncoming truck, driven by criminals. Somehow, miraculously, Tango knew the truck would stop after firing a couple of shots towards the driver and "SURPRISE-SURPRISE" it does, "at the very last second". The two criminal occupants dive head first through the windshield and land conveniently at Tango's feet, "want to try on some jewellery, gentleman", Tango says, as he dangles a pair of handcuffs. The film gets worse, believe me.The plot is simple, Tango(Stallone) and Cash(Russell) are two hot-shot cops from separate police departments. At first they don't know each other personally but they're both linked by their newspaper celebrity status as hugely successful cops, begrudging each other for the number one spot. Now comes the bad guy, a millionaire drug-guns lord who sets Tango and Cash up, so now the two big-shot cops end up behind bars, cracking one liner jokes as they try to figure out who set them up. The humour in this film is unforgivable. It's one unfunny, sixth grade level joke after another. In fact the script writer must have run out of one liner jokes, so he had Cash repeat one of Tango's earlier spoken one liners. The one liner that I'm referring too is the following line, "is that a proposal". Stallone says it to his captain in the films first half, in response to a marriage comment and Russell says it in the films second half to Stallone, in response to a marriage comment. How bad is that, the film repeats its jokes. Watch Tango and Cash if you dare.</fullReview>

Anyway - the big kids up the road managed to catch it and I would hear their endless takes on it because the one liners in this movie make it memorable.I love this movie! Kurt Russell is one of my Top 10 Movie Guys and I can't help but like the man who made living in Philly look so cool ( Jersey girl representin'! ). I think its interesting to bring these two guys together like this. Their film personalities fit each of them pretty well - I see Russell as more of a down-to-earth homebody than Stallone ( hey Im not knocking him -Italian men have their own kinda style ya know! ). The mismatch makes it fun - and if you don't find yourself quoting at least one of the great one-liners from this movie now and again, either you didn't watch it or you need to check your humor!Is it the epitome of all action films?

		<fullReview>Tango &amp; Cash is obviously inspired by the buddy-cop film Lethal Weapon, but unlike the Mel Gibson-Danny Glover classic, Tango &amp; Cash doesn't take itself seriously (it also eschews the pop-in political propaganda Richard Donner felt compelled to include in the LW films), and as a result is funnier - the film's signature satirical one-liner comes when a highway cop says Ray Tango "thinks he's Rambo"; to this Tango displays that Rambo is a wimp. Sly Stallone is millionaire cop Ray Tango - "You got a boatload of money, you dress like a banker," as his CO Captain Schroeder says. Kurt Russell is blue-collar cop Gabe Cash. When ruthless drug lord (like there is any other kind) Perret (Jack Palance) frames them both for murder to get them out of his way, the two incompatible cops put their differences aside to go after him. The mixture of some superb action scenes and the chemistry between Stallone and Russell make for an entertaining action comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a mindless, soul-numbing action flic, Tango and Cash is everything one could hope for in the limited genre. Witty one-liners deadpanned by dry Sly, plus endearing sarcasm oozed by charm-n-smiles Kurt Russell -- not to mention the introduction of the word 'FUBAR' into the English vocabulary. This one's a definite guilty pleasure, fueled by formidable bad guys, sympathetic heroes, and lots and lots of action. Kick back the Laz-E-Boy and shut off your brain, let's pop Tango and Cash in the old Hifi...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh, this movie has been done soooo many times. Two cops are framed &amp; must clear their names. The cops are rivals of each other. So, why see it? Because, this time around it really works! Plus, the leads by Kurt Russell &amp; Sylvester Stallone have something to do with it too. Tango(Stallone) is a white collar-type cop who cares most in life about looking good &amp; the stock market. Then there's Cash(Russell), who beats down the law in his side of town, with his blue jeans &amp; t-shirts. The two of them are set up, due to their many busts of associates of city drug kingpin Jack Palance. When they are set up of murder, they must work together to bust out of jail &amp; clear their names. Like an earlier comment said, this really is guilty fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure, you may think this is another one of those big dumb action movies but this was rather entertaining and quite amusing! Super cops Ray Tango and Gabriel Cash are made to be superstars by the media, but are then set up by the mafia and together they plot to escape from prison, clear their names and stop a powerful crime lord played by Jack Palance. Explosions, humor and so on, this is one of the greatest action movies I have ever seen and Teri Hatcher is at her hottest in this! In conclusion, this was "FAST AND FURIOUS!" I loved it!</fullReview>

Stallone and Russell are both excellent and the soundtrack by Harold Faltermeyer is fantastic. It's not the type of film to be watched if you're looking for an epic that will change your life, but definitely if you like to sit back and be mindlessly entertained."Chow, babe."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film that was funny when it first came out and after seeing it for the first time in about eight years, I have to say that it is even funnier now. Russel and Stallone doing comedy together is quite interesting in itself. But remember, these are two proud action stars. At least they were at this stage of their careers. Clearly Stallone was looking to curve his reputation just a little bit. Here, he comes across as a smart and dapper L.A. detective that just happens to tough as nails. Russell plays the role that Stallone would have played maybe even three years ago. But the change in character works for Stallone. This also gives Russell a chance to look even tougher and funnier. One particular scene that is played to perfecttion is when Russell and Stallone are in court together and they are given a chance to say some last words. Tango says some eloquent words to the effect of all of his buddies being great cops and facing up to adversity with pride. He then sits down and Russell, Cash, scruffy looking hooligan that he is, stands and says in a soft and demure manner,"Well I wish I could be as eloquent as my partner here... but I can't..... because.. this....whole thing just freakin' sucks!!!"Action is the driving force behind Tango and Cash but comedy is its forte. These two guys play well off each other and even Palance does what he can with what he is given, which isn't much. One has to assume that he accepted this role for a paycheck only.Another great character in the film is the one played by Michael J. Pollard, as the guy in the lab that seems to make all the silly police gadgets that Tango and Cash use. Now, would there be a guy like this in the L.A. police department? I doubt it but he sure is a fun guy to have around in a film like this.Tango and Cash is a great rental. It is probably a film that most people have forgotten about but it is worth another chance, especially since you can get it on video. Stallone and Russell are magic together and there is enough comedy to keep everyone laughing.And Teri Hatcher isn't bad to look at either.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tango &amp; Cash is a good action movie with entertaining performances by Stallone and Russell (finally together in an action flick). Stallone gives his usual performance but Russell has fun with his role and steals the show. Hatcher provieds the eye-candy and Palance shows as a so-so meanie. The dialogue between Stallone and Russell is the best part of the movie, with the excellent prison break coming in a close second. A rating of 8 out of 10 was given.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tango and Cash is one of those films which makes you long for the days of The 80's Action Movie. Do not watch this film expecting to see some 'oscar winning masterpiece', this was not made to win Oscars. But so what, this movie has everything an action fan could want, Lots of Action, Lots of Laughs all dipped in lots of cheese. The general summary is that Ray Tango {Sylvester Stallone) and Gabe Cash (Kurt Russell) are the two best cops in LA. Tango who works on the west side of LA, and Cash who works on the east, Have been costing Perret (Played excellently by Jack Palance) lots of money in the contraband trade. Instead of making heroes out of them by killing them, he hatches an elaborate set up to put them in jail, so he can operate without all the worries of tango and cash. This film has some great action sequences as well as some gut busting comedy with great delivery from both Stallone and Russell. Overall this is one of the crown jewels in the kingdom of 80's Action Films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stallone and Russell as Tango and Cash respectively, are framed by Jack Palence in this above-average "buddy cop" movie of the late '80's. The dialog is far from the best with several goutes being cringe-worthy, but the chemistry is definitely there and it's a fun enough film. Plus you can't go wrong with a cast that is chuch-full of 80's movies staples such as the late great Brion James, Clint Howard, Robert Z'dar, anf James Hong among others. Definitely the screenwriter Randy Feldman's best work, but next to "Hell night" and "Metro" that isn't saying a lot I know.Eye Candy: Roxanne Kernohan (from Critters 2) and Dori Courtney (from Hollywood hot tubs 2) show there tatasMy Grade: B-Where I show it: Encore Action</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't give this film a 1 because it was a film after all and it wasn't a boring home movie filmed on a cine 8 camera so it has to be worth a 2. I was advised by my friend to watch this film a long time ago, probably when it first came out and I couldn't understand why he said it was the best film ever. Obviously for me it wasn't. I like the actors both Kurt Russell and Sylvester Stallone but the plot was just not good in my mind and it kind of sat on the wall of stupid and could easily fall into the pool of nonsense. I don't really have much to say but as Buddy films go, the Lethal Weapon films blow this film out of the water. You have to ask yourself if it was that good a film why was there no sequels? Tango and Cash not for me but some loved it. It must be just one of those films that is equally hated as loved. Watch it try it out if you agree with me the stop button is always close at hand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this at Big W for $5 and couldn't resist.Tango &amp; Cash- get this- is the name of the movie based upon the two main characters, Ray tango (Stallone) and Gabriel Cash (Russell).These guys are the two best drug cartel smashing cops in the business, so good in fact that their exploits are regularly in the papers with their names attached. They don't work together, in fact they are in fierce competition.The movie opens with a scene making you thirst for more. Tango is chasing down a truck. he speeds past it and then pulls up right in front of it, forcing the truck to slam on the brakes and causing the drivers through the window. Tango remarks, wittingly, "nice of you to drop in". This sets up the movie perfectly, lots of action and weak one liners.We soon discover these guys are almost bringing down the drug industry together and causing one of the drug lords major headaches. The drug guy (Jack Palance) orchestrates a scenario to frame the wondercops and put them in prison, where he plans for them to then be killed (?).Will Tango &amp; Cash clear their names? Will they catch their nemesis? All these questions can be answered by watching this action packed movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm 15. I was only 4 years old when Tango and cash was released in theatres in 1989. I finally didn't see it for myself until I was 12 and I must say I was impressed. Stallone and Russell make a cool pair of cops. The plot surrounds Ray Tango (Stallone) and Gabe Cash (Russell). They are two of L.A.'s best cops and even more strangely they're both on opposite sides of the newspaper. Anyway, a bitter crime boss (Jack Palance) comes up with an idea of framing our heroes and sending them to prison. His idea works and they're sent to prison. Instead of them going to nice prison where they're not harassed or beaten up by the prisoners they put there, they end up going to the prison I just described. They are beaten up and harassed by the prisoners they put there in first place. They eventually escape and go after the crime boss who framed them. I think Tango and Cash is a funny and violent action/comedy starring two talented actors. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tango &amp; Cash is a very good 1980s action film that stars Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell! Yes, That's right two great action stars together in a movie! They both act together very well in this movie! I was thrilled to see them together! Its a treat in My opinion! Teri Hatcher, Jack Palance, Brion James, James Hong, and Marc Alaimo all put on very good performances. Stallone, Russell, Palance, and James all looked really neat! Hatcher also looked amazingly good! There are so many familiar faces that are in this movie in brief roles and they are Philip Tan, Michael J. Pollard, Robert Z'Dar, Lewis Arquette, Edward Bunker, Michael Jeter, Clint Howard, Elizabeth Sung, Roy Brocksmith, Billy Blanks, Richard L. Duran, Saveli Kramarov, Geoffrey Lewis, Salvador Espinoza, Andre Rosey Brown, and Phil Rubenstein! The acting like I said is good. There is a bit of comedy here as well that is funny. The movie's action is top notch! There are some really explosive action scenes, and story is good and its always interesting in My opinion. The music by Harold Faltermeyer was good and fit the film nicely. The direction by Andrei Konchalovsky and Albert Magnoli is decent. Tango &amp; Cash is a fine cop movie to watch and if you like Stallone, Russell, Palance, Hatcher, and any of the actors mentioned above then I strongly recommend you watch this movie!Movie Nuttball's NOTE:The following is something I noticed that some viewers may not know! Isn't it strange that Kurt Russell and James Hong are together again in a movie? Before they were battling it out in Big Trouble in Little China! Brion James and Saveli Kramarov is in this film together and they were also in Armed and Dangerous. Same thing with Roy Brocksmith and Marc Alaimo because they were in Total Recall. Its just something interesting I noticed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It still astounds me that this film was even made. Cartoony villains, terrible plot, unbelievably horrible script... some -- check that -- MOST of the lines uttered by Tango and Cash that are supposed to be witty or clever are downright painful and just make you cringe unless your IQ is under 90. It's corny, cliched, and just plain dumb. Nobody should talk like that, even in Hollyweird-land. The supposed cool characters even take their framing in stride... the only redeeming feature that I can think of is Kurt Russell's brief mimic of Stallone's Rocky-like voice. When Stallone (Tango) says "I don't know," Russell mocks him by saying "You DONNO" and twisting up his face like Stallone's Rocky character. Hard to describe in print, but it was the one funny line in a movie that THOUGHT it was FULL of funny lines.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen. With the very stupid witty remarks that they do to all this action that is never needed and to stuff that would never happen and what you would endure. For example when Kurt went home and the Chinese assassin tried to kill him i think i is very doubtful that he would go through that and then finish it off with a witty remark. And also where Selvester shoots the tank filled with drugs and licked it thats stupid, that could of been anything for example anthrax and then he finishes it off with another stupid witty remark "anyone wanna get high?". These are great examples of why i hated this movie and i hope others will agree with me on this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Framed for a drug dealing &amp; a murder they did not commit by millionaire drug czar (the late JACK PALANCE) TANGO (SYLVESTER STALLONE) &amp; enemy cop CASH (KURT RUSSEL) find that they must put their differences aside when they wind up behind bars, with hundreds of criminals attempting to do them in. Masterminding an daring &amp; dangerous prison escape, the two men then seek vengeance on those who framed them, while trying to clear their names, leading to tons of explosions, car chases, gun fights, fist fights, double crosses, misunderstanding's &amp; cross dressings (the last one being courtesy of Kurt Russell). TANGO &amp; CASH is a very underrated fun &amp; funny action film, that I admit liking more than the LETHAL WEAPON series. In fact, it's just like that movie. The film is very well acted, loaded from first frame till last with comedy &amp; action &amp; always has some very interesting plot twists &amp; turns throughout it's running time, not to mention many action packed &amp; suspenseful moments to help keep you on the edge of you're seat &amp; the adrenaline pumping. The film is very well acted &amp; directed &amp; it's truly a shame that a film as great as this, full of great characters, comedy &amp; action, could get lost in the shuffle. Memo to Hollywood, if you are reading this &amp; you want to see what an action film looks like, see TANGO &amp; CASH! Highly recommended to fans of action films, don't miss it!**** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tango &amp; Cash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The critics judge this because there is not so much action, and because the director is German, but they do still give it a good name, I liked it. Basically Sylvester Stallone as Raymond 'Ray' Tango and Kurt Russell as Gabriel 'Gabe' Cash are two ruthless, no nonsense cops who seem almost similar to each other. Yves Perret (Jack Palance) is sick of having all his business plans and most illegal plots ruined by these cops, so he sets them up for a murder. Tango and Cash go to prison and think it is pretty easy to escape, and it kind of was. They are now fugitives, but still have good intentions to catch the person who set them up, and give them what they deserve. Along the way they get involved with old friends that can help, including Katherine 'Kiki' Tango (Teri Hatcher). They do eventually find out that it is Perret, but they take it slowly because he knows they escaped. Also starring Brion James as Courier/Requin. By the way, they do becomes innocent heroes in the end. Very good!</fullReview>

Anybody who's into action movies will enjoy it and if you're a fan of Sylvester Stallone, this is a must see! Sylvester and Kurt Russel couldn't have been teamed up better. The cast is great, and Teri Hatcher does the role of Slyvester's sister perfectly. One of the best things about this film is the music. The soundtrack and score is great. This film, basically about two top cops who are framed, put in jail and get out with revenge, is very good and entertaining.

The Direction is great!. Andrei Konchalovsky and Albert Magnoli, do a great job here, with slick camera angles, nothing fancy, but he kept the movie at an excellent pace and did a great job!. There isn't much blood at all except, some bloody wounds, a few bloody gunshot wounds, and a gunshot wound to the head. The Acting is AWESOME!. Sylvester Stallone is AMAZING as always, he is extremely likable, hilarious, kicks that ass,and even made fun of himself in 1 scene (Rambo is pussy), plus the chemistry between him and Russel was amazing!(Stallone Rules!). Kurt Russel, is just as good here, he is also hilarious,kicks that ass,and like Stallone was tons of fun to watch!,and also like Stallone had a lot of funny dialog! (Russel rules!). Teri Hatcher is beautiful, and does fine here with what she had to do. Jack Palance is good as the main villain, there were a couple times where he didn't convince me but overall he was pretty menacing.Brion James does his thing and does it well, (he can play this role in his sleep!). James Hong adds some class to this. Overalll I love this movie and highly suggest you rent or buy this movie right now it's worth it! ****1/2 out of 5</fullReview>
