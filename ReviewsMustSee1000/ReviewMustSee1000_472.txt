		<shortDescription>What was the guy on who invented this ridiculous story??? ***Spoiler Alert***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** Spoiler Alert **** Spoiler Alert *** Spoiler Alert ***OK, this movie has a good cinematography and one cannot argue about the good craftsmanship.However, who invented this ridiculous story???Let me get this right:a) Aliens can travel millions of light years in their space crafts, but lack the technology of breaking into a wooden house. b) For that matter - a seven-foot-tall alien, who can run like an Olympic athlete, can be locked into a wooden kitchen pantry without being able to escape. c) Aliens (able to travel space) run around naked and cannot deal with water. Does this imply that a raincoat is a more sophisticated invention than a spaceship? d) Aliens come to `harvest human beings', but can be scared off by wooden clubs. Aehhh . the human body consists 90+% of water, which the aliens cannot handle . does this qualify for the `real dumb plot award'??? e) A referent looses his faith when his wife dies (which is fair), but regains it when he remembers her last words which tip him off that Aliens doesn't like being beaten with wooden clubs . are there more people who think this is crap???Also:f) When confronted with an imminent Alien attack, board yourself into a lonely wooden house in the prairie - don't go into the next town, arm yourself and join the local militia / military organisation.g) Don't have the asthma medicine your son's life is depending on handy. h) After you boarded up your house, just hang around in the lounge. Don't fortify your cellar basement and shift all your water, food and medicine there. i) Lacking fire arms, don't arm yourself with knifes, axes or whatever you can find. Leave your vicious guard dogs (who detect aliens earlier than you and could scare them off) outside the house... And the top price goes to:j) Alien communication can best be observed on baby monitors!!! . sophisticated civil air control and military radar equipment cannot spot them.Well, they don't make movies like that one any more. Hopefully, no-one will never ever make a movie like that one again!!!My opinion - right down there with `Battlefield Earth' and `Giggli'. 1 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>underrated film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think this film deserved the poor reviews that some gave it. I've only seen 3 of Night Shylaman's films (6th Sense, Unbreakable) and this one is the most sophisticated in my mind in terms of the director manipulating the viewers into seeing and believing what he wants you to believe.This is not Gibson's worst film by any means. If anything he gets to try to portray an understated, confused, and emotionally scarred character and I think he soft-sells it very well. Joaquin Phoenix also has a similar character to play and he too soft-sells it well. That was probably not an accident as their calm, sullen personalities contrast with the unbearable situation they find themselves in.If you haven't already, see it - and keep an open mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deplorable...no respect for science fiction or for intelligence, for that matter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a long-time science fiction fan and as a scientist, I was not prepared for the insult foisted upon this viewer by this miscarriage of the legacy of true science fiction. If one wishes to have a movie about faith and redemption, fine, but don't trash a whole genre in the process with unbelievable sloppiness. Three years after seeing the film, I still feel insulted.Spoilers: Why would an intelligent life form capable of traversing untold distances and for whom contact with water is fatal choose a planet for invasion whose surface is predominantly water? Why would that intelligent life form be incapable of sufficient intelligence and tools to free itself from an ordinary locked room? Why would those beings choose to prey on beings that are primarily composed of that substance they find fatal? The list goes on and on, but the bottom line is that some director with no feel and, obviously, no respect for the genre choose that genre for his vehicle? Oh, yeah, name stars and $$$. Next time I see the name M. Night Shyamalan, I'll forego the experience.</fullReview>

Also, even with there advanced knowledge they seem to have a problem breaking down wooden barriers. And was it only me but didn't that maize field scene look remarkably like the scene from E.T. But hang on this film isn't about Alien Invasion at all I hear you shout, its about man questioning and rediscovering his faith. Well, he may have done that but i lost my faith in the American Film Industry in the process. This is a film that insults the audience's intelligence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outlandish plot holes ruin film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film at a packed opening weekend showing in NYC. As the film progressed and the tension rose I thought to myself that this was actually a pretty good film. There were scares, some laughs and even some scenes that tugged at the old heart strings. It reminded me of Night of the Living Dead and the original War of the Worlds, both of which are long time favorites. Durring the final, climactic scene something so completely retarded occurred that I was ripped out of the contented haze the movie had lulled me into. I was shocked. I turned to my girlfriend and said "They get killed by water? Water kills them?" She said, loudly "This movie is F*CKING DUMB!" And I said "I don't believe it..." And that's it. Naked aliens who find water to be deadly come to the wettest place in this solar system. Then, believe it or not, they get killed with water. Other posters (nearly 1,000 or something) have pointed out how utterly insulting this is so I won't go any further into it. I would like to know why the people who rate this a 10 don't bother addressing this outlandish plot device that destroys the entire film for so many others. I would even accept an explanation like "I am an idiot and MAJOR plot-holes don't bother me at all". Has M. Night ever defended this ludicrous flick? No? That's probably because it's indefensible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostly dreadful, with some redeeming features</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film could have been so, so much better. Its greatest weak points are 1) the overly religious theme and the complete pap that links coincidence, fate and religious faith, and 2) completely stupid and illogical storyline regarding the Aliens attack of the earth.The cinematography is good, but nothing special. Mel Gibson's acting is laboured. Joaquin Phoenix is better, and has real talent, but is wasted in this. The dialogue is cringe-worthy in many over the top sentimental scenes between Gibson and his kids.The best thing about this movie is the genuine build up of tension for the 1st hour or so. Like some of the best monster/alien movies, the creature(s) are only revealed a tiny bit at a time ? and old (but good) tricks are used to keep the suspense high. Up until this point I was quite enjoying the film, and it 'had me going' a little.The finishing 30 mins does not do any justice to the build up, and the plot at the end is just silly and lame. I don't really know where to begin .. Well, OK, for starters, it seems absolutely ridiculous to me that an extremely advanced race of Aliens (as they must be to build space craft that can travel great distances in space and that can also be rendered invisible to our eyes when they get here) have to?i) create crop circles to navigate the earth ii) cannot work out ways to smash down wooden doors and battened windows of a house.You would think that had they come millions of miles to 'harvest (????)' humans they would have come prepared with some sort of hi tech guns that paralyse us, or at the very least some suits that make themselves invisible (like their ships) or maybe carry some hi-tech equipment to aid them in their task. But oh no, they wander around our planet surface butt naked thereby enabling us to lock them in wooden pantries! Perhaps if we were told that the Aliens are giving us a sporting chance (a la the Predator alien that hunts Arnie) then we might be willing to suspend disbelief regarding their apparent incompetence in 'harvesting' an inherently inferior race (i.e. us) a little more, but we are not led to believe that they are doing any such thing. You would also think, that such an advanced race of Aliens would probably work out a way to feed themselves without having to travel round the galaxy looking for beings to 'harvest', assuming that they are 'harvesting' us for food (we are not really told). And if it's meat they want, you'd think they get better value harvesting cows, sheep and pigs, no? In fact, if they'd just have asked us, 'hey we need some food', I'm sure planet earth's leaders would have given them a good supply of meat. But no, they attack us and risk themselves in the process!Also why, if water is like acid to them, are they wandering around butt naked on a planet that has most of its surface covered in water and whose atmosphere is full of water droplets and vapour??!!? Are we supposed to believe that bulk quantities of water 'melt' the aliens, but they can quite happily breathe our air complete with the high levels of water vapour that is in it?!? And if they don't breathe (we are never really told much about the aliens) then still the high levels of water vapour in our air would surely be a bit of a problem to them, no?There are just so many stupid inconsistencies in this film, it is almost quite laughable. And it is a shame really, because (as I said initially) the film is genuinely scary and suspenseful in the 1st hour. It's just that when the final credits roll, you think, 'hang-on a minute, that ending was just complete nonsense!!!'For all the hype M. Night Shyamalan is getting for writing, producing and directing his films, he really should learn a bit of science before trying to write a plot involving science fiction</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Believe The Hype - Especially Not Your Own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** Possible Spoilers Ahead ***I was originally sad to have missed this movie in the theatres, because I had heard good things about it. So it was with anticipation that I rented the DVD and settled back for a good evening's viewing... ...Ooops!I always start by trying to say something nice about a film, because almost no movie is universally bad. Well, "Signs" is extremely well-shot, with production design and camera work combining seamlessly to evoke a sense of atmosphere and growing panic - hats off to Tak Fujimoto. The casting and acting are good too - Mel does a classically Gibson good job of creating the role of the self-doubting agonised ex-Father father, Joaquin Phoenix provides a good foil as his ingenuous brother, and both child actors are convincing and endearing, their performances realistic enough to engage your sympathies.Sadly, that's as far as it goes. I started to worry as soon as I saw that M Night Shyamalan, not satisfied with writing *and* directing the movie, had decided to shove himself in front of the camera too, in his role as the hapless killer of Mrs. Mel. Bad move, M Night. You're no actor, but worse still in one stroke you evaporated my suspension of disbelief - I'm instantly asking myself "Good grief - it's the director! why the Heck does he feel the need to be on screen?" This totally smacked of self-indulgence and a nasty little suspicion of self-publicising arrogance. It's almost as if, after just three movies, M Night has decided that he deserves a Hitchcock-esque cameo performance in his forthcoming movies as some sort of signature - except he picks out a role for himself that is way larger than incidental.And destroying the suspension of disbelief is what this movie achieves effortlessly as the action progresses. Forget the obvious borrowings from at numerous other mainline sci-fi sources - M Night would probably call these deliberate "hommages", and frankly it helps pass the time to pick these out. You'll find Night Of The Living Dead, Independence Day, Day Of The Triffids, War Of The Worlds at the very least and there's more. This however is not the problem. It's the gaping plot holes, the sheer stupidity of the actions of both people and aliens in the context that's been created for them. To highlight just a couple out of countless - aliens capable of interstellar travel being unable to get past a flimsy wooden door? Those same ultra-genius aliens not realising that perhaps bringing an umbrella along with a crowbar might be a good idea?? Mel deciding not to bother calling the authorities to alert them there's a trapped alien in his neighbour's pantry, and for him to just go on home instead??? I couldn't avoid hearing leaden clang after clang as these incongruities kept smacking me between the eyes.I also scowl at the massively misrepresented marketing of "Signs" - it simply cannot be a movie about alien invasion, because it's so threadbare of plot, so it *must* therefore be a contrived vehicle about one man's loss and subsequent regaining of his faith, although the massively laboured and contrived series of coincidences in the movie - the fortuitously half-full water glasses left around, the precognitive message from the dying wife, the well-timed asthma attack - would be enough to turn the most rabid atheist back to God. Who needs faith in those circumstances, because blatant proof is being rubbed in your face.In summary, my central criticism of "Signs" remains the way in which we the audience are implicitly patronised as being stupid. You can almost hear the thought process - "Give the poor fools enough style and atmosphere and they'll not even notice the fact that there's no sense in the plot." Don't believe your own hype, M Night. Sure, "Sixth Sense" was a good movie, though less original and far less "shockingly twisted at the end" than the media would have had us believe, but "Unbreakable" was no more than poor to average. "Signs" has its good points, but never presume you can get your audience to swallow everything. Yes, we like style and love atmosphere, but sorry, if you're going to set up a narrative context - and remember you wrote the story too - then we need even vaguely convincing plot too. Sorry, but we as viewers deserve better than this.Four out of Ten - and that's for cinematography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sucked totally.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was the most illogical and predictable piece of crap I've seen in years. I loved Unbreakable and Sixth Sense, but this film feels like M Night Shyamalan's attempt to see how ridiculously absurd he can make a movie while still getting it made. He did a good job too. I can't really explain what's so bad about it without spoiling it, so:***********SPOILERS***********- Nothing makes any sense. Water-allergic aliens landing on Earth without protective suits? Don't give me that "alien logic" stuff. It's just dumb.- The divine message from God is "take the big bloody piece of wood and whack the alien over the head". Yeah, he'd never have thought of that himself. It takes divine wisdom to think of clobbering an intruder with a baseball bat.- A Middle Eastern village finds out how to defeat the aliens (water, how original!) and from there it spreads throughout the world. How? We're conveniently not told, but it managed to elude the reporter with 30 cell phones and 50 fax machines. Every Pakistani peasant got the message, but CNN missed it. Yeah. Sounds likely.- Did anyone believe Mel Gibson wouldn't get his faith back at the end? Even for a second?Waste of time, money, and celluloid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually terrific</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan has done it again, and this time, better. If 'Unbreakable' left skepticism about the young director, `Signs' will make you a believer again.Mel Gibson and his family, one boy, one girl, and Gibson's younger brother (Joaquin Phoenix) take residence in the small town of Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Gibson's wife is not a member of this household (we find out why, later). Shot over and around a 'Walton's-style' house and surrounded by crops, we get the eerie feeling that we are to be entangled here for the next two hours. Immediately, the children notice gigantic perfect circular shapes or signs as we like to call them, appearing within the crops. Is this a hoax or War of the Worlds? And, that's all you need to know. The rest of film will dazzle you with style, suspense, and downright scariness.The key ingredients to this recipe for storytelling is one half Close Encounters of the Third Kind, a dash of Stephen King, sprinkled with Orson Wells. Shyamalan also uses Hitchcock like close ups, wicked camera angles, and a blasting score. You are locked in as soon as the movie begins. You will tilt your head in wonder and confusion, as characters in the film do. There is a deep desire to figure this all out, while your stuck in the middle of nowhere, nowhere being Bucks County.The picture gives us two ultimate dilemmas to wrestle with. Two basic questions we must ask ourselves. Are our daily occurrences and the paths we choose Coincidence? Or, are is it just plain Luck? Shyamalan weaves these posing questions into a subplot, with trickery until the end. From scene to scene, he leaves no fades to black. As one scene ends the other smartly begins. That's what keeps the audience watching as if we were tucked tightly into our beds and rapidly turning pages of a good book. Each page is significant. This movie isn't just about crops. That's what makes Shyamalan such a keen filmmaker. He has the talent and ability to fog up the film, and distract you with different propositions.Shyamalan uses technique to peak his story, rather than dialogue. His masterful and favorite formula is the usage of flashbacks, which gives the audience a chance to catch up on what they might have missed. He emphasizes his points by re-occurring scenes and replaying them for the grand effect, the 11th hour, until he hits you with the finale. Whether you believe the outcome or not, you cannot deny his aptitude for storytelling.This nervous and paranoid feature film with a heart-pounding ending is terrific. I was still thinking about it when I left the theater. You too, will enjoy the ride. But, when it's over, say your prayers, get into bed, pull the sheets over your head, breathe a sigh of relief, and close the book!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting and clever scarefest reinvents the modern horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a horror film fan for 30 years. While I remember a few films actually scaring me as a kid (Jaws, Psycho), I have failed to encounter many in my adult life. I like to be scared, but Hollywood has seen fit to retread every tired formulaic convention in just about everything it throws at the local multiplex. Even the independent filmmakers, free of the "system", seem to forget what FEAR is. Mostly I sit solemnly staring in disbelief at the screen, waiting and hoping to get those goosebumps. Then, finally, we were given Signs. Most will say, including the director, that this is not a horror film; I genuinely disagree. If this is not a horror flick, then it is time for this film to start a branch of its own and begin a new genre. I admired every little aspect of this picture, from the use of everyday objects: baby monitor, a blank television screen and a half empty glass of water, to convey and act as a vehicle to extract fear from the ordinary. Most of all, Shyamalan is an expert craftsman and knows how to get the most out of space, actors and sound. It is the lingering shot on a basement staircase when you are desperately hoping he moves his camera to show us more, or the screeching sound in the next room whose source he won't reveal . This director knows just how long to hold the shot, to increase the tension and build the suspense, long enough for our mind to begin forming pictures. And those pictures can be the most frightening of all. Stay the course Shyamalan.</fullReview>

Sixth Sense was extremely clever and very frightening, Unbreakable was one of the first movies to take comics seriously and was also very cleverly written. This had the potential to be a new ET or some other kind of clever Science-Fiction, and instead we get this God awful (pun intended) sermon thats supposed to tell mankind that EVERYTHING is predestined.

		<shortDescription>An expert at work...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leave it to M. Night Shyamalan to take our expectations for a movie, turn them upside down, and still deliver a work surpassing anything we'd dared hope for.With `The Sixth Sense' and `Unbreakable' the young director so immersed us in threatening, supernatural realities that we would follow him anywhere. When all roads led to remarkable twist endings, we loved him even more.It's with high expectations, then, that audiences greet his new sci-fi thriller `Signs.' And Shyamalan waltzes into the picture clearly aware of what's expected. He knows we're on to his trickery and will spot his clever little ending a mile away, and that knowledge assures that we won't.Shyamalan also uses the ongoing allure of UFOs and space aliens to sell a film that, ultimately, has little to do with either one.Despite the inescapable background noise, the movie is really about the emotional and spiritual journey of a rural widower named Graham Hess (Mel Gibson). Formerly a reverend, he gave up his church after the death of his wife.When we meet him, his days are spent tending a large farm with his brother, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), and children Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin). It's a simple life that's turned upside down when strange crop circles show up in his field. At first, Graham is convinced it's a prank, but then they begin to appear around the world, and the possibility of alien life - perhaps even an invasion - looks realistic.As the film runs its paces, it riffs on a number of themes more important than the crop circles themselves, but Shyamalan is smart enough to know he has to hang his hat on something. With that in mind, he hides his real issues within a first-class, neoclassical thriller. That means the scares come not from splashy, grotesque special effects but tight editing and suspenseful storytelling.From the opening frames, Shyamalan creates an atmosphere so eerie and tense that one literally feels tired by the time the film ends. But it's a good tired, the type that comes after working on something worthwhile and being aptly rewarded for the effort.It's safe to say nobody else could have directed this movie. The unique perspective is purely that of Shyamalan, who wrote, produced and directed.At one turn the film feels campy, at the next desperately serious, but Shyamalan has somehow melded the diversities into a whole that plays like real life. Since that's what most people look for at the movies, the payoff is big.Shyamalan also demonstrates an expert ability to build tension, break it with comic relief, then rebuild it. It helps that he has veterans like Gibson and Phoenix delivering the lines, but one gets the feeling this movie would have been great even without the megastars. I'm glad they signed on, though, because their names assure a big-time audience, and this is the type of film that deserves one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie and even though I like Shyamalan, love Gibson and think Phoenix is great, the movie is plain stupid. Admittedly, it has quite a few moments that really scare the hell out of you (at least on the big screen). But the ending? Think about it! Aliens invade the earth and have to leave because they can't cope with water/rain? Where does that come from??? They've obviously been to earth a few times to "check the location", but they never encountered rain? They don't know that??? How stupid must they be - and yet surprisingly enough perfectly capable of building spacecrafts and interstellar travel. I think "Signs" is one of the most stupid films I've ever seen - unbelievable that such a film has been made. It's a shame!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moody , Atmospheric But Far From A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>!!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!! There's a lot to commend M Night Shyamalan's SIGNS for . It's not often we see such a moody atmospheric thriller about an alien invasion and I will praise this movie later . However Shyamalan shots himself in the foot by the way the story is told Crop circles appear outside the home of the Hess family and after Graham Hess and his brother Merril find out that it wasn't caused by local pranksters Graham's son Morgan comes up with the answer - It was done by aliens . He knows this because he read a book on the subject . Obviously everyone else in the world has read only one book - The same one as Morgan - because as soon as crop circles appear round the world it's the leading story and can mean only one thing: The aliens are coming . And sure enough just like everyone has predicted lights appear over Planet Earth's cities which herald the start of little green men come to wipe us out If someone told you crop circles were signs on an alien invasion how would you react ? Exactly but at no point does anyone question a possible invasion because it's taken as read by all the characters in the story which starts to become ridiculous when the world's broadcasters start interrupting programmes showing the world wide phenomenon of crop circles . Let's be honest here jet liners crashing into sky scrapers is a good reason to interrupt TV shows with 24 hour news reports but people finding crop circles all over the world is not There's one other thing : Ten year old Morgan seems to be channeling the minds of Newton , Darwin and Einstien . Listen to this kid's dialogue " Everything people have written about in science books is about to change " and there's several more instances of this . You can't take this child seriously or believe in him as a three dimensional character Make that two things : Why would aliens invade a planet whose surface is composed of 70% water ? Isn't the human body two thirds water anyway. Oh and how does Graham's neighbour know that the aliens don't like water anyway ? Better make that three things because if the subtext is about rediscovering ones faith then why is everyone certain of an approaching invasion ? Surely for this theme to work then Graham should have been shouting from the roof tops that aliens don't exist only to be proved wrong . If he's wrong about aliens then surely he's wrong about the non existence of the lord right ? It's a great pity that Shyamalan didn't think these things through a bit further because despite not ruining the movie these things stop SIGNS becoming a masterpiece of genre cinema which it certainly had the potential to be . Even a critical viewer like myself who noticed the flaws couldn't help being terrified by the climax in the cellar where for one heart stopping moment it looked like a couple of the characters had been abducted . As for the scene Graham sees the reflection in the TV .... I certainly can't fault the good bits and I will recommend this movie even to those who don't like SF/Horror very much . Certainly it's a radical change to watch a film like this that doesn't have tens of millions spent on special effects and the film works better for it . You reading this Mr Spielberg ? Shyamalan will best be remembered for THE SIXTH SENSE , a film that I found somewhat overrated while his follow up UNBREAKABLE was a masterpiece in my opinion . SIGNS is slightly different because it doesn't have one of those shock twist endings and when you consider what a poor film THE VILLAGE is one can't help thinking that Shyamalan would be better off abandoning clever endings and concentrating on terrifying audiences and I would wonder if he could get away with directing a Hollywood version of Nigel Kneale's QUATERMASS AND THE PIT . Now that would be worth queuing at the cinema forUpdate 30 dec : Some have mentioned that the concept of predestination is very important to understanding the movie ie the plot holes aren't actually plot holes viewed this way and while this makes absolute sense in a metaphysical way it still misses out on logic</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of the people that comment on this movie are going to relate the fact that they were disappointed. And that's okay- your opinion of a movie should always include your pre-showing as well as post-showing emotions. But to those people I just have to say, "You just don't get it." Everyone is going into this movie thinking it is some kind of chilling horror, or blood-and-gore slasher flick. Shyamalan doesn't do those tired genres, thankfully. Instead, he gives us a warm, funny, emotionally-charged, and yes, suspenseful thriller which manages to compact an entire list of genres into one whole film.I have seen the movie twice already- the first time for myself, and the second time just for crowd reactions. I wasn't bored through either showing. This is in part to some great acting by Phoenix, and some PHENOMENAL acting by the two child leads! Gibson isn't too bad either, but I have to admit, his part could have been played by anyone (sorry Mel :)I think for the first time Shyamalan really brings us a film that doesn't rely on smoke and mirrors to please the audience. For all those naysayers out there, I would suggest that you view the film again, either now, or when it is available for home use. Look- and listen closer. You might just be able to make out the 'Signs.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>worst movie i watched for years ... maybe worst ever ... the story is an insult for anyone with a brain (no logic, no ideas, nothing ...) , the aliens looked like in a b-movie from the 60ies ... the whole movie is based on intimidating music, which starts to be funny after the first 2-3 mins ... do not watch it so aliens who have a water allergy come to earth to get fresh slaves or food or whatever they intend to do with the humans they get: - they have spaceships but no spacesuits or even raincoats - they can't open doors- they can jump from the top of a house on a swing and then in a maize field without problems but a normal guy with a baseball bat can beat the hell out of them- the spaceships are invisible and can't be shot down and a toy phone can intercept their communication- they are naked (what was the atmospheric humidity on earth?) and don't seem to use tools at all- they navigate the earth by making strange signs in the maize fields ... yep, so what are they doing when there is no maize ... how do they navigate the universe? what about the water drops which condensate on the maize each morning?- the American gun maniacs do not form local militias to protect themselves ...- the main character doesn't get a useful weapon, just goes hiding - he even doesn't care to take his beloved dog with him ... lets him die (very Christian)- the first rain makes this highly developed species (space travel is something we will not manage soon) run as hell- ... a lot more of this, don't have the time OK, one can say that the movie isn't about aliens at all, but about faith:- so god sends a plague on earth, lets a lot of people die just to show the way to this one person ... what about the others? wouldn't it be better to choose a way to show him the way without many people dying in the process? remember, this isn't the old testament god ... this is the new and improved model with love integrated ...- what do you believe would happen after a failed alien attack ... what politic will the earth follow after this? a peaceful one? or one in which we get even more arms and get even more paranoid? will we enjoy more or less democracy? gods plan?- since god created everything he created the aliens also ... he doesn't seem to love them ... OK, granted, he doesn't seem to love us too, but they aren't even mentioned in the bible ;)- just imagine we were those aliens ... would we give up after the first failure? watch our history! we would come back stronger and with more troops. why do you believe would a species which was persistent enough to develop space travel give up that easy? or will we see a second part soon? and to see everything from an economic view:- how expensive would you think space travel is in relation to several humans? - if it is still economically OK to do this, wouldn't you as a developed species plan the whole undertaking carefully?- could you possibly land on some less populated and badly protected point, and maybe not that wet? a desert maybe, where you could get several tribes without anybody noticing for years?- i would be ready to bet you could go to any politician on any place on earth and he would sell you a lot of people just for a fragment of your knowledge (for example a lot of the American slaves were not catched by Americans but were sold by other African tribes to the Americans) or maybe just as a token of good will, or just to bribe you to go catch slaves somewhere else next time ...- maybe your genetic engineering should be as developed at that point as your space travel and you should be able to create your slaves/food yourself? by the way, you shouldn't be able to eat humans, they consist of water for a great part- of course your ships are invincible and you surely have some weapons too ... so what about the people on earth paying you a tribute so that you don't blow the earth to pieces?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I actually really rather like Signs...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs is set in Bucks County, Pennsylvania where Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) lives on a farm with his his two young children Bo (Abigail Breslin) &amp; Morgan (Rory Culkin) plus his younger brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), one morning they discover elaborate crop circles in their corn fields. At first they think it's a hoax but there are newsflashes all over the TV which say these crop circles have appeared all over the world, then things turn really sinister when UFO's start appearing in the sky by these crop circles &amp; when footage of an alien is caught on a camcorder the Hess family have to consider the possibility of an alien invasion...Written, produced &amp; directed by M. Night Shyamalan who also has a fairly big role in the film as Ray Reddy who ran over Mel Gibson's character's wife I actually really liked Signs. The script which takes itself pretty seriously could be described as somewhat slow at times but I thought the story was engaging &amp; pretty intriguing which kept me hooked. I really liked all the character's here, OK maybe the kids are a touch annoying as they tend to be in films but I thought this was pretty well written with a decent balance between humour &amp; seriousness. The alien invasion stuff is kept to a minimum &amp; little is seen of the aliens themselves, this is a film where less is more &amp; it retains a air of creepiness around the aliens. It's not big on action either &amp; concentrates on the Hess family &amp; almost totally ignores the outside world which is unusual for recent alien flicks which tend to be nothing more than showcase's for overblown CGI computer effects as in Independence Day (1996) &amp; War of the Worlds (2005) so Signs is a nice change of pace, I mean there's nothing wrong with huge CGI special effects filled films but Signs was just a nice change.Director Shyamalan does a fine job but then he had a mega budget to help him, for those looking for another The Sixth Sense (1999) will probably be disappointed as Signs is a very different film &amp; doesn't have such a great ending. I thought there were some creepy moments here &amp; the restraint in the usage of CGI here helps create an ominous atmosphere &amp; leaves something to the audiences imagination which is a novelty these days. What CGI is here is very good &amp; the alien when eventually seen looks OK if a little unimaginative.With a whopping budget of $72,000,000 Signs obviously looks the business &amp; has that big budget Hollywood look although that huge figure did surprise me a bit as there's not many special effects, there's only about five character's in the entire film &amp; it takes place in the same location for the most part so 72 big ones does seem like quite a lot considering the end result. I thought the acting was pretty good throughout.Signs in my opinion is a great alien invasion flick that tells it's story in a different sort of way, I liked it a lot although I know for a fact there's a lot of hate out there for it. Personally I think it's well worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unspeakably brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In last week's issue of Newsweek, M. Night Shyamalan is quoted as saying to his accomplices in crime, "If I did 'Pokemon 5,' would you come? Come on! I could turn it into a metaphor for the human condition!" The scary thing about that comment is not only that he probably *could* do it if afforded the opportunity, but also that he pulls off a similar trick in "Signs," which from an artistic standpoint is easily the best film he's ever done.The greater picture of the film is the crop signs that suddenly and quickly start appearing worldwide - and the question of whether they mean anything for mankind as a whole. But once the greater picture is laid out in the first twenty minutes, it takes a complete backseat to Shyamalan's happy &amp; pained family of four, and focuses on their feelings, their worries, their doubts; as the horror of what's transpiring in the greater picture creeps closer to them.When Merrill says, "It's like War of the Worlds," it's NOT hyperbole, even though we never see what transpires in the greater picture. Instead, Shyamalan focuses on the subtle nuances of the fear of the individual. Instead of seeing hundreds of soldiers fighting in hand-to-hand combat with gigantic bugs, we gain an appreciation of what it's like for those who aren't blessed with such courage - or, in Graham Hess' case, being able to find it again.This is the first horror movie I've ever seen that both genuinely scared me - because you sympathize with the family's plight, even without seeing it - and made me laugh at the same time, because the family's reaction to the terror unfolding in the world is a sign itself of a strength that most don't have - the ability to be levelheaded and always keep things in perspective, no matter how scary or "out-there" the situation is.As usual, Shyamalan gets excellent performances out of all of his actors, especially Willis &amp; Breslin as Graham &amp; Bo. As usual, everything you see means something - the trick, like with "Sixth Sense" &amp; "Unbreakable, is whether or not you can put them all together. I'd be shocked, though, if this film doesn't get nominated for its sound - the soundtrack is Hitchcockian-creepy, and Shyamalan is a master at using sound effects to create the terror that the visual effects normally do.Don't go to "Signs" expecting a monster movie, or a shock ending, but definitely see it before the summer's out, and be prepared to be moved in ways that you previously couldn't have imagined from a horror or suspense film. It's been said that a genius of film is one who knows how to transcend or reinvent a genre - and with this film, M. Night Shyamalan is decidedly on his way there, if he hasn't already reached it. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Signs is written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. It stars Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin and Cherry Jones. Music is scored by James Newton Howard and cinematography by Tak Fujimoto.Still reeling from the death of his wife, former man of the cloth Graham Hess (Gibson) lives and works on his farm with his two young children and younger brother. When the family awakes one morning to find a huge crop circle in their plantation, it is asked if it's a prank or the sign of alien contact?I don't know if M. Night Shyamalan discouraged the marketing of Signs? Where evidence very much pointed to it being an alien invasion movie for all the family to enjoy? But Signs is anything but a family alien invasion movie. The trailers were deliberately vague, there was a mystery element hanging over the picture and with the Shyamalan CV already boasting the phenomenally successful The Sixth Sense and the divisive, but very moody, Unbreakable, hopes were pitched somewhere between excited and intrigued. Gibson on board, and Phoenix as well, good selling points without a doubt. However, Signs is a grower, a film that pays better dividends on further viewings once armed with the knowledge of what sort of theme drives it on. Yet it still frustrates greatly and you can see why it proved so divisive.Shyamalan's movie is primarily about faith, the loss of such, the alien visitors are merely a component of this theme, they act as the catalyst that takes Graham to the pinnacle of his voyage of discovery. The meditations on faith and grief are subtle initially but they drive the picture forward, but then Manoj Shyamalan slips into sermonising and his picture strives for a huge ending to justify it, which unfortunately never arrives, this after having been tickled and baited by the mystery of what the aliens want, friend or foe? Questions leap out such as will the Hess family come through this latest crisis in one piece? And will this "invasion" marry up with the director's thematics that he is so keen for us to open our hearts to? The answers to these questions are mixed, and take further viewings to digest fully. That is if you can forgive the downright idiocy of the alien visitors in the first place?The last third has killed the film for many, which is a shame given the excellence on offer in the first hour. Shyamalan's camera is wonderfully fluid, his mise en sc?ne is ace and he garners wonderfully low-key performances from his cast. While as much as his critics hate to acknowledge it, the director has a brilliant knack for building suspense, the ability to draw the viewer into his world, playing on our basic inquisitive nature. That he hasn't delivered on his promise, both here with the finale to the film and later in his overall directing career (though this writer personally loves The Village), is hard to argue against, but there is major talent there buried in his egocentric/confused make up. Elsewhere, James Newton Howard's score is channelling Herrmann and Fujimoto's photography is sublime, this really is a beautiful movie to look at.Definitely not a family film, and not really an alien invasion film, with it showcasing both the good and bad aspects of its director. Yet still compelling and pretty enough to warrant a second viewing me thinks. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a boring story, but one that becomes more and more incredulous as the lame plot goes on. I am sorry, but a child of 5 could have written a better plot line. My main gripe - and here is the spoiler - is the aliens. OK, "War of the Worlds" the aliens get wiped out by viruses, but here they insist on invading a planet which is 70% water, and they get burnt by... you guessed it... water. A race with this little IQ probably would not have created fire, let alone interstellar travel. I mean, Christ, one good storm will have them wiped out. Probably the worst film Mel G has ever appeared in. I can only assume he was using to bankroll that other film of his (which I have not seen).Summary - if you like lame plots, little action, no suspense and films that can't decide what genre they should be in, this is for you. Otherwise miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More signs of his limitations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I enjoyed 'The sixth sense' it didn't impress me enough to rush out to see Shyamalan's further efforts so I've only just belatedly got round to watching 'The village' and 'Signs' on the BBC and what struck me about both was their resemblance to padded and drawn out episode ideas for the 'Twilight zone'.On the positive side Shyamalan has an undeniable talent for building suspense and delivering a decent creepy scare or two, sadly however a film needs a coherent and (at least nominally) believable plot to go with said atmosphere and here Shyamalan's limitations (at least in 'Signs' and 'The village') are there for all to see.In 'Signs' we have the intertwined plot lines of Gibson losing/regaining his faith alongside an alien invasion and both are seriously flawed.The (laughably absurd) problems with the aliens are so plainly manifest and have been mention so often I won't bother going into them again which leaves Gibson's (equaly absurd) regaining of his faith.First of all it's so thickly layed on it makes the film seem distastefully preachy. It's not as if it isn't possible to portray redemption subtly without the film coming over as a thinly disguised metaphorical sermon (see 'It's a wonderful life') which is, of course, what this film essentially amounts to. Then there's the characteristically perverse behaviour of 'god'...apparently to teach Gibson a Job'ish lesson his wife has to die horribly along with untold numbers of others as Earth is invaded by hostile aliens. Now I don't know about anyone else but that seems just a little over the top to me, clearly 'god' was having one of those old testament days. Even if we skip the wider implications and focus solely on Gibson's epiphany apparently 'god' has gone old school again in getting a message through to Gibson that his brother should arm himself (something both he and Gibson had unbelievably failed to do throughout) and beat a fellow sentient being to death...you can just imagine Jesus sitting next to his Dad sadly shaking his head.So much like 'The village' this effort starts well, builds up effectively but eventually, when it matters, collapses into such absurdity as to make it simultaneously annoying (as all that is good about it seems wasted and you feel conned) and genuinely laughable.Seems Shyamalan was a one trick pony after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breaks movie rule #1</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs breaks movie rule #1: don't insult your audience.Fantasy is great. Implausible is good. Outlandish is acceptable.Signs is none of the three. It somehow manages to find its way into a fourth category - one that is so absolutely ridiculous that we question whether the writers were even awake.It's stupid that Jeff Goldblum uploads a computer virus to the alien mainframe. It's stupid that viruses kill aliens who probably wouldn't have DNA at all.But, you know what? Audiences aren't computer scientists (I am), and they don't know jack about how viruses (real or computer!) work. We accept that writers don't have technical knowledge and that they usually don't get it right (though we applaud them when they do).Signs, on the other hand, is an entirely different matter.Everyone who sees this movie knows how common water is on Earth. It comes out of the tap, falls from the sky, and covers 70% of the planet. It's in rivers, lakes, and in every living thing on our planet. Kids play with blasters designed to shoot it and balloons designed to hold it. We have pools of it to swim in. It's sold in bottles in every food store, convenience store, drugstore, and pretty much any other kind of store you can think of.So, considering that you could hardly choose something more universal, WHY would the writers of Signs decide to make the aliens vulnerable to water? They know how universal it is. They know how absolutely ABSURD such a plot point is, and they know that their audience will know it.Yet they proceeded anyway. Perhaps they were trying to push the limits of what their audience would accept. Perhaps this is some kind of silly joke. But whatever the reason, their choice was not a lack of understanding. Their choice to make the aliens vulnerable to water was not a mistake and not an oversight. It was a deliberate choice.It's a slap in the face. A big "screw you" for trying to believe that this movie in any way represents any sort of reality. Not just the reality we live in, but any reality whatsoever. Movies don't have to be consistent with the world we live in, but they do have to be consistent with themselves.I am vocal about my distaste for movies that insult me. Flightplan sucks because it breaks the barrier of plausibility. But as bad as Flightplan is, Signs is 1000 times worse. From beginning to end, this movie just doesn't fit together.Signs doesn't break with plausibility to advance the plot. There is no tongue-in-cheek "OK, this is absurd" like Austin Powers or Spaceballs. It's not funny, it's not artsy, and it's not smart. Signs breaks with plausibility simply because the writers thought they could get away with it. I, like many others on IMDb, have responded with an empathetic "NO". You can't just jerk me around for your own amusement. Write a movie that holds together or I will go watch one of the numerous other pictures that do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of most stupid movies I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Again, Hollywood insults the intelligence of the cash carrying public.This is a story of and alien invasion - well, its the story of a small town family in the midst of an alien invasion.Its plays out with a priest who loses his faith, a family that loses its mother, and of course, all that is nicely resolved as the story plays out through the alien invasion.The aliens in this film are somewhat mysterious, possessing a multitude of spacecraft, lurking around in the dark, making crop circles, and without really being given much treatment except as a source of menacing and scary noises. Oh yeah, poison gas can come out of a thing on their wrists, whose only function seems to be threatening children.Having sat all the way through this film, wondering what its all about, we find that the aliens really are invading the earth, and soon after that we find out that this story will resolve by a secret alien vulnerability.Whats the secret alien vulnerability? They melt when they come into contact with water. A little girl, who has been stashing glasses of water around the house throughout the whole film, throws one on an alien and it melts. Boom Boom.At this point, the sheer intellectual laziness of this film washes over me, filling me rage. $10 and this is the best you can offer me.You can picture the writers huddle - "ok, now, how do we get rid of the alien menace before the film end? I know, they are vulnerable to ...., {swigging from a bottle of Perrier}, um, WATER!. Oh fantastic, you are a genius, lets put that in the script and we can all go home now." So lets see here - an alien civilization travels between the stars to invade the earth, a planet 70% covered by water, and where almost no place is untouched by rain, and they forget to wear the simple protection that something like a raincoat might offer, not to mention any other protective measures their star-traveling civilization might have come up with for when they encounter this most common of solvents.Hollywood writers, I know its just a plot device, but fer Christ's sake, if you cant come up with something better than this, you should probably go and find another job. It really wouldn't take much more thought - you could pick any common household substance to use, petrol, ammonia, whatever, and it would be more credible, and I wouldn't feel like I was just slimed as I leave the film.</fullReview>

Maybe M Night Shambles intended this movie to be full of clichs and references to far superior films such as War of the Worlds, or maybe he just had an off day. The best acting was "performed" by the two German Shepherd Dogs - obviously they had to die as they totally upstaged the humans.If you haven't seen the film then don't waste 100 minutes of your time, do something else instead.</fullReview>

Speaking of which, Rory Culkin, who acted in the film, was on that Bravo Special talking about the film, and it seemed that this movie stupefied him. he was talking like he was possessed, saying stuff like "the family gets crop circles...in their crops...and it's aliens..." i think the dumbest part in the movie was it's "climax" . it was a HUGE disappointment. i figured that Mel Gibson or Joaquin Phoenix would get a gun or something and blow the heads off those aliens, but no. the aliens are so weak and defenseless that they can be trapped behind a weak wooden door and get burned by A GLASS OF WATER. so this space creature can operate a spaceship, make circles about a mile wide in someone's backyard, but gets killed by a glass of water. Wow. I didn't know Shymalan's movies would sink THIS low. if you want to see a good alien movie, see "Day the earth Stood Still" or "Independence day", or MAYBE EVEN "Mars attacks!".

Personally, I think that if they are supposed to be far more sophisticated than us, they wouldn't come near our planet.The other biggest problem that I had with Signs is the fact that scientists believe that no life can live without water, so according to that theory, these aliens shouldn't even exist.In my opinion, the writers should have thought of something else that would kill the aliens off... maybe some other common household item.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A completely unbelievable premise from the start; this cheesy sci-fi nonsense is brimful of unlikely events and cryptic comments which turn out to be psychic predictions of advice needed in days to come. It is impossible to be scared despite the desperate attempts to build up the suspense, as at every moment, the viewer is bombarded by the ridiculous. From the start, the violent death of Mel Gibson's wife is portrayed with more comedy than horror, as she is pinioned between a truck and a tree and with her dying words, begins seemingly to ramble incoherently, including the words "Swing away". As crop circles and aliens (cartoon-style aliens) take over the neighbourhood, the son finds a textbook which seems to somehow predict the whole episode. At last the aliens begin to retreat, for some as-yet-unknown reason, but Mel and his family have a last battle to fight in their home. The alien attempts to kill Mel's child but _fortunately_ he has an asthma attack at that very moment (wouldn't you know it) so does not breathe in the toxic fumes and therefore survives (restoring Mel's faith, which had been sadly lost by the death of his wife). Meanwhile the words of Mel's dying wife are recalled, and Merrill "swings away", splashing the alien with water and thereby killing it (very Wizard of Oz). Absolutely ludicrous from start to finish - I rarely feel upon exiting a cinema that I have wasted valuable time from my life, but this was one such occasion.</fullReview>

There are two major things about this movie that make it completely awful, and it makes me think that he was too rushed or lazy when making this film.-- The deadpan acting. I don't know if MNS was trying to go for deer-in-headlight shock, or the heavy burden of the situation, but Mel Gibson and his entire family were completely unemotional about *anything*. After listening to their monotonic drone for thirty minutes, I was completely bored.-- The aliens. These guys are smart enough to accomplish interstellar travel, yet they've been plotting for a long time to take over a planet that's 70% covered with a substance that's toxic to them (I don't know... maybe they were looking for a source for WMDs), and they can't figure out a way to break down a wooden door with a weapon, explosives, or at least an improvised battering ram.... hoooo-kay!</fullReview>

And if you tell me the movie isn't really about aliens but about faith and Christian love and whatnot, I'll tell you plainly to shut up. It's a sci-fi movie, and it's bad sci-fi. If you consider it as a family movie it's even worse. Joaquin Phoenix, remembered fondly from Gladiator and Buffalo Soldiers, is wasted. And the kids were even more irritatingly cute than Haley Joel Osment in Sixth Sense - if that's possible. We got mediocre directing (not up to M. Night Shyamalan's standards), bloody awful writing. Shyamalan's dialogue was always bad, but the stories were great. This time we have a story that is not much more than a remake of War of the Worlds. This movie was made dozens of times before. The fact that Phoenix mutters 'It's like War of the Worlds' (oh, how self conscious) doesn't make it a parody or a homage. It's still a rip-off. Mars Attacks was a parody; Signs is a rip-off. The film doesn't excuse itself by using higher standards of special effects than were available before - the aliens look so awfully digital it's just pathetic.And the thing that bothered me worst is this. Watching a Shyamalan film, my expectations low though they were, I knew that as bad as the script will be, I'll still get a lovely, surprising twist ending. Well, there was a surprise. Here's the twist: there's no surprise. The ending is obvious and cheesy as hell. Maybe that's meant to be the surprise - if it is, it's a very tasteless joke. Sorry. The corny love-thy-neighbor-and-god-and-believe-in-yourself messages at the end don't impress me much either. Signs told me nothing I didn't already know. Look, I know all about crop circles, right? I kept hoping for a surprising explanation for the phenomena at the end of the film. Well, here's the explanation - they were created by thin, ugly, green aliens who want to take over the Earth, who look surprisingly like the guys from Close Encounters. WOAH! That was so never done before! Hey, hope you don't mind the spoiler. I consider it more a fair warning to prevent you from completely wasting two hours of your life. If you're a sucker for trick endings and consider watching the film because you liked Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, stay clear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing but overly deliberate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Graham Hess is a preacher turned farmer since the death of his wife 6 months prior shattered his faith in the idea of God being in control and all things happening for his reasons. When his children awake to find a massive corn circle outside their house, Graham assumes practical jokers. When he sees men running outside his house at night he is sure of it. However when they begin to occur all over the world and are soon followed by global sightings of both crafts and aliens, he begins to realise what is going on, although the reasons behind it are unclear.When it came out, Signs got so trashed by the majority of critics and imdb users that I decided to skip it. When friends got it out on DVD I was glad of the chance to see it, but wary that it may not have too much to offer. I was surprised that I enjoyed it, but I could also see why so many people had major problems with it. The plot is intriguing from scene one and only builds bigger as it goes along. My main problem with it was, just as the events take on a massive global significance, the film turns to focus on only the farm house. This is OK but I felt I needed to see more of what was going on elsewhere as the small scale action couldn't compete with the bigger picture.The film has plenty of jumps but suffers from being overly deliberate and plodding for the majority. Every scene is shot as if it is teasing with the idea of an alien bursting out at every minute and thus doesn't feel like it flows or is as natural as it could be. The actual plot is OK but many will be turned off by it's concept that `God has a plan' ? especially since they came for sci-fi, not religion. The flashbacks don't totally work and Shyamalan's traditional twist is not as impacting as he probably planned it to be.The cast is pretty weak considering the talent. Gibson plays it too tight and reverently all the way, it's hard to get with his character considering how straight he plays it. Then on the other side of the coin Phoenix is better because he is a little looser and more comic, but this doesn't sit well with the `on edge' feel that Shyamalan has given almost all of his scenes. Culkin is OK but too obvious while Breslin is better than she is allowed to be and really could have benefited with a bit more screen time.Overall this is a good story at heart but is spoilt a little by the telling and the fact that, while we all saw it becoming a global sci-fi, Shyamalan was actually building it to be come a much smaller look at faith and God. This clash of aims is hard to accept but there is still plenty to enjoy as well as plenty of jumps, just a shame that the film's final quarter can't live up to the expectation the plot had created.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) lives on a corn farm outside of Philadelphia with his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), his kids Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin). Local man Ray Reddy (M. Night Shyamalan) had caused a traffic accident that killed his wife and he stopped being a priest. He discovers a crop circle and other strange things keep occurring. Bo thinks something is wrong with the water and puts glasses of water everywhere. Then aliens invade.There is no doubt that M. Night Shyamalan is a good technical director. He creates some great tension. He peppers the movie with little comedic moments. It's a great little non-explosion filled alien invasion movie. It's a tense fun little horror movie. And then the reveal happens. The movie goes into disbelief. Honestly I try to excuse it from time to time but there are no excuses. Somebody must have noticed the problem but I guess nobody was willing to challenge Shyamalan back in the day.</fullReview>

Well, oceans of water. Yes Prefect, I am aware that water is extremely acidic to our race. But to be fair, The oceans only cover 75% of the planet. Rivers and lakes do take up some more, but the rest is dry.! Unless it rains from the skies, or snows?to be honest , with humidity we would be breathing the acid water pretty much constantly.No Prefect I can't think of anything else you need to be advised of. ??.except maybe, that we still can't figure out how to get inside their dwellings. I know! I beg your forgiveness Prefect, but they use these entry devices which have us perplexed. They call these things "door knobs".

'We're still going ahead with the invasion? It's just you know, there is so much water down there and you know how we don't get on with the stuff.' The General waves dismissingly.'Detail Splenkins, details.' 'With all respect sir there is loads of it down there, I mean whole great oceans of it. Then you have the streams, ponds, rivers. Schmek!

		<fullReview>Man-of-the-cloth Mel Gibson (as Graham Hess) has left the Priesthood. Six months ago, Mr. Gibson lost his wife in a car accident; and, he is struggling with a loss of Christian faith. Gibson's younger brother, Joaquin Phoenix (as Merrill Hess) has moved in, to help Gibson and his children grieve. Mr. Phoenix was a promising baseball player, but he stuck out too much...Gibson is an Episcopalian, obviously (a wife and sex are permitted), with two children: asthmatic alien-conscious Rory Culkin (as Morgan Hess) and perpetually thirsty Abigail Breslin (as Bo Hess). Gibson is also a farmer. The movie gets started when extraterrestrials startle Gibson's family, by turning their Pennsylvania cornfield into "Crop Signs" - aka "Crop Circles".Soon, these "Signs" are popping up all over India, and the world. Presumably, the designs are signposts for motherships - it's difficult to understand what logical purpose they would serve, as an alien spacecraft would be too technically advanced to use them... maybe, then, they are merely alien pranks. Or, they could be sent from God, to help Gibson re-harvest his faith? "Signs" borrows its basic plot from H.G. Wells' "The War of the Worlds" - a frequently tapped well. Gibson, Phoenix, and the kids look very silly in two memorable poses, sitting stone-faced with their palms on their knees and/or wearing pointy tinfoil hats. The biggest "jolt" comes early in the film, with a simple dog's bark. Mr. Shyamalan builds suspense well, in the early scenes.The best performance is delivered by director M. Night Shyamalan (as Ray Reddy). Cherry Jones (as Caroline Paski) is okay as the local cop, but her character should have written up (as a possessed alien, for example). The main "special effect" is good; but, the aliens, if they are real, have to be the dumbest extraterrestrials in the galaxy, if you stop and think about it? **** Signs (7/29/02) M.

		<fullReview>Where do I start? The absurd realism problems? The heavy-handed religious tub-thumping? The incredible stupidity of the aliens? Do I even need to bother giving a review since what I'm going to say has already been said? The aliens are stupid. They have advanced technology and yet eschew it in favor of making circles in fields and fighting hand to hand. They travel all the way to a world where 70% of the surface is covered in water even though it is incredibly corrosive to them. They don't even bother with any kind of protection from water. Just what do they want from Earth that can't be found on water-free planets, anyway?The film ends with a religious message, which only makes the already flawed film worse, in my opinion. The film illustrates the notion that everything has a purpose with a series of rather implausible coincidences (if only all the terrible things that happened to me and people I know turned out to be part of a divine plan rather than rotten luck...) Issues like how aliens fit into Christian theology (that could have actually made for some interesting discussion) are conspicuously absent.Despite the atrocious flaws I've highlighted, the film does have its bright spots. It is indeed rather creepy in places and has some redeeming moments. Still, they simply can't save it from the nonsense that pervades the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the happening (the Pixies)...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since "the Sixth Sense" (1999), M Night Shyamalan has become a respectable filmmaker who continues his exploration of the supernatural. Each new movie is announced like a great event. After "the Sixth Sense" (1999) and "Unbreakable" (2000), "Signs" was released in 2002 and as it was expected the movie was a worldwide blockbuster. A success widely deserved because the less we can say is that M Night Shyamalan's movie abounds in qualities, showing that he is able to go off Hollywood's beaten tracks to develop his peculiar style.First of all, it is obviously at the level of the directing that the talent of this young director shines. It is a real tour-de-force and the way he shots most sequences can only arouse admiration. It is also useful to add that several pictures are impressive (the air view of the crop circles).Then, from the beginning, an accumulation of weird details or sequences contributes to creating a disturbing and threatening atmosphere. Furthermore, the whole film takes place in the country and however, you are under the impression to be "in camera".But the main asset in "Signs" is the following one. Quite obviously, M Night Shyamalan wanted to tell the story of an invasion of aliens on the earth. For this, he almost never leaves Mel Gibson's farm and its surroundings. Everything is suggested, notably through the television and the radio which both play the role of link with the world. Of course, this invasion doesn't spare Mel Gibson's farm, neither the neighborhood. During a big part of the movie, you can feel the presence of the aliens by their sounds, their shadows, you believe you can see them. In another extent, their characteristics, their traits are either supposed, either maintained through the characters' words. At last, the action sequences boil down to the minimum (when an alien grabs Rory Culkin by the nape of the neck, Mel Gibson drops his torch to rescue him and the camera remains pointed at the torch. Mel Gibson's efforts to save his son are suggested by the struggle sounds.To go on with the assets, we can also take down this one: there's a will to use the special effects at a minimum, especially for the Crop Circles. Besides, the Crop Circles look like the ones you find on the cover of the Led Zeppelin album "Remasters".There's also another positive point: the presentation of the characters. On this point, M Night Shyamalan clearly distinguishes himself from the other American directors. A lot of them would have first introduced the characters and then would have broached the plot. Not M Night Shyamalan! From the beginning, we get to the heart of the matter and the life of each character (Mel Gibson's family), why they are in the current situation is explained to us during the progression of the movieAt last, there's often a discreet and sustained use of the music that contributes to create highly emotional moments. With all these advantages, "Signs" has all the elements to become a perfect movie. Unfortunately, the movie also contains a few shortcomings that keep it from becoming a masterpiece.Mel Gibson acts the role of a preacher who gave up his duties following his wife's death. It means that he lost his faith. But at the end of the adventure, he finds it again. In another hand, the two children reminded me of the ones you find in Spielberg's movies. I mean that they are the ones who discover the characteristics of the aliens. Then, I wonder if M Night Shyamalan drew from HG Wells' novel: "War of the worlds". In the novel, the aliens were killed by the microbes of the corpses and here, their "b?te noire" is simply water... Ultimately, in spite of a few weaknesses, "Signs" confirms well a thing: M Night Shyamalan's skill to turn a trite topic into an awesome movie. Highly recommended and we deal with an author we must follow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a bad sign, M. Night Shyamalan. A really bad sign!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written and directed by the India-born director M. Night Shyamalan, this religious film cloaked in horror science-fiction garb was the beginning of the end of the director success in the box office. While, this movie didn't tank, it did get a lot of mixed messages from critics. For me, this movie wasn't that entertaining. It was really bland &amp; disappointing. The movie tells the story of an ex-minister turn farmer, Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) whom homestead might be the site of an oncoming alien invasion. Without spoiling the movie, too much, the settling of this film is indeed scary. However, along with the alien invasion plot, comes a moral journey of a man's loss of faith and the circumstances that help him regain his faith. This part of the film, really undermine the other plot, by making it, confusing and too complex for the general audience. Due to the miscommunication of these two separate stories, whenever the two parts try to mash together, it didn't work. A good example of this is the whole idea of aliens invading a planet, full of water, when they're supposedly hate water. Now, it would make a lot more sense, if these creatures were demons from hell, and they were invading a desert region? Better yet, if the film told us, that the chemicals in the water kills the aliens, not the water, but the movie doesn't give enough subtext to make it seem that way. Another is the fact that these creatures can't seem to open any doors. Wouldn't it make sense, if the film show us, that the reason why these supposedly, technologically advanced aliens can't get through the doors, is because, they are fallen angels!? After all, there is a verse in Exodus; where God told Moses to have the blood of an unblemished lamb put on the sides and tops of the door posts of all the Israelites, so the spirits will not killed their firstborns? It's would match better, than the way, Shyamalan badly wrote about it. In the end, this story makes it looks like these aliens possess traverse space, but lacks common sense and strategy when it comes to opening doors, and avoiding water. It's uneven. Even the whole idea of crops circles being first a hoax, only to find out that its real debate is questionable, at best. It still doesn't make sense, why they would do that. Unless, the aliens were too stupid, in attempting peaceful first contact, but lousiness, mess it up. Even, the human characters are somewhat idiotic. It's weird that they saw, one of the creature trying to get in the house, through the roof, earlier in the film, only for them, to forget to board it, later, when the home was getting attack by the aliens. That's bad! While the story doesn't cite itself as such, there are a large number of similarities between Signs and the "Hopkinsville Goblins" event in 1955. It's quite possible Shyamalan drew on it for inspiration, whether it's a true story or a hoax is largely immaterial to the movie. All, I know, is this movie has very-very-slow plot development pacing with large amount of psychological dialogue and little action. Yes, I know, this is meant to build the tension, but gee, it was hard to get through. Another thing that suck, about this movie is the acting, or in this case, the lack of acting. The creepy, bland, non-expressive reply from the children, Bo (Abigail Breslin) and Morgan (Rory Culkin) is so clichs. Honestly, what type of children, act like that? Even, the crazy, full of emotions, Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix was flat and boring. Nobody really shines. I think, the only things that kinda shine in this film is the music by composer James Newton Howard, the sound effects, and the visuals. Shyamalan's visual style, and in particular, his use of the long take and the following aspects of his mise en sc?ne, his use of 'reflected images' and mirroring effects, is somewhat amazing. It set up, the uncomfortable mood or unworldly environment, so well. It heighten intense moments. Overall: While Signs contains the semantics of the science fiction and horror elements film. It's more of a message film that somewhat got lost, between the phrases of writing from script to screen. I really don't recommended watching. Unless, you like want to figure out the subtext of the film, or like really bad movies. For me, I never want to see this film, again. I just swing away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are few things more or less all moviegoers tend to agree about, one of them being that the career of writer/director M. Night Shyamalan, after an impressive start (The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable), has turned out to be a huge disappointment. Opinions may differ on the moment when he completely lost it, although Lady in the Water is generally regarded as the point his hubris got the better of him.Like The Village, Signs belongs to a middle Shyamalan phase, where his visual talent still made up for his limits (preachiness, plot holes, the egotistic insistence of casting himself in pivotal roles).Signs follows an alien invasion from the point of view of a small rural family including a widowed father (Mel Gibson), his younger brother (Joaquin Phoenix) and two kids. The movie is filmed with style, intelligence and an unusual attention to silence and stillness in the build-up of atmosphere.The elephant in the room is, of course, a plot hole so conspicuous it has achieved memetic status, with the water-allergic invaders mastering interstellar travel but not raincoats and umbrellas. Why don't you just commit yourself to directing and leave screenplays to better writers and acting to actors, Night? Not everyone can be Orson Welles and pull triple duty.Special mention for the fine score by James Newton Howard, homaging the works of the great Bernard Herrman.6,5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the "wow" of The Sixth Sense, I expected to be wowed again by Signs. Instead, I ended up laughing through the finale! This film does NOT belong in the same category of greats that includes: War of the Worlds (Gene Barry original), Alien, and The Day The Earth Stood Still. Outstanding shock scenes overshadowed the director's serious omissions and clumsy character motivators. Examples: 1) Wife is conscious and pinned against a tree by a car. EMTs decide she will die soon and fetch her husband so they can have a final moment together... and deliver Mel Gibson's big tag line,"Swing away." Are you serious??! EMTs rescue, treat and transport all victims. They do not withhold treatment to allow a tender moment. 2) The alien is standing in the living room and about to administer a fatal dose of gas to Mel's son. Does the director really expect us to believe that the boys' father needed his dead wife's inspirational pronouncement and his trophy bat to save his son??? What father wouldn't have ferociously launched himself at the creature or pummeled it with a chair? 3) In all the documentaries about this phenomenon, they are referred to as "circles." Not one calls them "crop signs" ... except in this movie.This film is full of such amateurish oversights and mechanical breakdowns. They're actually fun to look for. Start your own list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two-level story both succeeds and fails</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Signs" (2002) is a very interesting case. It's a sci-fi/horror story that has huge holes that are easily spotted. It's completely contrived. Yet it was a huge box office success. This movie that cost $72 million grossed $408 million. And although the sci-fi aspect of the story can't be believed, the telling of it is engaging and well done. The sci-fi story is almost but not quite dominated by the story of a father who has lost his wife and lives now with his brother and two children. So, here we have a combination of two stories, one a failure, the other a success.Within the story there is a book that predicts how aliens visiting Earth might behave. The analysis is very reasonable. However, it is sadly and badly limited. It says nothing about the physical and chemical basis of this universe! Any people that learns how to conquer space and space travel over vast distances must have a strong knowledge of physics and forces. They would never behave as the aliens in this movie are depicted. This is not good science fiction. It is not even good science fantasy. The writer-director, M. Night Shyamalan, is skilled and made a great success, but at the cost of creating dumbness. In older sci-fi movies and written sci-fi, there is typically an effort to explain or rationalize certain features that might lie beyond current knowledge or that skirt physical principles or that might plausibly extend current physics knowledge. This tradition of rational thought has been dumped by Shyamalan. This is disturbing and rightfully disturbs many IMDb reviewers even if audiences didn't seem to care.I view the result as manipulative and demeaning. Shyamalan might be sincere in his efforts and product. Roger Ebert mentions his other movies that he thinks are good. I cannot judge. But the movie itself manipulates its situations and audience's emotions. Well, maybe all movies do that. So why does this case seem problematic? It's so outrageous. It so violates logic. Couldn't an equally moving story have been imagined that is more real, even a sci-fi story? That's what great and respected writers of the past have always done. Shyamalan has not respected that marvelous tradition. This is the shame of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Six months after a fatal accident involving his wife "Reverend Graham Hess" (Mel Gibson) has lost his faith and given up his calling to become a farmer instead. His son "Morgan" (Rory Culkin) is asthmatic and his daughter "Bo" (Abigail Breslin) is convinced that there is something wrong with every glass of water offered to her. Additionally, Graham's younger brother "Merrill" (Joaquin Phoenix) who lives with them is somewhat backward. So when their cornfield has certain symbols cut into it they all come to bizarre conclusions on what it all means. Little do they realize at the time that their worst nightmare is about to come true. At any rate rather than divulge any more of the story and risk ruining this film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this movie had a good balance of humor, mystery and suspense which managed to keep my interest from start to finish. Likewise while Mel Gibson performed well enough I especially liked the performance of Abigail Bresline and to a lesser extent that of Joaquin Phoenix as both were quite funny. In any case I liked this movie and rate it as slightly above average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite the backlash, M Night Shyamalan's last good film still holds up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before the days of a 19th century village doing their best Kristen Stewart impersonations, bizarre self indulgent bedtime stories, Mark Wahlberg talking to plants, air karate and planet nepotism, Shyamalan made 3 strong genre efforts which took genres (Ghost story, superhero, alien invasion) known for thrills and turned them into quieter, deft character pieces. It's the same with Signs. This is the last time he made a good film, although it's not as good as Unbreakable or The Sixth Sense. Signs has received some backlash following its release, but it's a flawed yet interesting work overall. It's an alien invasion seen through the eyes of a family who lives on a farm, and there are various Religious themes as well which make the story deeper than it would otherwise have been. Shyamalan's script has its ups and downs. There are some silly and awkward lines which provoke face palms while other parts of the script are more interesting. The performances are mostly OK, and Mel Gibson just about pulls it off.The film is less credible since it has a plot hole big enough to fly a UFO through: Why do aliens who are susceptible to water come to a planet where two thirds of it are lethal to them? This certainly lets the film down combined with the uneven script and lack of action, which can feel slightly disappointing. Shyamalan pretty much ditches a finale and the thrilling moments and small scale. This is a good thing overall, but a little more of a climax wouldn't have hurt. However, the Religious elements will divide people but for me they added unforeseen emotion to the storyline, and the film oozes suspense in every frame. With astonishing visuals and cinematography, the film certainly looks great and even if the suspense doesn't amount to all that much, the way it is maintained throughout the film is pretty extraordinary. It doesn't have the best storyline ever, but it's a memorable alien invasion flick a definitely worth a look. Any alien attack film which is brave enough to avoid a massive shoot out space battle deserves credit.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the most stupid, boring film i have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, the question is, why could somebody who produced a film as good as 6th Sense, then produce something so incredibly bad and void of logic as SIGNS? Is he short of a few dollars? he must be desperate - same applies for Meg Gibson. Sad. I really wish i had used IMDb first to read these comments and saved myself two hours of boredom. Just to give you a sample of why this film is the stupidist i have ever seen:1. Baby monitors can pick them up but military radar cant!!! 2. Water dissolves them (was that from the wizard of oz?)!!! 3. Mel Gibson plays an ex-priest who looses faith on the death of his wife but regains it when aliens leave for no clear reason except perhaps they suddenly realized planet earth has a fair bit of water and that's their downfall !!! come on, i could not smoke anything strong enough to get me to write cr"p like that 4..... the list just goes on and on</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was so overrated. It got great reviews and I thought I would see a "scary" scifi/horror flick. What I got was slow moving attempt at 6th sense with a stupid ending that was not at all scary. I appreciate the idea of aliens and religion, but it couldn't have been done worse. No movie is worth the cost of tickets today, but this one was really dissappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll begin by stating that I enjoyed the "Sixth Sense" and "Unbreakable." I did not enjoy this. The movie is tediously slow. There are however more fake scares than a "Friday the Thirteenth" movie, a tired ploy when overdone, as here. The screams at those by my fellow theatergoers, however, were the only things keeping me awake through this "thriller". I kept looking at my watch through this interminable snorefest, hoping I would be rewarded for staying awake with a big payoff. The "payoff," to use that word loosely was so lame and hackneyed as to be preposterous. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Attempt at Hitchcockian suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Decent acting from the child actors, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin. M. Night Shyamalan played a small part himself, and did well. I can see why this film interested Mel Gibson, with the aspects of his character's faith journey. River Phoenix and the minor cast were all adequate. Despite plot holes, which most science-fiction films have, this film is largely Hitchcockian. Rather than concerning itself with explicit exposition, the main point, aside from the faith journey mentioned earlier, was the building of suspense, which requires things to be imagined, rather than shown. Some of this build-up was truly creepy. Overall it was okay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Signs" is an absolutely terrifying but inspiring thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are signs all around us about making life the best we can. M. Night Shyamalan directs and writes this brilliant thriller that can be used as a wake up for people struggling with anything. Mel Gibson stars as a small town man in Pennsylvania named Graham who lives with his two kids and brother Merill (Joaquin Phoenix)after loosing his wife in a car accident. Graham used to be a pastor at a church, but lost his faith after his wife's death. When mysterious crop circles and sightings of aliens occur in their farm and around he world, the family must fight to survive and keep each other safe. While trying to put together what really is happening, various signs about Graham's life are experienced. The title refers to signs of aliens, but also to being fulfilled in life. The aspect that I appreciate most in this film is how scary the film is without being overdone or violent. Very elusive, unpredictable scenes with great direction provide extreme shock due to fear of the unknown like Spielberg did in "Jaws." The aliens are also extremely terrifying looking that give great entertainment to the audience. Shyamalan also doesn't get carried away with making only scary scenes, instead he focuses on human struggle and family relationships that anybody can relate to. He makes such a personal story that makes you feel empathetic for each and every character. Mel Gibson gives a very moving performance and is great at acting shocked. This thriller has everything, and will keep you entertained throughout. What a thrilling experience!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tad exciting, but acting is emotionless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Signs" is a movie about a family living on a farm finds mysterious crop circles in their fields, which leads to the discovery of an alien invasion.This movie is a little exciting, coupling a classic alien-invasion plot (seen in many sci-fi movies) with a dramatic subplot involving Mel Gibson's character. The story behind his character plus the development of the other cast members are essential to the movie as it does not give this film a typical aliens-on-the-loose story. However, the overall dreary atmosphere and emotionless and bland acting made took away the intrigue intended for the plot. If I've found out a band of outer space aliens are planning to attack the Earth, I would imagine citizens panicking and government officials sounding the alarm. The urgency and commotion of that notion are not depicted here. I believe this is M. Night Shyamalan's style of directing; however, it doesn't click with me, at least. I would like to see a movie where the story's urgency and suspense are depicted by believable and energetic acting. This movie had the potential to be very intriguing and entertaining, but it is average at best.Grade C</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has more holes than a moth-eaten old coat... and it is about as interesting to watch. If I understand the story, the entire earth has to suffer an alien invasion so Mel can get his faith in his god back. And what Old Testament god it is. This god afflicts a young boy with severe asthma, makes his little sister neurotic about water and kills Mel's wife just so remaining family members can survive an attack by an single alien with no clear idea what it is trying to accomplish. Too bad this god was unable to, like, make these aliens, who can be killed by a glass of water, smart enough to realize that it might not be a good idea to attempt a take-over of a planet (and a people) who are made of predominantly just that: water. Clearly, Mel's god is not omniscient. More like a plot-convince deity. Of course, a movie is more than just story (even this one)... the set decoration here was, for me, the best part of the picture. All those glasses of water, for example. Someone put a lot of thought into coming up with a bunch of different tumblers just like a family would collect over the years and a kid might use.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There are no coincidences...Only lousy writers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's be blunt. There are three good things about this movie, and I gave them 1 point each: 1) the acting. 2) Strange as it sounds, some very (intentionally) funny lines 3) It is a piecemeal of much better movies on the same subjects which you briefly relive until sadly reminded this is not one of them.1) The acting in this movie from Gibson down to the little girl is so good that it confirms the old saying that good actors can work with the worst material. It is one of those films we (cough) macho men hate because it makes you cry. Rather, the actors make you cry when they do. The little girl will break your heart several times. 2) The writers should have stuck to comedy. From wearing foil hats to other silliness there are quite a few light touches in the first half of the film that almost make it worth watching. Almost. 3) Unfortunately 99% of the film is not "horror", "sci if" or anything other than an unintentionally funny mess. It is a poorly connected ripoff of better films from the Exorcist to Close Encounters to War of the Worlds. Not an "homage" as some would pretend but a lousy reflection like seeing a beautiful painting reflected in a full toilet.If you can see it for free or cheap, fine. But don't pay money unless you intend to laugh at a trashy mass of plot holes &amp; ripoff of better works. And that's no coincidence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ha! Talk about totally cutting corners here - Get this! - Signs' story about a total, all-out invasion from outer space only featured one single alien, in all. It's true!Can you believe that director/writer Shyamalan actually expected the viewer to be so dumb and so unobservant as to believe that the world was being over-taken by hostile extraterrestrials when he only featured a lone invader in the story?.... Now, that's what I call idiotic and insulting! Since this film had a $72 million budget, surely Shyamalan could've included at least a small army of aliens in the action in order to make Signs' story appear to be somewhat more believable (instead of doing the expected by greedily paying himself $12 million and Mel Gibson $25 million).And, on top of that - When it was finally revealed to the viewer what it took to kill these aliens, it was more than enough to disgust any "thinking" person and get them to wondering whether Signs' story was, indeed, simply being made up as they went along.Told in the most dull and dry fashion imaginable, Signs' story didn't, in any way, convince this bored viewer that its director, nor its big-name stars, came even close to actually believing in their parts in this completely pedestrian production.</fullReview>

If the aliens can master space flight, turn their aircrafts invisible, wipe out an entire species and take over a planet, why can't they figure out how to open a wooden door. 2. The alien's weakness is water right? Then why would they land on a planet that is mostly made up of water? Wouldn't they also have shriveled up when they landed anyway considering there's water molecules in the air we breathe as well. 3. The boy who plays the son can't act for his life. 4. Why didn't the aliens bring any weapons with them? They can build aircrafts so they can probably make weapons as well. 5. The alien's design looks is very unoriginal. I honestly can go on and on about the major flaws this movie has. Is it a bad movie? yes. Is it overrated? very yes. But is it the worst movie ever? no. So 2 stars from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a film that is supposed to have been the thing that made Shyamalan what many describe as the next Spielburg, there are too many things wrong with this movie. The main points of interest being the Characters, the Story and worst of all, the fact that they actually state out loud why the movie is doomed to fail.First off, lets start with the characters. They're all as bland as is humanly possible. Everyone seems to have a problem talking in this movie because they resort to whispering, even when the situation isn't tense enough to require it. Also, no one seems to have an emotion, they literally just say their lines. Mel Gibson seems to just monotonously deliver his lines, and don't get me started on Rory Culkin, who seems to have kept up his family tradition of blank, emotionless faces that seem to come naturally to them because no one else on earth could put on such a boring face even if they tried. Also, the children speak like adults and the adults speak like children. Whilst Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix discuss yelling and acting crazy to scare away the aliens, Rory Culkin is busy describing the fate of the future and the earth to his sister like he was some kind of Einstein trapped in a child's body. Children do not act like this in reality, rather than discussing what their kids might think of their current situation, they'd be running around waving their arms in the air panicking, if not they'd be thinking about what's on TV tonight.Second of all, the story is rather inconsistent. It has Mel Gibson as the distraught father who lost his wife to a car accident and this is somehow woven into an alien invasion. However, the points at which they choose to reflect on Gibson's troubled past are so ridiculously timed. For example, whilst the alien is holding his son hostage, he decides to have a 5 minute flashback to when his wife died. As for myself, I'd be thinking of a way to get this alien off my son and kill it and leave the contemplation of my past to another day. The flashback scene of his wife dying would have had a more appropriate appearance say when he was lying awake in bed thinking of the past, like it does in most other films. Also there are many characters who say really odd lines which you may think are important who don't appear again, just 5 second cameos of people saying things that could be important to the situation, but they again just disappear.And thirdly and most damningly, the fact that they state out loud why the film can't work. The planet is being invaded by a technologically superior race of aliens who have travelled light-years to get here, but they can't break through Pantry Doors! Whoever thought that up needs to be kicked for being so stupid! You can't be this idiotic! If the aliens had trouble working with doors, say they were allergic to wood or something, they would have built a device to help them overcome this problem, but nope, they came all this way just to have their grand invasion plan brought to a grinding halt by a wooden door!Also, the aliens are harmed when they come into contact with water, it melts them. Well, perhaps they should have realised that critical point before they decided to invade a planet where 2/3s of its surface are covered in this harmful substance. The first rainstorm they come across (and if they've invaded the United Kingdom that's only minutes away), they'll be running down the drains in no time! You'd think also that they'd prepare for such an eventuality, like, oh I don't know, creating some protective suit or something so that they can't be harmed by the rain or any other water. But again, nope, they just came all this way with no preparation for this kind of situation, just so they could melt away into the gutter faster than they can say 'maybe we should have prepared for something like this...'This movie has too many problems to count, the characters are bland cardboard puppets, the story is driving in reverse, the climax is ridiculously simplistic and they went and admitted the film's fatal flaw right to the audience. If no one else picked up on this obvious plot hole the size of the Grand Canyon, then I must be going slightly mad. Yes Shyamalan is a great director, especially in previous films like the Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, but those were psychological dramas rather than something more practical like an alien take over where a little more emotion and a little more practicality is involved. My advice to him is, go back to the stuff you were good at, the stuff that actually got you good reviews without having to butcher the whole plot and the film's feasibility whilst doing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wooden and hollow, sort of like the door the aliens can't pass</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan has become the butt of every person's movie joke with his consistently preposterous films, his unusual casting, and his own name. Like every director, I believe he can make a well made, approachable film, but Signs is one of the biggest patient-testing thrillers I've come to know. It's an overwrought, frivolous exercise and a belligerent kick to the science fiction genre and those who aspire to work in the field.Shyamalan has effortlessly created one of the most unpleasant and meretricious films this side of the Earth. It begins when Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), a former priest, awakens to hear his daughter, Bo (Abigail Breslin) screaming outside in his cornfield. Graham and his brother, currently living with them, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) race outside to find Graham's son Morgan (Rory Culkin) and daughter staring blankly into a crushed area of corn, laying flat in a perfectly round circle. Their suspicion grows as rumors of extraterrestrial lifeforms have inhabited our planet and are looking to take over civilization as we know it.Graham and Merrill have been manning down the fort at home since Graham's wife was killed after being pinned to a tree by a man who had fallen asleep at the window. There is a scene where Graham and the man (played by Shyamalan himself) have an awkward discussion by the side of the road. It is an incredibly insensitive, strangely written scene, with the Shyamalan character reciting some of the worst written dialog in a scene supposed to occupy emotional importance. But that is only one of countless details the film neglects to build on or explain.The film tries to erect credible, memorable suspense by giving us close to an hour of buildup. I normally commend a film when this happens because I believe it provides the writer's talent to come forth, is one of the biggest and strongest building blocks to a great thriller, and is too often traded for things of a lesser breed. Here, the dialog is painfully slow, which leads to scenes progressing at a staggeringly incompetent pace, and every line of dialog is recited in a hushed, melodramatic sort of whisper that it becomes dreary and impotent abnormally fast.When we are finally met with the unworldly lifeforms (and trust me, they're not too exciting and their presence is kept at a minimum) we are greeted with one of the most colossal curveballs (not in a good way) and insulting miscalculations I have yet to see in a thriller. The aliens are said to have traveled light years through space and time, built ships of strong stature (which can be assumed since they can perfectly smash a healthy section of corn), and have successfully created a plan, they hope, will allow them to take over our planet. And they're allergic to water. I hate to build on this complaint, seeing as so many other people this side of the IMDb/Rotten Tomatoes forums have voiced criticisms have done so, but it truly not only strikes me as odd but incredibly unbelievable - even for a sci-fi film, where the suspension of disbelief is almost required for every film in the genre.How are the aliens supposed to survive on a planet that is two-thirds water? Where every breath you take has some moisture in it? It is also stated from Mel Gibson in one of the most laughably unbelievable lines in many a moon that the aliens "seem to have trouble with pantry doors." Yes. They are allergic to water and can't bypass an ordinary wooden door. Which leads me to another question; if the aliens plan to take over the Earth, you'd assume they'd need weapons, right? You can't go around the planet inconveniently landing in people's cornrows and crushing a good crop? If the aliens, presumably, have weapons on board that they could destroy the Earth with, don't you think the same weapons could be used to assist in bypassing a wooden door? It baffles me the negligence towards logic this movie partook in. Signs is a maddening affront to thriller and science-fiction films that try to create characters, atmosphere, and an original storyline, that are left to wallow in exhaust from the unexpected take off of other films of the same genre. I will say the film provides us with good cinematography, but completely disregards it so we can see more of the film's attempts at needless style and inconsistencies more noticeable than a perfect circle in your crops. I've always thought it would be virtually impossible to round up four or more capable performers in a picture and find almost nothing interesting to do with them, or even make an attempt to note their presence, but Signs has definitely proved me wrong.Starring: Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, and Abigail Breslin. Directed by: M. Night Shyamalan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The biggest problem with the movie is how ridiculous the plot is, but since this is more of a 'man regains his faith' movie than one about alien invasion I'm going to cover my thoughts on that here.*** Spoilers Follow ***So Mel plays a priest who's struggling with his faith because his wife died in a nasty accident some years earlier. God did this to HIM therefore his faith has wavered, children being murdered in Nazi death camps is absolutely fine. Then some silly plot devices happen that allow him and his family to survive and he finds his faith again. Once again it's all about HIM, screw everyone else. I find this way of thinking morally repugnant.There is no internal logic to this movie. We never get to understand why aliens with the technology to travel to our planet are retards. Read some of the other reviews of this movie if you need elaboration. These aliens make the ones in Battlefield Earth look intelligent.I hate this movie, and only the cinematography and acting raise this to a rating of 2/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So you thought that all those crop circles were made by hoaxers with too much time on their hands? Naaah, no way! They're all made by aliens! And if anyone is wondering why aliens might want to spend time making crop circles, the answer is simple. They're a sort of extraterrestrial sat-nav, designed to guide alien spaceships into safe landing sites.That, at least, is the theory put forward in "Signs". Most Hollywood films about alien invasions ("Independence Day", "War of the Worlds") deal with their subject matter from an American perspective. I mean, who in America wants to see a film about aliens invading Russia, or China, or Paraguay? "Signs" is even more insular in its perspective, showing us not the effect of the alien invasion on mankind in general, or even its effect on America in general, but rather its effect on one particular family living on a farm in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.The Hess family weren't always farmers. The paterfamilias Graham Hess was originally a clergyman who lost his faith after his wife Colleen was killed in a traffic accident and now cares for his son Morgan and daughter Bo with the help of his younger brother Merrill, a former minor league baseball player who, although talented, never made it into the major leagues because of his reckless style of play. (Bo? I thought clergymen were supposed to name their children after saints of the Christian Church, not eighties film stars).The film tells the story of how Graham and Merrill manage to beat off the nasty green-skinned invaders. In the process Graham recovers his faith in God after Morgan's life is saved by what seems like a series of coincidences; Graham then resumes his clerical career. The title "Signs" refers not only to the crop circles but also to these coincidences, which Graham interprets as signs of divine providence.If anyone is wondering how to kill a hostile alien, "Signs" offers some sound advice. Hitting them over the head with a baseball bat is apparently a good move, but the best method is to empty a jug of water over them, water being a substance which is intensely toxic to aliens. This raises a whole series of questions which the film never answers. We are told that the aliens are short of food and have come to Earth to harvest humans to eat, but what we are never told is why they have chosen to come to a planet the greater part of which is covered in water and which contains significant amounts of water vapour in its atmosphere. Why do they intend to feast upon creatures whose flesh is mainly composed of water (and therefore presumably poisonous to them)? And what do they do when it rains? They don't even seem to carry an umbrella. The normal answer to questions like these is to say "Ah, well, they're an alien species, so their thought processes are quite different to ours", but this does not really serve as an explanation. It is unlikely that any species could have evolved unless its thought processes tend towards self-preservation rather than self-destruction.A more fundamental flaw than plot-holes of this nature is the fact that "Signs" evades some of the most fundamental questions raised by its basic premise. Although the film purports to deal with a religious topic, and its central character is a former clergyman, it never asks "How might our view of God, and our religious beliefs, be changed by contact with intelligent alien life-forms?" Graham recovers his faith because he believes that God intervened to save Morgan's life, but never asks himself why He did not intervene to save Colleen. (Or, for that matter, why He did not intervene to save the aliens, who are presumably also His creations, from having glasses of water chucked over them).The role of Graham was, apparently, offered to Paul Newman and Clint Eastwood, both of whom wisely turned it down. Mel Gibson, unfortunately, was not so discerning, as "Signs" is a very disappointing film. This was only the second of M. Night Shyamalan's films that I have seen, the first being "The Village", which I enjoyed a lot more. That film worked well both as a thriller and as a parable about the dangers of nostalgia for some imagined past, and Shyamalan managed the difficult feat of providing it with a twist ending which is both original and satisfying. "Signs", by contrast, is a corny (pun intended) sci-fi thriller masquerading as a meaningful exploration of religious and philosophical issues. Both Gibson and that talented actor Joaquin Phoenix are wasted. 4/10</fullReview>

Making a good science-fiction movie is always challenging and only a few such as the producers of Gattaca have succeeded. This particular movie does not even come up to the less than average standard of Sci-fi B films of the 1950s and 1960s.Why didn't I like it? Basically it was a waste of time for the two fine lead actors Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix. The script and lines given them were just awful. Banal doesn't adequately describe them.A married priest (Gibson) ceases to believe in God and throws away his dog collar after his wife is terribly injured and dies as a result of a traffic accident caused by a neighbour who was had fallen asleep at the wheel of his panel truck. (How the priest becomes a born again Christian seems to be the film's only theme). It does not explain his nastiness to his young son (he also has a cute little daughter). He has a grown up kid brother (Phoenix) who is a former baseball star (don't forget that last part because it's vital for the movie's end). The kid brother has moved into the barn like cottage adjacent to their Pennsylvania corn farm, after the priest's wife dies, so as to keep him company.The Signs are the several neat circles the kids discover in the cornfield. More of them are contained in -of all things - a Sci-fi novel about alien invaders that the young son is reading. It seems all too obvious that aliens are at work because the local young hooligans are incapable of drawing perfect circles let alone carving them into the corn. The family's pet dog is apparently attacked by an alien and dies. They don't call the vet to attend to the injured dog because, guess what, as is revealed a bit later, the vet is the fellow who fell asleep at the panel truck's wheel.Nor only is the script banal and the plot very thin and obvious but the scenes just drag on and the movie seems a lot longer than its 108 minutes with not much happening. One only catches sight of an alien bogey man during the last thirty minutes or so. Its first appearance is in a Brazilian newscast that freaks out the priest's brother who is watching the TV. The local alien bogey man later appears in vivo in the priest's family den after the family has boarded up doors and windows (remember that happened also in Hitchcock's The Birds). Indeed, the producers don't seem to have made up their minds as to whether the movies should have been a pure sci-fi or a horror movie. It succeeds in neither genre.There is a slight twist at the end where their own alien is whacked thanks to some cryptic words the priest's dying wife utters in a flashback as Mel Gibson hovers over her body at the scene of the accident. The twist is actually quite clever and I shan't reveal it for the benefit of those who might like this movie. As in H. G. Wells' War of the Worlds and every other Sci-fi tale or movie about alien invaders, they always have a fatal weakness, if you can discover it.The quality of the movie is not even redeemed by any exceptional cinematographic special effects or lavish period settings and costumes. As the movies is set in 2002, the adults dwelling in the Pennsylvania backwoods are either clad in Wal-Mart blue jeans and chequered shirts or in patrol officer's uniforms. The child and animal actors are good though the child actors also suffer from the poor lines given them, fortunately not the lot of the dogs who only have to bark and snarl at the right moment or the flocks of bird extras who whirl and twirl around when presumably disturbed by the alien presence. The movie might have been partially salvaged by an element of humour, but even that is missing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is a man who could be a great writer/director but instead goes for the bucks and banality. He knows how to tell a tale. He knows how to create tension. He knows how to get the most from his actors. He doesn't know how to make the story make sense nor leave out the hyper sentimentality. Yes, he does know how to make money and that's what it's all about. I've seen most of his movies, usually leaving the theatre or my TV thinking, why wasn't that better? "Signs" is clearly such a movie. He immediately grabs our attention with the "signs" in the corn field and slowly feeds us more info, building tension all the way. When the "martians" as I will call them, even though they undoubtedly came from billions of miles away, are playing cat and mouse, it's exciting. When more and more "signs" show they are probably hostile, we continue to wonder what will happen. And then we find out. Nothing much. It is so utterly unbelievable that an advanced race, at least technologically, would come all the way to earth to "harvest" us and walk around "naked" on a planet with 70% water, when water kills them. Stupid. They would wear some protective costume. It's also unbelievable that they could come all that way with no weapons. Hostile creatures have weapons to destroy enemies. They didn't travel all the way to the Earth looking for better scenery. They came to conquer us, with what? Their bare hands? This is really a silly plot. We don't even see them attack anything. We just hear them rumbling around upstairs, like burglars who dropped by. Then they leave mysterious designs cut into the walls. OOOOH. Scary. Then the big confrontation with the eight fingered nudie. Phoenix conquers it with a baseball bat! It could have been Neanderthal vs. Homo Sapien. The subplot (main plot) about the self unfrocked minister and his rejection of god, is just lame. His wife is killed when she decides to go for a walk in the middle of the night along a highway. Surpirse! A truck hits her. Well, that is unlucky, but maybe it would be better to go for a walk on your vast farm. So Mel blames god. OK. Blame him for having a stupid president while you're at it. Then when his son might die from the secret poison gas of goofy the alien, he prays to god and god saves his son. Pretty fickle this god. So he returns to the cloth. Is this a plot or propaganda put out by the cathlolic church...or in his Night's case, the Episcolpal church? Oh well, it made money. Surely no one in his right conscious mind would accuse M. Night of being a great writer. There's just no logic to any of his work. But who needs that when you keep rolling away wheelbarrows of cash?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gibson, whose salary probably represents a significant portion of Signs' budget, plays Father Graham Hess, a widower who is caring for his two children, Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigain Breslin), on a Bucks County (Pennsylvania) farm. Following his wife's death six months ago, Graham has done his best to keep his family together. He is aided by his younger brother, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), who moved to the farm following the tragedy. But Graham has lost his faith in God and has renounced his vocation. Then, one morning, he awakens to an amazing discovery - crop circles in his fields. At first, he is inclined to believe it's all a hoax, but, as evidence mounts that this may not be the case, he and his family realize that what has happened in their fields may be the first signs that Earth is about to have a close encounter.While much of Shyamalan's setup is familiar, the meat of the story has an exotic flavor. Taking a page from Steven Spielberg's Jaws, the director keeps the aliens hidden from our view. We catch occasional, brief glimpses - a leg in the corn field, a hand under a door, and a flash of green on a television screen. With today's special effects being so convincing, it's unusual for a filmmaker to fall back on the old, tried-and-true technique of "less is more". In the case of Signs, it creates a level of tension that a full revelation would have spoiled.Then there's the added mystery of whether the aliens are benevolent or aggressive. Shyamalan obscures their intentions for most of the movie, concentrating instead upon the fears and concerns of the characters when they don't know the truth. Graham gives a speech in which he talks about how some humans will view first contact as a miracle that gives them hope, while others will see it as a cause for anxiety and uncertainty. In other words, is Earth about to be subjected to a Close Encounters or an Independence Day? For quite some time, Shyamalan doesn't tip his hand, and, when he does so, it isn't in a predictable manner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>10 things I hate about Signs: **SPOILERS**1. Shameless Hitchcockian/Psycho opening music and credits rip-off.2. Casting: Hiring 46-year-old Mel Gibson and 28-year-old Joaquin Phoenix to play brothers.3. Acting: Everyone said their lines like they were reading them off a teleprompter. Mel Gibson never changed his facial expression once during the entire film.3a. Small thing: If you want to build mystery about a character, don't cast the director of the film as that character. The audience will forget immediately that he is supposed to be mysterious and instead will say, 'Hey, that's the director!'4. Crop Circles are not inherently scary. You can't just establish that crop circles are scary without establishing why they're scary. The film opens with Mel Gibson discovering a crop circle in his yard. He is instantly frightened for the safety of his family, which is practically laughable. If some farmer woke up to find his crops ruined, I don't think he would be frightened. He would probably go and get his shotgun an' hunt down the sum' bitch who did it.4a. When one of the characters writes off the crop circles by saying it was discovered to be a hoax by some of British guys a few years back, you instantly negate your entire movie. Unless M. Nught purposely wants us to believe that two random dorks coincidentally guessed an alien language while playing their practical joke.5. Not one but TWO painfully long speeches by Mel describing how his children were born.6. Tired "My child has asthma" plot device, AND tired "little kid happens to be standing next to the only opening in a locked room while monsters are trying to attack them, so one of them can reach in and grab him" plot device, BACK TO BACK!7. Joaquin Phoenix plays an ex-baseball player who couldn't make it to the pros because he struck out a lot, even though he could hit the ball over 500 feet!!! Um, probably not.8. When a kid thinks there's a monster standing outside their window, they don't tell their parents in a monotone voice. It's usually more of a blood-curdling scream.9. Hearing a jarbled cell phone conversation over a baby monitor and thinking it's two aliens talking.not scary.10. Retarded scene with alien walking through kid's birthday party. Why would the aliens jeopardize their entire mission so one of them could walk through a crowded birthday party in the middle of the day? Is he a big fan of cake? Did he want a crack at the pi?ata?Bonus #11 (big spoiler)11. The aliens' weakness is.(drum roll).WATER! It's like acid. It burns their skin. Sound clever? The answer is no, and let me tell you why. If the aliens are killed by water, how is it that they can walk around on Earth? The air on earth HAS WATER IN IT!!! It's what makes the sky blue. We measure it with something called HUMIDITY!!! Why would aliens come to a planet comprised mostly of water to harvest humans who are ninety percent water? It's a plot hole so big, you could fit Rosie O'Donnell through it.Ironic because M. Night Shyamalamadingdong got his start directing a Rosie O'Donnell movie.</fullReview>

For example, we have an alien invasion of the world, and somehow it focuses on a PA farmhouse. Why?This movie is a mystery to me, because I know that Shaylaman can do better. I was impressed by SIXTH SENSE. But I think he's gone downhill since then.Somehow, the invasion of the world is defeated. But not ours to know who or why--or how. But oh yeah, there's one alien left behind. And in keeping with the writing, the aliens are like those that a fifth-grader would draw.And as if we needed any more schmaltz, there's some guff about religious faith. Bottom line: this doesn't even come up to the standards of a 1950's melodrama. THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL was much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this movie in expectation but with growing alarm, it was hard to believe it was made by the same director of 'The Sixth Sense'. What on earth was he thinking of? In 'Signs' we have every modern film cliche thrown in - the asthmatic child, the dysfunctional family, the husband tortured by his wife's death in a car accident on which he keeps having flashbacks.The sci-fi element was just ridiculous and laughable. Are we to believe aliens had the technology to travel millions of light years to Earth but yet couldn't get past a pantry door? The final scenes were so stupid (and yet so predictable) I almost gasped in disbelief. I rate this the most disappointing movie since 'Blair Witch' conned everyone a few years back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One more strike and Shyamalan's OUT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved THE SIXTH SENSE -- even felt it deserved the Best Picturenomination it got. And when Shyamalan's UNBREAKABLE came acropper a year later, I thought it was a noble failure -- everyone's allowedone of those.But with SIGNS, my goodwill is gone. I'm beginning to think that, likeJames Cameron, Shyamalan desperately needs a WRITER. SIGNS is amess -- full of "aliens are coming" gobbledygook, cringeworthy lines likeRory Culkin's protestation that he wants to stay in their home because "it'swhere Mom was" and excruciatingly poor acting from just about everyonebut Cherry Jones, who does her best to hold her head up high and not beembarrassed by this dreck that is her biggest shot yet at big-screen renown.Everyone knows the plot essentials by this point, suffice it to say thattheir are loose ends and plot holes big enough to steer a spaceship through, and when it's all over, you can only wonder why the aliens were so intenton terrorizing and/or killing this boring group of rural Pennsylvanians. Weren't there bigger fish to fry in the United States? (Possible SPOILER): Every seemingly minor element that is introduced --Joaquin Phoenix's sports past, Culkin's medical problems, the daughter'sobsessive/compulsive relationship to water -- might as well have a big"Deus ex machina" sign announcing it, as each is obviously beingintroduced for a payoff later on, without feeling in any way organic to theplot or the characters.Save this one for DVD on a night when there's absolutely nothing else todo -- or better yet, just skip it altogether.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The world is informed by some kind of universal intelligence of scarcely conceivable power, complexity, and aesthetic subtlety, yet one to which the human intelligence is akin, and in which it can participate" -- philosopher Richard Tarnas. Signs, the latest thriller from the director of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, is about Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) who leaves his ministry after a car accident renders him widowed and devoid of faith. Strange things start happening: crop circles mysteriously appear in his backyard, the family pet's suddenly strikes at his children, and strange static emanates from a baby monitor. In addition, unidentified flying objects and hostile aliens start turning up around the world. I won't say any more than that about the plot, but you get the idea.Signs had me on the edge of my seat?. ready to tear for the exit.I thought I would give this film a try, since I have been deeply interested in the crop circle phenomenon for many years. I figured if I could make it through the seven or eight trailers, I might have a fighting chance of surviving the multiplex experience. Once again, I succumbed to the hype, thinking that Signs was going to be a thoughtful treatment of a serious issue. What I found was just another recycling of all the shopworn thriller cliches and "hostile alien" stereotypes that permeate the studios.Signs does not attempt to even try to understand the complexity of the UFO phenomenon or the unearthly beauty and mystery of the crop circles, even though a prominent crop circle expert, Colin Andrews was an adviser. What seems to have escaped the Signsmakers is the realization that the universe truly is full of magic and wonder, different from the frightening images in which we have been carefully taught to believe. Repeating clichs about hostile alien invasions as is done in Signs trivializes unexplained phenomena that has great dramatic potential. M. Night Shyamalan, to me, seems interested only in exploiting the burgeoning interest in the paranormal to market his thoroughly pedestrian and unimaginative commercial product. Signs doesn't even deliver on its own terms. I found it to be neither entertaining nor suspenseful, and the ending to be laughably melodramatic.All signs point to a bad day at the multiplex.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**********POSSIBLE SPOILERS THROUGHOUT**********I've read some of the reviews here on the IMDB and one thing comes to mind: A lot of you have no idea what the movie is about, or just didn't pay attention to the dialogue. There's a lot of....1) Why did the aliens come to a planet that's 2/3 water when they are harmed by water.2) Why did the alien look so cheap.3) The characters don't act like people really would.Well allow me to try to explain it to all of you nay sayers.1) There are a lot of explanations for this. One could be that they would have inhabited the other third of the planet. That's like what, 400 square feet. The world's a small place right? Another explanation could be that they weren't aware of the fact they could be harmed by water. Sure it seems silly but tell me, how does one know when they are allergic to a certain medicine or when one doesn't like a certain type of food. You aren't born with the knowledge that you aren't going to like steak before you even try it.2) For those of you that don't understand the film I'm going to try my darndest to explain it to you. For those of you that did understand the movie but still had something bad to say about the look of the alien all I can say is that the Director is presuming not to know what aliens actually look like. Since none of us have actually seen them or know the extent of their existence he's not going to show us a tall lanky green alien with a huge head and big yellow eyes. That's also why all the scenes where we see the aliens the best is somewhat blurry. That was Spielberg's mistake with A.I. He used the same aliens from Close Encounters. Unless he has a few aliens living in his backyard I assure you he doesn't know what they look like if they do exist.3) I find this totally untrue and I'm going to cite certain examples from the movie to show you that. The scene at dinner where Mel Gibson breaks down and then the children come over and hug him. I've heard it said that no child of that age would do what was done after having just been yelled at. He would most likely go running into the other room. I have a 10 year old niece that is actually one of the smartest people I know. Smarter than a lot of the adults I know as well and would have handled the situation the same way. Just because someone is a child doesn't mean that they always act like a baby and start whining and crying. And vice versa. Just because someone is an "adult" doesn't mean they always act like an adult. The best scene of this movie is another example of this. When Mel Gibson crouches down to his sons height and proceeds to tell him of the day he was born. How awesome of a scene is that? If it hadn't hit yet, that scene should have been pretty clear that this wasn't a movie about an alien invasion but rather something else. And that is most likely what a real father that thought he and his family was going to die would do. They wouldn't have run.The Director is not an idiot and he is not going to treat the movie going public like they are idiots. That is why at the beginning of the movie there wasn't a disclamier saying that this movie is not really about aliens and that's why there aren't going to be very many aliens throughout the movie. He left it up to you to figure out what the movie was about. Obviously a lot of you had trouble doing so. If you wanted to see an ID4 type movie then go rent it. That may be the kind of movie that racks up all the millions but I guarantee you that the Director would rather his movie tanks while making it his way then it makes millions by being a cheesy alien film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel kind of bad for M. Night Shyamalan. The Sixth Sense, one of the best films of the 90's and one of the best plot twists of all time, ultimately sucked all the talent, potential and genius out of Shyamalan and left him as a stupid, egotistic moron who wouldn't know a plot if it was injected directly into his skull. And this is one of his worst films by far.The only reason I have not given this film a 1/10 is because at least Shyamalan films have half-decent cinematography and he obviously puts a lot of effort into making his films look good. That's where the praise finishes. ALL the actors did a horrible job. Even Gibson's performance is flat and boring. Phoenix does a stereotypical white American jock hero sort of act and fails to give off any emotion. The actors who play the kids are also terrible, they did nothing but irritate me and their acting was bland and talentless. And of course Shyamalan sticks his ugly mug in for several scenes and tries to stammer out fancy sounding lines in an obvious attempt to boost his ego.The worst parts of this train-wreck are the plot holes. Here we have aliens that can build spacecraft and travel billions of miles across the universe... and can't open a pantry door (and what does Mel do upon stumbling across this extra-terrestrial threat? Call the police? No, he goes home and acts like nothing happens, idiot). These aliens, to whom water is like a highly corrosive acid, choose to invade a planet that is mostly water, while naked, running around in air that's full of moisture, sprinting through cornfields that would be covered in water droplets in the morning, not taking into account things like rain, not bringing any tools, medical equipment, weapons or armor, and on top of all that, feeding on humans who are about 80% water. It's so STUPID it hurts. And their top secret communications? You can pick those up on a baby monitor. Please. Also, don't keep your son's life saving medication handy- he'll never need it.That's not the only problem. This film bills itself as a science fiction thriller, but it's a thinly disguised Christian "regaining-of-faith" flick. Mel looses his faith after his wife is killed by a rouge driver, then he regains it again after he realizes her death rattle was a warning from God to help him defeat the aliens. So what does Mel say? He basically says "Thanks God", when he should have been questioning why God made him loose faith and then gave it back to him, only while KILLING his wife in the process! Come on! What a waste of God's time, Mel's time, our time, and some innocent person died for no reason because Mel ended right back at point A! This entire film disgusts me and insults the intelligence of reasonable people everywhere. In the end, I was hoping some of the Hess family would die because they irritated me so much. I almost got my hopes up when that brat started having a respiratory attack but then my hopes were quickly crushed. In the end, the message is "God will make you loose your faith, kill your loved ones, and then give your faith back". Good job Shyamalan, your writing and directing talents (but not your acting talents- your cameos suck) never cease to amaze me. This man should be BANNED from making movies.2/10</fullReview>

Nothing about this devious anti-Semite would surprise me anymore.Interspersed in-between all the x-file-ish malarkey are idiotic "cute"- meant-to-be-funny comic-relief scenes like the astoundingly silly "3 to 2" vote, or Gibson vs. rest of family. That's straight out of a failed Saturday Night Live sketch.Speaking of his dull family, that son? A typical Hollywood-movie kid: a 225 I.Q. Yet where did he get that intelligence from? Mel the priest?? Perhaps Mom had a fling with a nuclear scientist while Mel was busy talking to God? There is nothing wrong with intelligent kids as such, but it does start to get very irritating when 9 out of 10 directors opt for the "ultra-bright brat" clich. This movie could really have used a dose of realism; by portraying a normal kid, i.e. one who doesn't act and talk like an adult, this would have been one small but wise step towards that. The kid dishes out advice like Oprah Winfrey on speed, and reveals a vocabulary larger than Mark Twain's, while he quotes Dr.Bimbu's idiotic book.Dr.Bimbu. With "Signs", MNS has stepped into the retarded realm of the many charlatans, liars, and other esoteric witch-doctors of this idiotic New Age. Everything "Penn &amp; Teller" would label as "100% B.S." MNS will eventually stick into his increasingly absurd movies, trying to sell it as science rather than sheer mindless fun. Thereby, MNS has willfully joined the dumbing-down, anti-science bandwagon. Whether that is due to stupidity or greed isn't even relevant. "Signs" is yet another in a plethora of high-profile contributions towards turning us all into morons. But must we all end up like Sean Penn? Screw Dr.Bimbu.Speaking of modern-day myths for gullible, miracle-hungry fools, why would any advanced and hostile alien civilization make those damn silly Crap Circles? "Greetings, Earthmen. We're trying to hide from you, hence avoid jeopardizing our plans for attack, but here are a few 200-meter- long clues we left lying around for you to muse over, just for the fun of it?" "The nerds were right", says ne'er-too-bright, bat-waving Phoenix. I suppose that MNS ? being a mega-nerd himself ? wanted nerds to be taken more seriously, especially when they drool over silly UFO theories. But he made a slight mistake, the confused man that he is: those are morons, not nerds.A news announcer tells us in all honesty: "What you are about to see may upset you." So what happens? What is this horrible Shyamalayian sight that might twist our stomachs into knots? A GREEN B-MOVIE ALIEN. Either that or an emaciated Sasqwatch. Ed Wood's influence has always been totally under-appreciated.The alien attack has just been repelled, yet all bunny-lipped Phoenix wants to do is talk to Mel about his "loss of faith". So Hollywood? Pathetic, soppy family drama with touches of "uplifting" religious re- awakening baloney, serving as a substitute for originality or interesting plot-twists. Spiffing.Was Phoenix's miraculous "girlfriend vomits during kissing" anecdote lifted from "South Park"? Anything else M. Night Sharlatan wants to admit to have stolen from other TV shows and other movies?..."Signs" is a poor man's "Independence Day": focus on just one family and one house (i.e. an inexpensive setting), and you don't have to spend tons of money on special effects. Save the little money you have (after having paid a fortune to Mel for a truly bad performance) on the one or two shoddy-looking green aliens. Even the two lethargic catatonics in "X-Files" would have been embarrassed to play opposite such dumb spielbergian outer-space twits.In a way I was saddened by the failed invasion attempt. A victory by the bug-eyes would have meant no more MNS movies, and not a single additional turd by Emir Kusturica or Spike Lee.H20 as a skin-melting acid? MNS re-writes some basic laws of chemistry, not just physics and interstellar space-travel.But if you thought this MNS movie was a turkey, just check out "The Happening"?So why are nearly all movie aliens NAKED? We LIVE on Earth and yet we need clothes, but outer-space mongrels with utterly different biological set-ups just come here and prance around in the nude as if they'd been here for aeons.Sharlatan kills his aliens with water, Spielberg (of "War of the Worlds" fame) executes them with the swine flu. It's only a matter of time until Robert Rodriguez comes up with aliens even dumber than these. How will Hollywood's next alien invasion abruptly end? Will they die from AIDS because they're all gay? Will they flee in terror after watching an episode of "Ally McBeal"? Or will humans discover telepathy and send those deadly Paris Hilton brainwaves into the alien invaders' collective heads?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Space Oddity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Caution: spoilers)In 'Signs" writer/producer/director M. Shyamalan attempts to merge Hitchcock and H.G. Wells into a spine-tingling story about a extraterrestrial invasion of earth, as experienced by a Pennsylvania farm family. The pre-release Hollywood hype about alien-carved 'crop circles' (as so well documented in supermarket tabloids) tries to make the film more relevant and spooky than previous 'monster space invaders' flicks. Despite all this hype and Mel Gibson's acting, this insipid film flops miserably. How did Gibson ever fall into this black hole of a screenplay? 'Signs' serves-up an embarrassingly numbskull science fiction yarn and pretty anemic horror. It's mostly a lot noises and shadows, and those pesky crop circles just sitting there, but little else. The film's fleeting glimpses of the 'jolly-green' alien fleeting around the farm like Bigfoot, is about as scary as a kid putting on a white sheet and yelling 'boo.'There have been so many space monster and horror creature films, Shyamalan can't help but copy elements from everything from 'Poltergeist' to 'The Thing.' But the story line just keeps heaping absurdities upon absurdities. For example, any real farmer would get his pitchfork and shotgun and go hunting for any aliens lurking around his farm and flattening his corn (as in the hilarious vignette in 'Back to the Future' when Michael J. Fox first makes a crash landing in 1955). Instead, Gibson and brother played by Joaquin Phoenix just whine about the end-of-the-world coming. They then board-up the house, just like in 'Night of The Living Dead.' In that cult classic film there are dozens of seemingly indestructible wicked zombies.But in 'Signs' all we finally get to see is ONE clumsy alien, who must have gotten sidetracked from the invasion force. He turns out to be the first movie character since the 1939 Wizard of Oz's wicked witch to be killed by water! Now, think about this. The alien invaders are smart enough to travel countless light-years across space but don't realize earth is the only 'water planet' in the solar system. Duuuh! What's more, any middle school student who has ever done a research paper on astrobiology will tell you: no water = no life, even if it has three eyes, three toes and is polka-dot. Artistic license aside, this idiotic premise sets back science literacy by 20 years.Shyamalan should go find his boyhood 8mm movie camera and go back to making student films until he gets in right. A copycat film that is as dumb and uninspired and this deserves an 'F'. It is such a drawn-out bore, even the gang on 'Mystery Science Theater 2000' would have trouble staying awake to mock it.</fullReview>

There is nothing in this movie that can be considered plausibly entertaining and sitting through it is torturous and demeaning. Were I in the legal field I would find a way to work a class action lawsuit against M. Night Shalamalamdingdong for the offense to humanity that he has created with this foul work.

		<shortDescription>i second "ultimately dumb"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no need for me to come up with my own clever review title, because someone else said it perfectly: "ultimately dumb."This movie had so much going for it that I was particularly ticked off that Shyamalan dropped the ball. I went into this movie with little respect for Shyamalan. (Unlike most people, apparently, I never liked The Sixth Sense: thought it was tedious.) By half way through the Signs, I was thinking maybe I'd underestimated him. The storytelling idea here is really good: an alien invasion from the lonely perspective of ordinary people, who have no idea what's going on. The mood is fascinating.But Shyamalan snatches defeat from the jaws of victory!It's often been said that stories, like planes, are easy to get of the ground and fly, but very difficult to land. Shyamalan crashes this story with what may be the dorkiest plot fumble in the history of otherwise-good SF stories: the critical alien weakness turns out to be a severe allergy to water.Oh, dear.Back in my youth, I was an aspiring SF writer. I submitted a whole bunch of stories to SF magazines. Nearly all were rejected without explanation. The few polite notes that did explain the rejections all slammed me for numerous basic storytelling misdemeanours. Those editors easily picked up on practically any shortcoming as the basis for a rejection.Shyamalan's dorky climax wouldn't have gotten past even the most forgiving of those editors. And yet he gets to make movies for millions.The world is weird.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Twilight Zone would have done this better without all the pretentiousness and for a lot less dollars...regardless of the plot holes (what movie doesn't have those?) - the real issue is the turgid nature of the film, designed presumably with some sort of artistic 'intent' but actually creating a flaccid, boring piece of celluloid with a soggy sentimental backstop of lost faith. However truly sincere the director was with the creation the end result lacks impact, pace, logic, plot or believability. What could have been an interesting film is instead lazily put together almost in a touching faith that it would be appreciated. One has to wonder if this would have ended up on the big screen at all if it had not been for the directors previous outings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was about the last one in the country to go to see "Signs" so I guess that's why the only other people in the audience kept talking through it. The first two-thirds is a cinematographically lovely homage, practically frame by frame and certainly scene by scene, to Hitchcock's "The Birds," in making the quotidian scary. Though instead of one hunk, we get two in Mel Gibson and Jacquin Phoenix, and no statuesque blonde.The last third steals mightily from every 1950's alien invasion sci fi movie, and some of those are classic favorites of mine. Maybe Shyamalan figures no one watches black and white movies anymore or maybe it's just more homage.Either way, I was bored.(originally written 9/29/2002)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Come on, everyone, get real</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[Yeah, there are spoilers. Many.]This film is far from the cinematic watershed many blindly proclaim. In fact, it's a mess, quite silly, and in so many ways derivative. Think "Night of the Living Dead," "Independence Day," and all the hints of coming mediocrity that Shyamalan gave us in his two previous films -- The Sixth Sense, which I thought was a great film, and Unbreakable, which began to hint at his talent for making the banal overly self-indulgent and pretentious. This film leads us further down that road.Sure it's well done. Cinematography effective. And in the beginning scenes you begin to think there's going to be a Sixth Sense treat in store. The little girl's a scene stealer. The early emotions alluring if predictable. But this film never delivers, and instead goes from silly to ridiculous. Come on, it really IS just an alien invasion flick, and laughably. I mean where do we come off fantasizing that an alien intelligence that is prima facie so far advanced over any technological level we can claim, has as its loftiest purposes, hiding in cornfields, signalling with crop circles, running around looking like George Pal's Morlocks on a strict diet. Hey guys, get in there and eat a few more humans! You can navigate through space but you need a symbol in a cornfield to tell you where to land, be, or whatever. When a human raises a bat in retaliation, blast that sucker out of existence with a hand phaser before he gets to strike two. And if a little moisture is going to spell your doom, don't choose a planet that's two-thirds water. And if you're going to spend years planning this invasion with surreptitious abductions, then just take those few specimens you need and breed the crap out of them in holding pens on your ships for soylent green.And if all that Mel Gibson needs to overcome the loss of his faith due to his wife's demise is the trivial epiphany "see ... then swing away," then we've really reached the nadir of human self-indulgence. And all we need to do to thwart the alien invasion is lock them in a closet, or spit at them? Dorothy did it better and more convincingly in Oz.You want "spiritual enlightenment and redemption" without having your brains batted out by it, see Contact, or go back and see 2001. But don't see this mess of a movie. Shyamalan needs to abandon the maudlin and macabre and make a comedy or two. This movie sure made me laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to give Shayalaman credit as a true artist. His movies are always beautiful to look at, and it is clear he has artistic vision. In the case of "The Sixth Sense" he made perhaps the finest movie of its type I've ever seen. His consequent outings, however, have been sporadic at best. "Unbreakable" just didn't do it for me; maybe that just comes from a personal feeling that the whole super-hero thing is idiotic. And I'm not the sharpest guy around, but I had the plot twist in "The Village" figured out in the first few minutes. And "Lady in the Water" is a contemptible waste of time, money and talent.Which brings us to "Signs". This movie does deliver some eerie moments. It shows how effective suggestion and quick glimpses can be in these days of scriptless CGI blockbusters. There are some fine moments here and there, and Mel Gibson who has since proved to certifiably insane or laughing all the way to the bank, or both, turns in a good mournful performance. Joaquin Phoenix is likable as usual. I couldn't dislike the movie based on its actors, but I did dislike it.After successfully building tension, the director squanders it with silliness. Tin-foil hats and aliens who look less frightening than the Sleestacks from "Land of the Lost". And you can kill them with water? Who's bright idea was it to invade a planet with four-fifths ocean surface if water can kill you? I think the human race is in pretty good shape if we're invaded by Shayalaman's E.T.s, who can apparently cross the gulfs of interstellar space, but can't force their way into a locked basement, or land without making giant obtrusive patterns in cornfields. And a well-placed urine stream will dispatch them! Not like the guys in Spielberg's superior "War of the Worlds" remake. Those guys did some serious killing. Shayalaman's alien invaders gawk through kitchen windows into camcorders and hide in kitchen cabinets and stick their appendages out under the doors. Hey Mister Spaceman? You ever heard of the knife? Maybe the director was trying to make some statement that through their very alien-ness, the invaders were unaware of things we who are more accustomed to this environment know intuitively, but I'm not buying it. The humanoid shape, like an iguana in underoos, their apparent lack of any sort of battle plan, and their general ineptness do a lot to undercut their menace. I managed not to laugh out loud, but it took some effort. Lets hope this talented director turns out some better fare. He's certainly capable of it. But then so was Ed Wood.</fullReview>

Signs unfortunately has no replay value, in fact it has no play value at all. The film is hardly scary at all. The supposedly frightening moments may be scary to a 4 year old, but anyone of age that finds anything in this movie scary is out of their mind. One of the worst things about this film is the horrible cast. Mel Gibson does a good job, but Joaquin Phoenix doesn't fit his role well, Macaulay Culkin's kid brother is an annoying brainiac pest, and the little girl in the movie isn't cute at all - she's way too "forced" to act cute. The story line is garbage, and the whole "twist" at the end of the movie is pointless. Don't watch this film if you want to save your money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Signs is hands down the worst movie I have ever paid money to see at a cinema. Basically it's the story of a minister who has lost his faith but manages to regain it with the arrival of some aliens.This isn't a terrible plot but the way it's presented is beyond parody. There are a few tense moments early on but then the aliens start landing, though this would be expensive to show you so instead you get to see five light bulbs against a black backdrop, in much the same way that bad sci-fi has always represented alien invasions when a bit strapped for cash. When they start running around the ministers roof like a pack of squirrels and show they are unable to open doors I was just stunned. It's only the first of a long line of really badly judged bits that just keep the comedy flowing.What really stinks this awful movie up is the nonsensical ending. It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever and by the time the film had been rolling for an hour most of the audience had departed. Those that stayed mostly did so to jeer the movie and laugh at it's mawkish script and pathetic attempt to make the whole thing seem grand and meaningful.I don't think I've ever seen a movie that has so insulted my intelligence. My tiny local cinema only seats 250 people and was forced to stop showing it because in the words of the cinema manager "too many people were walking out and demanding a refund and the audience waiting to see it were put off by the laughter of people already viewing it."I laughed too until I heard Shoddyhands had announced he was the new Hitchcock on the basis of this movie, and then I found out that some viewers actually agree with him and think this is a profound and clever film!

The aliens are supposed to be technologically superior to us but still they try to capture humans with their bare hands. Where is the logic in that, there would have been tons of way to get the humans dead or alive.Also the motivations of the aliens are left really vague, which is clearly wanted but still it leave this kind of moral that nothing can harm us because god watch us. The aliens are merely the impersonal enemies that are there because they are evil and we the good one are going to defend ourselves because we are the good ones.The major plot problem in this movie is that nothing explain why the alien left, or at least nothing gave clear answers to this event. It is evident that water was the weak point of the aliens, but there is inconsistency in this. First inconsistence: the atmosphere is composed of a part of water. Second inconsistence: humans are composed of over 70% water so as most living creatures and plants. Third inconsistence: The planet is composed of 2/3 water, why would a supposed superior race show up on a planet mostly composed of water, to capture creatures that are composed of water and all that without protective suits.The movie in a global view isn't bad as long as you don't seek a logical sense in all that.</fullReview>

The story was dragging along in an awfully slow pace.2. There was not actually much happening in the movie.3. There was a lot going on that didn't really give this movie any more substance4. The constant talk about "There is no coincidence" started to really get irritating, and the sentences "Swing away" and "His lungs were closed" really drove this to the edge of utter irritation. Because if that was to be the movies main point, then it was a really boring one!5. Whenever there was action to be expected you saw it from an angle from which you actually saw the least! In the cellar you saw 20 seconds of "flashlight on dirty ground" whilst the guys struggled to free the boy, -22345 points for that. Mostly in the fighting scene in the living room, you saw the bat, not the beaten one, -362344 points for that.6. In general did this movie have about the worst shots I've ever seen! I think the film makers didn't wanna waste time on cutting up scenes into smaller 2 second bits like it usually would be done in many places, so when Mel Gibson talked to the woman who was playing his wife, you end up seeing him first for about 10 seconds and THEN FINALLY when you think you're never going to see her face, the camera switches angles and shows her face too. There were very many shots like that where not only the camera angles were extremely irritating but also what was filmed did not always seem to be the best choice. Whoever made the screenplay for this movie or decided what to shoot should really go back to film school! I could really and honestly have done that better myself!7. Did you too notice that it seems as if we viewers were supposed to see as little of the aliens as possible? The first one is locked in a room and all you see is his fingers. The next bunch is again not in the same room as the camera and the rest of the people and when finally that single alien was in the middle of the room, the room had somehow become very dark - at least where the alien was standing - eventho it had actually been quite bright a minute before when the boy was on the couch next to where the alien now stood. It really seemed to me as if we were only to know that there were aliens, but we were not supposed to see them! CHEAP!8. I found the story one of the most boring they could have made out of that topic. I would have rather seen this movie take some kind of direction a bit like "Contact" did. Maybe that Gibson was a scientist investigating crop circles who had started to kind of figure out some meaning and then maybe would have made one of his own that made sense to the aliens and that way gotten in contact with them... or anything else, but not a priest who doesn't wanna be a priest who has children which run around with aluminium foil hats all day and a brother who cant play baseball and a wife who died and said some delirious things when she passed away... TIRESOME AND DISAPPOINTING!9. Of course this wasn't really illogical, but common... people in the Middle East being the ones to discover that the aliens don't like water? I mean... is that the first thing people in the Middle East would do? Spray water on aliens? As I said, it's not unlikely and I know that there too is water in the Middle East, but I would have found it a bit more likely for somebody else to come up with that, maybe people from South America or anything like that. Well well... this was just another of those more odd things that don't make you wanna watch this movie again.Move along folks! Nothing to see here!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Movie of the Year, and one of the biggest Clunkers of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I normally don't post reviews of movies I hate, but when so many people seemed to have loved this film and fallen victim to Shyamalan's shyster film making tactics, I feel I need to voice my opinion.Yes, I understand that this was in actuality a film about faith and family. I also understand that the "crop circle/alien" aspect of the film was simply a tool to simultaneously get people in the seats and test the faith of the story's characters. But does that mean that all of the gaping plot holes involving the aliens (which I will not list here because so many other posts already have pointed them out) should be forgiven? Of course not. Regardless of the director's motives regarding the aliens, this is still bad movie making. There are also many plot holes involving the family (which have also been listed ad nauseum). Plot holes aside, it's still just a flat out lousy movie. Shyamalan takes himself and his stories way too seriously. He thinks way too highly of himself. He wants to be the greatest director of this generation, a hybrid master somewhere between Spielbergian sentimentality and Hitchcockian thrills. He also seems to be repeating himself already with his past three films in trying to perfect a new genre--the tear-jerk thriller. I think Shyamalan is capable of making good movies. "The Sixth Sense" was a decent, well crafted, well acted film, although not nearly as great as many propose. He can also make interesting films. "Unbreakable" was probably the only film where I was totally enthralled by the first hour or so, and then flat out hated the film by the last half hour. "Signs" could have been a decent B-movie (even if it was still about faith and family) but Shyamalan approached the material far too reverently, as did all the actors. Just because a movie is about faith doesn't mean it is good, or even well intentioned. Again, with his supposed twist of an ending (and what a wretched ending this movie had), Shyamalan seems to think every movie has to have a twist (and a moral). "Sixth Sense" had a good and appropriate twist. "Unbreakable" had an appalling and ridiculous twist (ewww...it was actually a comic book movie BOOO HISSSSSSS) and "Signs" has a completely inept and unnecessary twist, that really isn't a twist at all. In fact, this really wasn't a movie at all. This movie was neither scary nor touching, nor well made nor well intentioned. There isn't a rating low enough to indicate how much I hated this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Movie of 2002</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was so boring and had so many holes in the plot it was painful to watch. The aliens spent decades scouting and never realize that 75% of the planet is poison to them. If they had realized this, why did they not protect themselves from water? Not even a rain coat? Don't they know it rains on this planet? What if they attack someone who just got out of the shower? Or trip and fall into a swimming pool at night? And yet they run through fields of corn at night, somehow avoiding the dew. Have you ever been in a field at night? Obviously M. Night hasn't. Otherwise the aliens would have ran screaming back to their spaceships, looking for their first aid kits.And after they showed Gibson's wife dying, some guy in the audience said "I bet his brother hits a home run on an aliens head!". That was just too obvious, and yet this was supposed to be part of what gave Gibson his faith back.(And yes, we were at the very first screening of the film in our city)I know the aliens were just a plot device to enable Gibson to regain his faith, but M. Night just got lazy on this story. That or he's just out of ideas. I thought "Sixth Sense" was pretty good in spite of some plot holes. "Unbreakable" was good but too long. Maybe he should try to do a movie without a gimmick ending.</fullReview>

Some of the suspense segments when isolated are very effective, but the movie as a whole, is a total stinko. How could Mel Gibson even let this happen? He's usually so on the money. But every scene, including his, that's played for drama, bombs like Hezbollah. Cool premise, we all like these alien invader doomsday pieces, but this film needed an awful lot of work.

		<fullReview>SIGNS(2002)(4/5 stars)Rarely does a film come along that is truly great by all means, even if flawed. M. Night Shyamalan's new Summer hit SIGNS is just that.Mel Gibson turns in a wonderful performance as Graham Hess, an ex- priest (of what domination we never firmly grasp) who loses his faith after his wife dies. Now he lives with his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) on a farm in Philadelphia with his two children, Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin). After finding crop circles in his cornfields, weird things start to happen all leading up to one of the best and most under rated cinematic conclusions I've seen in years.The acting in Signs itself makes it worthy of critical acclaim. Mel Gibson presents his best performance we've seen in years, and Joaquin Phoenix (who got an Oscar Nom for the 1999 film Gladiator) is superb as a humorous, but responsible brother to Graham. Rory Culkin - the brother of Home Alone star Macaulay Culkin - acts better than his brother ever did, especially considering the emotional scenes. Abigail Breslin lights up the screen, one scene in particular with Gibson when she asks why her father talks to her mother sometimes. Another great performance by all the actors is in one scene at dinner, in which they all have a bit of a feud. It's terrific acting at it's best.M. Night Shymalan, who directed, wrote, produced, and acted in this film is one of the best directors to emerge into the film industry in years. What separates Shymalan from the rest is that his approach at filmmaking is genuine and very original. He truly loves his job, and we can tell he obviously enjoys doing what he does for a living. You see, Signs isn't about aliens attacking Earth, what crop circles come from or their purpose, etc. or anything you'd think. Signs is about an ordinary man, who loses his faith, and then finds it again. That is what this film is about. We aren't presented with a horror film about aliens attacking, or any real action sequences involving this subject. We are presented with a man and his family, and what they would do. We don't want to see E.T, nor INDEPENDECE DAY, or such horror / sci-fi / action films like ALIEN and PREDATOR. Though most of those films are great, we've seen it before, and that's what makes Signs different from other alien films, and what makes us interested in it. SIGNS ISN'T REALLY ABOUT ALIENS. It's how a man finds his faith again IN THIS situation. Shymalan just took a subject he found interesting, popped in a family in the middle, and continued his brilliant message on screen. I must agree with the critics and audiences around the globe, Shymalan is the next Hitchcock. He presents us scenes in which he drags out the invisible slowly, then unleashes the full picture (like the beginning field sequence, in which we are slowly presented the crop circles). Another aspect of this film, is proving Night has a knack for acting. In one scene, he delivers an emotional scene to Gibson. Shymalan and Gibson must work again together soon. I hope Night at least gets an Oscar nom for best director, Gibson for best actor, and Phoenix for supporting actor. THIS they all deserve an award for. It's a truly great film.Night also has a knack for making something normal and mundane very horrifying and scary. The soundtrack by James Newton Howard is amazingly eery. Much like the classic Hitchcock films, the soundtrack changes the mood of the audience member in their seat. It can spellbind them, amaze them, scare them, haunt them, or make them feel depressed. In SIGNS case, most of the film is filled with haunting and eery music, and uses this ancient film technique to it's advantage.The aliens, though some criticize of being very unrealistic, are presented perfectly, not showing them fully on screen, until when you least expect (some say naked aliens just look dumb, but hey, what about E.T?). One interesting part of the film, is in which a baby monitor accidentally picks up aliens speaking in `clicks,' which is how we suspect they communicate between each other. It provides a nice aspect of communication through the film not only with humans, but that these creatures are real and they do communicate, much like us.I will tell you, Signs does have some flaws that are spotted easily, and we wonder how a director like Night could have let these through into the film. One would wonder why Gibson's character doesn't arm himself with more of a weapon than a knife, but that is a forgivable flaw. I won't point out any more of the flaws I spotted, because it might ruin the film for you in case you don't spot them. Just let this be a warning, there are flaws. Just put them aside if and when you spot them and have fun.Unlike a lot of movies, Signs also has an excellent ending. When the credits start rolling, the message comes clear across, and you realize Shymalan delivered what he wanted to be delivered. Though it may disappoint some ?6th Sense' fans because it uses a different technique overall, I enjoyed SIGNS better. All in all Signs does have some flaws, but if you put them aside you can find yourself having a very enjoyable experience at the movies. I did at least. The storytelling is superb, the setting and musical score is haunting, the acting is one of a kind, and the overall effect it accomplished on me and other audience members, proves that great sci-fi/horror/drama films can still be made right. I give SIGNS 4/5 stars-enjoy the film, don't criticize it's flaws.&gt;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not your typical sci-fi thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you went to this movie expecting a typical sci-fi thriller, you doubtless left disappointed. If you went to this movie to see an M. Shamalayan Night film, you probably loved it, as I did.For me, the sci-fi aspects were a device to explore the lost faith of the Mel Gibson character, a man who had abandoned the ministry after a tragedy struck his family. The film asks the questions, are we alone in the world (and he's not talking about aliens) and is there such a thing as a coincidence? In one particularly striking scene, as he talks with his brother, Gibson's bitterness comes through.I happen to think there's a place for spirituality in film and I love Night's take on it. I also like his old-fashioned type of film-making, the way he pays hommage to the greats and the way he surprises us. Night believes we don't listen enough, and if we do, there are messages abounding for us. I'd rather see this than a pretentious, dark, depressing film that pretends to say something.</fullReview>

Incredibly, the aliens choose Earth -a water planet to colonize/subdue, but the aliens are unable to deal with water, which is apparently toxic to them! Whoops! Big strategic planning error for the aliens. Yeah, right! The mood evoked by Shyamalan was spooky and oppressive, so I give him credit for that, but the plot problems really interfered with my enjoyment of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Signs" is a movie that divided people even more than great and underrated "Unbreakable". It isn't a "War of the worlds " or "Independence day" type of movie . It isn't really about alien invasion. It's about faith and losing it . The aliens are only catalyst for that theme. It's a movie about human condition.The idea of making a serious movie about faith based on aliens and crop circle in plantation is very risky . I think that while not everything worked in the end , Shyamalan actually comes victorious . "Signs" does fall apart in the end . The logical questions about aliens that audience have aren't answered and the final twist is rather laughable. Still as a drama it succeeds. Shyamalan leads his heroes masterfully. We really care about them and can imagine ourselves in their situation. Shyamalan never fails to create suspense too. There is a great tension here and some of the scenes are really scary . Why ? Because Shyamalan wonderfully plays with viewers imagination and he knows that what you don't see is what scares the most.James Newton Howard's score is great , while Tak Fujimoto's photography is sublime. Good performances from Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix.I'm hoping that Shyamalan will be able to make once again a good movie. It would be shame for such good director to end his career too soon. I'm still waiting and hoping for his comeback. I give it 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterful Low Key Horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting, I'd always liked this movie a lot, but watching it again after a 3 year layoff I finally see just how extraordinarily well done this is. I've watched a helluva lot of horror movies in the past 3 years, and watching this again I really see how it's on a completely different level from the vast majority of them. When it comes to creating a slow rise in tension and simply inserting the supernatural into the apparently real world 'Signs' has few peers. This relates to a small flaw, perhaps: Once we get to the climax, once we've seen all there is to see, the reality proves a little too mundane. But, the strength of the journey itself more than makes up for this slight anticlimax. This is definitely one of the very best horror movies of the new millennium.I've heard some complain that the film lacks sight of the big picture due to its exclusive emphasis on the central family but I think that's what really makes it work, what really makes it real. After all, who cares about the big picture? We don't experience the world as a city or nation, we do it as individuals. That and it just allows us to really get to know the characters, and for Shyamalan to create full, real characters rather than just having a pack of clichs in various cities spread out across the nation. (Like you'd see in something like 'Deep Impact', for example.) Phoenix and Gibson are both absolutely great in this film, particularly Phoenix. Gibson's Graham is a little to cold and distant for us to relate to him initially, so we really connect with Phoenix's Merrill first, though I definitely came around to liking Graham as the movie went on. They're both utterly naturalistic, and manage a real severe intensity in the most emotional scenes while still avoiding any histrionics. The two children, Culkin and Breslin, are fine. I'm always leery of children having prominent roles in movies, but Shyamalan largely avoids sentimentalizing them excessively (Morgan is kind of a whiny dork) or earning cheap audience identification. (In the scenes where the kids are in the greatest peril I identified far more with Graham then with the children themselves.) Certainly, this won't be to everyone's taste as it is extremely low key up until the very end. And I don't mean this simply in the sense that it isn't violent or gory; that's true of a lot of modern horror films. The film simply refuses to show you much of anything through out the vast majority of the run time. There's a lot of noise related horror, obviously, and it goes light on the jump scares. (More amazingly, some of these scare tactics were actually surprising. Even after having seen it a couple of time before a few years back a couple of these were slightly surprising.) The film uses a particularly classic setting, the old siege on the farmhouse a la 'Night of the Living Dead'. Again, the primary siege is just so impressive because it manages real intensity despite the fact that they show you virtually nothing. The true climax is less effective, but it's still fine and is necessary from a thematic standpoint. Many people have complained about the 'twist' in this film. I've got some news for you: This movie doesn't have a twist. Morons.In the end, however, it may be the human element that really makes this movie standout. It's just a very tragic portrait of a family that has largely fallen apart. I'll admit it, it probably goes a little to far a couple of times, but it also manages a few genuinely moving scenes, which more than compensates. (Particularly note the great scene of Graham and Merrill discussing fate late one night, and Merrill's confronting Graham after the invasion night and so on.) As I always say, I don't really insist that my movies have realistic or likable characters, but the very best ones usually do. And 'Signs' has got that. Furthermore, Shyamalan's dialogue is generally leaps and bounds beyond what you usually see in a horror film, and it's also really quite funny much of the time.I've heard a lot of morons complain that the aliens here don't behave in a realistic fashion. I had a long-winded rant worked out in my mind, but these people aren't gonna be convinced by that, or anything, as a matter of fact, so I'll just keep it simple: It's absurd to claim that the aliens in this behave in an unrealistic fashion because we, the viewer, don't know anything about them. There are an infinite number of potential explanations for why they act as they do, and 0 reasons to believe they would behave any other way. Any supposed logic you may have come up with relating to the aliens is irrelevant, because they are wholly of and within the movie. And perhaps more to the point, this comes with the territory. Complaining about the aliens in this film is like complaining about how hardly anybody has any guns in a contemporary martial-arts film.Yes this is a great film. Definitely Shyamalan's best in my mind, as of this moment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot Summary: A family living on a farm discovers crop circles in their field and feels that it is a frightening sign of what might be coming.If you did not see this thriller in theaters, you should check it out on DVD or VHS. Mel Gibson stars as Gram Hess, a man of the cloth who abandons his ministry in rural Pennsylvania following the tragic death of his wife. Gibson's family discovers crop circles that may be the first signs of an invasion by aliens. This is one chilling supernatural thriller, one that is worth seeing again.The theme or central insight of the movie is that people can triumph over adversities. Gibson's faith is tested after a horrible tragedy and he searches for the meaning of the signs or crop circles. The movie is directed and written by M. Night Shyamalan who also was the writer/director of `The Sixth Sense' and `Unbreakable.' `Signs' has more suspense than M. Night Shyamalan's previous movie `The Sixth Sense.' This is M. Night Shyamalan's best movie yet.Joaquin Phoenix plays Gibson's brother, Merrill Hess who is a former minor league baseball player. Roy Culkin plays Gibson's son, Morgan and Abigail Breslin plays Bo, Gibson's daughter. Ray Reddy is played by M. Night Shyamalan, the writer/director. Patricia Kalember plays Gibson's wife, Colleen Hess. M. Night Shyamalan's use of low key lighting adds to the mystery of what is out there in the dark in the field, is it aliens or is it something or someone else. This lighting adds to the suspense of the film and the fear of the unknown.To sum it up: `Signs' will keep you in stitches with suspense. It also has some funny moments as well. `Signs' is one of my favorite movies that I've seen in awhile. Gibson's character faces his adversaries as he finds the meaning of the signs. If you haven't seen this movie, go out and rent it. If you've already seen it, watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this when it first came out at the cinema and was struck by how inteligent a film it was. I saw it again tonight on a pay-per-view channel, and I see it more clearly now. This film goes straight into my personal favourite top three films of all-time.Basically it's about a family trying to come to terms with grief. They have lost their mother, and Mel Gibsons charactor has lost a wife he obviously loved deeply.Whilst they are trying to get back to some sort of normality, they discover a huge crop circle in their backyard. Strange occurrances happen, and it turns out to be an alien invasion!What makes this film unique is that the action revovles around this one family and how things effect them. Will the father figure be able to snap himself out of his grief to be able to look after his family, or will the aliens win?All the charactors are fully fleshed out. We learn in flashbacks how the wife and mother died, and everyhting is observed in an inteligent manner. There aren't too many films about that say, "stuff it" let the audience work it out for themselves, they are clever enough! This film is a genuine golden nugget of a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie excels at a somewhat lost movie art: suspense. The director and story teller does a good and unique job of engaging the viewer so we're on the edge of our sets wondering what is going to happen next and what is around the next corner and in the director's usual style, there's a hidden story secret that's revealed at the climax. This is not just a story about scary things that frighten us, but a story about people and their relationships and beliefs. I'm not religious, but found the lead characters conflict compelling.Also, I saw "Unbreakable" (same writer/director) and didn't think that movie was engaging as compared to this one. And I thought this was a little better than that "I see dead people" movie (completely forgot name!) perhaps because I'm not sure that Bruce Willis is the best choice for this sort of role.However, I'm definitely glad to have this writer/director out there creating movies (won't attempt to butcher the spelling of his name from memory) and I think he's one of the top movie-makers these days.Don't forget to see his home-videos on the DVD version(s)--- it's a reminder that it takes a lot of work and commitment to achieve what he has, but that it all starts with a desire/vision/dream.</fullReview>

Even the religion/faith theme is weak and unconvincing; basically Hess lost his faith when his wife died in a freak accident and regained it when his son lived due to a freakish sequence. All the atmospheric, flowery shots by the director cannot hide the turns of events are forced and simplistic. A much more powerful way would be he regains this faith YET his son DIED; something obviously the director/writer had no stomach for it as he went for the Hollywood style redemption.The biggest disappointment is the alien. *****Spoiler Ahead*****These aliens were supposed to be smart, fast and with technology light-years ahead of us. Instead, we were asked to believe some plastic-skin zombie possessing little intelligence, little athletic ability, nothing but primitive poison gas as weapon, not to mention problems with water and wood, to be THE MENACE. The whole "Merrill swing away" sequence is simply ridiculous and outrageous -- an insult to everyone's intelligence. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's strange; the story's different, but it feels the same as "6th Sense / Unbreakable"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Be aware. This summary will outline plots from other films by director M Night Shyamalan.I was one of the myriad of movie fans who were intrigued with M Night Shyamalan's "The Sixth Sense" (Hollywood Pictures, 1999) and figured that the movie's success was well deserved and was in line to buy the DVD when it debuted.Then came "Unbreakable" (Touchstone Pictures, 2000). I never saw the film in theatres because I got the gist from the promotional onslaught before the movie opened. To my surprise, the movie featured a story that was oddly similar to "Sixth Sense." There's a character who has a unique special ability and learns to develop and use the gift to help others. I rented the movie and was thoroughly disappointed at the blatant re-packaging that Shyamalan had pulled off; convincing his new fans to spend more money to watch basically the same movie-and lead actor-again.And now there's "Signs." I was again overwhelmed by the media blitz that Touchstone launched many weeks before this film opened. I saw enough in the trailers to get the point of the film. And it again was very similar to the other super-paranormal films Shyamalan's has made. Crop circles begin appearing, and people have to figure out why it's happening. I watched the airline version a couple weeks ago and from here on have vowed to never watch any future Shyamalan films. I was sickened that I spent $5.00 to watch it on the airplane!M Night Shyamalan had a unique perception of the supernatural in his "The Sixth Sense." But he beat his concept dead with "Unbreakable" and made it all the worse with "Signs."It's amazing the kind of movie that people will pay money to sit down and watch. I suppose, however, that I may be a more discerning patron that will never watch movies from directors like Shyamalan, Cameron Crowe or Curtis Hanson (at least, from now on after Crowe made "Vanilla Sky" and Hanson helmed "8 Mile").I still have my copy of "Sixth Sense." But rest assured that I'll never add "Signs" to my Paper-Weights (titles I own but can never finish in one sitting). I'll save that bin for "Sixth Sense."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everyone missed the point (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people have rightly commented about how this film is not really about crop circles or alien invasions, but a lot of people seem to hold the misconception that it is about a man's crisis of faith and return to his god. This movie's theme, subtle though it is, is one of xenophobia and paranoia. We see the crop circles, we see the aliens, we see the Father's fear and anger, we see the family protecting themselves, we conveniently don't see how the aliens are defeated, but we see a return to faith and good times. What this movie tells us is "they are coming, they will come in to your homes, in to your private lives, they will attack your children, they will threaten your liberty, and what you need to do to protect yourselves is board up your homes, don't let anyone in, bury your heads in the sand, it'll all be dealt with, don't worry about the details, just keep your faith in god, have some flinstones chewable morphine and watch MTV, all your troubles will go away." It's a disturbing piece of revoltingly patriotic propaganda, up America and don't trust anyone else. This aside, it was a rather weak film that pulled every punch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After all the promos, what a disappointment!. Mel's family are as fake as they come, the attempts at humour fall flat, there is no tension or horror. How is it that aliens are so smart to conquer interplanetary travel but are so dumb that they draw patterns to alert their arrival, fail to understand they have a simple aversion to water and conduct their "harvest" in small towns with few people? It is scary that this movie is in the top 250 list. Abigail Breslin was a delight but please Mr. Cinema Owner, give me back my $10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a number of problems with this film. It is cheap, chose the wrong actors for the roles, and ultimately fails to deliver anything remotely scary or suspenseful.The storyline borrows heavily from other 'invasion' movies without adding anything new, it plods along hinting that something scary may happen when ultimately nothing does. Essentially this is about 4 people in a house running from strange noises.The final scene is actually very funny. You finally see an alien (this showdown having been predictably set up during earlier scenes) and the way that this alien is dealt with is laugh out loud funny, although I am sure this was not the intention of the movie makers.Both myself, and all the people who watched this film with me thought it was a major turkey, the only thing that stopped us leaving before it finished was my insistance that 'something good is about to happen', and didn't I look stupid after that.If you enjoyed Blair Witch then you will enjoy this, and I truly feel pity for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, what are we looking for here?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From a scientific viewpoint the film makes no sense. The character development is where the effort seemed to focus in this film.The acting of Mel Gibson was a good attempt along with the cast but they really can't lift this film from just plain poor writing.First, these aliens are allergic to water and should steer clear of it. They manage to get through the Kuiper belt just outside of our solar system without hitting any water out there. Yet, there's enough water there to drown the earth fifty times over with all those comets coming and going.Then, of all places, they choose to land on a planet with 75% water all over it.Worst of all, they decide to feed on people, who contain a higherpercentage of water than the earth....Well, at least I liked the company I brought to the show and the restaurant we ate at afterward has great food! Give it a zero.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm very surprised at the high level of positive feedback this M. Night film is receiving! I would say, without a doubt that I was impressed with M. Night's first two films. Signs however, in comparison, is a mainly visual thriller/SCI-fi movie that is very static, poorly paced, lacks originality (for anybody who has read, or seen War of the Worlds) and has dialogue not unlike an Ed Wood film! (Plan 9 From Outer Space comes to mind as I sit and listen to Mel Gibson give a horribly scripted, almost juvenile speech regarding people's lack of faith.)Now, I know that I'm in the minority, and most people have RAVED about this film. I suppose it's only in comparison to his previous work that I feel that this one is SO disappointing. The sense of "restraint" he showed as a director in "The Sixth Sense" and the original, thought-provoking concepts in both "Sixth Sense" and "Unbreakable" are nowhere to be found in "Signs"...(well, original, for those who didn't mind Sixth Sense's similarity to "Carnival of Souls"). without giving away any of the plot devices: what you THINK is going to happen in "Signs" HAPPENS, and it doesn't even happen in an original or interesting way.I'd recommend spending your time elsewhere, and avoiding this one until it's on cable, however, much like "Unbreakable" people are going to see this one simply because M. Night wowed them with his previous work. This time around people might feel cheated, in terms of "WOW" factor, especially in the "I totally didn't see that one coming!" department.A disappointing film to say the least.-Frank</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the other night i thought i was getting the privilege to see the movie "Signs." i went into the theater all psyched up and ready for a non-stop suspense thriller. the first 20 minutes of the movie were ok....but even 20 minutes into it it felt as if the movie was already dragging along at a slow pace. this, right off the bat pissed me off.*WARNING THIS PARAGRAPH CONTAINS SPOILERS* what really p***es me off about to stupid movie is the lack of depth to things that are going on in the movie. for example...at the end of the movie when the aliens invade all you hear is that the aliens invaded and the humans found a primitive way to stop them, and there gone now. BOOM thats it....NOTHING ELSE....thats a load of crap. and how come the alien doesnt attack jaquin phoenix...i saw some other person say because his only defense was the poison...yea...right buddy...it didnt seem like the aliens only defense was the poison when it went after mel gibson underneath the cracks of the door. that was lame. the only thing that saved this movie from me crapping on it was the acting of jaquin phoenix. He did really well in this film...but even he couldnt save this peice of trash from being a horrible movie...sorry "sign" fans...dont waste money on this pile of garbage..id rather watch Spy Kids 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admired Mr. Shyamalan's view into the life of a Superhero in Unbreakable, and everyone liked the Sixth Sense, so I figured Signs would just add to the great track record that he had. Well, I was, to say the least, mildly dissapointed. From the opening credits that reminded me of a high school powerpoint presentation, this "Sci-Fi Thriller" had its work cut for.Mel Gibson seemed to have his abilities of an actor caged up, which in turn made him simply a name to slap onto the picture. Joaquin Phoenix proved to be the highlight of the picture by adding much needed humor to the story. The two kids were pretty stereotypical for the whole cornfield horror genre.THE FOLLOWING COMPLAINTS INVOLVE SPOILERS. YOU'VE BEEN WARNEDSorry for the following rants, but it's the only way I can put them out. First off, the Appearance of Night is a standard in his movies, but his most recent character just doesn't fit into this world. When the Alien is revealed, the broad daylight turns the scene from a creepy first look into a Scooby Doo-like laugh fest. There was not enough outside views of the Alien invasion. The final face off was all out ridiculous. A Hostile Alien would not dance around for two hours threatening to harm a person, it would just go for it. Why in all places in the world does the Middle East figure to use Water to fight off the Aliens? Why Not Seattle or an area with Rainforests? Why do the kids in these movies have to act like all of the life has been taken away by heavy sedatives? Why poisons from a wrist artery? Why not goo? Well, I guess the gas is alright.-----------------------------------------------------------------------All in all, I was expecting too much. I was hoping for a solid story with A good scare or two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*********Some mild plot point spoilers. I don't recommend reading this until you've seen the film. i.e., go see the film.************It's possible that, in long retrospect, "Signs" will appear to my memory to be a simplistic, one-trick B-movie thriller with a generous sapling-layer of faith arguments thrown in for good measure. If I feel that way I won't be alone.But I don't feel that way right now.Right now I'm looking over my shoulder. Right now I'm pondering how M. Night Shyamalan could maintain as direct a focus on the details of this film as he does. Right now I'm still reeling from the realness of the situation into which the film's characters are thrust.Right now I'm writing this review so that I can rejoin the real world in some way, and detach myself from the one I was so thoroughly woven into a few hours ago. So I can sleep well, mostly.Shyamalan is possibly the most brutally efficient director I have ever seen at work. Only Hitchcock kept a focus nearly this narrow, and it's sure that "poor man's Hitchcock" is a phrase that will dog Shyamalan for the rest of his days. Others have compared him to Kubrick for the drawn-out scenes filled only with the immediate focus or sometimes with nothing at all, leaving the viewer to fill in the gaps. But in nearly all Kubrick films I find myself urging the next scene to begin; with this film I found myself wondering what new thrill or revelation would walk into the scene. Not a second is wasted. And yes, there are the trappings of early Spielberg, the "less is more" of Jaws, where we're slowly introduced to our assailant one terrifying limb at a time.And as we work our way into the nature of the beast, we are also astonished with the strangeness of the main characters, each of which it seems have been cast with a specific thrill in mind. Both Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix have creeped us out in one way or another in previous films, and the child actors, far from being boilerplate screamers, are as different as night and day, Rory Culkin appearing helpless and insightful while Abigail Breslin is naive yet resolute as the unflappable Bo.Shyamalan's only misstep is casting himself in a substantial role in this film, where he seems a young child who has created a spectacular fantasy world and finds himself unable to play-act in it with nearly the skill that its complexity and intensity require.And even his deadpan performance serves to dish up yet another of the ample thrills in the film. While I was somewhat disappointed with the ending, that disappointment was the same I feel as I pull into the station of my favorite roller-coaster ride - sadness that there couldn't have been one more blinding bit of firework, but soberly aware that I probably couldn't have handled anymore.Give this film a spin and see if you can handle it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reading the negative comments on this movie confirm what I'd long believed: most people need to be spoon-fed their entertainment. It has to be black-and-white, spelled out right in front of them, or they just don't get it."Signs" is not a movie that spells it out for you. You have to use that most neglected of all human organs: The brain.But if you do divert a little energy to your gray matter, you are in for a fantastic emotional journey that's as engrossing and masterful as they come. Shyamalan deserves to be mentioned in the same sentences as Spielberg, Hitchcock, and Kubrick.I was enchanted, I was challenged, I was enlightened. I literally laughed, cried, and nearly wet my pants with fear.If you're looking for Independence Day, the X-Files, or War of the Worlds, (which many people clearly are) look somewhere else. This is not that type of film! But it *is* the most engaging, thoughtful, and purely frightening alien-genre movie since Close Encounters of the Third Kind.5 out of 5. 10 out of 10. Go see it. Bring your brain, and pay attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Granted the mixed reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect from this film--but upon seeing it, I will say that every negative review was blown out of the water.However, I am of the opinion that the simultaneous gasps (and one scream, might I add) coming from around the theatre was worth the price of admission in and of itself.With a suspenseful score appropriate for any thriller, I was hooked by the time the opening credits were finished--and it didn't end there. I was given no time whatsoever between the fade of the last words and the first striking image before the horror began.I was extremely impressed with all of the performances, but particularly with the emotional range of Rory Culkin (Morgan) and Abagail Breslin (Bo), and also by the comic timing of Joaquin Phoenix (Merrill)--something new for him, as he rarely gets a chance to flex his comedic muscles in the other films he has done. It is rare to see such talent all in one movie--and Mel Gibson (Graham) is stellar, as always, with his emotional portrayal of the reverend who has lost his faith.The overall humor of the movie, in fact, is absolutely sparkling, with witty one-liners and visual gags that will have you laughing for hours afterward. (And may I say, I think I'll make my own tinfoil hat.)My opinion? This film is a force to be reckoned with. Impressive soundtrack, impressive camera shots, impressive acting, and pretty impressive storyline. I've not been scared so badly in a long while--10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading a few of the other comments here about _Signs_ being an intelligent film, I have to wonder if I was in the right theatre. It was somewhat entertaining, but about as subtle as Allen Iverson's jewelry. You get pummeled about the head and shoulders repeatedly with some of the most obvious foreshadowing ever to hit the screen, and the whole movie is pretty manipulative.If you love Wal-Mart, double-wides, and sport a mullet, this film may strike you as intelligent. Otherwise, go in with reasonable expectations, and don't pay full price. The acting was good, but the script and direction were extremely disappointing -- kind of like M. Night Shyamalan wants to sell Beanie Babies or Angel Figurines on QVC or something.</fullReview>

The best part of the movie however was the wonderful acting. Mel Gibson was excellent as the former preacher who lost his faith. He was very clever and made the character so realistic. The best character however must have been, Pheonix, cast in the role of the younger brother, he was the comic relief in the movie. His character portrayed on how the younger nation would act in such a huge and unrealistic circumstance. I would recommend this to anyone who likes movies, a must see. 9 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

Night Shyamalan is actually making me feel bad as a video producer. Whenever I see some hack like Michael Bay take a movie with a $140 millionbudget like "Pearl Harbor" and steer it into the ground, I think "I could have trashed a movie for $140 million!" By comparison, Shyamalan's "Signs" wasmade for $62 million, probably could have been made for a tenth of that if no- name actors would have been used, and was simple enough to have been shoton someone's camcorder. Yet his knowledge of how to pull an audience'sstrings makes this the best movie of the summer. Go see it with a big crowd. That'll hide your screams.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great bold film making.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great cinematic experience. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Shyamalan's way of story telling is quite special. He gives hope to a lot of beginners. Hey you dont need to spend megabucks on big studio sets or exotic locations or use special effects to create an effective movie. You need story telling skills, a good script and good acting. And of course some boldness to be different. Check out all his latest 3 movies. Bulk of the shots happen indoors. Cast is very minimal too.From reading some of the reviews here people are still expecting shyamalan to 'rise up' to matrix and independence day style of film making. Hey if you want eye candy, go watch starwars and mib. But if you want something with more substance, here is a guy that gives you stuff to think about. All of Shyamalan's movies had me thinking about his movie making even days after I saw it.On a side note, all his movies combined probably contains just one 'R' rated sentence. (Unbreakable: the crude sexual reference in the comic book store.). Aspiring filmmakers, take a deep breath. You dont need to fill your movie with 4 letter words and references. Here is your example. (Half the shorts in atomfilms.com or ifilm.com are r rated).Was signs scary? Oh yes. Good acting? defenitely. Very touching at some points. I have no complaints about the plot. Its irrelevent. Its the way he approached the subject that matters.Signs is a good movie. Just ignore the negative comments. Most people havent gotten out of the sixth sense hangover yet. Its probably the same people who compained about not able to see the CGI train crash in Unbreakable.Will Signs make money? You bet. Like his older movies, Signs also was made on a budget of around 60 million! He must be a dream filmmaker for studios.Go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M. Night Shyamalan's Sign should read "Do Not Enter"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen "The Sixth Sense", "Unbreakable", and now "Signs". I would rate "The Sixth Sense" an 8, "Unbreakable" a 5, and "Signs" a 2. I am beginning to think that we have already seen the best that Mr. Shyamalan has to offer.*** SPOILERS BELOW ***Artistic Impressions: It's hard to figure out what this movie was trying to be. Was it a new look at an alien invasion movie? Nope. It seemed like a remake of "War of the Worlds". Was it a horror movie? Nah. It never seemed to relate to the viewer enough to get the viewer truly scared. A character exploration? Possibly, although the only character really being explored was Mel Gibson's. I never felt like I cared enough about his character to really want to see any more depth. Best that I can figure is that the movie is just trying to be another "revenue enhancer" for Touchstone Pictures.Pacing: The story was slow (as was true in M. Night Shyamalan's other movies). There was enough going on in the movie to keep me involved, but only barely. There were a few times that I looked at my watch to see how much of the movie was left (not a good sign). However, the few "scary moments" were well placed and gave me a little jump, even when I knew what was going on. The first couple of alien sightings were very well done.Acting: The acting was mostly decent, although the children (as usual in Hollywood) were totally unrealistic. Mel's acting was good, but the character he was handed to play never really grabbed me.Special Effects: Very good. Everything was cohesive visually and audibly. There wasn't any time that I caught myself thinking, "Cool special effects!". (This is a *very* good sign). I firmly believe that special effects, when done correctly, shouldn't draw attention to themselves. Special effects should make a story more believable, not become the story.Strengths: Not much that I can think of here that I haven't mentioned already.Weaknesses: Poor plot cohesion. "Signs" is a story about a potential alien invasion. Why are the aliens invading? We never find out. Why didn't the aliens use their advanced technology to invade us? A weak quote from a goofy dime-store book about aliens solved that problem. One thing about that book, though - it was always right about what the aliens would do. Funny how that happens in movies, hmmm ;-)? Why did the aliens leave after just a few days? We never truly found out, although I would expect that they would have blasted the crap out of our planet if we had "beaten" them as easily as we did in the movie.Summary: Although the character development is decent, the main plotline was very weak. Don't go unless you feel that you really have to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sign of a bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The basic premise of an alien invasion from one family's point of view is a potentially interesting spin. Signs was billed as a 'War of the Worlds' type of film and that's probably an unfair comparison. M. Night missed many of things that made 'War of the Worlds' among others such good stories, letting the viewers use their own imagination to create the anxieties. It's a shame that we continue to see this type of screen play that tells you every step of the way what is going to happen in the next scene and keeps you from being engrossed in the story. As for the ending, it is very contrived, but thankfully it did end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>like a slow, draggy "X-Files" episode</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to seeing this movie and was very excited when I got a chance to see it at an advance screening.With that said, the movie was a major disappointment. It really seemed like a slow, draggy episode of "The X-Files." There's almost no jeopardy or suspense until the last ten minutes of the movie. But, by then, you're so worn out by the draggy pace of the film, you've lost interest in the picture.Mel Gibson seemed bored with his role. J. Phoenix vastly over-acted as he often does. He can be a great actor when carefully directed, but that was not the case here.One big problem for me was that the film never addressed the issue that "real" crop circles were proven to be fake in actuality when they appeared in England several years ago. So when they appear in the picture, they seem silly, not scary.Also, the writer needs to do some basic research about how corn grows! It's obvious he knows nothing about how a farm or farming practices work. Yes, this is not a documentary about agriculture, but anyone who knows anything about farming will find the mistakes laughable.This is definitely a "wait for cable" movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Sign of All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last night I attended a screening of 'Signs', the latest motion picture written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan ('The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable'). I looked forward to seeing it! The trailer, already airing on TV, portrayed the movie to be a very exciting sci-fi thriller.Mel Gibson stars as Graham Hess, a former reverend whose wife was killed in a grisly car accident six months earlier. After that, he quit the ministry and abandoned all belief in the existence of a higher being. The supporting cast includes Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin and Cherry Jones. All turn in good performances.The movie opens with the discovery of giant crop circles in Hess' corn field. Who made them? Do they have some profound meaning, or is it just a prank? Without exposing the plot, I will tell you that the crop circles are just one of many 'signs' that lead the characters toward the conclusion.Some early scenes have a good sense of humor, taking full advantage of Gibson's wry wit. The funniest involves Phoenix, Culkin and Breslin in silly tin-foil hats. But the film is frequently as dull as its dark lighting and subdued atmosphere.**** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ****At one point, the screen goes totally black -- for what seems like an eternity -- while noises are heard. Then, a face is illuminated (chin up) by a flashlight beam. For a split-second, I thought I had stumbled into a rerun of 'Blair Witch' by mistake. But no, this was just one of several scenes that mimicked other films a bit too closely. I spotted near-perfect renditions of scenes from 'War of the Worlds', 'Field of Dreams', 'Children of the Corn' and others.The scariest moments are the classic 'bump-in-the-night' variety. Special effects are nearly absent unless you count the alien, who looks like a tall man dressed in two-dollar spandex tights from a Halloween close-out sale.Yet, the film is spellbinding because you constantly feel as though something really extraordinary is about to happen. Unfortunately, the anticipation is never rewarded and the story ends suddenly with a disappointing and unsatisfying conclusion. (As the credits began to roll, I stared at the screen in disbelief.)'Signs' is really not the movie portrayed in the trailer. The sci-fi story you came to see -- dealing with extraterrestrials and crop circles -- is merely a subplot to the internal, spiritual strife suffered by Hess (Gibson). Sci-fi is simply a colorful wrapper used to conceal the movie's true focus: a ponderous message about human spirituality.That brings me to my favorite 'sign' of all. It was bright. It was red. It had four letters. They read: 'E-X-I-T'. So I did.As I filed out of the theater, I overheard several conversations expressing the same sense of disappointment that I was feeling. A teenage girl, talking to her girlfriend, said it best: "Well, I never want to see that again!"Ditto.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Execrable Rubbish of the Highest Order/Ordure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am wholly amazed - dumbfounded, in fact - that this film has the ratings which it does. R. Ebert (with whom I quite often agree) gave it 4 out of 4 (!!), and the user reviews here are 6.7! (!!!) Un.be.lieve.able.While I am not willing to say that this is the worst film I ever have seen, it certainly is the worst I've seen in the past 10 or 12 years. I was holding out hope until the very end (the last 10 minutes or so), that the entire alien theme (in all its supremely flawed details) was some sort of dream sequence-y thing that the director would be able to somehow "pull off". The best that I could have expected from such a treatment (or from some other deus-ex-machina device) would have left me with a very poor-to-mediocre film experience, and even that would have taken absolute brilliance being exercised just shy of the ending credits.But no. The aliens were what they were, and any interested reader can peruse the many reviews here which address in detail the oh-so-many flaws, sub-flaws, and sub-sub-flaws which, taken together, rendered the film all-but-unwatchable. I simply don't have the stomach to write on this at any length.Finally, on top of this injury to the innocent movie-viewing public (Shame! Shame!), the film further insulted us with quite a bit of bad acting. (Though, in fairness, where the writing and direction is so perfectly atrocious, it may be somewhat presumptuous to assign any blame at all to the actors. Mea culpa.) Forewarned is forearmed, humans. Proceed at your peril, with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very overrated and stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is really bad. Nothing makes sense, the people make stupid decisions, and the aliens are absolutely brainless. The child actors, while they can cry on screen, are terrible. Any time they're not crying is atrocious. At one point, something pretty scarring happens to the children, and there is NO EMOTION. Given context, you would agree with me in saying that the kids should AT LEAST act a LITTLE shocked. And then there's the camera-work. The camera-work for the most part is alright, but those shots where the camera swoops across during a conversation or something mundane drives me crazy. There's nothing in this movie that you can't find anywhere else. The aliens look generic, the setting is clich, and most importantly, the main twist makes NO SENSE. I'm not going to spoil it here, but it is literally the most BACKWARDS THING you could imagine. Like once you see it you'll be wanting to beat up M. Night Shyamalan. I honestly don't see why so many people like this movie. The only redeeming qualities are Mel Gibson's and Joaquin Phoenix's performances, those are actually pretty good. But other than that, there's next to nothing good here. I mean, some of the camera-work is alright (aside from the aforementioned swooping thing,) but sometimes alright camera-work doesn't make a good movie. Everything is overdone, overlong, and too predictable for my liking. Avoid this at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool Movie, Bad Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs is a 2002 film created by M. Night Shyamalan, an alien invasion movie based around a Christian family who will soon realize that aliens are invading earth and will soon invade their very own home. As I watched the movie (watched it 30 times approx.), the horror in the movie isn't as you would think. Here are my thoughts: Suspsense/Frightening 100%. The film was perfectly made to frighten everyone, and especially disturb you. Even adults get disturbed by the movie, because having the thoughts 7-foot tall aliens who can spray poison gas and invading earth is truly disturbing. Scenes in the movie such as the alien reflection on TV, the disturbing clip of the alien at the birthday party on the TV (Which was probably the scariest part in the movie), and the alien on the roof were jump-scares, and sure to take your heart down on a roller coaster. If you have children, they will most likely have nightmares or be afraid of this movie, ergo PG-13 for being frightening.Profanity, Obscenity 5%. There was hardly any profanity, except in one scene which was considered a comedic scene.Plots/Well-Designed 20%. Although the premise of the movie was good (alien invasion and what not), the plot wasn't. It made no sense at all for aliens to come to earth vulnerable to water, and the ending especially ruined the movie (even knowing it was tense).If you want to see a good suspense movie, yes, this is perfect for you. If you want to see a well-designed movie, take your business elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bit Of A Departure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now we get to Shyamalan's third film, "Signs". This is also where I feel his movies started to decline. But we will get to why in this review.Now something I should mention is that I don't think this is a terrible movie, but I wouldn't consider it good. But there are a good amount of people who do like this movie, but this is my opinion.One thing I should mention is that a lot of the acting is very robotic, not as robotic as Shyamalan's later films but still noticeable. Also there are the child characters who act like adults and some of the adult characters act like kids. Also Shyamalan does the Hitchcock-Tarantino thing where he casts himself as a character in the movie. But here's the thing, with Hitchcock he cast himself as a background character, not an important character, and Tarantino can actually act. Which is important when you are making yourself a somewhat major character. So yeah, Shyamalan isn't a very good actor, which is made more clear by his next movie.Also now we have a slower paced movie now then the last one, which would be fine if it wasn't so boring. That's kinda the major problem with this movie is that it isn't very interesting, not even the aliens are all that interesting. There is also some attempted suspense but that also fails, but there are some good moments though. Sorry if I don't have much to say about this movie, its just a bunch of boring stuff that happens and that's it.And for those wondering why I didn't talk about the ending, I would recommend you watch this analysis of the movie that talks about the ending. Even though I don't agree with his opinion about the movie, he does give a good point about the endinghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ju05PuiyQ</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An anti-Job for Mel (tv)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, if I'm right, the illness of his son, the alien invasion, all this was orchestrated to make Mel a believer again after the death of his wife! It's indeed the opposite of the biblical Job who never lost his faith facing some personal disaster. Maybe that's the reason (the sign) why the alien would choose their farm to come because it's so stupid to think otherwise! Sincerely, this is however greatly far-fetched and this movie can't reach the value of the "X-files" or "War of the worlds", albeit mixing faith and alien is indeed the right question to ask: if a God create us, what about the aliens so: did he create them also? In that perspective, the offers doesn't bring elements and its only good conclusion is to say that the believer never feels alone! Next, the alien invasion has never been so mistreated in a movie: maybe the beginning with the crop circle is good but the later capture of one alien in a attic is stupid and when we saw them, they look just bad. In addition, the directing is awful as Shamalayan just refuses to do it: he just put down the camera and the movie is about characters watching it. So, it's very static and quickly, it gives headaches.So for the one who was labeled as the next Spielberg, it was a bit too early and this movie and following prove that he hasn't the stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War of the house</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With 'The Sixth Sense', mysteriously-named director M. Night Shyalaman proved himself a master of certain kind of atmospheric tension. He tries to repeat the trick in 'Signs', with partial success. The start of the film is corny but undeniably gripping, and throughout he manages to conjure moments of real tension despite using the barest minimum of special effects. The limitations of this film lie more in its structure. Aliens are invading earth; but the film concentrates entirely on one family who hole up (for no particular reason) in their own house in the country, facing the menace on their own. The film thus has a feel of a ghost story (isolated family terrorised and haunted), and yet, at a time the whole earth is meant to be faced by destruction, the fate of this one family seems trivial when set in its wider context. One can also grow tired of Shyalaman's stock elements - the over-earnest loving families, the beautiful, supernaturally-aware children, the mysterious book that somehow contains at least some of the answers.Shyalaman certainly has a skill at making this sort of movie, but 'The Sixth Sense' also had a plot that was startling and cleverly-enough constructed to disguise its essential ridiculousness. 'Signs' manifestly does not: which is not to say that it won't make your skin creep as you watch it, and more than once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feels Like A Sci-Fi Movie From The 1950's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan has the touch for making movies that make you think instead of carrying you through the film by dramatic special effects. The story of an alien invasion and crop circles feels like something from the 1950's film Invaders From Mars. Signs has a good plot but it seems to be missing more of the action and suspense that audiences today demand. At times I found the movie a bit slow and tiring and when the film ended I thought that it could have somehow finished better. I give the movie a 7 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Signs is a good suspense movie, with good performances of the Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix. The basic plotline is Gibson a man that lost his wife and faith, one day found strange circles in his farm. His first clue, is some guys was responsible for this strange marks. However, the true is very different, aliens are responsible for this marks and prepare an invasion. This fact will be affect very deeply the life of Graham's family.This movie is basically about fear and lost, the suspense is a little impaired, because the aliens are shown explicit and clear in the middle of the movie. In my opinion, there are some aspects in the movie that are little artificial (About aliens and water), but this is a minor flaw. My general impression, is that Signs is a good movie, with a good story a solid performances of Phoenix and Gibson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie tried to be too many things at once, and each aspect was poorly done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs had so much potential, but it really disappointed me when I went to see it. The movie tried to inject humor, science fiction, thrill, and drama all into one plot. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it was done very poorly.The humor wasn't that bad, and I laughed at most of the jokes. However, there were jokes at suspenseful moments and it would just ruin the mood. However, humor wasn't the biggest shortcoming of this film. It was just out of place.The science fiction aspect of the movie was horrible. They spent the first 1/3 to 1/2 of the movie developing the suspense and mystery of the crop circles and then...***SPOILER***...they ended up being for navigation? How lame is that? I think most of the people there wanted to see a more interesting reason for them. The aliens were also done very poorly. They tried to build suspense by only showing parts of their bodies, but that didn't really make me all that apprehensive. Eventually when they showed the whole body, the alien was incredibly stereotypical. Skinny and green.The thrill part of the movie consisted of purely hollywood cheap thrills. Sudden music with sudden camera changes with something new. Yes, it made me jump. Then, I swear, I started laughing my butt off in the movie theater. It was just so simply stupid. A real thriller is psychological which makes you not be able to fall asleep when you get home.The drama part was done poorly too. The biggest short coming in my opinion was that you never really became attached to the characters.The whole thing with the "signs" being placed etc was to try to prove a philosophical idea. This wasn't done so badly, however, they basically told the audience "Some people believe in God and fate, and others don't." Usually, when a movie comes out which tries to make you believe something different, it comes up with something new that most people haven't thought of. Since the idea was so unoriginal and shallow, all of the work done to develop the signs etc was a waste of time.In conclusion, I went into the theater hoping to see something which made me think in different ways like A.I. and other science fiction border of reality movies do, but instead, I left wishing I didn't spend the $6.00 to see the movie (not to mention the $4.75 I paid for the popcorn which happened to not be that good that night, lol).</fullReview>

Mel gets totally overshone in this movie, he doesn't shine at all (never does these days, give me him in Gallipoli). And yes there was a scary build up, the green men being seen bit by bit, but PLEASE!!! beating one to death at the end of the movie? C'mon, there had to be more but I must be missing something. If its to do with faith then it was a lame result. I just expected so much more, something with oomph to take your breath away, but to have Mel say "Swing away" and then the alien be beaten by a baseball bat and glasses of water, very poor ending. Its like he had a great story, the build up, end of the world stuff and then he lost it. All the flashbacks to his wife. No I'm sorry this was a very overrated and disappointing movie.

I am an avid lover of horror movies and psychological thrillers and I was expecting this to be something extremely "edge of your seat" when, in return, I was laughing for most of the film. Yes, Mel Gibson's performance was pretty good but, come on, as good as "Braveheart"????? That's just a load of b.s. Even in "What women want", Mr. Gibson had done a better and more enjoyable acting job. Same goes for Joaquin Phoenix. This was very sad comparing to "Gladiator". I think the kids must have had a much better performance. Now, about the plot. As I said, I spent more time laughing than jumping in my seat which goes to say much about the horrorness of the movie...And that ending???????? That was the most pathetic excuse of an ending I have ever seen.

Now I have no problem suspending disbelief when warranted but this borders on the ridiculous. SPOILERS!!!! I could level a list of flaws but I don't want to be pedantic, so I'll just cover my top three: 1.) As rightly noted by so many others the inconsistancy of the aliens' powers is a huge problem 2.) The reason they choose to stay in the house (a vote? you've got to be kidding me) is weak--comon' how about their car doesn't work or they aliens are already outside, etc 3.) A total lack of verisimilitude in terror, the kids were way too cool and the adults barely pick up an object (any object-which would be a natural reaction) to defend themselves until the end. Instead Mel picks up cooking utensils and makes dinner. In fact that scene with Phoneix going up the stairs to see if the aliens were gone without grabbing an ax, hammer or anything was one of the most implausible moments I have seen on film.Well I did like the faith restored portion, and I thought the flashbacks (and coincidence/destiny) were well woven into the thick of things. Also the part when the Doctor tells Mel that one of them is in his pantry was really strong and showed potential, too bad I just wasn't able to overcome the fact that these aliens who can mask their ships in mid air can't get out of a pantry. I think some type of terrestrial creatures would have been better suited here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Signs", the worst movie of the year so far, contains some of the most annoying of movie cliches: Kids who are far wiser than the adults. Rural people presented as noble and morally superior. An obvious early scene that telegraphs a later scene - Conversation about a character's great home run hitting abilities. (Gee, do you suppose a baseball bat might be available to this guy at a critical moment?) And worst of all, a ludicrous speech that reduces all of humanity to two types, those who believe and are right, and those who don't and are frightened. Does that mean if you're not gullible enough to swallow this film, you're the wrong type? Here's a suggestion: If you're going to make an anti-intellectual movie, have the courage of your convictions and stop referring to a "BOOK" for evidence. Admit that you hate books. The boy refers to the book to make his "wise" pronouncements. The book that shows a spaceship setting "his" house on fire. Then why do the board up the windows? To provide more kindling? Characters played by Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels could not have been dumber.</fullReview>

"Signs" really is more of a mood piece, little overt physical slasher, and more subtle director motivated technique. The scenes in the crop fields are sweepingly creepy. A number of the surprises are excellent. While I wasn't impressed with the movie, it was scary for me and there were too many logical flaws in it, I believe that overall the audience rating for this type of movie is a great sign for what in means for the audience members.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun Time At The Theater</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very entertaining, and enjoyable movie for myself and my family. It's obvious that a lot of IMDB users, use Citizen Kane, The Godfather and Schindler's List as their basis for comparison to every movie they review, so they'll always have plenty to complain about. Fortunately, I'm not such a movie geek that I have to expound on each aspect of the film and I can look at it objectively for what it is; an opportunity to escape into the lives of some characters and watch them solve the problems that life throws at them. With that in mind, "Go see this movie." It's a good story to take your mind of off whatever problems you might be having and I can guarantee if you go, not expecting 'Gone With The Wind', you won't be disappointed. You should laugh, you may cry, you'll definitely jump out of your seat on occasion, only when you're not sitting on the edge of it. The movie provides some good discussion points, so you can talk about it afterwards over pizza with whomever you saw it with. What more could be expected? The story-line and plot-points have all been beat to death hear so I won't go there, but I would like to make some observations. I think M. Night Shyamalan's main interest is entertaining his audience, ala Spielberg, Hanks, and Eastwood. I'm sure if it was his goal to win a Best Movie oscar he could produce garbage like 'Sakespeare In Love' or 'American Beauty', but I believe it's more important to him that his film 'entertains' rather than 'achieve' and I applaud him for that. Another more selfish comment is that I would've really liked to have seen Bruce Willis in the Mel Gibson role. Not that Mel was bad, I thought he played the part well, but it would've been interesting to see how Bruce would've played it, while shooting the hat-trick with M. Night, after The Sixth Sense, and Unbreakable. My last point is, don't read more into the story than what it is, 'characters struggling against outside forces of conflict.' If you do that, you'll enjoy the film, but if you do feel compelled to analyze every frame, you may want to stay home and rent Casablanca instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan, 1 Spielberg, 0</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan's Signs feels like a loose retelling of H. G. Well's War of the Worlds because there's something ubiquitous on Earth the pointy, clicking little acrobats can't abide. If that's true, then Signs is a vastly superior--and very, very scary-- version of Well's work. This movie elicited such dread from me that I had to shut off the tape repeatedly and take a breather. It's that good.Compared to Spielberg's 2005 version, Signs looks even better. Spielberg managed to turn his work into a overblown, episodic, and ultimately very frustrating movie that only scared me when I got to see his aliens (and that was too damn little face time for me!).I think Signs was one of the few horror movies I've seen in anything like recent history that makes me shiver when I think of it--and I saw it in the summer of 2007!That's staying power.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signs of disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie focuses on the story on a family of four which consists of a former priest, his brother who was once a minor league baseball star, his daughter, and his asthmatic son. Together they receive a variety of signs such as crop circles, lights in the sky, and so on that point to some mysterious force at work.These signs lead to disappointment. It turns out that the mysterious force at work is an invading alien race. But it gets worse. These aliens are launching an invasion of Earth despite the fact that they cannot stand water. This is absolutely ridiculous as water as one of the most common substances on Earth. This story represents everything I dislike about alien invasion films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plagued by ruining its own antagonists but liberated by its heroes, suspense, and message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a great film. Unfortunately, its worth is often completely missed by viewers. The only downfall is the villain. Unfortunately, this aspect was also what was making the movie a significantly terrifying movie for the first two thirds! While the evil lurks in the shadows, the suspense of "Signs" is unstoppable. Shyamalan successfully emulates Hitchcock's "The Birds" but drops the ball in the final act by entering territory Hitchcock wisely avoided; a slapped on explanation. It is not until the lights come on that the movie falters somewhat but not in terms of character; fortunately! This is almost the scariest film I have seen when it comes to the "fear of the unknown". Not because the aliens are super scary- LOOKING, but rather because until the end they aren't SEEN much at all. It allows the audience to impress their own fears upon the aliens as is so brilliantly written into the film's best sequence which is a simple conversation on a couch.Shyamalan is best when he doesn't try to reinvent the wheel, but rather when he is putting spinning rims on the wheel. His successful films are all very typical genres but they are given an interesting context that makes them better than the average film within that genre. Ghosts, Superheroes, and Aliens are all done to death. However, the perspectives Shyamalan tells these typical premises helps them transcend the mediocre. It isn't until he tries to coming up with his own original material that things fall apart. Fortunately, there is not too much that goes astray in Signs. He wisely chooses to tell an Alien invasion story from the perspective of a small family rather than the wide-scale epic. This is where Signs really works. Realistic characters are simply non-existent in alien invasion flicks to begin with. And yet, in this one, they are the centerpieces. They are also acted exceptionally well all around! That alone is why most people disliked this one oddly enough. They wanted aliens frying people and instead got something a lot deeper. This is simply no discredit to the film itself, in my opinion. Plain and simple, this movie, like all of Shyamalan's flicks, should be viewed as a unique film because it has a highly unique perspective. This film explores the concept of how people react in terrifying circumstances. Do you believe that everything is just coincidences and you are alone, or do you read the events as signs of some higher power? For this reason, the film is entirely a dramatic, supernatural, and psychological thriller, and clearly not some mindless horror gore fest or a typical alien invasion romp. Furthermore, the "signs" aren't the literal crop circles. All the "signs" in the film are shown in the finale and we are left wondering if it was all just luck or part of a plan just as the main characters point out in the previous conversation. It is left to the characters and ultimately the viewer as to what they make of them...In the end, this movie is very terrifying but at the same time immensely beautiful and character-driven. The final act succeeds in completing the main character's arch but unfortunately threw in a little too much information regarding the villains which spoils some of their impact and shows the "face of the devil". It pulls a "The Mist" and suddenly takes an unnecessary turn into left field when it was doing just fine. Yet, in comparison to "The Mist" which abandons both its mystery and its characters, "Signs" abandons its mystery but preserves and elevates its characters.Overall, Shyamalan really accomplishes what he set out to do with this one and I believe it deserves more recognition for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many problems to be good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Uggg what to say about this movie...First off I will say it was a huge let down mainly because it started off so well and then there was problem after problem....plot hole after plot hole that it just made the movie almost unbearable to watch. Yes the acting was good by the main cast starring Mel Gibson And Jouqin Pheonix but the side cast were terrible. This movie had a high budget but it was shot in about 3 small different places? I have no idea where all the money went.This movie is about an ex reverend who owns a farm. One day after his children were screaming in the fields he runs out to discover crop cirlces. Then they turn on the news and see that something very strange is happening as crop cirlces start to pop up all over the world. He tries to keep his family safe and calm as the invaders come.This movie started off really good and it really did have a creepy atmosphere but why too many plot holes ruined it for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The dialog is masterful with well-blended elements of introspection and humor. "Signs" is in no way a comedy, but there are deeply humorous images and dialog in this film that contribute much to the film without any detraction at all. Laughing out loud is more than a texting tic with "Signs." Characters are developed quite well and so deeply that you forget the actors and become engulfed in their characters. The director and his crew create a very believable, dimensioned world. Stories and back stories entwine seamlessly.The photography, lighting,and scoring combined into an atmospheric movie that caught my attention and never let go. The director's movies have been, for me, hit and miss, but "Signs" is definitely a hit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has It's Faults and Plot Holes But Still Worthwhile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The alien invasion movie is the oldest but best draw in basic sci fi movies, so MNS's take on this shopworn plot gets some pluses for originality. He is the type of guy who is so earnest and such a good filmmaker that you can enjoy this movie even though parts of it are just plain dumb like schmaltzy sentimental fatherly monologues about his children's' birth during the scariest part of the movie. There were enough and incessant Christian and spiritual references to fill 2 months of sermons with near idolatry of the preacher's dead wife thrown in for a Mary hail. But the lamest part of the movie were the aliens: the weakest, most incompetent bunch of losers to ever build interstellar ships and invade earth. The Boy Scouts could have driven them off. But it was scary in parts, as well as thoughtful, almost too thoughtful. It was fun seeing Mel play a introverted, non heroic sort of family guy, not the demented kill them all father he played in "The Patriot" or "Braveheart" or a 100 other ones. The best actor was Rory Culkin playing his young son, who is much better than his more famous but obnoxious brother, The daughter, precocious 6 year old Boo, was played well by a wee actress named Abigail Breslin. While young actresses &amp; actors are natural scene stealers, she was precious and enjoyable. Certainly better than that screechy obnoxious pre-teen monster Dakota Fanning played in the latest version of "War of the World". In that movie the main disappointment was not having both kids killed off for their general useless bratty behavior in a time of extreme danger and emergency. One more note, if you are looking for special effects there are next to none. There are no fancy ships, death rays or mass death and destruction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Faith-test film that gets a bit cheesy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good performances by all. Weird and failed script, though. The film uses space aliens to test one man's Faith in Catholicism. Apparently, a defrocked priest, played by Gibson, takes a wife and has three children. Since the priestly character is never erased, I'm not sure the Church, at least of the past, would have blessed such a union. But these are confusing religious times, and particularly for Gibson in his own real life.So along come the aliens. And in a flashback, an Indian friend of his (played by M. Knight himself) down the road is spooked by one of the aliens at night, locks the baddie in a pantry closet, gets in his car and proceeds to speed wildly down the road until he hits Gibson's wife who was out for a walk. She's alive when he gets there, and has advice for the kids - particularly for the oldest, 'see the signs'. She probably didn't mean the space aliens who set in motion the events of her death.Meanwhile, in a previous scene, Gibson has met the Indian friend who is fleeing the area for a lake - the aliens don't like water, he says. And he apologizes - I'm just soooooo sorry - again for killing his wife. Presumeably, with all the space aliens around blocking what at the time were analog TV and radio signals, the guy was released. So he takes off for the lake.And that's the test. Gibson says he's lost the Faith. He dutifully blames God, sez I'ze-hates-ya, and whatever else. It's all God's fault. Yet there's miraculous deliverance at the end. And Mr. defrocked, living in sin, apparently takes up the collar again and goes - where? Does this 'Catholic' have his own ministry, his own separate congregation (sort of like . . well, like Mel has)? Test - test passed? I . . guess. Was that the plot M. Knight?And then the aliens are gone. While there, they were War of the Worlds types, sneaking about and trying to capture people. A film about on par with this except for all the fx, the Cruise remake of WotW pretty much depicts the space aliens of this film, as well, at least in terms of behavior.But M. Knight should have stuck with Wells. He made sense. Bacteria and viruses. That might even sneak into a suit, which they didn't even wear in the Cruise film. Here, they're never seen but for a glimpse in sunlight. But they look like grey mummies just out of the sarcophagus. Either that's their moldy all-together, or that's one goofy space-suit.At any rate, apparently their Achilles heel is water, even just a few drops. People here have pointed out the difficulty with that. Put a few drop of water on them, 'suit' or no, and it's like stomach acid or something. But, they attack a planet that's mostly - water. They fly around in spaceships at an altitude with cloud vapor - water. They hang around in the middle of the night and early morning. Water. Early morning dew. And where they reach out violently to grab people in some scenes, when Gibson is strolling through his field of corn at night with only a sometimes working flashlight, apparently with aliens hiding all around, not one single grab. I guess M. Knight must have thought light scared 'em before he hit on water.Such a cheesy film. This M. Knight was once thought to be a great director about to make a name for himself. And I think Signs was even well-reviewed at first. Looking at it now . . .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked Signs at times, but I also disliked it at times. It's a mysterious, atmospheric movie that really has good scenes, but it could have been a lot better.Story? Cropcircles, UFO sightings, strange pictures and eventually aliens who come to Earth. Hostile aliens...The story mainly involves a family of four living in a farm in the middle of nowhere. All four characters are played well and you'll get attached to them, or some of them at least. So the acting is quite nice.The movie's main strong point is the suspense and slowly building towards a climax. It's done very well, but past a certain point in the film, it weakens. Too bad though, because for the first half of the movie, I was on the edge of my seat.So basically Signs is a nice movie, but it could have been better at some points. It's certainly watchable, but don't expect a masterpiece.7 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shyamalan's star began to fade with this pretty disappointing third film, the style is still as well-executed as in his previous movies, and his special style of dialogues still occasionally have that strange effect on me, but the plot is just way too weak to keep things interesting. It's the subtle horror of an alien invasion, in a typical M. Night fashion we don't really get to take a good look at the supposed villains. All of this really does work, but not for two hours. And the customary twist ending doesn't really deliver either, it just ruins things. If you can even call the ending a twist, things just suddenly stop making sense. I know were supposed to be amazingly intrigued by this oh-so mysterious situation and the foreshadowing of the dead wife, but I just can't get there. And was the hint the wife gave really necessary? It's a pretty basic plan, they could have thought of it all by themselves. Perhaps Shyamalan is just too much of a one-trick pony. Get a basic story, add a little mystery, throw logics out of the window, and there you have it. It worked so well in his first two features though, we'll always have those.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Attack by an alien? Try pissing....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film recently 6 years after it had been released. As the rating had been high all along I was kind of greatly disappointed at its plot, particularly at the twist that aliens can't stand water.Actually I have previously seen "Scary Movie 3" which had exposed some of its plot lines but believe me, "Signs" is funnier! How else can you imagine that when you are attacked by an alien, pissing at it can save your soul! It's equivalent to its release of poisonous gas at you.This is not to mention the stupid scene when the clergyman was on his way home, and was advised by the police woman to have a last word with the upper half of his wife while her lower half was dead.If flaws like these could be taken care of, this can turn out to be a much better movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The lone highlight of this film was the one spot I expected to deliver the least: Mel Gibson. Though nearly every character was fairly superficial and flat, Gibson's Graham Hess was well-developed, deep, engaging and likeable, despite the writer's lame attempts at trite humor. The rest of the film seemed to remain on the surface, with poor acting and worse character-development in most of the supporting roles, especially Officer Paski. Most of all, I was turned-off by the over-riding message of the film. I have never been a fan of those who subscribe to the ideology that there are no coincidences. There are countless millions of opportunities for wild coincidences every second, and to believe that when you are lucky, it is because God planned it that way, and when others are unlucky, it is, likewise, supposed to be that way. God simply does not wish to protect them? If God wanted to protect this family, he could've done it simply by having the aliens land in another field, as opposed to setting up this elaborate scheme of endless coincidences that contributed to their survival. At least he Shyamalan has a message, which is more than I can say for 99% of the film-makers out there today. Still, his sense of humor and sense of emotion have never succeeded in drawing me in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Twist!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are different opinions of when was Shyamalan's turning point was in going from being called "The Next Spielberg" to his name being associated with bad movies and ridiculous twists. Some think it begun with Unbreakable and others his later films like the Village or the Happening. Personally, I've always thought it begun with Signs. Whilst it was received OK at the time, I've always seen it as a mess of a film with dull characters, mostly bland visuals and quite possibly one of the worst twist endings ever put to film. Just like any Shyamalan film the cast seems to suffer from extreme boredom. I say this because from the very start of the film they all seem completely detached from everything that's going on. For example early on when the family dog attacks the children, Mel Gibson's character just seems mildly distracted when he senses something up. Then the kids themselves don't act like they've been attacked but instead like they've just been mildly irritated by something. Ultimately it's a big problem for any drama, because if the characters don't seem to care then why the hell should the audience? It's not the actors fault as for some reason Shyamalan has repeated the same dull monotone style for all his actors ever since the Sixth Sense. The problem being that whilst in the Sixth Sense it was something different to what we'd seen before and worked to create the off- putting atmosphere, here it's boring and makes little sense when it's used in casual conversations. One of the things that bug me the most about Shyamalan's films is that he does tend to put some good ideas and concepts into his films, only to then ruin them. For example there's the aliens themselves. At first they are quite well done with Shyamalan making us fear what we don't see as we are put in the protagonists perspectives seeing only brief glimpses of the invaders. But then he screws it up because when the aliens are revealed they are completely unintimidating and created using incredibly ugly and unrealistic CGI. On top of that the way he has people react at first is interesting with people being very sceptical of whether aliens have invaded. However whilst this could be an interesting background for the story to take place in, it's forced into the foreground and focused on for a significant portion of the film meaning it gets dull pretty quickly.Obviously just like any Shyamalan film this one has a twist. But this film has not just one, but two of the most laughably implausible twists ever put to film. Firstly it's revealed that the invading aliens are allergic to water. Really? These aliens travel all this way across the galaxy and can be defeated by water? I'm assuming that Shyamalan was trying to go for something like what was done in War of the Worlds where the germs are the downfall, but it worked for that because the Martians had no concept of germs and never would have thought of looking for them. Water on the other hand covers most of the earth! Did the aliens never notice this when they were scouting the planet? These aliens were as dumb as the ones from Plan 9 From Outer Space!But that's nothing compared to the twist that god killed Mel Gibson's wife so he would know to tell his brother to hit the alien with the baseball bat. There are so many things wrong with this.... Firstly these are the weakest alien invaders ever. A single baseball team on a rainy day and their invasion is over. Secondly, if god really wanted to send a message then why did he have to kill his wife? That sounds more like the way the devil would send a message! And finally did they really have to be told to use the baseball bat against the alien? Honestly I would have thought it would be obvious! For me this is quite possibly one of the worst twists put in a big box office film just for its complete lack of any logic or sense. It's actually laughable that this story made it into a 75 million dollar film. But that's just what this film is. Hilariously awful. Honestly it was worth watching because it is one of those films that is so bad it's good. I'm rating it low because it fails at the drama and horror that it was attempting. But looking at it in the same vein as a film like Plan 9 From Outer Space it is pretty enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will start with the positive aspects of this film, of witch there are few. Mel Gibson is believable, if only because all he had to do was look slightly downcast and beyond that be emotionless. The movie is slightly frightening at times and the scenes in the corn are legitimately scary.Aside from these small redemptions, this movie is ridiculous. Although the aliens can travel across the universe and make themselves invisible, they are completely incapable of protecting themselves from their weakness, water (?), which covers most of the surface of the planet they are attacking, is the most common part of the beings they plan to harvest, they cannot escape from rooms if they are boarded up, they cannot fight or exert any strength on anything... The list goes on.Near the end, an alien that is left behind in the house grabs the boy, who is suffering from asthma. Then, in the least effective scene I have seen in any movie, the family all stares in horror at the alien. The father has a religious realization while he is staring... Meanwhile, the alien continues to stand there, not moving, apparently equally appalled as the humans. He makes no attempt to escape, does not harm the boy, and waits a full five minutes, waits until the family realizes that they could hurt the alien with a baseball bat (genius!) to use his poison spray. Why not attack the alien earlier? Why not take the boy and escape? Why didn't the family take the medicine down with them? Why didn't they have weapons with them? Why is this movie so terrible?!?! The theme of the movie is religious. I can accept that, except that it is badly contrived and makes a ridiculous connection between religion and coincidence. The bizarre tendency for the little girl to leave cups of water out is a blatant setup for the ending, when water is exposed as the aliens' weakness. The boy's asthma was also obviously set up for the poison gas the alien sprays in his nose. And it is apparently miraculous that the main character's wife told him to tell Merril to keep playing baseball. Because she obviously meant that only he, great baseball player that he was, could possibly use a baseball bat to kill an alien. And because they had all of their own bizarre problems or talents (the ability to swing a baseball bat, for example), this means that some divine being is looking out for them. A completely immature and nonsensical interpretation of religion. A clumsy and pathetic attempt to convey this theme. God-awful.Do not ever watch this movie. It is an insult to science fiction, to movies, to writers, to the audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am going to say I don't hate this movie but to me it is rather bad and the plot has some huge holes in it that some people need to consider before praising this movie.The whole movie deals with aliens that have touched down and are terrorizing Mel Gibson and his family, by the way Mel Gibson in this movie is a lapsed priest after his wife died in a car accident.The idea sounds interesting, but there are huge plot holes in this movie: 1. Water is lethal to the aliens which will kill them by contact, yet the aliens came to a planet covered by 75 percent of water, precipitation is constant and dew settles on corn at night, so the aliens running through the field should have been killed instantly.2. When the aliens finally break into the home the family fleas into the basement, and the aliens that are capable of inter-space travel and cloaking their space ships cannot get through a wooden door.3. After the family holds them off, the next day Joaquin Phoenix opens the door and goes upstairs without taking the ax or any other weapon with him, sounds extremely ignorant to me.This whole scenario is ridiculous but on a positive note the movie does have some pretty good scares and an effective soundtrack, and the acting wasn't bad either.But those things are not enough to save this film for me, but those reading this if you can stand giant plot holes then by all means see this film, but all others it's better to avoid it, watch M Night's previous two films instead.</fullReview>

This movie lacks a message (it could have had an interesting one considering the priest and alien life) But nothing happens that makes me wonder about these aliens and why they have come to this world and hang around in cornfields.It's as dull as a Mc Donalds hamburger, no particular taste so it appeals to more people.

This is a charmless, stinking turd that will be bettered than the popcorn sat under a heat-light for the past 24 hours even with flies buzzing over it.The premise begins with a disillusioned, racist preacher played by Mel Gibson, he hates the Jews and so he's settled in the rural heartlands of America to restart a master-race, unfortunately he has a son with a cleft-palate and he also has a dead wife, so him and god aren't on good terms anymore... It's OK though Jesus sends some aliens to test his faith and guess what, he gets his faith back and it's all OK! Only it isn't. M Knight Shtmalan(sic), is possibly one of the most horrificly insulting people I've ever come across in films, possibly even worse than Michael Winner... this movie treats the audience like they're retarded.In all truthfullness, I saw 6th Sense and was truly angered by the banality of that movie and I bought this from a charity shop on VHS (back in the day), this is also the one and only movie I have ever thrown out - ever, even Magnolia escaped that. Yet, so awful that I taped over it with a documentary just in case anyone found this at the rubbish tip and decided they might want to watch it - I spared them that.I really detest the whole Michael Bay kinda thing, yet find that sometimes watchable with enough booze, this doesn't even have the charm of exploding things, just a seemingly willfully-dull plot, that treats you as if you are very, very stupid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to be honest and admit that I've never been a big fan of M. Shyamalan Night. I think his plot twists deceive the audience without adequate explanation or consistency. And now every movie has to have a trendy twist, most of them I either figure out before it happens or am disgusted when it is finally unveiled.I agree with most of people's complaints about the plot holes in Signs, specifically how unintelligent the aliens are. But my biggest problem with this movie is how lamely the 'faith' premise was interjected. Aliens meet God. Yikes. This might be my heretical agnosticism speaking here, but doesn't the concept of Alien life sort of suggest that there is no God? Okay so there are Aliens and God? Well I only have one question then.Do the aliens have their own God or is He the same as ours?</fullReview>

Thats what this heap of codswallop is-I mean who puts up the money for a film which is not even supposed to be a drama of sorts yet doesn't even make it as a comedy or a human story on the lines of ET Its full of goofs and the only thing is got right was to be BORING! Goofs-take your pick between: a one time Reverend who's called "Father" by people who knew him when I think most people know its Catholic priests who are thus styled and are not allowed to take a wife. Or the crop circles supposedly seen from a window yet are a long way down the field of tall plants. The aliens looked exactly like the Roswell alien-have these people no imagination. The unreality of the whole thing is rather stupid when the Government seems unconcerned. It comes to no conclusion either-its just a very dumb story and to give it 1 is just for the scenery</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Its 1, 2, 3 Strikes You're Out At the Old Ball Game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw this movie on DVD and I was really looking forward to it because I remember how much they were promoting it when it first came out, and after all, it was a Mel Gibson movie (with Joaquin Phoenix as the icing on the cake, how bad could it be?). I read most of the reviews on here before I saw the movie.For the first hour, I was on the edge of the couch, totally riveted to my television screen as I waited to find out what was going to happen next. But. . . in the back of my mind I was thinking "I'm sure this isn't simply going to turn out to be about some stupid green aliens who supposedly want to take over the world. The crop signs have to mean something else, and they are just trying to mislead us by implying that it really is about aliens." Boy was I wrong! Slowly, I came to the realization that this movie was the biggest piece of crap that I've ever sat through. No, it isn't a "thinking person's movie" unless you are remedial and on drugs. Why is it that every slow-moving, pseudo-spiritual film is thought to be so profound - are we trying to fool ourselves into liking this garbage? Are we afraid to admit just how silly the movie really is so we pretend that it has a deeper meaning to justify our having been foolish enough to spend 2 hours watching this drivel? Are we really such gullible sheep? Grant Hess was shallow, grim and boring - I didn't believe one single emotion he was pretending to have. I can't even imagine how he ever became an Episcopalian priest. Surely, as a priest he had to deal with life and death issues before so why would he think he would somehow be exempt from sorrow or death in his personal life? Isn't he supposed to believe in an after-life and feel that his wife has "gone to a better place?" How could he have enough Christian faith to even become a priest yet when he is faced with a personal tragedy of his own, be so quick to abandon his beliefs? It made him seem like a hypocrite - "I'm a man of God but the minute I'm faced with a personal tragedy, I'm done with religion." How shallow is that? I certainly wouldn't want him to be my priest. Then, when he is faced with the prospect of evil aliens, all of a sudden he knows exactly what God is thinking and why things happen the way they do. What a simplistic ass! The children were acting more like aliens than the green dudes - they were unnaturally pale, emotionless, coldly logical and moved like they had taken one too many tranquilizers. Even the sheriff seemed like she was on Valium. After she asked them a few questions about the intruder in their cornfields, we never saw her again. It made you wonder if that town was peopled with humanoid robots. Evidently, Shamalyan doesn't know anything about dogs - do some research, buddy. No German shepherd is going to turn on his owners the way the one in the movie did - if anything, he would be trying to protect the children and probably give his life protecting them, not try to kill them because he sensed a few green strangers lurking around.What about that wife? - she was supposedly sliced in half by a truck and held together because she was wedged between two vehicles, yet she was able to have a last inane chat with her husband. I don't think any of the characters were well developed and you really didn't know what made any of them tick. You didn't get a sense of what their life was normally like until this whole crop circle business started. If this was a working farm, where were the hired hands? Why would you be terrified of these so-called signs and assume that they had to be related to aliens? If you were mindless enough to stay in a deserted house and face down beings who wanted to kill you, wouldn't you at least have a stockpile of things to use as weapons like knives, axes, tire iron, whatever? Wouldn't you put aside food and water and blankets for your family before barricading yourself in the basement and wouldn't you have enough sense to make sure your child had his medicine? The way that little boy was snorting on that inhaler every few minutes, I'm surprised there was anything left in it. If his asthma was that severe, he shouldn't have been on a farm at all. And how stupid were the aliens - just stand there while someone beats you to death with a baseball bat or fall and wait for a glass of water to fall on your head and melt you. Who says extraterrestrials are supposedly superior? Wherever these airheads were from (The Naked, Stupid, Clueless Planet for Green Rejects, I'm guessing), I'm surprised they survived at all.I didn't care about anyone in this film and as far as I was concerned the green men could have slurped all of them down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shyamalan must be the most overrated and over-financed director in film today. Apart from Sixth Sense, his films range from awful to bad. Signs is no exception.The writing is amateurish, predictable and cloying. The conflicts are superficial, the character flaws and inevitable redemption are hollow and contrived.And the menace, the alien menace, is laughable. Two dimensional characters, they might as well be zombies or simple thugs.They have traveled across the vastness of space, to a planet whose surface is composed mainly of water. They cavort naked around in the humid air, through dew damp fields of corn, barefoot on the damp ground. They fly space ships but dig in the wet soil with their hands and.... buh buh buh baaaaaa!!!! THEY ARE KILLED BY WATER.I'm melting! Signs is an example of how not to make movies. But you had to encourage Shyamalan and look what it got us, a raft of the most dreadful and over budgeted films ever crapped out by a human.Shameful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sentimental claptrap that is appalling in its attempt to lure audiences with the alien invasion theme and traps them in some sort of pseudo-psychological, emotional, family friendly, manipulative movie.There is so much wrong here that is well, just wrong. The absurd plot, yes the water as weapon thing (we do have some on our planet, one could observe), the lack of any grand scope that a premise of this magnitude requires and of course the constant lame lamenting.Everything interesting takes place either off screen or on a tiny little television, or even a transistor radio. There are many pretensions such as hiding the threat (Val Lewton) to enhance suspense, and that ridiculous psycho-babble about faith, fate, and coincidence.The most intelligent dialog comes from the children. The adults talk like they are reading from a Dick and Jane book. Short sentences with a staccato that lacks emotion or understanding. The actors are "placed" motionless in front of the camera like they are posing for Polaroids. This is filmmaking at its most self conscious.Finally, it uses the real crop-circle phenomenon and Ufology as exploitation with typical misunderstanding and misrepresentation. This is Shyamalan pretending to be Spielberg while ripping off Hitchcock. He should be ashamed of this money making sham if he considers himself a serious Director, if not, then take a bow for insulting your target audience and laugh all the way to the bank, at least William Castle did not take himself so seriously and that was part of his charm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Works up some eerie suspense but is ultimately unsatisfying...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the suspense is well geared to keep you wondering how on earth this plot is going to be unraveled--but when the windup comes it's a disappointment in more ways than one. I was with the story until the last fifteen minutes when the whole thing just fell apart--but along the way there are many things to admire.The performances are all first-rate, although I would have preferred a better, more appealing child actor than Rory Culkin as the son who reads up on aliens. He lacks the distinct personality of his more famous brother. Abigail Breslin, on the other hand, is a sheer delight in her role, reminiscent of Drew Barrymore in "ET". Joaquin Phoenix does a standout job as Mel Gibson's brother who can wield a mean baseball bat and Gibson himself is so subdued for a change that it makes you wonder if he really believed in the script. Phoenix and his relationship with the children provides some humorous highlights that are welcome in this kind of intense story. It's nice to see him in a more wholesome role than usual.The suspense is guaranteed to keep you glued to the screen until the letdown of an ending. Just be advised that there are compensations for keeping a sharp eye on the film before the disappointing denouement. M. Night Shyamalan can be praised for an original script and some smart direction--but too bad the religious aspects of the story were so muddled as to seem foolish. James Newton Howard's score is highly effective for this kind of story, especially toward the end.Enjoy at your own risk because along the way the contrivances show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much To Enjoy, But Somehow Short of the Mark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a documentary that accompanies the film on DVD, M. Night Shyamalan admits that SIGNS was greatly influenced by such films as NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and Hitchcock's THE BIRDS--an admission that will come as no surprise to any one who has seen SIGNS in the wake of those films. Although very different, all three have one thing in common: they ultimately focus on a small group of people fighting off an unnatural entity that attempts to invade their very ordinary homes.The story is an unusual mix of meditative religious and classic sci-fi elements blended together by Shyamalan's remarkable sense of visual style. Mel Gibson is a minister who has lost his faith in the wake of his wife's tragic accidental death and who now rejects the concept of unseen powers entirely--so he is nonplussed when his children discover a crop circle in his own cornfield. He remains skeptical even as television news coverage reports alien crafts hovering over major cities. But his denial is exploded when he and his family have a close encounter of the extremely nasty kind.The small cast is extremely, extremely good. I generally dislike Mel Gibson as an actor, but he has grown a bit since his macho-bravado BRAVEHEART days, and while he might seem an unlikely choice for the part of a failed minister he carries it extremely well. Joaquin Phoenix is perfectly cast as Gibson's younger brother, and the children--Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin--are flawless.What isn't flawless is the story. The blend of religious and sci-fi motifs is an interesting idea, but director Shyamalan (who also wrote the script) doesn't quite manage to hold them in balance, and ultimately winds up beating you over the head with the film's religious elements while giving the sci-fi elements the short end of the stick. I did appreciate the fact that the film builds suspense more by what it does not show than what it does, and I have no qualm with that--it's a welcome choice after such special effects overkill as INDEPENDENCE DAY and the like--but several of his plot devices smack of stereotype, and the film's conclusion is such a deus ex machina that it is not to be believed. There is indeed a great deal to admire about the film, but when all is said and done it somehow lacks sincerity and falls just short of the mark. Entertaining nonetheless.Gary F.

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies of 2002 so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A scary-looking monster is not needed in this movie. Just simply the fear of the unknown is enough. But just in case that's not enough for YOU, you will also get creepy sounds &amp; very frightening situations. I don't want to give too much away, but I will say that some of the stuff that is on the news on the TV in the movie is some of the scariest material in the movie. While all the things on the news in this movie are pretty freaky, there is one news clip in particular that I think really scared mostly everyone (maybe everyone) in the audience. So basically, don't go to this movie expecting to see a bunch of man-killing freaky-looking aliens. If you want something like that, rent "Alien".All of the actors in this movie do a terrific job. The kids were great, which was unexpected for me. And as for the director...well, M. Night Shyamalan is a genius. He is the Alfred Hithcock of our time (note that he is nowhere as even remotely great as Hitchcock, I was just saying for our time). And he is now one of my favorite directors. With "The Sixth Sense" and "Signs", he manages to make movies that can truly terrify the audience, and he doesn't use blood &amp; gore, he uses suspense and just simple horror. They are both only rated PG-13, and are both real crowd-scarers, which tells you this guy is really something.To sum it up: This is one of VERY VERY few movies that had me laughing out loud one minute, and then jumping out of my seat in shock the next. Lots of laughs, great acting, awesome directing, truly terrifying material, shock value, all the suspense you can handle and then some, what more do you want from a movie? Little kids saying the darndest things? Excellent character build-up? Drama? Well you get all of those too. "Signs" is one of the best movies of 2002 so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Signs is a mediocre movie with a fairly well developed storyline and a good cast that sadly didn't deliver as strongly as I hoped.After previously seeing the Sixth Sense and Unbreakable,I was expecting a lot from this,all of them being directed by M. Night Shyamalan,but this just didn't work as well as I had hoped,aliens seemed like a subject that he would have had a field day with,but the movie just didn't work out that well for me.I felt like the plot was trying to find itself the whole time,it wasn't sure whether it wanted to be a very character driven drama or a very gritty sci-fi,it jumps around from those two things way too often.I liked Mel Gibsons performance but he has certainly seen better days,however,Joaquin Phoenix performance was definitely the best and,though he wasn't in the lead,I still found myself caring for his character more than anyone else.A disappointing movie that didn't deliver as well as some of Shymalan's previous work,Signs has it moments but it's mostly a sci-fi that I feel people would be better off avoiding. When alien crops herald the arrival of alien invaders,a former preacher must fight to save his loved ones.Best Performance: Joaquin Phoenix Worst Performance: M. Night Shymalan</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sort of like this movie. Taken as a horror or science fiction movie, it might not live up to many of its peers, but if one takes the plot as a symbolic exploration of the struggle with faith, it has some value. This is a spiritual movie.Visually it's well done in an old fashioned style, and at times really scary. Sudden violin bursts and reveals makes for brief tachycardia episodes with good effect. The entire presentation gives a sense of isolation of it's characters, and the house where the main plot happens, which plays on the feelings of the protagonist. The suspense is good too, and the viewer is left wondering what will happen. Also, the gradual reveal of the past is well done, and not too overstated.But for me, the "punchline" of the movie, as it is revealed, is oversimplified and overstated. Without spoiling, I can say that things come together well - too well. Also, the final message of this movie looses itself in the mistake that the same message has when provided elsewhere by people of faith: it ignores the massive suffering outside of the single event that is valued and taken as a sign. All in all, worth a watch for the suspense and occasional thrill, but be critical of its message - this movie adds nothing in that respect.</fullReview>

You never even see anyone get killed. You just don't feel the danger. You don't feel the impending doom and invasion. You don't get that feeling at the bottom of your stomach when something bad is about to happen. Then, the aliens just suddenly decide to leave, and we find out that the aliens' weakness is water. In the end, all the pieces of the puzzle "fit together", like the little girl only drinking half the glass of water, the guy playing baseball, etc. The ending was very disappointing. Also, if the aliens' weakness is water, why would they be interested in earth, which is 70% water? And what about the water vapor in the air? Exactly. The tin foil they put on their heads to keep the aliens from reading their thoughts was funny. I give this movie a 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS - I thought this show was about crop circles, a subject i think deserves a lot more attention than it gets. So i watched it but instead, it's really about an alien invasion and there are some glaring problems in how the story plays out. Many posters have commented about how silly it was for water-averse aliens to come to a planet teeming with water. That didn't bother me because the aliens were after the humans and apparently decided the water was just a problem to be avoided. What bothered me is how at the end of the movie, the aliens were able to break thru the boarded up windows and doors of the farm house but couldn't break thru the basement door to get at the humans they wanted. They tried for hours but couldn't do it!! And then there's that bizarre scene where Mel Gibson gets to talk to his wife who's been literally CUT IN HALF in a car wreck. Talk about nonsense.Despite these liabilities i still give this a 6 cause i did enjoy the movie and it was suspenseful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant thriller that falls apart at the two-thirds mark...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan's third major picture is a tough film to review. The acting is great, the visuals get a thumbs up, and it's guided to its final destination by a deft filmmaker with a knack for creating suspense. Mel Gibson stars as former reverend Graham Hess, who has given up the faith after a freak accident takes his wife (ironic, as Gibson's next major film would be The Passion). Living on the family farm with his brother Merrill (the always excellent Joaquin Phoenix), they're scraping by and raising Graham's kids (Rory Culkin, the most talented of the Culkin clan, and Abigail Breslin). Unlike Harvery Keitel's character in From Dusk Till Dawn ("Do you still believe in God, Daddy?" "Yes. I'm just not happy with him.") however, Gibson's Hess has given up the faith completely. "There's no one watching over us," he tells Merrill.Soon, crop circles are showing up in his cornfields. His animals are going haywire. We know what's coming next, but what works about the film is the sense of claustrophobia the setting creates. A massive invasion is being launched across the globe, and not once do we ever leave the perspective of the Hesses, in their small farmhouse entrenched by cornstalks. Shyamalan understands that an audiences imagination will always scare them more than anything concrete, and teases us with shadowy figures. It works. The first half of the film is beautifully suspenseful. The first straight on shot of an alien is pure goosebumps.And then things kind of fall apart. Actually seeing the aliens, they look a lot less intimidating than we previously imagined. The level of tension drops. It's not gone, but it's nowhere near intense. Then Shyamalan goes for one of his patented switch-endings, which worked so well The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. Here, not so much. In a way, it's good storytelling in that the movie begins planting the seeds of its ending from the very beginning. In the end, the pieces are all in the rearview mirror and it is exciting to watch it come to fruition. The problem is a logistic one; it makes no sense. For aliens with such a weakness to even attempt an invasion of Earth seems downright hilarious. Still, while this stretch seems far-fetched, at least the movie works (for the most part). Unfortunately, we can't say the same for The Village. Good call, M. Night. Way to follow up a dud with a stinker.OVERALL SCORE: 7.0 = C+The score is inflated by an excellent first half and terrific acting that makes it worth watching. This is a movie that your senses will love, but your mind will reject. Still, if you can get past the "twist", you will have a good time. It's not nearly as good a film as the grossly underrated Unbreakable, but it is good. It just could have been great.PLEASE, M. NIGHT. NO MORE TWISTS!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty decent flick...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With an increasing fan base and a seemingly inherent penchant for making pictures that arouse discussion (whether it be positive or negative), M.Night Shyamalan seems to be making quite a name for himself in the Hollywood sphere and is well on his way to becoming one of the greatest directors in history. Not to say he's there yet, but in ten years or so, I truly believe that this man's soft directorial style will be considered genius and his uniqueness for suspense will be rated and compared to that of the master himself - Alfred Hitchcock."Signs" is a story about a fractured family's reponse to a bunch of mysterious crop circles that begin to enclose their small farm-house in a remote village on the outskirts of Philadelphia. The film progresses as crop circles begin to appear all across the world, spreading mass panic amongst the populations and indicating an extra-terrestrial threat who's intentions are anything but benevolent. Mel Gibson is excellent in his title role, and Joaquin Pheonix's brilliance shines through as always. Further credit goes to the two main children in the movie - one of whom is a future klidden Rory Culkin - who provide a sense of fear throughout the picture and allow a constant reminder of stakes.The film itself is pretty decent, serving up the suspense that we've grown to accept as the trademark style of Shyamalan himself, in his soft and elegant directorial style that has garnered critical acclaim for both this film and, especially, the Sixth Sense. And in its direction, Signs never falls short. For a fairly inexperienced mainstream director, Shyamalan has an immensely strong grasp over the medium and portrays this through his ability to direct both the actors and the action on screen. Once again, his choice of elegance in the most suspenseful and shocking of scenes is brilliant and strikes many different chords at once - surely a quality that raises him above many other directors who have attempted the genre.The cinematography and the editing also serve their purposes in the ultimate aim also - suspense - however, it is within a slightly patchy script that this film falls short. To be honest, it seems that Shyamalan's enthusiasm for directing the film was for more substantial than the enthusiasm he exuberated when writing the screenplay. For one, everything happens too fast. Whereas his other films have allowed it to play out a little longer, and let the crux of the story take as much time as the characters demand, the crucial parts of this film remain a bit too rushed. Perhaps more alien encounters would have dampened the suspense of the "what's gonna happen now" factor, however I still feel that despite all the film's other allusions to faith, fate and God (which were tied in rather nicely), we wanted to see just a little bit more of some of the good stuff - not the sappy stuff. That would have made the film perfect, but in the end we are left with what could have been as good as the Sixth Sense or any Hitchcockian thriller, but its in its steadfast simplicity in alien encounters that the film falls short. And don't misinterpret it, as I am fully aware that at certain points the alien aspect is deliberately overshadowed by the theological elements of Gibson's loss of faith and his hatred of God, but I still feel we could have been shown more.And I wish we were...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not a classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Signs" is a film that intrigues the viewer, but the climax is somewhat of a letdown, and disappoints.The story concerns a series of unexplained crop circles appearing around the world, and fears of an alien invasion follow. However the focus is on one family, made up of good performances from Mel Gibson, as a former Reverend, and Joaquin Phoenix, as his younger brother. Mel Gibson is a widower with two children, and the significance of this family is revealed when they find a pattern in their crop field.As mentioned the acting is decent, and the story tight and contained. The film is somewhat of a slow burner with the tension and suspense slowly building up. The characterisation is effective, as each character is involved in the climax. We see how each character, as well as the other people reacts to the events of the film. Memorable scenes include a claustrophobic basement section, which is particularly effective and frightening.The film is not too dissimilar to Spielberg's recent "War of the Worlds", but where that is large scale, and often breathtaking at times, "Signs" is small and compact, which often works well, as it keeps the story focused, and personal.In conclusion- "Signs" is a good solid movie, but does not offer anything particularly memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie better than anticipated,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read several of the reviews of this film. Some stating that the film copies some very well known films. While I agree that there are some areas of the film which are not exactly original ideas, I was not disappointed at all with the film. I felt the acting was superb, actually some of the best acting I have seen in a long time. Gibson was magnificent, Phoenix was very convincing, and the two kids were very believable. There were a few scenes in the movie which were slow, but I think this is mainly because there were some other areas that really made me jump out of my chair. I also feel that M. Night uses music or the lack thereof to increase tension for the viewer during the film which at times can make the film appear slower than expected. I was however left with a good feeling as I exited my seat after the movie was over. The final message of the film was upbeat and gave a sense of hope to those who have questioned their faith in a higher being.One concept of note which was very evident to my mind watching this film is the underlying question of what would I do in the shoes of these characters. I have read a review stating how nice it was to see the lack of any weapons other than a baseball bat throughout the film. As obvious as this lack is, I believe it was an intentional part of the overall writing in this film I was interested to see how M. Night would tackle a subject that has seen lots of screen time over the years, an alien invasion. His previous films spend a great deal of time delving the human emotional psyche, and this film does not disappoint in this regard. I thought it was refreshing to see how the concept of an alien invasion was treated on a more personal and intimate level than other films of a similar type of subject matter. The characters and circumstances that start to unfold during the course of the film are believable and realistic. The reactions of the characters to events as they occur are also very real and leave little doubt of the fears and angst being experienced. I would not be surprised to see at least one if not more of the cast recognized next March during the Oscar night for the performances in this film.Overall, I believe viewers expecting a Sci-fi thriller will be better prepared if they go into this film expecting a psychological thriller instead. Sometimes, what you don't see, is scarier than what you do. Ask the producers of The Blair Witch Project, they mastered that in their film, M. Night has already proved in his two previous films of note The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable that he is a master of this art as well. I give a standing ovation to M. Night for the work he and the cast did on this film, it will be a classic in time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The weak end destroyed a lot of the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, i will start with the positive aspects of "Signs": The film is well made, it don't need a lot of special effects to cover a weak plot or made the audience scary. It is a silent film, in which the horror of the unknown comes silent and slowly. The movie starts with the crop-circles, and then we realize very slowly whats going on with the aliens, the ships in the sky, the news from all around the world and the big question: Come there in peace or it is a invasion? It was a very good idea to focus almost the complete movie on the farmhouse and its residents. This is the way which most of us will probably witness the first contact (in peace or not). Sitting at home, listen mesmerized to the news on the TV and the radio and discuss about the aliens and what he will probably do or what we shall probably do. At last it clear up, that the aliens are not friendly visitors, and we find our family alone in its home, with almost nothing to defend himself...Until this point it was a very good movie, but at last the stupidity of the aliens is astonishing: Invading a planet, that was covered with approx. 2/3 of water... the stuff, that is deadly for the invaders. After i saw this movie i imagined a ridiculous scene: The aliens runs all over our planet... and it starts to rain... i imagined the Song "Little April Shower" from "Bambi" during the aliens quoting the Wicked Witch of the West from "The Wizard of Oz": "I'm melting! I'm melting! Ohhhhh...What a world! What a world!"The weak end destroyed a lot of that, what the first 95% very good runtime of the film had build up. In this film M. Night Shyamalan had unfortunately failed with his last surprising twist. "The sixth sense" and "Unbreakable" are both weaker in the beginning, but the end twists are much better than in "Signs". So the first very good 95% of the movie deserve a 9, but the last weak 5% only a 3. Overall i give the complete movie a 7 of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever dialogue, well shot, shaky plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did somebody forget that water makes up part of the earth's atmosphere? Water vapour is present in the air, we breathe it in AND out. So, I find it somewhat incredible that an alien whose Achille's heel is H2O a)would choose to land on Earth which has vast quantities of the substance -have they never seen the blue planet from above? b)are unaffected by water unless it is thrown on them or preferably smashed onto them by a sentimental swing of a baseball bat. However, despite these obviously huge discrepancies due to an idea which seemed - hey,like a pretty good idea, but wasn't really thought through (I blame this on the director) I think this film is visually brilliant. You weren't expecting that were you? Shymalan directs with startling self-confidence and this film is uncannily good for a paper thin plot. Mel Gibson produces a sterling performance as the Reverend and any film with Phoenix has to be a winner. So, ignore the flaws and enjoy the acting. Enjoy the dialogue, enjoy the suspense and enjoy the camera work. Enjoy the set, enjoy the shiver down your spine as you too feel the fear that the characters do. All I ask, is don't even try to think about the plot realism. Enjoy the film for what it is. It is excellent but oh so fatally flawed. It is disappointing compared to Sixth Sense but still worth watching. Perhaps you are left longing for a little more, oomph but watch it, just not twice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen several films made by this director. Although he obviously is talented I find it very hard to put up with the heavy depressive atmosphere that colors all of his films. All characters become wooden, depressive, humorless and irritating. Mourning, that this family is supposed to be feeling, is not at all the same as catatonic stupor or clinical depression as the director seems to imply. To appear to be suicidal is not the same as having a deep emotional inner world. I find this film simplistic, corny, clich and very predictable. The director's skilled, no question about that, but he's sadly lacking in humor and vitality. All his films are disturbing in an unpleasant way. Ingmar Bergman and many others do not give you a similar unpleasant feeling although they also deal with difficult questions. I've always felt that this director is very overrated.</fullReview>

It goes on about the title being stupid because if aliens could find their way to earth from a distant planet then they would be able to find their way around our home planet. Summed up in a couple of words this is sheer Cr*p. We can see bodies such as Mars and Venus through telescopes. But we needed to send robots, satellites etc. to scale the terrain. They send other beings to find out for the rest of them.Anyway, what effect does the title have on the film?

The death of the wife by a DWI driver, him just happening along at that time her dying words the psychic kids, the dunce brother the REV lost faith being a REV at the end, the luck that the kid had a asthma attack so he did not die of the alien gas attack, the story jumped around to much tried to be funny, scary, mysterious a love story all at the same time and none of it worked. SCARY MOVIE #3 was a heck of a lot better. and if the aliens were so advanced way one no guns, had to use circles in fields to set up their attack what no radios either, how did the ships talk to each other, flashes of light. I am a spiritual man and was some what pleased by that side of the story but give me a break what was this about and I hope they never never try a sequel, it will ruin this one for those he liked it and those of us who did not will turn up our noses even before seeing it.

		<fullReview>"Signs" is not a very good film, and certainly nowhere near as good as "The Sixth Sense". Despite having been written and directed by M. Night Shyalaman, there's nothing that differentiates it from any other mediocre thriller.Basically, it's about a farmer (Mel Gibson) and his brother (Joaquin Phoenix) and his children (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin) and what happens in their lives when they discover crop circles in their cornfields, when similar things start to happen all over the world, and when eventually it's thought that alien life is responsible, and that the aliens are hostile, and so on and so forth. It contains a few soppy scenes between Mel Gibson's character and his brother, also a flashback to a scene with his wife, although unlike in "The Sixth Sense" these were not well-timed to as to make you feel sentimental and almost start to cry, they were totally misplaced and came across as dull and slow-moving. (Sorry to keep going back to "The Sixth Sense", but like many people I only watched "Signs" because I was so impressed by Night's other film.) There is practically no suspense at all, although the actors all try their best they're struggling with the dodgy material, the kids were very adorable but no Haley Joels and the alien life forms, when we finally see them after ages of shadows, look very much like humans - somebody wasn't very imaginative. There isn't even one of Night's famous twists at the end, just a deus ex machina, which is very disappointing. And although much is left unresolved (aliens plan a takeover, then suddenly depart, the boy is saved, oops, that's the end?) there are no mysteries or questions for you to think about afterward. It comes across as a film trying to be more than it is. It's just an average alien movie, nothing special. Leave it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A series of strange events that make some sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs is about a family of 4 (A dad, his brother, a little girl and alittle boy) living in a farm house and all of a sudden one night the dad of the house (Mel Gibson) spots someone on the roof of their barn and him and his brother (Joaquin Phoenix) go to see who it is. Then after trying to scare it off the roof they find out its not a human at all. So after about 15 minutes through the movie strange things start happening like crop circles in their field and their dog starts freakin out so the boy stabs it with a fork (Ouch a ba ba ba). Then the Mel Gibson character goes into the field at night and finds an alien stalking him. Then on the news there's sightings of these strange beings around the world. Then the dad goes to some guy's house and there's an alien in the guy's pantry (wtf?) turns out they don't know how to open doors so he trapped it (but somehow they know how to break into houses with boarded windows) Soon after when the dad returns home, aliens start trying to break into their house and they have to hide in the creepy basement. Bla Bla Bla an alien tries to kill the little boy so the uncle smacks the alien with a base ball bat and a glass of water spills on it. The End. About 3/4 of this movie is actually somewhat scary, up until you see what the aliens actually look like then you realise they're just skinny tall green guys. It turns out the aliens can't stand water so if you had an army of little kids with super soakers you could take out the entire race of these stupid aliens. I gave this movie a 5 simply because the endings so hoky poky.</fullReview>

Night Shyamalan tries to tell us?Are they hostile?Maybe our planet will be attacked some day.People are worry about this.On the contrary,M. Night Shyamalan show us the other side.The Extraterrestrial eventually save the boy's life,that's amazing.Obviously,M. Night Shyamalan tempts to change the people's mind on the extraterrestrial,that's the point.There are some other movies like X-Files or Taken touching on the extraterrestrial.All those movies are trying to unveil the mystery,the movies are very fantastic and brilliant.I really like to see,but the topic remains controversial.Do those unknown life exist?Hostility or Amity?

		<shortDescription>No coincidences?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe what it comes down to is that Shyamalan is brilliant at storytelling. He can make you believe the unbelievable, and take you to places you rarely think the mind can enter. He's not afraid of long sequences, because he knows it will just make his audience lean in for a closer look. His writing style brings a new meaning to the word elegacy. If you have not discovered this brilliant director, you must do so now. I myself am writing screenplays and am about to direct an ameautur film. He is truly inspirational on this account. Many complain about how disappointing they thought "The Village" was, but that's because they are not allowing their minds to do what it wants the most: to learn, to see, to expand boundaries. Sure, the village might not be a horror flick. But Night's flowing script lets the audience think in new and unexpected ways. Signs taught me to keep my eyes open to the possibility that "there are no coincidences." And The Village might be nominated for Best Picture, as the word is getting around,which speaks for itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was just not what I was expecting for a science fiction movie. I don't understand all the hype over this movie as the plot was weak and the acting was uninspired. After watching the movie, I wondered how aliens with super technology could not get through a locked basement door. It is baffling how aliens that could travel millions of light years in space could lose a war in one night to a planet,which in contrast to their own world, had to be primitive. Another flaw is in the fact that although water is a deadly toxin to them ,they decide it's a good idea to take over a planet that is 2/3 covered with water. If you were looking for a new world wouldn't you pick one that was 2/3 covered with arsenic? Smart huh? The last insult to my intelliegence occurs when an alien has abducted Rev. Hess's son and is about to kill him with poison gas. Rev. Hess's brother takes a baseball bat and beats the alien and the alien just stands there making grunting sounds. Once again I'm astounded by the sheer stupidity of this superior alien being. With the technology this species must have, where are the death rays and laser guns? I mean the EBE isn't even smart enough to run away when getting beat to a bloody pulp with a Louisville slugger. If you aren't bothered by these holes in the movie and just want to see a Mel Gibson performance, then you might find some enjoyment from viewing it. If you want an intelligent, well conceived, sci-fi movie, then look elsewhere.</fullReview>

Naturally, it isn't just a prank, which is not surprising as that would have made a lousy film. Then it is the lights, the aliens. And then their onslaught upon Earth. But no, that's really not it either. This film is really a jigsaw of information to the viewer, a jigsaw of the complex type that doesn't turn into a logical image before that last and final piece has been put in. And that's when you see the divinity of it all! - That is, in case you don't belong to the group of people who just see fortunate or unfortunate coincidence. It's really all about seeing the bigger picture, and while doing so, this film manages to keep the toes curled, the gut chilled and the back rigid on the viewer. It's been a long time since a film got to me the way this one did. I warmly recommend this film to anybody out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have rented the film two days ago even if it has been gone out in the cinemas for so much time. I premise that they are ten months that I have begun to watch the movies in original language (since I am Italian I have seen them always doubled) to learn better the language English but now I do it because I have noticed some differences among the original one and the also doubled to level of emotions but especially for the atmosphere...obviously I use at the same time two subtitles. About the film "Signs" I have to say that I like the first part enough kinds because I am a fan of Mel Gibson but it is a little animated, but when the protagonists are barricaded in the house I have been really, really in tension. It seems very realistic and I have also been afraid...for an instant I am not more felt only in the house as if there were presences. I like the representation of the alien ones because don't seem puppets or something produced to the computer, thinks thanks to the direction. I have remained disappointed only of a thing. I have seen a long time ago the film "Scary Movie 3" and there was a comic call to the film "Signs." For all through the film I have believed that there would have been a more direct contact (almost a form of conversation) with the alien ones and that Mel Gibson begged them for the restitution of his child abducted as it happens in "Scary Movie 3." Generally the movie has hit me a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do not waste your time with this movie!!!Spoilers ahead.OK, this is a bad, bad, bad movie. It's a pity that it has decent cast, though they don't act up to their reputation. I have read some reviews here, many of them concerned with the fact that aliens come to a planet full of water but they are allergic to it. OK, this is the most obvious mistake of the guy who wrote this lame script. But, come on:1. aliens are sighted around the globe, floating above major cities... and above Mel's farm (he's playing a priest who's lost his faith);1*. they are guided where to land by some crop circles, as a map; i wonder, how did they get to Earth in the first place? Did they do circles on the Milky Way? or they just followed the principle "Ahead, matties!" and just happened to stumble across Earth, since they know not any system of coordinates?2. sure enough, they have a purpose: to attack a farm in the middle of nowhere and poison the people... it makes sense... neah!3. get this: "THEY HAVE PROBLEMS OPENING THE PANTRY DOORS" says Mel, and he knows what he's saying: the aliens travel a long way to earth, come to the door and do what? THEY BANG ON IT TILL GET TIRED; even a band of cave men would have much more efficient than the technologically advanced aliens, who can't even break down a door4. well, point 3 makes sense if we think of the fact that the aliens have no knowledge of clothing as well... nor any other gadgets... and "they have come to fight hand to hand combat, to avoid usage of nuclear weapons..."5. Mel's son could not have been more annoying; his lines are very philosophical and sophisticated; no kid would ever speak like that (nor would any normal adult - only one with a huge penchant for the dramatic might)6. are you wondering what the action is in the movie? NONE !!! Admittedly, there is a fight, where basically everybody stands still, including the alien who is clubbed by an angry baseball player (with a very low frequency, however)7. are you looking for special effects? wrong again! there are none! the alien ships are just bulbs against a black background; and the so called alien is a guy in a sponge suit which you can get for halloween (actually, yours might look more realistic)OK, I've said my part, just to add to the critiques of the other reviewers who have deservingly hated the movie. I really can't find any redeeming traits for this one.Do not waste your time with this movie!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very slight film from a one hit director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SIGNS is memorable only in that it fails on so many levels to entertain. This is a film worthy of a PG rating, whether or not it was given one. The two HESS children were amusing in that they were more attuned to the danger than the two adults; that they possessed the instincts of animals. I suppose I should not have been surprised that the adults would be less likely to believe what was going on around them. Nor should I have been surprised that Father GRAHAM HESS, experiencing a loss of faith, should be the last one to accept the possibility of an alien invasion.On the whole I felt the problems with SIGNS centred about the two adult male leads. First I did not feel that the former FATHER GRAHAM HESS, especially as played by Gibson was capable of showing either empathy towards others (the two key scenes involving the poor girl who wanted to confess, and the unfortunate man who had fallen asleep at the wheel, before hitting Gibson's wife). After listening to the girl in the pharmacy he tells his family never to be with her alone; and after hearing Ray's sincere apology, Gibson's character is incapable of acknowledging this).I thought that the director's judgment was terrible to not letting Gibson lose it totally around the final dinner table, but chose to cut to the beginning of the home invasion. However nothing I had seen would convince me that Gibson could lose it, and break down, as an actor.[POSSIBLE SPOILERS)So when the film concludes with Gibson putting the cloth back on, I was not so much surprised, as I was bewildered: his character, at least, as played by Gibson, seemed to be a very unlikely candidate for priesthood!As to Joaquin Phoenix I could not believe this was a man capable of launching a baseball 507 feet! I found it difficult to swallow watching Phoenix in GLADIATOR going up against a far beefier Russell Crowe (who at least looked the part).The final sequence in which Merrill has to swing a baseball bat seemed to a token attempt to appease the audience who had seen no combat at all... despite the son's warning that most of the action would be hand to hand, so that nuclear weapons would be avoided.All in all, I thought the level of invention and execution was on par for what I would expect of a made for TV film (and many would be far more entertaining than SIGNS). Some lame moralizing and philosophising instead of good old fashioned suspense, mystery, thrills and chills!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay.I'm just going to start by saying that although I really disliked this movie, I'm sure there are many people in the world who do like this movie, so I'll try not to anger you guys too much.Anyway, this movie really did let itself down. I'll admit, at the start and even to the middle of the movie, I was a little edgy. Shymalaan does the creepy camera angles very well and he has a great use of colour and tones. BUT this movie had a really difficult plot. It was a plot that has been done countless times already, the whole "aliens attacking earth" idea. The thing with this film's aliens were that they were the stupidest aliens ever. I mean, if these aliens were scrutinizing Earth as a place to harvest, then you'd think they'd do a little bit of research, eh? Think that they might realize that Earth is like, 60% water and that could hurt them? Nope, they went ahead and invaded anyway.The only thing that saved this movie from being a complete flop was the acting. Mel Gibson was, impressive, not brilliant but impressive, and Joquain Phoenix does the brooding hulk very well. The kids very uncannily creepy too.But the plot let this movie down, and overall it was not worthwhile at all. There is no major logic in this film, there is a subplot involving the dead wife which really doesn't add too much to the plot, only to the characters, which are fairly unlikable anyway, and the film seems to be too concerned with "faith" and other such religious subplots that it makes for slightly dragged out viewing. There was heaps of material in this film that could have been used in more constructive ways, but instead the film just piled on more little meanings and thoughts. I expected a thriller. I got a fairly dragged out, driveling film that really didn't have much meaning in the long run. And as for the "twist"...well, there wasn't one of those either. I guess Shymalaan tried to make up for it with "The Village".</fullReview>

Gibson's brother in the movie is one of the best characters. Swing away! The female police officer performs well too. For such a serious movie, there's a lot of fun moments.

Yet, this movie is immensely suspenseful. I did not sleep well the night after I watched it. Therefore I can state that it had some impact on me. It is funny, too, considering the wonderfully innocent behavior of little Bo ("Why don't they have girlfriends?").

		<fullReview>The film "Signs" was released in 2002 which was written, directed, and produced by M. Night Shyamalan. "Signs" takes place in a small farm town of the family of a retired reverend. The reverend Grim (Mel Gibson), along with his two children and his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), lives on a farm where unusual events involving crop circles have begun to occur. Suspense builds and aliens invade earth, leaving the family to discover a way to fend them off.The plot of the film includes aliens invading planet Earth, but the underlying theme of the movie is whether or not things happen for a reason or that there are no coincidences. Unfortunate events occurred which caused Grim to retire from the Catholic Church and live as a farmer. The beginning of the movie explains that Grim believes that there are no coincidences and that there is no one watching Earth from above. Merrill believes that there is hope that things will turn out for the better and events do happen for a reason. By the end of the movie, the idea that there are coincidences and that things do happen for a reason is clearly portrayed. "Signs" could be the ultimate masterpiece created by Shyamalan. The plot of invading aliens combined with the theme of coincidental action gave way to a film full of action, suspense, humor, and emotions. In many films, aliens are characterized as corny looking, but in "Signs" they were respectfully portrayed. Location of a farm town was perfect as crop circles are often associated with extra terrestrial invasions, which made the dialogue and costumes appropriate to the setting. It is hard for me personally to find anything appalling in this film, as everything flowed smoothly from one scene to the next. This is definitely the kind of movie that will not only entertain us, but also cause us to think about why things happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute tripe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't help it, there is a spoiler here but the concept of 'spoiling' this film is hard to grasp, I could barely do a better job than the script.This is without doubt the worst film I have ever seen in my life, bar none. Having read the other review of it I felt obliged to set the record straight. It's hard to know where to start plunging the knife into this bloated turkey but suffice to say when the credits rolled at the end the reaction of most of the cinema audience was laughter and a few groans. Not quite what you'd hope for with a sci-fi horror film. The story concerns a preacher (Gibson) who has lost his wife to an improbable car accident and who starts to notice some strange UFO activity around his farm. What follows shortly after is tense, well shot and edgy. Then it takes a turn for the absurd. After a fleeting glimpse of an alien you are expecting the film to be quite entertaining but it swiftly becomes silly. Gibsons house comes under siege by aliens and we are told that this is occurring worldwide. Yes, homes of bad actors are under siege, but not just them it seems the aliens are after ruining birthday parties and hanging out above Mexico (they just love that, don't they?). The budget must have been about $5 for special effects because we are treated to five lightbulbs in a dark room to represent a terrifying UFO appearance above cities. Never mind, the plot will carry the film through won't it? Unfortunately not. We are mysteriously told that 'an ancient form of warfare' is winning out against the aliens. The newsreader presumably not revealing what this is in the hope Gibson will be killed off before he can make any further rubbish flicks. Sadly, Mel and his little brother suss it out for themselves. You see, the aliens have invaded a planet covered in water where it rains a fair bit but alas are killed by water. It seems they sunk all their scientific know-how into building UFOs but didn't stop to plow any thinking into rainwear technology. A simple glass of water in the face is enough to kill them, hooray! It is a shame that someone didn't throw a glass of water into the face of whoever first proposed this script otherwise it might have been a watchable movie. As it stands it is without doubt a total joke. The confused and pointless attempt to bring Mels flagging religious faith into the plot is also misguided and adds nothing to this unpalatable mess of a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A despondent film with monotone dialogue and emotion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan's SIGNS is plagued, as was his predecessor, The Sixth Sense with an X-file like mood. Scully and Mulder had to be searching that corn field. Emotions lie low in this despondent film. Let's face it, Shyamalan has a gimmick and it seems to work well with Bourgeois audiences. The film is very goofy on the most part. The film holds our curiosity but fails to deliver any punch. It seems to be dwelling on some philosophical idea of the human condition in the 21st century. It explores the faith and family of rural America in a quick changing world. A corn raised family residing in an Andrew Wyeth painting.The directing and lighting in the film fail to inspire any originality. It leaves one to believe that Shyamalan was under contract to make another film; "Oh, who cares...give them cheap alien gimmicks and a corn field....we'll get you Tom Cruise or Mel Gibson....it will make millions..."And it did....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Earth is being invaded! Everyone grab a bat!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some minor spoilage is contained herein.Perhaps it is a testament to M. Night Shyamalan that he can put us on the edge of our seats over nothing at all. In "Signs", he masterfully creates strong suspense inspired by a not-so-strong antagonist. When we think of hostile aliens invading Earth, we may picture such scenarios as "War of the Worlds", or some other variation of the "death-ray toting, destroy all human life" scheme. "Signs" decides to take a different approach. But never fear; what these aliens lack in sophisticated technology, they more than make up for in navigational ability. Crop circles, of course, are not elaborate hoaxes, but actually road maps for alien invaders. From what facts can be gathered in the movie, they roughly translate to "Attack somewhere around here". In movies such as "Independence Day", the aliens wisely began by destroying major population centers such as New York and L.A. The effect of their elaborate crop beacons in "Signs" seems to be to direct invaders to small farmhouses across the world. I don't want to pretend that I'm smarter than an alien, but perhaps there are better indicators of major population centers than crop circles (Hint: Look for the big bright lights).The point of my seemingly incessant rambling is to note that this movie lacks believable baddies. From our very first glimpse of the aliens in a very bigfootesque home video, we almost want to laugh at them. It's just hard to be frightened by creatures that can easily be subdued with a blunt object.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are you Kidding? (Possible spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grossly disappointing. I was looking forward to this M. Night film thinking I would get an intelligent treatise on the crop circle phenomenon/Sci-Fi flick. No such luck. What I got was a sophomoric maudlin (very slow) story about a 50'ish minister who becomes angry with God for taking his wife in a car accident. (Now there is a mature spiritual person dealing with loss.) As a minister does this man think that he would be exempt from life's inherent dangers and possible tragedies? Should he react like an emotional child not getting his way? Please, this juvenile silly plot is laughable as drama. As a sci-fi flick it has so many holes it's ridiculous. Aliens averse to water travel to the water planet? They did not have this figured out till they got here? They are strong and fast enough to leap to roof tops yet are incapable of avoiding a guy swinging a baseball bat? A wooden door is an impenetrable barrier for them? Why would they simply not be gunned down by police/military? Or firemen with hoses? The point of the crop circles was navigation? They can travel interstellar space but need crop circles to get around here? Does any of this have a shred of logic? I don't mind suspending believability for a good yarn but this very poorly thought out excuse for a B movie with stars borders on absurd. The Hitchcock imitations are everywhere, and yes after the tenth close up of a water glass we get it, water is significant! Please, this is self indulgent gibberish, not sci-fi, mostly just unbelievable and smarmy drama about one man's sophomoric spiritual crisis with a very weak unresolved ending, the "are you kidding?" kind. M. Night did a masterful job with Sixth Sense, but I can't imagine what he was thinking here and why no one said..Are you kidding?.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>underrated director, hes better than the mcguffin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just read your reviews, and whilst you clearly liked the film, i think you may be giving Shyamalan less credit than he deserves. Signs was a brilliant film, but a poor twist which he could have done much better. Apart from the whole the earth is made up of 80% water and they run around in crop fields that must be full of water...it wasn't a twist that you come to expect from Shyamalan.He's a much better filmmaker than you appear to be prepared to give him, Sixth Sense and Unbreakable are brilliant because you are concentrating so much on the brilliance of the films, that the twist does come as a shock. Signs however, whilst incredible beautiful, does not have those subtle clues that create the twist but instead a desperate idea...and by comparing Shyamalan to Hitchcock and saying its only a Mcguffin is to completely lessen the work of a fantastic filmmaker. Hitchcock admitted that the mcguffin was a plot device to progress the film along, and whilst these aid the film, its Shyamalan's status as an auteur you guys need to consider, why do you assume that just because his other films are great you should let this one be put down as simply another Hitchcockian McGuffin. Quite simply, Shyamalan's film is beautiful and fantastic and the boy's asthma and the girls phobia of water was a poor plot device and a twist you could see coming really. Shyamalan is a better director than this film suggests and it should be praised for its first hour and 30 minutes and criticised for its use of the McGuffin...this is unsubtle film-making from a guy built around subtlety.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a suspense thriller ....it kept me in suspense wondering when it was going to thrill me. The little girl was the only good thing about this pointless excuse for a movie. The line "Help me, I'm melting! I'm melting...what a cruel world. Who would have thought that a little girl could destroy my beautiful wickedness." Or something to that effect, comes to mind (the wicked witch from the Wizard of Oz). How scary is an alien who gets trapped in a kitchen pantry, and takes the better part of a day and a half to break through a wooden door? It's a shame we didn't get to see how long it takes for one to punch it's way out of a paper bag. Then again, that would have made the torture for the audience last longer. I ended up saying "so what" after seeing this movie. Very disappointing. Not on par with the other movies he's put out. I'd Rather have my eyes pried open like that guy in A Clockwork Orange and be forced to watch Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, Killer Klowns From Outerspace, and Plan 9 From Outerspace. for 72 hours straight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven but enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs is somewhat uneven, delivering a well directed, superbly acted and genuinely creepy film that is let down by an ultimately disappointing story.Signs offers a unique approach (in my experience) to the 'aliens invading' formula of your typical summer blockbuster. It is an intimate, almost claustrophobic story, told using just four central characters while the bulk of the actual 'horror' that is key to the narrative (the invasion itself) unfolds in the outside world and almost totally off-screen. This approach enables Shyamalan to impress in the audience a heightened sense of helplessness for the characters as they are so isolated from the world outside and is a very effective vehicle in telling the personal and emotional side of the story. Once again Shyamalan's understated style in bringing chilling moments to the screen is the film's biggest highlight. I won't spoil these for you now, but rather than dishing out cheap scares the film does manage on occasion to ooze a satisfying creepy vibe thanks to some great camera work, particularly the lighting, and a good score. Gibson and Phoenix really sell the story with great performances, while their young co-stars are endearing and enjoyable to watch. The girl playing Bo in particular with her disturbed angel character brings again a wonderfully understated yet extremely satisfying performance to the screen.The story is ultimately a let-down, weak and unsatisfying in its climax with some pretty blatant plot holes and inconsistencies. Still, with some great camera work, performances and a genuinely engaging first half, Signs is worth a rent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Signs" Of Good Things To Come?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took me 2 weeks after "Signs" came out to finally go see it in the theaters and I was TOTALLY excited. I'd heard SUPER good things from some of my friends so I couldn't wait.The movie hadn't even STARTED, I mean it was still just the opening credits and I was already jumping in my seat. It was really sad. But my friend that came with me and my family thought it was just HILARIOUS. Anyway, I thought the movie was AWESOME. M. Night Shyamalan just TOTALLY delivered again. It made me love him even more. It had me crying in parts, it had me cracking up in parts, and it DEFINATELY had me screaming in parts. I don't think I've really jumped as much as I did during that movie. Even if my friend was grabbing me and whispering "Boo!" in my ear during the most RANDOM scenes. What an exhilerating experience.I so enjoyed the film. It touched on the subject of religion and God without being "preachy" like some films can be. And it also reminded me of a throwback to the old alien movies they used to pop out all the time.I also thought the acting in it was awesome. Mel Gibson did a good job as the faithless minister. And Joaquin Phoenix. What can I say about that man? He almost MADE the movie for me. He was so funny and he did such a good job. I love that dude. Plus, my friend and I had a pretty fun time oogling him and nicknaming him "Fox-Ay Phoenix". Dorky? Sure. But it's true.All in all, I would definately have to give it up for "Signs". Awesome movie from M. Night Shyamalan. It scared me like no other, it made me cry, and it made me laugh hysterically. Just all around GOOD entertainment if you're looking for something to watch. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Needs to be seen in the theater</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are movies that come along every once in awhile that are so powerful in the theater, but upon a second DVD viewing it doesn't work at well. Signs is the best example of this I have ever seen.Spoilers IncludedI saw this movie on its opening weekend in 2002. When the movie ended, I could not get out of my seat. I literally had to sit there for a minute and take in what I had just seen. No movie had ever done this for me before. Granted, I am generally a fan of older movies, so I never saw most of my favorites in the theater. However, seeing Signs in the theater is an experience I won't soon forget.The movie starts out with Mel Gibson living with his brother and two kids on their Pennsylvania farm. We learn his wife has died. Has anyone else noticed Mel Gibson's wife has died in at least 8 of his movies? Early in the movie, crop circles appear in his corn fields. Make no mistake, though, this movie is not about crop circles as the previews lead us to believe. This movie is about an alien attack in the mold of Close Encounters. Where the movie's power comes through is in the reveal of the creatures. The first time the creature is seen, it is as a silhouette on top of the barn. Honestly, you can't even tell anything's really there until you pause your DVD. Shortly after, a leg is seen when Gibson's character shines a flashlight on one of the crop circles. I am not a huge Shyamalan fan, but the moment in which the creature is finally seen is filmmaking genius. Because of what has happened earlier in the film, we are searching through the bushes trying to get a look at another leg, or an arm, then BOOM, the creature appears in full view across your screen. At this moment, the whole theater lurches backwards about 3 feet. At the end of the movie, there is another great reveal of the alien which I fortunately saw coming, but that just made it cool instead of scary.The power of these moments is enough to make Signs one of the best movies of the past view years. The movie, however, is not without it flaws. I'm so tired of the child yelling "I hate you" to the parent for no obvious reason. Apparently, Hollywood screenwriters have different kids from the rest of us, because I have never heard a kid do this, but it happens in 90% of movies with children. The final showdown with the alien is a little silly, but overall this movie will leave you scared, scarred, and full of emotion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie 100% after watching it 10 + times. The director &amp; this theme of movies happens to be my favorite. Anyways, M Knight has made the movie so you can be really suspensed while moving w/ the movie. It's not a dread while you wait for the actions of the aliens. It's actually a progression of events while you focus on many parts of the film. [all major characters, connections, theory, logic]. If you have an imagination, watch this movie. If you drone on based realistic movies, this could be the one to open your eyes wider to appreciate human understanding of the unknown. This is a nice movie that goes beyond the average 'o no there are aliens &amp; this is what we will do'. This film questions your belief and faith if you let it.</fullReview>

Wasn't it a little far-fetched for that alien who got his hand cut up by Mel Gibson to come back for revenge on the family? That totally made me rethink how good of a movie it was. Also, the movie is similar to M. Night's previous two because it is very slow moving and takes a while to develop. It also cannot be ignored that water plays a big role in this movie, much like that of Unbreakable. The more I see of this movie, the more I realize how stupid it was. It can be enjoyable because there are laughs and there are some scary scenes. Overall I would give it a 3/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A throwback sci-fi thriller wrapped around a human condition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked this movie. It has been given a split decision by the viewing public but has been better received than Unbreakable. It has been difficult for Shyamalan to score another box office knock-out since The Sixth Sense largely because it was such a huge hit that it was a quantum leap. This is similar to Bob Beamon's record setting long jump in Mexico City, 1968 Olympics that shattered the previous record by almost two feet when mere inches or fractions of inches are the usual progression. Beamon spent the rest of his track and field career just trying to approach it, let alone surpass it. I hope Shyamalan's career does not have to endure the same kind of relentless expectation. Shyamalan's movies are now compared to that original leap which is why a lot is missed in his two works since. But I don't believe The Sixth Sense is his standard for making his movies. Each one is its own entity not seeking to match another. It will be interesting to see how The Village is received. I think the mark of Shyamalan's genius as a filmmaker is that you can't fully digest his work in a single sitting. Even though he borrows philosophy and technique from previous filmmakers, Shyamalan displays his own passion for brewing these ingredients into his own stew.Signs is funny and scary. So we know that crop circles can be and, to the best of our knowledge, are man-made? That doesn't mean that alien spacecrafts can't use them as navigation makers. Furthermore, where did we get the idea from anyway? How would you react if you suspected that aliens were assembling in your backyard for something yet to come? We know very little about them, how much do they know about us? What are their intentions -- exploration, conquest, enslavement? What are our inferences -- friendship, hostility, doom? They are obviously technologically advanced of us in space travel and seemingly biologically advanced in locomotion. How do we get out of this one? Coincidently, we must keep the faith!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I quite enjoyed Signs.Judging by the money spent on special effects I presume it wasn't supposed to be a science fiction movie. (one rubber catsuit, a field of rustling corn and a $20 baby alarm)The priest loses his faith when his wife dies. As a priest, we might have expected him to understand that people do die and not to throw his dummy out of the pram so readily. Presumably had the priest been Catholic he wouldn't have had a wife and there wouldn't have been a film.Anyway, Mel makes the most of things and gets the message across that bug eyed greys shouldn't mess with us because we've got the holy water.Mel puts in a typically enthusiastic performance to raise the story above the corn. There is a good blend of suspense and sentiment. Little Abigail Breslin as Bo, is used to good effect to charm us and take our minds off being unnecessarily critical of the storyline.Point to note. Do not advise that priest, carrying large kitchen knife, be used as emissary to possible future alien landing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eclectic Script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They're everywhere! Lurking in the cornfields, caught in the pantry, scaling the roof, stalking down alleyways, and up in the sky... You name it.The script seems to borrow a little of this and that from at least a half dozen other works. These include "The Birds," "The Thing," "Day the Earth Stood Still" and "Night of the Living Dead." So this plot (described as "drama/horror/scifi/thriller") connects crop circle phenomena with UFOs and aliens --though I don't recall such tangible connections being made before -- anything to create some tension.It's H. G. Wells meeting Steven Spielberg (and those precocious kids are definitely Spielbergian) for a sincerely acted piece. Its impact will depend on the degree to which one's willing to buy into all those divergent reference links. Mel Gibson certainly was, and delivered his role with the seriousness of enacting Hamlet (which he reportedly wants to play). He rather passed his audition.  </fullReview>

One interpretation -- That the character is indeed Catholic and the story takes place in an alternate reality where Catholic clergy are allowed to marry and have families. This might be more of a stretch if Mr. Gibson hadn't made his pre-Vatican II - style Catholicism such a part of his public image.In this alternate world which has gotten so far off track spiritually (by letting Catholic priests marry, for example, and presumably other equally horrible things), Mel's priest character is punished by an angry deity with the the gruesome death of his wife and the rest of us by means of a terrible human-harvesting raid by malevolent demon-like beings straight out of Hell, er, I mean, the Galaxy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one huge fatal flaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie would be good except for one flaw that, for me, makes it completely irrelevant and unwatchable. If you haven't seen the movie, read no further, because this will definitely spoil it for you. The aforementioned flaw is that the aliens only apparent weakness is water. OK, water... Um, what?? WATER!!?? If these aliens are the least bit intelligent (which they probably have to be to organize the invasion of a planet and construct the means to transport beings to that planet) don't you think they would realize that 70 - 75% of the earth's surface is covered with WATER. Also, what were they going to do when it rained?? This is equivalent to us humans attempting to colonize a planet with huge oceans of cyanide, where it frequently rains cyanide. The only explanation would be that the aliens have never come in contact with water. This is highly unlikely though, as they seem to be an advanced society and there are only so many compounds that you can make out of molecules, the building blocks of everything, and water is one of the simplest and most stable. Also, wouldn't one think that these aliens would survey earth and its contents before invading to determine if an invasion would be beneficial? Sure, M. Night Shyamalan does a fine job with almost all of the technical aspects of the film and I was right there with him in enthusiasm until I learned that the aliens' weakness was water. I especially liked the build-up of suspense and the few startling moments, as well as the fact that the aliens chose to invade not only the cities, but some rural areas too, which is very realistic for a sci-fi movie. These almost make up for the water-weakness, and if you can get past that HUGE flaw, you will enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense, but not quite as atmospheric and thrilling as Shyamalan's other works.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SignsGraham Hess is a former priest, who has lost all his faith in god when his wife died. Now he is living with his 2 children and his brother, they're living outside a small town running a farm. One day "Signs" starts to appear in their crop fields, at first they think it's made my local people playing a joke on the, but as they watch the television similar "Signs" starts to appear all the world. While this is going on Graham Hess is continues to struggle with the death of his wife and her last words "Tell Merril to swing" and "Tell Graham to see".I am a keen admirer of Shyamalan's amazing talent to build up an intense atmosphere in his movies, especially "The Sixth Sense" gives a fantastic view into his perfectionistic feeling for movies. And while this movie is still an admirable effort, it has more flaws than the other Shyamalan movies i have viewed, it's not nearly as thrilling and the awaited twist is a bit sloopy, but the movie is still very intense most of the way. And it does have a lot of Shyamalan's trademarks, i just think that the story itself is not nearly as engaging and interesting as the others, i think Shyamalans twist is also more predictable and expected than in his other movies, there are simply revealed too much for it to really shock. You see some of it coming most of the way, but there are still some things in the end that does indeed make other things in the movie make more sense, but it's nowhere near as powerful and outstanding done as in his earlier movies, but this is still a highly original movie that brings what one expects.I am sure that this is also one of the movies that will divide the general public opinion, the movie can really be understood two ways. Are they all living in some sort of dream? Or is the movie about faith in god and the fact that everything one way or the other, does indeed happen for a reason. I believe in the 2nd. My primary reason for this is that the movie just doesn't make sense if you understand it as a dream, too many things are revealed and too many things wouldn't make sense. If there were only 4 characters in the movie it would make sense, but there are many more, and it would all be too realistic for it all to be a dream. However the 2nd thing is what seems more real, and also what makes most sense, and i have a strong confidence that it is what Shyamalan wanted to say with this movie. "Never lose faith, everything does happen for a reason".The directing is definitely strong here, i think Shyamalan have once again proven that he is one of the most talented and interesting new directors, and i do look forward to seeing his new project as i find his style very engaging and interesting. Also i think he has his own style which is good, you can feel that its Shyamalan that have made the movie, and the original feeling he brings adds up for a good experience in watching his movies, he is really good at creating an intense atmosphere in the movie itself, even if it doesn't work out as well here as it have done in his other movies. But who can blame him, Sixth Sense was almost a definition of a perfect thriller.Another thing i have admired Shyamalan for earlier is his apparent skill to make child actors seem so reliable and realistic in their way, a place where many fails because children naturally aren't very experienced and generally also more immature and nervous, but this is the 3rd movie in a row where Shyamalan makes all of his cast play some very convincing roles and there is hardly ever a flaw here. Especially Joaquin Phoneis is fantastic, and i will always have the image of him with the helmet on burnt inside my eyes.To sum it all up a bit, i am as said a big admirer and fan of Shyamalans special style, for me he is one of the best directors i have seen since Carpenters early days in building up an intense atmosphere, and even though this movie doesn't come close to the perfection of The Sixth Sense, it's still a solid and thrilling movie that will surprise you, even if you think you have the ending predicted. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Get this out of your head now: Sings is not about aliens. It's not about crop circles, it's not about an invasion.If you are expecting to see green men with lasers taking over the earth, you'll be disappointed. If you are expecting conventional presentation, you'll be very disappointed.You have to look at this movie not as a depiction of a potential reality, but more like you'd look at impressionist art. We don't call Van Gogh a horrible painter because Stary Night wasn't realistic, do we? The acting is mellow, a low sad tone that conveys a sense of loss. It is quite poignant, and I think all of the actors did an exceptional job.This movie is about a single man's faith. Nothing more, nothing less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signs: A Movie For ALL Reasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me begin by saying that I really enjoyed this movie. _______________________________________________________________________ Mr. Shyamalan's conceptual and, to date NOVEL, use of the phenomenon of crop circles as a sign is thought-provoking. The manner in which Mel Gibson's character, Graham Hess, is presented: a minister having lost his faith, due to the death of his wife, is really quite good in terms of the "slow tease". The children's characters are intelligent, emotional and convincing. This film shows a real sense of a "familial connection" and interaction in the way the characters all relate to one another.____________________________________________________ M. Night's measured revelation of the several seemingly-unrelated "coincidences" in THIS film, contrasted to the manner in which he presented and revealed the characters in "Unbreakable" and in "The Sixth Sense," is coupled with information about each character in the first few scenes of the "back story." It establishes of the individuality of each character (Graham's brother, son and daughter), yet gives the viewer merely a glimpse of each of their "quirks". Myself, having studied the works of Dr. Carl Jung, noted psychologist and recognized "father" of the foundations of most of Behavioral Psychology, I can see - throughout this film - the many instances of Jung's "Synchronicity Principle" in action. Just as in real life, an individual can only "see" what THEIR OWN INTERNAL "settings" permit them to see. So, too, does M. Night reveal this story: by gradual alteration of the VIEWERS own "filters of perception". **Watch this movie AT LEAST one time, just for the overall story (simply because it is very well written, well-paced and "snapshot" of single-parent family life in this ERA).** Then, watch it again and this second time around, LOOK for the revelations AS THEY ARE REVEALED: tell me that you have never experienced an incident of SYNCHRONICITY! You may have been unaware at the time of its occurrence, as to its meaning, but through time, distance, and/or a re-orientation of your own thought processes: "NOW it all makes sense".Thank you, M.Night, and please keep up the good work! It is my hope that you are ALWAYS able to fulfill your "NEXT VISION," and that you will continue doing what you LOVE to do (and which you do so well). It's also my personal belief that your abilities (whether or not you are TRYING to), tap into the UNDERLYING currents of Humankind: OUR Collective Consciousness and the Collective UN-Conscious. (...because this movie wasn't REALLY about the aliens...-wink-) AND it IS good Movie-making!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are we in a rut, or what??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was/am a huge fan of The Sixth Sense and have seen it several times with each viewing revealing another nuance of movie-making artistry that makes me want to anticipate the next Shyamalan outing with eagerness.Not wanting to wait for the release of his follow-on (Unbreakable), I sought out his previous film, "Wide Awake," and was nearly equally as pleased with what was a very touching and enormously likeable film which is highly recommended for his fans, and families looking for a good movie to stimulate thought and conversation. You can see in this earlier work, unaffected by the glare of wunderkind adulation that now accompanies Shyamalan's ouevres, an innocence and attachment to the angst of children that makes us all long for those times in our own jaded lives. Then came Unbreakable, and I found myself disappointed because many of the same tricks, devices, locations, actors, and derivative audience manipulations were again used that we had seen in his better earlier works. I could see a pattern developing that to me said "move on" before the arthritis of cliche overwhelms you.Then came "Signs," and I knew the shark was hurdled. [Spoilers follow.] I won't belabor the many flaws well documented by others (of which I'm in entire agreement), but a few pointed remarks are in order. I'm one who likes to suspend conventional belief for the sake of entertainment as much as anyone, but I will not become stupid for the experience. This movie has all the same flaws as Unbreakable, but goes one level further (lower?) by asking the audience to accept the crashing stupidity of aliens technologically advanced enough to travel through space, but astoundingly incapable of breaking down flimsy barriers and not smart enough to know that this planet is mostly made up of water which is highly toxic to them. BTW, having a glass of water thrown at you is one obvious thing. But have you ever wandered about at night through tall grass (let alone cornfields while making those ridiculous "signs" now well known by all to be hoaxes) in a misty humid evening. You will be drenched. Aliens will die. And if that fails then hocking a loogie constitutes a pretty close substitute. C'mon, even a heavy handed Mel Gibson can't overcome that nonsense.So now I've seen seven minutes of "The Village" (with same devices, actors, etc in the mix) and I've already heard some speculating that this is Shyamalan's homage to Little Red Riding Hood which just fits in perfectly with the many cliches he's established heretofore. I really, really hope it's not that obvious and shallow. But I can't quite shake the feeling that we are in a deep, deep rut here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever wondered about all those crop circles, or who made them, or why? Neither have we, but if you're just itching to know, this pretentious loser of a film will clue you in. Written, produced, directed, and, in part, actually filmed (here we go again!) by M. Night Shyamalan, this dreadful tubesteak of a movie would have you believe that aliens, who periodically come to Earth to harvest humans, and are bright enough to navigate across tens or hundreds of lightyears, actually need roadmaps scratched in the dirt once they get here to help them locate human population centers! You GOTTA be kidding. As if this weren't enough, we poor humans can eavesdrop on their sinister plans by using AM band baby monitors, and, as it turns out, can defeat them by using squirt guns and garden hoses! To say that this strains credulity would be an understatement of near-Biblical proportions. Mel Gibson stars as a recently single, recently defrocked minister who's trying to raise his two young sons and, by all appearances, his brother as well. Okay, we'll buy that, except for the fact that Gibson, who is normally a fine actor, goes through this entire movie displaying all the range of emotion of a heavily sedated hospital patient. Even the use of the word "movie" is something of a stretch, as "Signs" is very little more than a three act play that almost certainly would have done better on the live stage. Shyamalan evidently thinks of himself as some sort of latter-day Hitchcock, employing as he does scenes and camerawork that are very Hitchcockian in appearance -- but not substance. Take our word for it: Hitchcock he ain't, nor can we, in good conscience, recommend this film. To be blunt, it stinks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great suspension thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is far from (beyond) a trivial alien thriller. It's more about a man's journey of his faith than alien invasion of our earth. We don't see alien ships or weapons, we barely see aliens in full figure (a little at the end), yet it was really scary. I think that's because the movie sets the whole story on a single family on a rather isolated farm, making the experience more personal and much closer to the audience; Shyamalan did a wonderful job building up the frightening atmosphere around the house and the corn field. The Hitchcock style suspension techniques are everywhere. For example, when Merrill went out of the basement to check if the aliens are go, yet the camera didn't move a bit focusing on the empty door, that 10-second long silence and wait was so tense and terrifying; what really scares you is not when you see aliens face to face, rather it's when you don't see them yet expecting them.Of 'course the movie is more than just a horror story. Reverend Graham lost his wife in an accident, he also lost his faith to God. Holding his son Morgan who was struggling in asthma attack and nearly dying, he ranted "I hate you (God)!". Yet deep down in his heart he held hope, which kept him fighting for his son's life and the family's safety. The experience completely turned him around. The movie asks the question: when we face unknown evil force in our lives, would we still have faith in God, believing someone up above is always watching over us?One thing I'm confused about is those unexpected humor scattered in the movie. That little conversation between Hess brothers right before they prepare to rush out to scare the alien away seemed a bit out of blue and awkward. Having Merrill wearing the foil hat is also unnecessary.Overall it's a wonderful movie and I enjoyed it a lot.7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was real good it had a lot of action in it. I would rate Signs 8 out of 10. This movie made me want to keep on watching this freaky film. I liked this movie because of the aliens in it and I liked the aliens because you never knew what they looked liked and how they acted. This movie had real good affects over all it was a good movie. My favorite people in the movie Signs was Gram and Uncle Merill. The movie was slow but was mysterious like I said before. Once I watch this I didn't want to stop watch it and the same thing with Dracula 2000. but Dracula 2000 was my favorite movie ever. So if you want to watch this slow but mysterious film rent it or buy it. Be sure to tell me if you liked it not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There were brief moments - very brief moments - of enjoyment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are major spoilers in this post, so if you mind, for heaven's sake, scroll on by. (Also please take note: The following is merely my opinion, and is only meant as such.)This is probably one of the most derivative movies I've ever seen. I recognized, in it, bits of X-files, War of the Worlds, Night of the Living Dead, and Morons from Outer Space.Gibson, who for the first 2/3 of the movie has evidently been directed to behave in the "Kevin Coster No-Expression School of Acting" does a good job of portraying a zombie. His brother -- once the audience is even allowed to know who this guy is -- looks like he could be Gibson's son. In fact, I was mystified by the relationships among these two and the children for the longest time. I even thought maybe the female cop was Gibson's daughter. Then, toward the end, Gibson shows a spark of animation -- as "spark" is related to "atom bomb explosion" -- then lapses back into zombie-land.These aliens were definitely not the sharpest knives in the universe, coming to Earth, which is predominantly made of water, to eat people, who are predominantly made of water, then choosing the SMALLEST humans, who would probably make a few snacks, but not a real meal. Evidently the aliens, while they were "probing" Earth for information had overlooked the fact that water does them irreparable harm. Also, if they can be done in with a baseball bat, what about missiles? Do missles just bounce off? How about a shotgun? And what was up with wood being a problem for them? Wood is DRY! Cornstalks have water in them -- not wood planks.One good thing about this problem with water -- Seattle was safe; so, most likely were coastal cities and the cities around the Great Lakes.As a writer, I had a real problem with the viewpoints used in this movie. The audience, for example, is left hanging at one point, staring up a staircase for what seems an eternity while indistinct noises came from upstairs. This wasn't suspenseful -- it was boring. It's no wonder the characters slept for 12 hours. (12 hours? How could they sleep at ALL with aliens trying to break into the house? Did Gibson's character, perhaps, have a narcoleptic response to extreme stress?)There are several instances where the audience doesn't even know as much as the characters. This works fairly well in a mystery novel, but if an author wrote something like, "The father walked upstairs to investigate. There were noises. The stairs were empty. More noises disturbed the silence. The staircase was still empty." the novel would never get past the slushpile.Then, for no apparent reason -- at least not one that had anything to do with the plot -- we are treated to the alien's viewpoint as he merely stares, in the best tradition of heroines being menanced by a monster, while water descends, sending him to his doom. We, as the audience, are thinking, "Ah - THAT saved them some special effects money!"I'm not sure why the writer wanted us to know this invasion was similar to War of the Worlds. I'd already had that thought and knew that whatever killed off the aliens was going to be something very simple and stupid. And just what did those people in the "remote villages" who discovered how to defeat the aliens do that was so mysterious? Did they have primitive garden hoses? Why didn't the TV people just say, "WATER HURTS AND KILLS THE ALIENS!" You'd think this would be news to share, not keep to one's self.I was somewhat offended at the implication that the audience was so simplistic and willing to suspend their disbelief that they wouldn't notice all the movie's problems. I could go on and on about the inconsistencies, bad writing, bad directing and so-on, but you're probably already nodding off.Suffice to say, I won't be rushing off to see the next movie this fellow does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Signs of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most unfortunate films events of recent years was the unexpected success of a little-trailed Bruce Willis ghost story movie. Mr Moonlighting's career had been in long, slow decline apart from the blip-boost of his Pulp Fiction cameo, but 'The Sixth Sense' put him back in the big league, temporarily at least.For many of us seduced by the hype of TSS, and especially the write-up for its emerging writing talent - the exotically named 'M Night Shyamalan' actually sitting and watching the movie was a bit of an anticlimax. Fairly leaden performances, portentous script and a fairly hackeneyed and well trailed twist at the end.However it seemed to seal M Night's reputation as a screenwriter of note, I guess based on box office alone, a reputation his two subsequent films have not borne out. But where Unbreakable was merely dull, Signs is basically appalling.The idea has taken shape that this guy is a genius and up to handling the challenge of being director, writer and producer of a single project. He acquits none of these well in Signs. Despite having two of the great action-event movie producers riding shotgun; Marshall/Kennedy, Signs is so unbelievably leaden for the first hour-and-a-half that my finger hovered tantalisingly over the stop button.Most infuriating is the artifical and non-naturalistic 'style' that someone (I suspect M. Night) has directed the actors to use. This combines an utter lack of emotional range with non-normal response to situations, interspered with sickly outpourings of inner belief or the characters acting as mouthpieces for cod philosophy.Two horrendous moments spring to mind in the film: the first, where Gibson and Phoenix sit watching television coverage of the alien encounters, Gibson launches it a 'there are two types of people speech'. This rambling, inelegant and absolutely unprofound observation of whether people have faith or not to see them through is treated as a brimming eyed revelation by Phoenix's character while the audience thinks 'huh?'.What is even more cringeworthy is that you can feel that the writer thinks - wow this is really great writing. This is so far above the crappy naturalistic speech of most Hollywood movies. No, it's not: it's turgid, badly written, inconsistent and vacuous pandering to your fanbase and the constructed image of yourself as a 'great writer'.The second occasion is the 'when your were born' speeches that Gibson regales his children with as the aliens are breaking into the house with the intention of eating everyone for breakfast. Pointless, artifical 'moments' of profundity when any honest and naturalistic attempt to capture that moment, that emotion would get its true fear and horror.Actually, let me change my mind. The most truly awful moment of this film is when Gibson gets to exchange some final words with his wife who happens to have been cut in half by a car but is still totally aware and communicative seconds before slipping softly into death. This is not how people die, let alone how they live.It needs not me to add to the chorus of derision about the basic plot of the film and its alien invasion theme. It's not so much as picking holes in the plot as attempting to create something coherent and logical out of it. Naked aliens that cannot stand WATER? Better sack the alien commander responsible for researching the invasion then. The idea that they might travel 500 million light years to be defeated by a garden hose is totally risible.Of course M Night devotees will say the story is actually a PARABLE which mundane viewers expecting a story and real characters are missing. The water can be viewed as baptismal, the aliens as our internal demons, the house as the isolation of the soul, the whole event as a proof of faith. Yawn. There is more insight into the human condition in 5 minutes of Scorsese or Alan Parker than in hours of this simulated, meretricious garbage which is intended to appeal to our vague spiritual yearnings and need for pasteurised morality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miracles or Coincidence?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Gibson stars in the sci-fi thriller "Signs", which was written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan ("The Sixth Sense", "Unbreakable"). "Signs" primarily takes place on a farm in rural Pennsylvania. Gibson plays Graham Hess, a man who lives with his two children Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin), and his brother (Joaquin Phoenix). The plot begins when Graham finds a crop circle in his field. He thinks it's a prank, but when reports come in from around the world about similar crop circles, it's obvious that something more is happening. The next day, Morgan hears some strange noises while playing with a baby monitor. Graham later hears the same noises and sees something in his field. Reports come over the television that lights are appearing in the sky close to the locations of the crop circles. With all signs pointing to an invasion by aliens, Graham has to protect his family. Throughout the movie, we learn things that allow us to understand the characters. We learn that Graham was a reverend, but since the loss of his wife, he has lost his faith. We learn that Merrill was a baseball player, Morgan has asthma, and Bo has some obsession with water. This leads us to the critical intention of the director. The central idea of "Signs" is that everything happens for a reason, even though that reason may not be apparent. Many instances that happen will ultimately affect the outcome of the movie. This movie also asks the question, `do you believe in miracles?'What I like most about the movie is how the director sets the mood and timing. There are many instances of sitting on the edge of our seats waiting to see what happens next. Camera angles and lighting are used effectively to create suspense and fear. As for timing, the elements of the central idea which are spread throughout the movie all come together in the end to affect the outcome. I am a huge M. Night Shyamalan fan. Anyone who liked and understood his previous films will definitely enjoy "Signs".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as 'Sixth Sense', much better than 'Unbreakable'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS The three M. Night Shyamalan films I have seen have relied heavily on the use of prolonged suspense. This tactic may seem to some very slow and boring, and this was certainly the case with 'Unbreakable', one of the worst films I have ever seen. As is often true, the first is the best and 'The Sixth Sense' is by far and a way the superior film of the three. But 'Signs', on first time viewing anyway, is worth the watch.Shyamalan does manage to create tension here, in parts, but it does veer towards dire 'Unbreakable' territory too. The film's best moments are undoubtably the scenes where the aliens are present BUT off-screen. This leaves room for audience imagination and this is always more nerve-wracking than any visuals on screen. Therefore the most effective scenes are when Gibson is wandering around in the corn at night, with hidden aliens around him, the alien trapped in the pantry scene and the start of the final attack, as the trapped family hear aliens scurrying over their house.But like so many films down the years, as soon as the supernatural menace is revealed to the audience the tension drops considerably and consequently the film is less interesting. The representation of the aliens is so stereotypical. The thin, green figure that is clearly based on humans. The whole sentimental thing fails to convince too. The 'swing away' finale is cringeing viewing and the recollections of the children's birth could have been much more subtle. The discussion on the couch that people are separated into two categories, those who believe things are meant to be and those who simply think it's coincidence is valid and reasonable, but not really appropriate in the context of seeing what could be alien spacecrafts on the TV. What has coincidence got to do with anything? It's whether the images are real or not that should be the discussion. It is only in the 'swing away' climax we realise the reason for the inclusion of the coincidence discussion.However I don't want to rip into this film that much because I did enjoy much of it. And it does have one genuine moment when the audience jump in shock and that is when the dog suddenly barks at the kids when they are playing. Typically the most effective shock does not include the human-like aliens, and that is no coincidence.</fullReview>

The basic premise of aliens invading is okay, but these must be the most inept or peculiar ever. Ignoring the fact that they are up to no good, yet again, (why can't they be normal like ET, as a superior species might be) these seem to be the only invading force anywhere without military might or weapons, but just use a bit of gas &amp; their superior presence to bowl people over. But they haven't figured on a glass of water. Oh my!!!The acting is good, particularly the two leads, but they are all lost in a tedious script &amp; surprisingly little action or tension, which could have been better as an episode of Outer Limits or Twilight Zone.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had great hopes of this movie. I thought "The Sixth Sense" was very good and "Unbreakable" sustained my interest until the end. However this was one of those films during which I just kept looking at my watch to see how much more I had to sit through. The underlying themes were isolation, faith, and attitude to life. The isolation would seem to contrast with other impending disaster films in which humanity is drawn together, but this self-absorbed family seem to be experiencing their own crisis. A loss of faith is something I've witnessed many people experience, but once lost it takes extraordinary events to restore it, so I suppose the film was accurate in that respect.The acting was OK with Mel Gibson playing against type, but a different lead actor might have brought a bit more to the role.There were a few decent shock moments, but on the whole I found the film exceedingly dull.</fullReview>

Gibson sleep walks through his part and the rest of the cast mug their way through it half asleep. As for the aliens, they come and they go, mainly go.Perhaps someone will explain why creatures that have supposedly travelled through space and at light speed cannot get through a wooden door that Gibson has jammed up. Or why the visitors are so well organised and technically competent that they come to a planet filled with water which they apparently can't cope with.It's all fairly laughable and it makes you feel you could immediately make a much better movie. In fact it could be a real inspiration to an aspiring film maker who seeing this load of old garbage can only be encouraged. File this one under "crap."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILER-ALERT***Imho, this movie sucks. And to be able to explain why it sucks, I have to explain the plot. Don't read further if you haven't seen it yet...Signs starts out like any other alien movie. Signs of alien life appear all over the world and an invasion seems inevitable. But in fact this in not a movie about aliens. It is a movie that deals with religion and belief. Towards the end this becomes more clear and you get the feeling that you've been watching a sci-fi version of the bible. All logic has been shoved aside and has been replaced with religious symbolism.The main problem with this film is that the symbolism takes over the story. The plot seems thin and weak, but eventually becomes clear. Everything is a metaphor. Aliens are apparently dumb-ass creatures, who are unable to open doors and can easily be killed with water, but in fact, aliens are demons. This becomes apparent when you realize that the aliens are not really invading the planet. They are here to get us, the humans. These aliens are actually being killed by some kind of "holy" water. The whole goal of this movie is to make you believe in the presence of a god, no matter what happens. The last scene, where Mel gets his faith back, is the most important scene in the movie. I, however, choose not to believe, and that is why I really dislike this movie. It felt like religious "in your face" propaganda, while I was expecting a good sci-fi movie. I'm disappointed, because I actually liked "Unbreakable", M. Night's second film...My rating: */*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst films I've seen in 2003</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Signs on DVD and didn't enjoy it very much.I thought the characters were very gullible to believe that aliens are the answers for anything they can't think of a more believable explanation for. Throughout the film I didn't really believe that the aliens were real. They didn't look believable enough and just looked like men/women dressed up in costumes.This film wasn't scary except for one brief moment when I felt a bit scared but the rest of the time I thought they should be braver and face the so-called "aliens".I didn't like the characters in the film as I thought they were too gullible and the men weren't brave like I thought they should be.The story was very slow and I was waiting for something exciting to happen throughout the whole thing.I hope that other films by the same director aren't as bad as this and I hope he doesn't make the same mistake again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An overrated insult to the intelligence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many movies out there that are extremely overrated. Sixth Sense, a masterpiece by writer-director M. Night Shyamalan, was overrated; it was good but not that good; it had many holes in the plot. However, when it comes to being overrated, Signs is in a category all by itself.Take away Mel Gibson and replace him with an unknown actor, and this is a B-movie. Take away the popularity of the man who directed it, and this film would have been as easily forgotten as Xtro and Not Like Us. The popularity that Sixth Sense enjoyed gave Signs one hell of a boost. The fact that Signs has a few scary scenes has swindled people into thinking this is a masterpiece when it comes to horror flicks.The movie is about a group of aliens making crop circles around a farmer's cornfield. Later in the film, we find out that these aliens, who so far are behaving like pranksters from outer space, are planning to invade Earth. Apparently making crop circles is their idea of warning people that an attack is coming. Imagine American troops tracing crop circles around Iraqi farms, and you get the picture.One of Signs' scariest moments takes place when a group of kids at a birthday party see an alien walking down the street. The shocking footage is filmed by someone at the birthday party. Horrifying indeed. But if you use a little logic, you immediately realize that the alien is walking around naked and without weapons. So they are planning to invade Earth naked and weaponless? Suddenly bigfoot seems a little scarier, and the aliens in Independence Day, who were dumb enough to not know about antivirus software, seem a lot smarter.Spoilers ahead, and I mean real spoilers:Eventually the invasion begins. This is the point where an alien breaks into Mel Gibson's farm. Yes, attacking farms is an alien's idea of a planetary war; it seems the aliens are in desperate need of corn. But Mel Gibson and his family are going to fight back. They get in the cellar and lock the door. Apparently these aliens can travel faster than light, but they don't have firearms, and they are afraid of locked, wooden doors.Then, early in the morning, the alien seems to be gone. It seems the alien is afraid of sunlight. When the family, who has been through one hell of an ordeal, turns on the television, they realize that not just one but all of the aliens are gone. Why? Because humans discovered that water can harm them. Yes, water can harm them. Yet they were stupid enough to walk around naked. Imagine a group of nudists hanging around a lava-marinated volcanic eruption, and you get the logic of this.The scariest thing about Signs is the fact that not even movie critics saw all the holes it has.</fullReview>

At times I thought it was too simplistic. At times it seemed intense. I thought the acting was poor. It was unbelievable because of the way the son seemed too much in charge of the father and the apparent stupidity of an alien race that didn't recognize the water situation. And the predictable use of the uncle's baseball background was one more problem. Yet the movie was attention holding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The comments from the people who actually enjoyed this piece of garbage are truly hysterical! The prevailing attitude seems to be that if you didn't like this film, you just didn't "get it". The insinuation behind this, of course, is that critics of "Signs" represent the lowest common denominator of modern moviegoers: those unthinking robots who are still amused by the explosion-heavy and plot-light action flicks of the Jerry Bruckheimer ilk. If this is the truth, then I guess I break the mold. Few people get more joy from all out assaults on Hollywood cliches than I do. I would much rather watch Jean Cocteau's "Blood of a Poet" than the latest Vin Diesel movie. I adore films that are RADICALLY thought-provoking and original, yet despise any film as logically incoherent as "Signs", regardless of how "cerebral" it might be. The notion that one must ignore the blatant plot holes in this film (which, frankly, indicate utterly INEPT screenwriting) in favour of paying attention to its "deeper meaning" is nothing but a cop-out! As far as I am concerned, "Signs" beats "Plan 9 from Outerspace" for the Worst Film Ever Made hands down! Don't waste your time with this laughably pathetic picture!* out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was strongly recommended to me by a number of people (usually a bad sign!) so, when I saw it for sale cheap, I bought it.I quite enjoyed the first half. Quite tense, a few mild surprises, Joaquin Phoenix trying hard, quite promising. But what happened in the second half? It turns into a thinking man's 'Mars Attacks' crossed with 'Independence Day'! I was glad when it ended.And what about Mel Gibson? Not only has he lost what acting talent he had, he is hardly recognisable as 'Mad Max'. Is he going to stand for Pope when the present incumbent finally snuffs it? I think he should!If you haven't seen, then don't bother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This time he's done it.... sadly not quite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm delighted to see that Shyamalan is indeed learning, evolving, and seems to have the right kind of ambition.I'm among those who disliked the 6th sense, because I found it too manipulating, full of cliches and contrived acting. And awful Hollywood syrup music (heeewwww!). But I recognized a talent, as the story was great and some of the direction aspects were very interesting and refreshing.I was looking forward his next opus, hoping this guy would improve, but obviously "Unbreakable" was mainly an attempt to make another hit, and despite the -once again- great story, it was quite a boring movie.This time we have something really interesting.First, we have the first really frightening movie since a loooong time.I wouldn't watch it alone, and very few movies have this effect on me. And no, the 6th sense was not one of them.Secondly, we have a tuneful, tasty and intelligent direction, that does not insult my intelligence by loudly pinpointing everything that matters. No, one actually has to be patient, observe and think about what's happening. This is meditative direction. I like it so much. Outstanding pace, served by a brilliant visual composition and perfect editing. The narrative is not "illustrated" by the movie like in 99% of modern productions, the narrative IS the movie and vice-versa. Aaaaah.This is where Shyamalan's ambition is clear, as this kind of direction is not aimed at the brainless and shallow modern audience. No, he wants to please those who think, who observe, who actually take the time to get into the narration and fill the gaps. Those who read books, or look at decent movies. So he's trying to escape the commercial hype around his first opus. Great.Then there is the acting direction. This is very clever stuff. OK he's been borrowing a lot, mainly from Kubrick (Shining) and the Coens (Fargo). Nevertheless, this work is really impressive. And miracle (;-)), Gibson actually played the game! Thanks God, he did! Maybe he was not really aware of what Shyamalan was doing with him, who cares as the result is here for us to enjoy. Phoenix was a pretty clever choice as he's a natural for this kind of stuff. He does know what it's about, and fills exactly the right space. I'm curious to see what will be Phoenix's next works. I think he should meet Cronenberg sometime.So Shyamalan seems to have made his choice: to be an artistic director, there with the Coens, Kubrick, Cronenberg, Lynch and others. Well he has good chances to succeed. But it seems he still has to gain more independance.Because I can't believe that he actually thinks that the way he uses music is near to adequate (from an artistic point of view). Please. The best parts are the ones without any music, and thankfully there are plenty of them. Good. But when there IS music, a much better one would be needed. We have lots of good movie composers nowadays, just pick one.And I can't believe that this incredible happy ending, with its pedestrian, dull moral subtext, is what he intended with this story that until then was packed with dense, clever, subversive subtext. I HOPE he did not. I HOPE he's going to gain more independance and become a real free artist. Then when he talks about faith, he'll do it HIS way until the very end of the story.I know there are a lot out there who'd love him to keep on making soapy, sweetened, viewer-friendly flicks like "the Sixth Sense", but I'm among those who are expecting much more quality, challenging stuff from such a talented person. Would "Signs" be... a sign that it's going to happen? Have faith ;-)!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great film but very misunderstood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to see lots of gore and explosions and aliens with ray guns go watch Independance Day or Aliens because that's not what your going to get by watching this film. Many people who disliked this film called it "boring" or "far fetched" well everyone is entitled to their opinions but it seems nowadays many movieviwers expect to see the meaning right there. Well for films like Signs you have to be willing to look deeper. It's about family and faith not about aliens coming to blast the human race into oblivion. The aliens are only a part of the film. I personally thought Signs was a very enjoyable film. I thought Joaquin Phoenix was great as Mel Gibson's brother and provided good comic relief for the film and I personally don't know why some people had a problem with Shyamalan himself playing the role of Ray it was only a minor role.(WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD)The film was quite suspenseful and at times frightening the scene in which Merill is watching the porteguese tape it has us dying for antocipation of our first glimpse of the alien creature and Merill's reaction was just classic.Many People complained about the ending I thought the ending was quite good People had a problem with Merill using a baseball bat to subdue the alien creature well..they live on a farm what other weapon was available??? and it made sense since Merill played baseball and Ghram's wife told Merill to "Swing Away"(again you have to look depper into the meaning) and Bo's glasses of water she left behind which helped defeat the alien along with Morgan's Asthma which was killing him but in the end saved his life. I thought it was rather clever and like Mathias said much more clever then anything you naysayers would have thought of. Signs was a great film 9/10 go watch it and see for yourself but know what kind of film you are watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SUCH a disappointment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First and foremost, I absolutely loved M. Night Shyamalan's prior movies. I think his cinematic eye, attention to detail and sense of dark humor is normally very refreshing. HOWEVER, I cannot see how anyone would consider Signs even a "good" movie. Shyamalan's prior movies gingerly lead you through a maze strewn with clues which would eventually bring you a surprizingly satisfying apex at the end of the film. This film just led us through a corn field.All of the elements that you thought would matter at some point - didn't. All of the characters that you thought would matter at some point - didn't. The dramatic twist of a ending didn't happen. The scifi movie that was in the commercials didn't happen. I suppose the acting was good considering they had such paper thin characters to work with.I sat with my mouth open during the last half of the movie because I was amazed at how bad it was. Then the end added insult to injury. This was simply a weak remake of "The War of the Worlds" (perhaps those of you who actually liked Signs should watch it). That's it. Such a disappointment!</fullReview>

His choice of camera angles and the subtle way in which he films his most horrifying scenes are remarkable. But the last scene spoils all these efforts.

I knew nothing about this movie going in, apart from that it had Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix in it - usually that would be enough to make a good flick. This time, however, all that transpired was about two hours of constantly waiting for something to happen. I'm not going to waste my time with an outline - after all if the people who made it didn't bother giving it a recognizable plot, why should we bother trying to find one? Maybe I missed the bits that were "scary" or something, and I DEFINITELY missed finding any real point in this meandering odyssey to nowhere.

		<shortDescription>Signs is definitely overrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CAUTION: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSWhen I went into the theater to see this movie, I was expecting an X-Files-esque alien story, with lots of shadow play and psychological suspense. I thoughtthere would be a lot more buildup from the crop circles than there is. I was disappointed. Signs has potential, but that's all there is. This movie tries to be a family story, a sci-fi thriller, and an underdog-overcoming-the-odds tale. Each of these genres has its merits, but not when spliced together. Signs has many good points, such as the first, say, half an hour. Unfortunately, M. Night Shyamalan tries to do too much with it. In the course of the movie, I started to care less and less about the characters. I didn't care about their fears and past misfortunes, and I certainly didn't care what became of them. I also began noticing more than a fewinconsistencies in the plot, not to say blatant hypocrisies. WARNING:SPOILERS ARE APPROACHING! First of all, if the aliens melt when they touchwater, wouldn't the nighttime dew in the cornfields kill them? What about the fact that water vapor is in the air? Wouldn't their skin melt? Why are they kidnapping creatures that are 80 percent water? Why are they attacking aplanet which has two thirds of its surface covered in water? Another problem I have with the monsters is that they have mastered interstellar travel, yet they can't figure out how to break into a boarded-up house. Finally, (SPOILER!SPOILER!) one of these supposedly advanced beings gets beaten by a guyswinging a baseball bat. A freakin baseball bat!!! Has anyone even heard of guns? Why didn't the army try shooting them, for God's sake? My majorproblem with Signs, however, was the interjection of mushy spiritual crap atmoments of suspense. Family film parts absolutely kill suspense, and beat its corpse with a stick. As I say, there are good parts of this film, but the director should stick to doing one thing at a time, and not try to please everyone all at once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a huge movie fan. I've seen well over 3k movies, if not more, and I just don't get it. Shyamalan is really bombing here. He was reaching on Unbreakable, though I can understand some of the intrigue there. I was still disappointed in Unbreakable after seeing his first major film success, The Sixth Sense, and in looking back I can see that he seems to be trying to be the next Spielberg in the age when Stephen was stuck on children's stories and fantasy movies. But Signs is really not all that good. Okay, it's got some okay acting, some nice photography, decent editing, reasonable sound work, but sheesh, it isn't all that. It moves relatively slowly, even for a 98 minute film, it fails to build all that much suspense, until the end, when some of the shots are quasi-unique, but it's just too family like for this type of really suspenseful subject matter and I was quite disappointed after seeing two sources, including all the people at imdb.com recommend it so highly. It's not that great a movie people. I once held M. Night in high regard, but now I plan on staying away from any future projects he might undertake. Sorry, M. Night, but please find a different direction. This one's not working. About the best I can give it is a 4/10.</fullReview>

I'd hoped, wished the director would have had an new, original view on crop circles. Alas, it was the aliens again. There were other clich's: the 'psychic' kid that gets messages from 'beyond'; we've seen that in Poltergeist and other movies. And the storyline of aliens at first being almost invincible and than suddenly dying of something stupid, ordinary, onnozels (well, look it up); that has been used before: In War of the Worlds it were germs that finished the aliens and in Mars Attacks! country music. Another thing I noticed. Although at some point in the story it became quite clear the aliens were here (crop circles, giant spaceships hoovering in the sky), when the aliens got down to the surface they moved around almost undetected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan has the touch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shyamalan is master of orchestrating the buildup of tension and atmosphere. The fact that in the film aliens actually appear just four brief times is a testimony to deft and skilled direction. The same is true of the 6th sense - all that tension and fear, and you only see dead people about four times in 2 hours.Gibson and Phoenix are an excellent casting choice - they complement each other very well and are thoroughly believable as brothers. Phoenix has the haunted look down pat - just what the film needs.There's no need to recap the storyline - other reviews have done that already. But it is necessary just to counter some of the criticisms that have come Signs' way. A lot of people out there were griping about the fact that the aliens were quite primitive - having to use ground signs to navigate, and being vulnerable to water. I think this is simplistic - why do people always assume that aliens, if they do exist, are more advanced than we are? Couldn't it be possible that humans are in fact the most advanced life form in the universe?Shyamalan makes his film more believable by not equipping his aliens with every gadget in the book - and at the end of the day its a film about ordinary people, who are emotionally stretched, reacting and coping with extraordinary events.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the type of movie that makes me wish there was a way to get inside your head and erase whatever you want.Signs was one of the greatest "edge of your seat" movies i've seen in a long time. Just like in "The Sixth Sense" when everything came together at the end, I was completely blown away. (i'm not like most people who over analyze a movie while i'm seeing it for the first time just to prove to themselves how smart they are. I just let it roll and take me where ever it wants)When the movie ended, it was like I was on a drug. I was all excited and talkative like a child. "I can't believe I didn't notice that!" and "That was great how this and that went together!"However, once I knew the secrets of the movie, the second time I saw it, it had lost some of the magic. It was still a good movie, but didn't seem as fun the second time around.If someone could create a way for people to forget movies so that everytime you went to see it, it was like the first time, movies like "Signs" and "The Sixth Sense" would be so much more enjoyable.A great movie, but don't let anybody tell you about it.

		<fullReview>This is the type of movie that makes me wish there was a way to get inside your head and erase whatever you want.Signs was one of the greatest "edge of your seat" movies i've seen in a long time. Just like in "The Sixth Sense" when everything came together at the end, I was completely blown away. (i'm not like most people who over analyze a movie while i'm seeing it for the first time just to prove to themselves how smart they are. I just let it roll and take me where ever it wants)When the movie ended, it was like I was on a drug. I was all excited and talkative like a child. "I can't believe I didn't notice that!" and "That was great how this and that went together!"However, once I knew the secrets of the movie, the second time I saw it, it had lost some of the magic. It was still a good movie, but didn't seem as fun the second time around.If someone could create a way for people to forget movies so that everytime you went to see it, it was like the first time, movies like "Signs" and "The Sixth Sense" would be so much more enjoyable.A great movie, but don't let anybody tell you about it. Plug your ears and run until you've seen it for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An edge of the seat movie about losing faith, and finding it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan tackles the issue of faith through the filter of science-fiction. Former Reverend Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), has thrown away his collar after the tragic accidental death of his wife. In Hess's words, "I will not waste one more minute on prayer!" This to the consternation of his family, brother Merril (Joaquin Phoenix), son Morgan (Rory Culkin), and daughter Bo (Abagail Breslin).After the appearance of crop circles in the corn fields of their Pennsylvania farm, the family must pull together to deal with the frightening reality that they will soon face. Graham will not have the luxury of wallowing in his own bitterness for much longer.This is an excellent movie for several reasons. It takes the Alien sci-fi genre, and gives it an entirely new treatment, a very cerebral treatment. Also, true to Shyamalan's cinematic ideals, it gives us a deeper moral question for which the movie is merely a framer. The question; are you the kind of person that believes that things just happen, or that they happen for a reason, is certainly worth asking.Excellent acting here, especially from child actors Culkin and Breslin. I found the movie well-paced and riveting throughout and would recommend it as a suspense thriller with a message to anyone looking for a few chills.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was so overhyped, I have to admit I went in dreading it so much, I wanted to be proven wrong. I wanted this to be the best Mel Gibson movie since his forgotten classic, Payback. But, alas, no. A plodding plot. Two dimensional stock characters, with no development. Cliche dialogue so bad that the actors only keep a straight face by being wooden throughout. The only genuine moment was a cameo by Patricia Kalember as Mel's dying wife. It made me long for thirtysomething, where she was the least interesting part of the show.Pretty bad when a movie makes me long for television.In the end, a self important exercise of posturing egos with no meaning.Rent Close Encounters instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan's movies, for me anyway, are 2 hits and 1 miss. The Sixth sense and Signs are very good representations of the film making craft. Unbreakable... Well lets just say I didn't like it.The movie, Signs is a well planned movie that avoided the all too present predictable plots that spew out of hollywood these days. I found myself thinking. "Ok here comes the..." and "Ho hum here we go again" Much to my surprise, the movie did not tread on that familiar ground. The tension was planned perfectly and barely let up. The shocks and jolts that were present were placed with precision for maxium affect. At least M. Night Shyamalan did not opt to simply change the scene and crank out a loud noise for his shocks. This is a clever movie even if a supposed advanced alien race has problems with doors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Executed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: 8 out of 10. Directed by M. Night Shyamalan. I have to say that before seeing this movie, I was bracing myself for a disappointment due to mixed reviews. I must now say that I found the movie to be quite remarkable, well executed, and nicely crafted. M. Night Shyamalan rightly deserves respect for putting out a film with a lot of his personal touches instead of putting out something that people expect to see. While `Signs' will have scenes of the traditional or convention variety, it is the ambiance of the scenes that is unique.Shyamalan made good use of the films lead actors. Mel Gibson as recent widower Graham Hess, and Joaquin Phoenix as the younger brother Merrill Hess are both well cast and interesting to watch. They both brought a lot to the movie. Shyamalan himself has a somewhat key supporting role in the movie as well.It was a good choice to make the movie focus on the Hess family instead of the global distress of an alien invasion. The few times that we did see an alien during the middle of the movie was really frightening. Especially the first time Graham Hess (Gibson) sees one right outside the window of his children's bedroom. I believe we see an alien (or part of one) seven times in the movie, and the first six appearances were only for a split second, at first I was dissatisfied that we didn't see more. Yet in hindsight, less appearances of an alien does accomplish more for the movie.We never find out why the aliens were invading, but the viewer does realize that they were hostile. Here is one qualm that I have with this movie, it seemed a little illogical to me that the aliens would think that humans wouldn't realize their (the aliens) weakness since this substance is so abundant on our planet.`Signs' really held my attention and I highly recommend it. In fact, I look forward to seeing it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shymalan Strikes Gold 3 Times!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's rare for a thriller to evoke a lot of emotions. But Signs does. It can scare you, make you laugh, and make you want to hug your loved ones, all at the same time. The cast is all exceptional, with even the children delivering bravada performances. The real star is Joaqiun Pheonix, who steals the show as the childlike dofus brother. But as the family, caught in the midst of an alien invasion, the entire cast (and Shymalan as the writer) succeed at making you care for the charaters. In fact, I think, other than Donnie Darko, The Big Lebowski, and Clerks, I have never enjoyed characters this much. Plus, add some slick homages to Hitchcock, plenty of interesting moments, and enough laughs to fill two typical comedies. At the end of the day, Signs might not be worthy of winning a lot of awards, but if you want thrills, chills, laughs, and tears, you can't beat the experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Truth Isn't Out There - SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the trailers for this, I was really excited to see it. I expected a smarter, scarier "Independence Day." When it came out, my sister saw it first, and she wasted no time in tearing it to shreds, telling me how stupid and boring it was. End result: I waited to rent it instead, and recently sat down to watch it with no expectations at all (probably the best way to watch any movie).I thought it was terrific. Since I wasn't expecting another Alien Invasion action flick, I could settle in and accept the alien subplot for what it was: a plot device designed to give Graham a chance to reexamine his lost faith and reconnect with his family. While the nighttime chase through the cornfield was tense and the Brazilian party video was really disturbing, the two most gripping scenes were both quiet conversations: Graham &amp; Merrill's discussion on coincidence/luck vs the divine plan, and the dinner scene where the wall between Graham and his kids finally comes down (this scene is played perfectly by everyone).And, to refute what some others have written here, I didn't see the "faith vs luck" thing as being explicitly pro-religion. All he's saying is that if you believe in a higher power, then it's easier to build a happy life for yourself. But you can doubt and still be happy; it's just harder to live with the fear that you're alone in the universe. In the end, it's not religious faith or the Benevolent Hand Of God that saves the Hess family from the aliens; it's the fact that they're a strong family that looks out for each other.People have complained about the "flat" acting, which seems to me to have been intentional. In a nice change of pace, Mel Gibson gives an atypically quiet performance; those used to seeing him goofing around in the Lethal Weapon movies might be disappointed. Joaquim Phoenix continues to develop into a rock-solid character actor (watch him reacting to what he sees on TV &amp; in every scene he's got with the kids), and the bond between the brothers was deeply felt, as well as the void in the family. Both of the children were excellent; Shymalan has a real gift for casting and working with child actors.A few words about the aliens, since so many viewers wrote in to share their disbelief about the way they behave. It's never confirmed that the crop circles are for navigation. That's just what the reporters are speculating. The crop circles could have religious meaning to the aliens, or maybe that's how they mark their territory. Maybe it's just psychological warfare, designed to confuse us and distract us from the other things they're doing.It's also never confirmed that they need us as a food source. Indeed, if water is lethal to them (see below on that), we'd be the worst thing for them to eat (we're 80% water!). Maybe they view us as a threat and this is a pre-emptive strike. Who knows, maybe they only mate once every 30,000 years and human bodies play a role in it.And here's another theory: maybe the universe is full of alien races, and we were lucky to be invaded by one of the less-intelligent species. It's possible that in all their explorations, they never encountered water or doorknobs before coming to earth. And why are there aliens randomly sneaking around Pennsylvania farmhouses and Brazilian birthday parties? Because they're idiots. Maybe Shyamalan was having fun with the accepted wisdom that the alien invaders would naturally have to be much smarter than we are.If you can drop your expectations and accept that this is a movie about one man coming to grips with God, finding his lost faith, and repairing the wounds in his family, and that the aliens are just a means to that end, then you'll probably get something out of it. If not, then you should probably watch "Aliens" or "Predator" again instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an alien movie with an underlying theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs, directed by M. Night Shyamalan, and staring Mel Gibson as Graham Hess and Joaquin Phoenix as Merrill Hess (Graham's younger brother who came to live with him after the death of Graham's wife), was an alien movie with an underlying theme. The theme of Signs is that most people at some point in his or her life questions the belief in god or a higher power. This theme is generally present through out the movie.In one scene, Graham is called to the scene of the accident that will take his wife's life. He is dressed in his priest attire when he arrives. But as his wife is dying you can see it in him that he is questioning why god would let this happen to his wife and to his family. This is the point at which he has started to question the existence of a higher being.In another scene that presents the theme, Merrill and Graham are sitting on the sofa in the living room watching the television report on the fourteen lights from alien ships that were surrounding Mexico City. Merrill asked Graham, "People probably think that this is the end of the world." Graham replies with a simple, "yes". Merrill gets upset and says, "Can't you pretend to be the way that you used to be and give me some comfort." Graham then goes onto explain that there are two groups of people. One group that has something lucky happen to them sees it as more than just luck, but as a miracle and that someone is looking after them. The second group sees it just as luck. He then explains, "There are those people that see these fourteen lights and it fills them with fear. And then there are those that see those fourteen lights and feel that it is a miracle and they believe that someone is their to help them and that fills them with hope" Graham then looks at Merrill and says that he must decide within which group he belongs. This scene shows how we all as individuals have to face this same question. We either choose to believe or not to believe in a higher being.And in another scene towards the end of the movie, Graham is holding his son who is having an asthma attach and they can not get to his medication. During this scene, Graham thinks that his son is going to die. And again, this represents his questioning of a higher being. Why would god take two members of his family away from him?Shyamalan used many elements in his movie to contribute to the theme. Lighting was one element that was used through out the movie. Most of the scenes that were shot were dark and dreary. For instance, the scene described above when Graham and Merrill were watching the alien report on the television. In addition, most of the other scenes shot in the house were kept dark. This could have represented how Graham felt distanced from god. It could also show that he felt isolated and alone in this time of trouble and need.Another example of the element of lighting, is in the scene where they are coming out of the basement after his son has survived the asthma attack without his medication. At the top of the stairs is a window that has a curtain with cut outs of stars and moons. The whole shot is dark except for the light coming through the curtain in the shape of those stars and moons. This could have represented were Graham was regaining his belief.Another element was in the use of angles. For example, towards the middle of the movie when Graham decides to get his family out of the house and away from the television that was constantly reporting on the alien invasion, Shyamalan uses a birds eye angle. It shows their car traveling into town where they will run into the man that killed Graham's wife. This angle could represent that even though he was going through a time of questioning and disbelief that god was still looking over him and was there with him during this troubling time in his life.The theme of Signs is that most people at some point in his or her life questions the belief in god or a higher power. This theme is generally present through out the movie. The theme is very important in this film. It makes it more that just another alien film. It adds emotion to this movie. And it addresses the fact that things happen in every person's life that make them question whether or not there is a higher power.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not watch this movie because I love SCARY movies. I could care less about "SCARY" movies. I watched this hoping that it would be a great extra-terrestrial story. It wasn't. Why do aliens almost always have to be UGLY and ready to KILL or EAT you??? Where do we get it that aliens must be some horrible dreadful being? The only "good alien" I've seen in the movies is "E.T.-The Extra-Terrestrial" and that was more of a comedy and not a real serious story about aliens.Due to all the television and movie hype, keeping us scared to death of aliens, if we ever were face to face with them, we would kill them all before finding out if they're friend or foe!One of the things I did like about the film was that Graham Hess (Gibson) lost his faith after his wife died and at the end of the film his faith is restored. Also the movie IS quite different than most movies on this subject.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pathetic. absolutely pathetic.this was probably the lamest scary movie it has ever been my displeasure to watch. i have absolutely no clue why everyone else was scared of it. not even the alien was bad. if anything, it was disturbing. the only thing i thought was cool about it was the crop circles and how they made them so perfect. i watched this at a sleepover and when the alien came on the screen evryone in the room screamed. so did i but i was trying to be scared. (Note: it's extremely hard for a movie to scare me during and after i watch it. its so easy for me to just remember that it was just a movie and then ill be fine. one exception to this is the ring. that movie rules!) usually i can forgive scary movies if they didnt scare me as long as it was a good movie period. one example to this is the sixth sense, guts and gore dont scare me too much but *HUGE SPOILER ALERT* that was a total surprise at the end when we found out the therapist or whatever was dead. they hid it so well. i thought that was a terrific surprise so i give that movie a 9/10. but were not talkin about the sixth sense unfortunately......plus, the message was kinda predictable. we kinda figured out that his wife had died when he had the flashback of the ambulance and at the end we all knew that he would get over it. there's also some non-explainable parts. for one, his son had asthma and he had an attack down in the basement without his inhaler. i guess he like passed out or something and at the end when the alien squirted the poison up his nose the guy said his lungs were closed so no poison got in. let me ask you this.....if you passed out from lack of air how could you stay alive that long? the son should have been dead way before the alien came.but like i said....what really got me was that it was trying to be a scary movie but it turned out to just be a wannabe. id give this movie a 3/10. the crop circles and special effects were what saved it from being a zero. if you do watch this and you're expecting a fantastic thriller, dont count on it.</fullReview>

When the movie starts at the beginning, goosebumps come all over my body. The most scary scene was the most expected (but also un-expected) scene in the film, where you hear the newsreader say: "What you're now are about to see, can be disturbing." When I saw the trailer, I just thought that it was the crop-circles, but *SPOILER* it was that alien. I was scared to death!! Only the end was very un-Shyamalans, and it was too accidental (or something like that, but you know what I mean, I hope). But the rest of this film was great. Thank you, crew of "Signs", for this great movie!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything happens for a reason</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs takes a great deal of time and creates a very elaborate context to teach us one simple, and not very original idea: everything happens for a reason. Mel Gibson is Graham Hess, a former minister who left the church after the tragic death of his wife. Everywhere he goes his former parishioners call him `Father,' even though he vows `not to waste one more minute of his life on prayer.' You see, Hess lost his faith when his young, beautiful wife was taken from him, cut down in her prime. When giant crop circles appear in his corn field and then start popping up all over the world, it seems his faith is to be tested once again. Are these bizarre configurations a hoax, or a sign that an alien invasion can't be far behind? Bet on the latter. When the tall green ETs do touch down Hess fights for the survival of his family, and learns more about the complex nature of fate. In the end he realizes that life is not just a series of coincidences, but a carefully arranged pattern that fits together like a jigsaw puzzle ? everything happens for a reason. Director M. Night Shyamalan handles the material with his usual incredible visual style, but unfortunately the story is too thin to sustain interest. The aliens are not the focal point of the movie, but simply used as a plot device to help Hess learn about himself and his beliefs. Shyamalan has an almost Hitchcock-like ability to build suspense, unfortunately, unlike the late-master he doesn't follow-up the anticipation with any thrills. Signs is limp ? all fore-play and no sex. If you're in the mood for an exciting alien invasion movie skip Signs and rent the 1953 Byron Haskin directed War of the Worlds, you'll have a better time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It really bothers me the number of pop-cultured idiots who comment on this movie as a "let-down" or a "rip-off". This movie isn't a UFOs-blowing-up-cities or Aliens-running-rampant-in-our-neighborhoods movie. If you want that, watch Independence Day or the myriad of B-movies following that exact same thing. This movie was pure suspense without the flashiness that ruins so many other movies. It's an excellent and refreshing film that reminds us just what good filmmaking is all about, something we've lost since the days of Hitchcock and since good storytellers have gone politically correct (Spielberg) or cash-motivated (Lucas). Those who can't appreciate such a film need to stick with absurd Bruckheimer flicks or anime to get their flashiness and things blowing up. Those with intelligence and who enjoy good storytelling over mindless eye candy, keep an eye on this Shyamalan fellow....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scariest Film of 2002</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(WATCH AT CINEMAS OR BIG SCREEN IN DARKNESS!)I'm not entirely sure if it's scary or suspenseful. Maybe it's both. In any case, this film is the only film to have got me scared, sweating, almost unable to watch. Unlike the much over-rated The Ring, Signs makes your heart-pound faster without spoiling it with a convoluted, non-sensical, ridiculous plot. Even with some ridiculous plot points, and ridiculous scenes, and ridiculous director cameos, the suspense remains. The last 10-15 minutes are truly terrifying- long silences, complete and utter darkness, bumps,footsteps,heavy breathing leave the viewer on the edge of their seat.**SLIGHT SPOILER** One of the best scenes has Joaquin Pheonix walk up a stair case, camera positioned, fixed, at the bottom. Slowly, he gets to the top, turns around, window behind him, and says to his family below- "It's all Clear. they've gone". What happens next I won't spoil, but it's surprising, and a master stroke from Shyamalan It's one of the most gripping scenes in a film I've seen recently, matched only by another scene in the film, involving a hand-held camera video,a children's birthday party and an alien. As riveting as it is nerve-racking**SLIGHT SPOILERS END** The suspense begins early in the film and is sustained for much of the entire film, but the last minutes don't just take it up a notch, they take it up 10 notches. Having said that, the actual resolution, after 10 frantic, frightning minutes, is a major disappointment, rather trite, and the film is not otherwise flawless, inconsistincies in plot making the film suffer. 8 and 1/2 out of 10. Frightening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so they aren't a trilogy, but they are released as a 3 disc DVD set in the UK!After his ghost story, and his superhero story, this is his take on an aliens story. In short, I enjoyed it and would recommend it. The build up of tension was superb, no film has made me jump this much since 'Ring' (the original, not the remake) and the pay off was satisfactory.Double thumbs up from me</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How can the creator of Sixth Sense make a movie this bad?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the second Shyamalan movie I've seen, after Sixth Sense. That was a good movie - this isn't. The two movies are literally the exact opposite of each other. Where Sixth Sense is clever, unpredictable and intense, Signs is patronising, condescending, thoroughly predictable and painfully slow.Realistically, the plot of this movie should have consumed no more than about ten minutes, and was padded out with scenes that wanted so badly to be suspenseful - but weren't. That was probably partly to do with the weak plot, but equally to do with the laughably bad special effects, that belonged in a 1970s movie.I wanted so well to like this after being so impressed with Shyamalan's past work. I couldn't like it, because it was a mediocre, wishy-washy movie made even worse by the hype that preceded it.Don't waste your time - any B movie running on cable for free is likely to be as good, if not better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>signs is m. nights third commercial movie. and a well made movie it is too. the direction has it's own character, be it odd camera angles, visual trickery, or the placings of the actors. m. night is a director first and foremost. which is rare. and as a storyteller, he is original, give him that, but he can be a little over ambitious. the sixth sense was perfect as it was. unbreakable was intriguing but difficult. and signs, is just far fetched.but, it could have been different. the last 20 minutes are good, but it didn't need to be. i think m. night struggled to better the endings to his other movies. and in the attempt, botched it up. it does hold some nice meaning to it, but the way it was done was over dramatized. and the alien was a bit cack. but the duration of the film is masterful, brilliantly set up, and spooky, creepy, tense and moving. it moves at its own pace, giving us more dialogue than action. but at least it's good dialogue. mel gibson and joaquin pheonix are very very good as brothers, and the kids, mainly abigail breslin, are just adorable. so what could have been a masterpiece, ends up being just above average due to the copout finale. lets hope m.night stops trying to please the audience with a twist ending next time, and just lets the story breathe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Mel Gibson as an actor, really, but just not in fatherly roles like he plays here or in "The Patriot." His portrayal of a priest who's lost his faith wrapped around a story of alien invasion just didn't strike me as real. He's much better as a wise-cracking cop, like in the "Lethal Weapon" series or the rugged loner in the "Mad Max" trilogy.The movie centers around a conversation Mel has with his nephew, in which he postulates that there are two kinds of people in this world - those who believe in miracles and destiny, and those who believe things just happen for no real reason. Mel plays a reverend in a small Pennsylvania farming community who recently lost his wife in a freak auto accident. He's left the church because of his loss of faith and is now bitter and rudderless in life. His house is a mess and his family is breaking up.Then one day, crop circles appear in his corn field. Soon after, strange beings show up on the farm and in the community. His asthmatic son, played by Macaulay Culkin's younger brother, Rory, is curious about the aliens, sensing right away that this is a real invasion. Mel's daughter, played by the cute-as-a-button Abigail Breslin, seems more awed by what's happening than frightened. Joaquin Phoenix plays Mel's nephew, who's helping out around the farm, and he's decidedly in the camp of this is all a miracle of some sort.The "signs" from the title refers to events leading to other events in the lives of the characters. The movie is supposed to make us realize that all things are connected and that we should look for signs in our lives, but the overall effect is a bit clumsy in the movie.A conversion Mel has with his dying wife in which her last words are, "Hit away," ties in with Merrill's (Joaquin Phoenix) skills with a baseball bat, which comes in handy when an alien invades their house and snatches the little boy. Alot is made of the fact that the boy's asthma actually saves him from the alien's attempt to poison him with some gas. The asthma is a sign? God made him asthmatic in order to save him? That's what Mel thinks.The movie is entertaining and a bit spooky. Much of the movie feels like you're part of someone's dream, sort of like Shayamalan's "The Sixth Sense." But I was expecting something more complex from the appearance of the crop circles, not a straight forward alien invasion complete with boogeymen creatures trying to drag off the children. Mel's dilemma as he deals with his loss of faith and the impending disaster centers the movie, but I had difficulty interpreting his emotions most of the time. He doesn't play a character in control, which is what you expect of Mel Gibson. He's confused and angry and drifts through much of the movie with a blank expression, not seeming to know where he's going, which makes for an awkward story since no one else really picks up the slack. Drama requires a hero, and that element is lacking in this movie. The final scene where Mel puts his collar back on seems trite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After all the praise and hype that surrounded this movie I eventually got round to watching it and I seriously wish I hadn't bothered. I have a general idea of what the plot was meant to be, widowed priest losses his faith, aliens invade, he gets it back, but the script just did not come to grips with that plot. The direction of the film was lack-lustre and the story just didn't seem to flow right. Performance? Has Mel Gibson forgotten how to act? And Joaquin Phoenix, what happened to the kind of performance he gave us in Gladiator? Watching this movie I felt as though I was been punished for something, I think that M Night Shyamalan needs to go back school before attempting to direct something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Signs' begins very well - kind of an early Spielberg like aliens story. Mel Gibson is good as he can be, Joaquin Phoenix whom I saw recently in 'Buffalo Soldiers' is an amazing actor, and the tension is slowly building. An then, two thirds in the film, you are due for a big surprise. It is really a turn in the subject, in the characters evolution and in the message. I am not going to reveal more but high chances are that you will either love it or hate it! Unfortunately, I fall in the hating category, and some of the scenes in the last third of the film are, in my opinion close to the ridicule. However, I know that many people will like the turn, and believe me - it is a matter of faith. What wasted talent! 6/10 on my personal scale.</fullReview>

The family is suffering vast emotional shock and this is manifested in MelG character, in fact they are the classic wako madmen, only instead of ATF they see Aliens. Are they all mad? or just taken in by the head of the family spreading his psychosis to them?. Watch it again and see if you agree? the silver paper on the heads, the nailing up the windows, they're on the roof, "they" fight physically and can't go thru wood? redemption comes thru the most life giving substance we know. All the "signs" of madness are there... maybe it owes more to Greenaway than to (MR) spock!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No tension, just boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Night Shyamalan made a great movie with "The Sixth Sense". The plot was good, the tension and suspense built up as it should and the ending was unexpected. Then came "Unbreakable". I gave it a very low rating here, because the action was sooooo sloooow, there hardly was any tension and an unexpected ending lacked. Sadly in "Signs" Shyamalan follows his tradition of "Unbreakable". "Signs" lacks everything a good movie should have. If my wife had not wanted to continue, I would have switched it off halfway. Hardly anything happens, and the events that do happen are far from unexpected. No tension at all is being built up. One knows from the very start that the events have something to do with some kind of extra terrestrial life, and this suggestion is repeated so often that extreme boredom overcomes the viewer. It is clear that we get to see something of these ET's at some point, but when this happens at last there is no tension, no horror, no unexpected action, no drama, nothing at all that can grip the viewer. The (few) principal characters react frightened from the start to the end but what are they frightened of? And what is the plot? I don't know. There is no plot. So this was the last movie I ever saw by Shyamalan. He made one great movie ("The Sixth Sense") but he seems not to be able to reproduce even some of the fine elements of that one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I expected more and I am disappointed. I`m asking how could this movie total an amount of more than 200 Mio. US$ at the theatres? Well, the plot is alright but it is not well packed as a convincing and really chilling blockbuster. During two thirds of the story nothing goes on and you wait and wait till something happens. The rest is all dj? vu. It is a low budget movie with no special effects. Okay I've got the message having hope in God but this I know since I am a little boy. I think this time the director failed completely after his last average movie "Unbreakable". Some critics I read on imbd said it seems Hitchcocks "The Birds". I dont think so. "The Birds" is better, has more suspense and is a real edge-of-your-seat-thriller and it is still actual. I continue to believe that director Night Shymalan has great potential of turning better thrillers than this one. If you want to watch it I highly recommend you to rent it before you buy. You will appreciate my advice.Too overrated. Maximal 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what it appears to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs borrows from multiple sources, primarily Hitchcock. Shymalan is touted as "The Next Hitchcock," but this does justice to neither Shymalan or Hitch. One can be influenced by Hitchcock while at the same time establishing a style of his or her own, and I think Shymalan has already successfully carved himself his own niche in the cinematic pantheon.The film "Signs" is ostensibly an alien-invasion thriller, but it is really about something a lot more than its obvious subject. The film wrestles with questions concerning faith and God, something most of Hollywood has a tendency to disdain. It is this aspect of the film, tastefully done and not overbearing, that transforms what would otherwise be a good thriller to a very good film. That's not to say that there aren't flaws and plotholes, notably concerning the Aliens themselves in terms of their primitive tactics and the ultimate way in which everything pans out. However, the feeling of gloom and tension, the Night of the Living Dead-style finale, and its willingness to tackle issues of faith with tastefulness and sincerety, put this film very close to being excellent.9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interpretation of SIGNS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the things that I think that most people miss in this movie is that the Aliens arent evil. Its all about the way we interpretate the signs. At no time we see the aliens make something evil. They make crop circles and hover over cities but if you think about it in a rational manner then this is more a sign of trying to communicate rather than of hostile intentions. If the aliens in fact were hostile dont you think that they would have brought some weapons to kills us primitive people? You have to remember if they have the technology to travel to earth from a distant planet they would be 1000 times superior to us. Resistance would be futile, as they say :)It obvious to me that the message in the movie is that we humans project our fears into the unknown. We let our fear dictate how we interpretate signs. In the movie Mel Gibson is convinced that the aliens are evil and therefore he never see the signs in a rational manner. As a last resort he picks up on his believ in his mythical religion when he thinks that it can save his own ass. Ironically he regains his faith by killing the alien that saves his own child.If you are one of those people who thought the aliens were evil I suggest you see the movie again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing (Spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disappointing. The majority of the film was okay, and the acting was at the high level you'd expect given the cast. But the whole time I'm sitting here thinking "okay, what's going to be the gimmicky ending this time?"... and it was pretty weak. Still, anything with suspense, aliens, and Mel Gibson can't be all bad. "Signs" is a good movie. But given Night's track record and style, what you expect him to deliver simply falls short this time.The aliens were an interesting story to work with... crop circles and all... and their part of the story was quite entertaining. The news "footage" of the alien at the children's party was very eerie, and the scenes in the cornfields were quite tense. But the underlying Mel Gibson personal struggle story line was pretty weak... a disillusioned priest who in the end returns to God because of the alien incursion. Right. Nevermind that an actual alien incursion would turn the bible on its ear and toss most of it out of the window.And the "zinger" at the end was laughably weak... junior is saved from the alien poison gas because he has had an asthma attack that left his throat closed and kept the poison out. Yeah, right. I have asthma. If you have an asthma attack that closes your breathing off, you can kiss your sweet patootie goodbye... you aren't surviving. But I hear you saying "it was a miracle, that's the point". No, the only miracle would be if anyone thought this was a clever ending. Night's gimmicky endings are seeming pretty strained these days, having gone from excellent in "Sixth Sense" to pretty unbelievable but still chilling in "Unbreakable" to downright silly in "Signs".I'd still recommend this film, but if you're looking for the great, insightful, mind-blowing ending you got in "Sixth Sense", you'll be disappointed. The gimmick is starting to get old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all the newspaper critics' bluster about M. Night Shyamalan filling Hitchcock's shoes, this director has made quite an interesting niche all his own. His movies are unconventional, with humor, suspense, well-crafted dialogue and minimal violence. Signs may well be his best work to date - I'll admit it had me jumping at shadows for quite a while after watching it - but the ending is simply unforgivable, particularly in an otherwise excellent thriller.SPOILERS AHEAD.Signs is a unique film - all its flaws come into play during the last five minutes. Shyamalan makes the inevitable mistake of showing the alien clearly. He should have left it at the blurred newsreel footage, which was effectively disturbing. I was willing to forgive and forget - until Graham is seen donning his priest's collar. If we're to accept the film's assertion that everything somehow adheres to a plan set in motion by some higher power - let's call it God - does Shyamalan seriously expect us to believe that Graham would return to the priesthood when God saves his son from the terminal asthma inflicted upon him by God in the first place? God doesn't have the best track record in this movie. He apparently cut Graham's wife in half with a truck, traumatized a mild-mannered veterinarian for life, made Graham's daughter neurotic about her drinking water and, oh, ARRANGED AN ALIEN INVASION OF EARTH AND THE SLAUGHTER OF HALF ITS POPULATION - all to bring a single jaded priest back to the fold. If anything, shouldn't Graham be more adamant than ever in his hatred of this particular deity? Please.8/10</fullReview>

The most glaring hole in the story was water. As we find out water is what kills the aliens much like the wicked witch in the Wizard of Oz. Knowing that why would they come to a planet that is 75% water and frequented by rain, sleet and snow? Other silly parts of the story are that the aliens move so fast in the opening scenes that neither Mel Gibson or Joaquin Phoenix can hope to catch up with them on foot. Yet by the end of the film the local vet has one locked up in his pantry and it can't seem to move fast enough to avoid a baseball bat.</fullReview>

It isn't quite drama, science fiction, action, comedy, or suspense. It takes elements of all of these and turns out a well thought out, entertaining movie. Fans of Night's work, (Unbreakable, The Sixth Sense), will really like Signs. Mel Gibson, in my opinion really stretches as an actor, and is supported by a good cast. And although you never really leave Mel's world, you get a sense of a larger world view with the story. It is also the first movie to deal with Crop Circles, which is a very compelling subject. Additionally, I truly admired the way "faith" was tackled in this film. Though provoking and entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this movie for the first time on DVD, I came out both satisfied that I had a good movie experience, but somehow not entirely satisfied with the themes. Filming, editing and especially the music were excellent. A good movie brings you into the film and engages you, and this one does it marvellously. This is usually more evident on DVD, as one can turn off the movie if not happy after 25 minutes.What I am not entirely satisfied with is that the 3 films, now that they are complete, is really quite shallow. Taken as separate films, they stand on their own, but if you look at the themes from the first (ghosts), 2nd (comic book heroes), and now (aliens), you begin to see how popular culture has a large part to play in the writers style. He is young and has not had enough life experience to come up with anything more than childhood ones. Quite frankly, I am getting tired of seeing his cameos and that of his relatives. I would really like to see him just direct a movie with a really good script next time. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I missed Signs during its theatrical run, but did manage to read some reviews of the film, which were mixed at best. Guess I wasn't expecting much when I finally got around to renting the DVD. Boy, was I surprized! ** spoilers ahead!!** Don't know why all the bad reviews. Sure it's not Unbreakable, but that was a completely different genre. For a premise as superficial as a "War of the Worlds"-type alien invasion, this movie managed to really hit my gasp-button one more than several occasions. I suppose its the wonderful cinematography, or maybe Mr. Shyamalan's clever way of layering shots and keeping what we expect is there off camera (a la Jaws, Alien)long enough for the imagination to run amuck. The CNN-like presentation of the actual invasion also added to the terror in ways I wasn't expecting (that scene at the child's birthday-party in Brazil really sent a schock down the ole spino!) Alas, cheap scare tactics rear their ugly heads, but in the hands of such a talented director, it works somehow (who'd have thunk that the glimpse of an alien shin could be so chilling...) Luckily the quirky nature of the characters and some of the dialogue balances the tension out a bit,something a movie of this ilk always needs to set you up for the next scare. In the end, I guess the whole rekindling of the main character's faith could have been fleshed out a bit more, but less is more when such a serious theme is mixed with little green men from Mars, in my opinion. Verdict: maybe not the director's best movie as a whole, but for the genre it's an instant classic due to good pacing, clausterphobic setting and clever storytelling. Now, where's my tinfoil cap...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mixed bag of two halves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very rarely does a film have an equal amount of good and bad points. Usually I can say 'I liked that film' or 'I didnt like that film' in varying degrees. With Signs I couldnt decide and ended up liking some and loathing others. **SPOILERS FOLLOW** On the good side first - The trailers led me to expect a film along the lines of a conspiracy theory with a is it/isnt it aliens plot throughout. Very early on though we establish that they are aliens and for me we got to see a more realistic version of Independence Day. I also liked the fact that we were treated to an opinion that there may actually be no such thing as God. So rarely do us atheists get our say in films - even in Contact we were in the wrong! The direction was excellent once more. I like a film that treats its viewers with enough intellegence so that if it doesnt show you something you can let your imagination work it out. From reading the other reviews I can see that this doesnt always work as some people prefer to be shown every detail rather than use their imagination. Final good point - nice to see Mel Gibson not overacting for a change, if anything he underplayed it to produce one of his best roles ever but unfortunately not one of his best films. Bad points - Number one out of the blocks which follows from above is the fact that in the end the 'non believer' turns into a 'believer' once more and everything is right in the world. Perhaps one day we can have a film without everything turning out right because of God. I believe what Mel's character says in that we are alone and it is what we all do that makes a difference NOW because this is all we have. I found the soppy part with the wife a bit distracting that late in the film and her 'vision' of the future a bit convenient - I'm sure they could have found another way to work out that water kills aliens as sure as paper kills stone. Finally I didnt like it's pace. It was slow for the most part but I cant knock that too much as it added a bit of suspense. I'm just glad I saw it on DVD and not at the cinema. Overall, worth a watch but don't expect to be blown away. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After two highly popular and extremely well-made first rate thrillers "The Sixth sense" and "Unbreakable" M. Night Shyamalan has already established himself a certain reputation as a writer/director who's next film is an eagerly waited event. Although "Signs" is a great movie it's unfortunately a slight let-down after Shyamalan's previous two.It starts out like Steven Spielberg's classic "Close encounters of the third kind" and slowly turns out to be more like a weird mixture of "Night of the living dead" and "The Birds" or even "Predator". Of course most of Shyamalan's trademarks are all there, cinematography is once again amazing and the way the director uses reflections and other simple things like sounds and shadows to built up the excitement is quite ingenious.Well this time Shyamalan has certainly stolen a whole lot of ideas about the proper way to use the sounds from Alfred Hitchcock's "The Birds" but it doesn't really matter because the whole thing works like a dream. The fact that this movie really hasn't got that major twist in the end that turns everything we've seen before in the movie completely upside down was a disappointment because I really expected something like it. Luckily Mel Gibson made a fantastic performance in the leading role. I would have to say that "Signs" is a good, solid scifi thriller if I don't compare it too much to the two M. Night Shyamalan films starring Bruce Willis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Signs", starring Mel Gibson as Graham Hess, focuses on the faith of a man and his family. Life's tragedies create a different reaction in all of us. Some of us get stronger, weaker, lose faith, gain faith, give up, or ask why. Mel Gibson is dealing with his catastrophic situation in life while strange and eerie circumstances begin to take place around his large, farm house. Extraterrestrial life is a dominate factor in the movie, but the theme of Signs deals with earthly problems. The director, M. Night Shyamalan, shows us that even the most faithful person can lose sight of their faith when tragedy strikes.Mel Gibson struggles to raise his two children, played by Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin, after a terrible accident. His brother, Merrill Hess played by Joaquin Phoenix, moves in to try and help out. Soon, several incidents occur to interrupt the normal, everyday life of the Hess family. We get a sense that the world is in danger as perhaps we did from "Independence Day". The underlying theme of the movie brings the audience back to problems that perhaps we can understand, however; it also relates to the alien visitors. Mel Gibson questions everything he has ever believed in for two reasons. Number one, we can all understand his struggles after his wife's chance accident. But, we can also see him begin to question whether or not somebody looks over us after the extraterrestrials come to put a scare into us. Several techniques, such as close-up shots and the way mise en scene is placed, help the audience see Mel Gibson's struggle more clearly. In one scene we find Mel Gibson finally meeting with Ray Reddy, played by M. Night Shyamalan. Shyamalan was the person who caused the accident with Mel's wife. As Shyamalan is talking to Mel about the accident, the audience gets to see a close-up shot of Mel Gibson. We see the intimate details of Mel's strife through his facial expressions. A second scene is set up to show Mel's struggle and his place in the family as a leader. After encountering with what may have been an alien, Mel goes back into the house. All four family members are inside the frame with Mel to the far left, sitting down with head slumped. The other characters notice him and slowly surround him; the appearance is that he is trapped with nowhere to go. He is obviously struggling with his thought process, yet the family is still looking to him for guidance. Without one word spoken, we get a sense of Mel Gibson's desperate struggle and the family's faith in him. Most of us would probably look to our faith system during a tragedy. This may cause us to question it and seek guidance from our faithful leaders or counselors. But what if one of our faithful leaders, a Reverend or Priest for example, began to question his belief system. To me, the main idea in "Signs" deals with just that situation. Yes, even the most faithful of all of us can lose sight of our faith.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a little apprehensive in watching 'Signs' at first, but I was so glad I did. The story is basically of a ministers' faith, challenged after the death of his wife and a threat of alien invasion. Mel Gibson's performance as the minister was portrayed in a quiet and passive way. The under-tone of the production was creepy, given the Director M. Night Shyamalan's past film record. Joaquin Phoenix played Mel Gibson's character's younger brother, who did a fine job in depicting the source of encouragement to Mel's characters' lack in 'faith', and also, when Mel can't accept what is happening around him.Over-all the film stirred up a lot of emotion within me and I think there is a moral to the story, but I will let you come to that conclusion. I found this film entertaining as well as enlightening, it did not have to show gore or an absurd plot. The film was not complicated in expressing the fundamental basis of what could happen. I enjoyed it a lot and would not hesitate to watch another movie by this young director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing Sixth sense and Unbreakable i had pretty big expectations before i saw Signs, even though i had heard some mixed opinions from my friends. The thing was that i actually thought Unbreakable was better than SS, unlike most of the people i know. So i was thinking that Signs has to be even better. I was wrong...The story itself is probably one of Hollywoods all time-leaders: Alien-invasion....and sure, Schlyman(or whatever his name is spelled) does his thing with creeping and subtle suspense, not underestimating the viewers, as usual. But something is missing, i can't put my finger on it but it just doesn't have that edge that the previous films. Surprise ending? I THINK NOT! It couldn't have been more predictable and actually cheesy.... aliens can't handle water...please! Earth surface is 70% water. Think the aliens wouldn't have analyzed it before they came? I don't.... Nope. Disappointment..... 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and now Signs, I certainly hope we see something new from M. Night Shyamalan very soon. He is already a recognized and marketable name as a director. I can't help but liken him to Alfred Hitchcock, though he is nowhere near and will likely never achieve that bar set by Hitchcock. Even the music and his cameo appearances in his films suggest Hitchcock.I honestly didn't know what to expect going into this one. I knew it would be creepy. I wanted a thriller. I got way more than I expected.People looking for another 'Independence Day' or 'Alien' need not apply. You won't see much of the aliens in this movie. But, as it turns out, this movie isn't about aliens at all. It's about faith. I have NEVER seen the subject of faith presented in such a novel and provoking way. Mel Gibson needs to take on more roles like this one, because here he truly shines. For that matter, the entire cast does a remarkable job, notably Joaquin Phoenix and Rory Culkin.This movie had its scares, but at the same time it had some absolutely hilarious moments. This movie has found the balance between horror and comedy that clicks just so perfectly.Don't just ask someone to tell you what happens. If you're at all interested, see this movie. Thought provoking, funny, scary, and entertaining, this is the best of Shyamalan's work to date. I eagerly await announcement of his next movie, and hope it continues his trend of quality and Hitchcockian suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>!!!!!!!!!! CONTAINS SPOILERS !!!!!!Okay, I've read a lot of criticism about this film but I have to defend it.If anyone has read 'Tommyknockers' by Stephen King they will be aware of the stupid alien theory. Okay they can travel to earth but maybe they didn't invent interstellar travel, they could have poached it form some other nearby species or inherited it from a previously enlightened culture on their own planet ( I mean, when the ancient Egyptians were building pyramids , some cultures were still living in caves in other parts of the world ). If they were that smart they would have been far more subtle and used more insidious ways to get what they wanted rather than the very clumsy methods they did use. They had no obvious weapons (except their poison gas spray) and seemed to be unable to cope with a locked door barring their way!! Also they struck me as rather insectile - quite organised but not too able to think creatively, even their speech sounded like crickets or something.As for the water thing - maybe they didn't KNOW that water was toxic to them. Perhaps earth was the first planet they ever visited that HAD water. And if they they subsequently realised after landing that water could harm them, then maybe they had a sort of stubborn attitude to the idea of giving up and going home after travelling all that way in the first place. Lets face it, everyone knows that smoking gives you cancer but how many people keep smoking anyway and think 'it won't happen to me'.Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix were excellent and the film had some quite subtle humour and nice touches like the recruiting office scene where JP gets a hard time from local idiot Lionel Pritchard and then there's a tiny moment where you get to see that Pritchard is a total loser. I liked the fact that Mel Gibson didn't seem to own any guns - being an ex-reverend and everything, and the cursing scene was funny too.I don't think films should necessarily give you nice neat endings and answer all your questions. I think that M Night Shayamalan would be pleased to see how many people are outraged by the loose ends, I'm sure it's exactly what he would have wanted to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well at first the movie seemed good. Something strange was going on, what could it be, and so forth. Then the aliens started coming, ok still good. Then they started bording up and everything started reminding me of the birds (the book, havent saw the movie yet). Then they woke up. Sure the movie has had some huge plot holes from that start (They can fly to earth in a space ship, but cant get though a jammed door or a sack of dog food?) but that water is their achilles heel? Why take a place covered in water, the air alone is full of water. There are just to many plot holes to make this movie work. Maybe if they all lost in the end and dumped the whole faith thing or something, that and made it scary. If it wasnt for it was PPV, I would have went and done something else.</fullReview>

The dog barking, the banging on the door, the hand appearing under the pantry door.The best scene was (Merrill Hess) Joaquin Phoenix was watching the news clip on the television, children were having a party and were startled by something. They all rushed to the window to see what it could be. I was watching the window. Nothing happened for about 5 seconds, then I saw a green human creature appear. I jumped because you did not know what was going to happen. (Merrill Hess) Joaquin Phoenix jolted out of his chair, just like I did and the children at the window.We all shared the same fear, very clever and inventive by M Night Shyamalan the director of this movie.

		<shortDescription>Poorly thought out premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD.I think this movie's premise was poorly thought out, and very unrealistic. To name just a few absurdities:Any civilization advanced enough to find us and travel here wouldn't need to use crop circles as signs for communicating among themselves. And their method of communication would probably be a lot more private/secretive than that! I mean, really, give us a break!Also, there is good theoretical evidence that water is essential for advanced life, not just here on earth, but everywhere. That's just a fact of life about chemical bonds and evolutionary forces, etc.. Those aliens must have circulatory systems, which would almost certainly be water based (some form of liquid 'blood'), as would their body cells, etc. And so, why come to a planet that is 75% covered with water, which could be detected from a great distance away, and which has an atmosphere filled with water?Also, such an advanced race came here to harm/abduct people, but they can't fight their way out of a kitchen pantry? What, no ray guns, etc? Come on!In short, this film was written by someone who seems never to have read any science fiction at all, or studied any science, or even given much logical thought to the premise or structure of the screenplay. What a disappointment. What a waste of two hours. Unfortunately, I saw it on Pay Per View cable TV, so I can't get my money back. But if I had seen it in a theater, I would have demanded (and probably got) my money back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie about intergalactic space travelers who can be defeated by a squirt gun and retaliate by inspirng asthmatic attacks in young children, Signs is extremely hard to take seriously. I kept on waiting for the humans to wise up and break out the Macintoshes, but after seeing the alien(s) at the end, I guess why bother. Lock 'em in the closet, beat them over the head with a bat, and turn on the sprinklers. Problem solved. Oh well. Not sure if anything could have been made of this movie given that people have admitted to creating crop circles with boards strapped to their feet, but whatever might have been made of it, certainly wasn't here. Kind of uplifting in a way -- after watching this movie I say bring the space aliens on! I've got my garden hose and a healthy supply of water balloons.Guess you can give it a few stars just for the reasonably moody style and acting (you can really sense the presence of the Sixth Sense's director at times). But as anything that's supposed to be remotely frightening this movie is an abject failure. In fact with a little work could have been a nice parody.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Signs" is directed by M. Night Shyamalan and stars Mel Gibson, who plays the role of Graham Hess, father of two children who are dealing with the loss of their mother. The Hess family lives on a farm in a small town in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. They awaken one morning to find their cornfields had been damaged by crop circles. The crop circles soon begin appearing all over the world.Soon after, they realize that extra-terrestrials are planning to invade and to take over Earth. The Hess Family is thrown into questioning reality, their beliefs, and morals. How will they defeat the enemy? Or will they become the defeated?M. Night Shyamalan wrote, directed, produced, and acted in this film. I believe this film was made due to the crop circles that appeared in the United States in the mid 1990s. The crop circles were later determined to be man made with strings and boards. Shyamalan perhaps made this film to bring back the feeling of question and concern that came over the U.S. in the 1990s.He may have even believed that it could have been by a UFO and wants the audience to open their eyes to the possibility that we may not be alone. He might want us to think about the fact that the crop circles were never scientifically proven to be man made.I really enjoyed this film, though I am not one that is interested in sci-fi films. This movie had an array of activities that made it great. "Signs" has talented actors and a fantastic storyline filled with suspense, drama, and humor. My favorite thing about this movie was that it's a sci-fi film, but was filled with a natural reality. It wasn't extremely far fetched as are many sci-fi films.I would suggest this movie to anyone who craves a suspenseful movie--be ready to sit at the edge of your seat. This film captured my attention while grasping my imagination.</fullReview>

Catholic priests don't have wives.Other than that, this was a film trying to be something on a higher level than it could actually reach. "Signs" is not a sci-fi film so much as an inspirational thriller, if there is such a category. Even then I found it rather saccharine, and the holes in the plot could fill the Albert Hall.Also, would someone kindly dissuade Mr. Shyamalan from acting in his own movies again!

		<fullReview>On the basis of Shyamalan's 3 major films, I think one can start drawing conclusions about his work. First of all, he has "tackled" the 3 greatest mysteries of life: Death, UFOs, and Comic Books. His treatment of all 3 is simplistic to say the least. It would be an insult to the New Age movement to call them that, they seem just lukewarm meditations based on late-night student philosophy ramblings or just too many comic books. So "Signs" was not so much a disappointment for me as a confirmation (and a waste of time.)His trademarks, at this point in his young career, are jarring implausibilities in the stories and unnatural, painfully stilted dialogue. The acting is almost uniformly wooden. To underscore this, he even had the nerve to "perform" in one of the major roles of "Signs" and reveal his shortcomings in front of the camera as well. (These are not flaws for audiences of limited intelligence, so I predict his continued success with the mass market.) In fact, the only thing he seems to have going as a director is a good visual sense. So I would not be interested in seeing any future films by this director unless he should happen to hire a writer or two to help him reveal the Great Mysteries with a little more intelligence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having enjoyed Sixth Sense and particularly Unbreakable, I was looking forward to seeing this. I enjoyed it for what it was, but I wouldn't put it up there with those previous two films. There were some nice scenes, though, and he has a way of getting some nice spiritual moments to ring through in a way that feels right. My favorite moment was actually the goofiest, when there was the videocam capture of the alien at the children's birthday party (a nice Bigfoot cop, btw). It was kind of goofy, really, but also gave me the feeling of what it would be like to be seeing that in the situation the characters were in, and therefore the reaction was shocking as intended. I thought the performances were very good, particularly Joachin Phoenix (who I didn't like at all in Gladiator). His reactions to what was going on helped make it believable (for example, when seeing the video of the alien). If anything, the film seemed a bit too short. It took a while to get going, and then once it got going a little, it ended. I like what I saw, but I guess I expected a little more, as opposed to Unbreakable and Sixth Sense, which seemed a little more satisfying as a whole. Still worth seeing, though. I think Shyamalan is one of the best filmmakers today, and I like that he doesn't have sex and blood and excessive violence and swearing in his films.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible Spoilers!Not being an enthusiast for either Mr Gibson's or Mr Shyamalan's work, I waited for my flatmate to rent the DVD before viewing this movie. I must admit, I had been intrigued by the trailers - looked like a good old fright-from-outer-space picture to me. It isn't, though - more's the pity."Signs" does employ a few time-honoured tools of the genre - inexplicable phenomena (corn circles - could have been a good hook), the fact that you don't really see the creatures until quite late, and the classic situation of it all happening to (or at least centring on) a lonesome farmstead, all these are classic devices.But what comes along in this garb is not actually an alien-shocker sort of film, but rather a drama of spiritual rediscovery (potted: Cleric loses wife, as a consequence loses faith, but it turns out her last words as well as some of the action in the film preceding the finale can be interpreted as divine predetermination/intervention, and badabing-badaboom: he rediscovers his faith). Quite apart form the fact that I'm personally not likely to be impressed by challenge-to-faith storylines (unless done in manners as excellent as "Dead Man Walking"), I think this is what spoiled the film for me: trying to both spiritually challenging and suspenseful, it fails on both counts.As to the first: the alien invasion is not plotted well enough to make the viewer really interested. We don't know why they come (or where they come from), we do not get to know anything about their greater strategies, and most of all, we do not get a satisfying bust-up at the end (someone found a way to repeal them, apparently - that's all we are told. And there's a scene in which an alien is vanquished by the judicious use of a baseball bat and tap-water - effective, maybe, but hardly riveting. "independence Day" - need I say more? Not a film I find intellectually interesting, but then, so few of the alien take-over genre are). Of course I am aware of the fact that the invasion is incidental to the film's main theme, the vicar's return to the godhead - rather like the murder in Gosford Park - but a) the trailer should have given me an idea of that and b) that storyline is beset with problems of its own.Actually, for me at least, its really only one problem: its too pat to be in any way engaging. At the centre of the picture, a dialogue scene is used to introduce a dualist view of humanity: those who believe in predetermination, and those who believe in the essential randomness of life. The film then continues to integrate disparate occurrences (from the dead wife's last words to a child's bad habit of leaving half-empty water glasses standing around) into the parson's final revelation that God must exist because why else would it all make sense in the final instance. Unfortunately, it's all too glib for my taste - where's the spiritual challenge? Getting over a loved one's death has been done better before. Not to mention the fact that the central dialogue mentioned is unbelievably trite, theologically about as sophisticated as a penny catechism, and geared towards an audience of the literalist kind with a Manichean world-view (dare I say US American at this point?) - and not towards anyone with a shred of interest in the psychological machinations of fitting a disastrous event into an essentially optimistic religious world view.Failing both as a suspenseful and technically interesting exercise in the alien invasion genre and as an exploration of crise de foi, I cannot recommend this film - watch it when your flatmate/partner rents it, but don't rent it yourself.</fullReview>

(2) The entire theme of the movie is unpleasant from the beginning with no view of life as normal before things begin to fall apart. (3) The struggle of faith in Graham Hess's (Mel Gibson) life is left almost totally unresolved (or it is brushed over to an undramatic conclusion). (4) The end of life glimpse of the future from Colleen Hess (Patricia Kalember)seemed somewhat fake/staged. Again, noted I rated the movie a 9. I thought the movie was great and am still uncertain how much the above mentioned short comings effected the my overall view of the movie. I thought it was a great movie with a few shortfalls.

		<fullReview>this film has the potential of being a pyscho or the shining or maybe therabouts but never gets there. it pushes boundaries in filmaking but the film itself is flawed.there are excellent performances from mel gibson and the two children. one of the finest interaction of family characters ever. all the other characters are very believable and add depth to the film.i saw this movie on dvd and its presented to the highest standards. surround sound is made full use of with the rears given a good workout at times. there is a very widesoundstage and u really feel a part of the scenery. also picture is very good, colours are very vibrant.it is filmed in a similar style to sixth sense or what lies beneath and works very well. its often slow but controlled and u really get a sense of the characters emotions - fears, anxieties etc. however, its too slow at times and u just want more to happen. it almost tries to get the most out of a very thin script.the film is thoroughly gripping and u are left glued to your seat, at least for the first half an hour but without result. nothing much actually happens until the last few minutes and you are left wanting more.secondly the film is too short althougth feels quite long due to slow scenes.however, aspects of the film are quite revolutionary and will likely be adopted by other filmakers.overall this is a good film, it will scare u but it could have been much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shyamalan's trademark seems to be clichd paranormal tales. The filmmaking is not clichd but the ideas are. In Sixth Sense, about 10 or 15 minutes from the end, I was thinking "why was everyone talking about this film?" then with a simple twist it gives you something to think and talk about. People told me that they thought Sixth Sense was very scary. This is my problem - I don't find films scary anymore. I seemed to have reached the age, or state of mind, where I don't scare easily, especially by films with B movie ghosts or aliens. It didn't help that I watched Signs at home with my wife and kids but I saw Sixth Sense at the cinema and neither raised any hairs on my neck. I put this down to the fact that I don't believe in the spiritual or paranormal. In fact, stealing a line from the movie, I think that events just happen, not that they are signs. If you believe that everything is ultimately explainable (or random) then there is less of an unknown to be scared of.So, what you get out of this film will depend on your beliefs and whether you like scary movies. If you don't find it scary there is not going to be a lot left to entertain you. On the plus side there are a few laughs - more than you would expect but the Science Fiction is corny (no pun intended!) and implausible. Perhaps it is best to approach Signs as a dark comedy.So, what you get out of this film will depend on your beliefs and whether you like scary movies.

		<shortDescription>Can't believe Mel Gibson made this flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the sillier movies I've seen in a while. The plot takes itself seriously, which is great, only it fails to deliver on any sort of believability. The plot holes are too numerous to list entirely. A few big ones: How'd they get here? Why would they try to take over the world without using any advanced weaponry? Why, if they are very physically superior to humans, would a normal man be able to lock one in a closet? Why would that person then not call the authorities but rather head for the lake? Why would these aliens give a rat's behind about a totally insignificant farming family? And on and on and on. The concept of the wife's last moments and last words is a good plot facet, but again the specifics cause it to fumble. "Swing away"? "See"? I laughed at the end because I thought the foreshadowing was so lame.There are a few good moments of suspense, and a few brief frightening moments, but if you're a fan of good screen writing, this is definitely not the movie for you. 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than you've heard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Contains a couple of wee spoilers) Things happen by a grand design. So is the point of 'Signs'. Actually its about a few other things too, but hey? Whatcha gonna do? Signs is a bit different to your usual alien invaders schtick. It actually makes you think. There is no 'God bless America' style rousing speeches, no cornball 'welcome to earth' style heroics, no 'monument lasers' or any of the other crap that's become so prevalent in the 'alien invasion' sub genre. I don't think I have enjoyed an invasion film so much since 'Invaders from Mars'. Signs is a suspense building exercise first, UFO movie second, as a result we get to see all of one alien in the whole movie. And one weapon. I know this has dissapointed most people, but it was never the intention of the director to make a heroic 'humanities last stand' type movie. He intended to, and succeeded in, creating a character driven film about a reasonably average family trying to cope with extraordinary events. Its why they don't tool up on guns, steal a space ship and take the fight to them. Its why they hide in the basement and board up all the windows. The exposition of the alien invasion is very well handled. After a series of strange goings on Graham Hess tells his kids 'no more tv', as their imaginations are running away with them. Then Graham experiences things beyond imagination and states 'lets turn the t.v on'. Which plays a pivotal part in telling them and us just what is going on. Such as the utterly marvellous scene in which Merrill sees 'them' for the first time. I also like the directing style. He seems to thrive on the mid shot, capturing so much in the frame. I was also pleased to see wonderful moments of levity in the film which do genuinely make you laugh. At the end of the day, its pretty much a no brainer to criticise Signs. Blah blah blah stupid aliens cant work a doorknob, blah blah blah why corncircles? That's not very high tech for space-faring aliens, blah blah blah earth is 70 odd % water, blah blah blah blah blah. It is, on the other hand, harder to value this film for what it is. If you can't appreciate a movie without 200 CGI shots a minute and a 'God bless America' ending, don't watch this. You will only whine about the 'Stupid Aliens' and wonder why Graham Hess isnt capping ol' ET's ass with his M60.</fullReview>

With Signs, I really don't think people came to the movie to see Mel Gibson, but they saw it for M. Night. This is a wonderful fluke in the movie business. Aside from Spielberg, people simply do not attend a film based on the director. One of the most terrific thing about this film is that it works on more than one level. Without spoiling the film, you'll be hard pressed to hear them talking about the thing you're watching. The movie works on a visual level and then surprisingly it works on an auditory level as well. This is weaved together in such a way that people of all sorts can gain some sort of enlightenment on the situation. The final scene is a beautifully muted scene that ties up the main character's story. Beautiful. I think it's best to say that this is Night's most mature film and I can't wait to see what he has planned next. He has mentioned that this is the last 'surprise ending/supernatural' movie for awhile, so it'll be interesting to see his take on other genres.</fullReview>

This is a species on "a raid", and may travel the stars in craft for supplies as man does with no more science than a hollowed out tree.This film is no better than the scene in the army recruitment office. JoaqimPhoenix' character is mocked by a local hood.He responds with a subtlemovement causing a flinching reaction from the pleb. Detail.Emotion. Reaction. Brilliant.The director is hoping his audience is smart enough to fill in the spaces for themselves, he goes full on for the Hitchcock tip, from cameos to the score, but guess what?

		<shortDescription>Very over-rated movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually do not put my comments down for a movie but I think when a movie is very over-rated like this one I want to give my two cents. My biggest problem with the movies is that the plot hole are huge and I think you may see my point after I list the top 5.5) Any race that flies across the solar system and can cloak themselves from all earthly radar would not be able to have their communications picked up by a baby monitor.4) I don't if you know people that have asthma but anybody I know has their puffer at all time no matter if it is the end of the world or not.3) Any race that flies across the solar system can break through a wooden door. Come on give me a break where are are the land weapons. That air was explanation earlier in the movie is weak.2) Has anyone seen CNN when their is a hurricane in the states. The grocery shelves are emptied, long lines of people leaving, people in churches etc. There was no panic in this movie not even by the father trying to save his two children.1) The biggest loophole is that the movie eludes to the fact the aliens want to harvest us but water is poison to them. Last time I checked the human body is 80-90% water and would mostly be poison to them. What are they going to do put us in a dehydrating tanks to get rid of the poison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mediocre Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS HEREINI saw this movie on a date, and quite frankly, thought that it was a waste of time. There were some high points, Joaquin Phoenix's performance was very good. (I thought it was weird to see him as an average young American male, after watching him as the psychotic emperor Commodus in Gladiator). There were some scary parts, like where Mel sees the hand grab at him under the door. That and the home invasion by the aliens though, were the only scary things that i saw. Also, and this is what the worst thing was, was that it was unrealistic. I mean, if we were invaded by extra terrestrials with superior technology and intelligence, you would think that we would have had a harder time fighting and defeating them. Also, why would intelligent alien beings sensitive to water invade a planet over two thirds water? So if you don't have anything better to do, it can be entertaining, but don't have high expectations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching this on DVD. Did people really pay to see this rubbish at the cinema? I haven't been this bored with a movie since I saw Dragonfly. Most boring (in fact it eventually became laughable) were the drawn out scenes where the actors were supposed to react to things happening off screen. Someone should have referred them, prior to production, to Sergio Leonie's brilliant The Good the Bad and the Ugly for lessons in doing this. I started to think that perhaps the surprise ending was going to be that our family were the aliens, due to their unhumanlike reactions and wooden performances. Note that I haven't really commented on the plot. This is because what plot there was would have easily fitted into one of Spielberg's old Amazing Tales episodes (and still it would have been boring). Oh well! My dog enjoyed it. He had a great time trying to find the dogs inside the surround sound speakers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked The Sixth Sense, but Shyamalan's efforts since then leave much to be desired. The Shyamalan writing process seems to be: think up a tricky surprise ending, then write a story to lead up to it. And it shows.The movie Signs is merely a two hour build up to the ending. Like if we get a tricky trademark surprise ending, we'll walk out of the film happy and forget that the other 95% of the movie was boring. The suspense would have been good if it wasn't so overdrawn, but instead you just find yourself sitting there waiting and waiting for something interesting to happen. I won't give away the ending, but it was pretty stupid all things considered, and as far as I'm concerned only created some huge plot holes.Another thing this movie suffers from is the usual bizarre M. Night dialogue. If he wasn't so egotistical he might take on a co-writer just to do dialogue, because some of the lines his characters spit out are the most unnatural, weird things you've ever heard. "I think we should all relax and go eat some fruit" is what I'm talking about. Who the hell would say that?The last criticism is Shyamalan's obvious racial agenda. Every time he casts a doctor or therapist or anyone of intelligence in one of his movies, it's an Indian in the role. He himself plays a veterinarian in this film, which is just the most ridiculous notion for country USA.And if that weren't obvious enough, the crop circle concentration around India. Like the aliens would think that giant leper-filled slum was the most important place on the planet. Give it a rest already Shyamalan, we know you're proud to be a curry muncher and we can only wonder why.Overall, a big let down of a movie. Shyamalan should put more into his stories so that they aren't so dependent on the payoff of the surprise ending, which this time fell flat anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How the Trailers of a movie can put you on the edge of your seat, waiting for that moment when it comes out to rent. It's absolute brilliance and M.Night Shyamalan (Director/Writer/Producer) should be grateful because without the Trailer there would be very few people going to see it from 'word of mouth'.I would say the film wasn't 100% rotten, there are a few scenes that made me jump out of my chair and the acting from all of the cast was well directed. But what disappointed me was M.Night Shyamalan has wrote this without considering the why's, What's and Where's. He's put one story about a man losing his faith because of his wife dying and how he copes and another story about suspected aliens making crop circles. Was he thinking the main character (Mel Gibson) needed some form of depth instead of being just a normal farmer, who's having a bit of problem with his crop. Or is it a new way of making an old story line (losing his faith, etc) a bit more exciting by integrating an action/thriller story within it's foundation? All I know is that after this film I was left with a handful of loose ends and a nagging sensation of 'What was the point!'It's a far cry from Sixth Sense folks! Save your money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the relative disappointment of "Unbreakable," one can beforgiven for approaching "Signs" with added caution. But it deliverson every level, emerging as one of those rare films you lookforward to seeing again even as you're watching it.Shyamalan is a master of subtlety: he frequently puts his audiencein a position from which they will be able to generate their ownsense of fear without ever having to resort to cheap shock tactics.And just to round off his talents, he also turns in a goodperformance! It's a moving film too, Gibson, who has rarely beenbetter, largely responsible for that with a deft portrayal of a manwith both inner demons and impeccable moral standards. Inaddition, "Signs" has its own brand of humour which occasionallyand pleasingly surfaces to soothe the tension of what is athoroughly absorbing and rewarding story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few good scares but for the most part dull (1 spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure I can explain why, but the ending in Signs was too convenient. The water thing, a little too on the nose if you ask me, and the wife's message at the end, same thing. In the film business they are called plants and payoffs, but they are most effective when they are subtle. But here we see glasses of water all over the house for the whole film, so when their power is discovered, you feel like "oh that's good then".Obviously this is a small imperfection in the film, but there are much larger ones. For one, Gibson put me to sleep. He didn't have a very "fatherly" presence in the film, so I never fully believed he was this rural farming dad. I always felt like he just got out of his Mercedes, put on a flannel shirt and stood on the set 10 minutes before shooting.And Shamalan needs to stop acting in his films. Not that he's a bad actor, for the roles he was in he was fine. The problem is that there are thousands of struggling actors trying to get a break into the business who could really bring the role to life. Shamalan has got his big break; he got 4 mil from Disney just for writing the thing. It's a little self-absorbed. Subtle cameos are cool, like Hitchcock did, because its fun to look for them. Shamalan is in your face for 5 minutes of the film. Give someone else a chance.Sure the film isn't that original, but nothing in Hollywood is anymore. If you want original your going to have to go to a short film festival where there isn't any studio money involved. He isn't ripping people off, and he's not paying homage either. He's taking proven ideas to help propel his story, that's the way it works in this business.There are some good scares in Signs, and one of the bright spots in the film is the sound design. What you can't see but can hear on the other side of a wall can be just as scary as an alien chasing you down a hall.It's an adequate film with dull performances and a slow start, but it has just enough suspense to prevent you from turning it off to do your taxes.-IR</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen some lame movies, but this is one of the worst I've ever seen. This movie is just plain painful to watch start to finish. It's not even the type you can enjoy mocking, it's just plain stupid. I can not believe the rave reviews this movie has got. And to everyone who says "You just don't get the message!"... believe me, I got it. Everyone who has been forced to watch this movie got it. I'm not ignorant, I just don't care. The message is every bit as sickeningly dull as the movie itself.Every time the story even starts to get going, something so freaking stupid it makes my very brain ache happens. Have a touching moment about God vs Random... follow it up with a story about a girl puking on herself. Yep, that's good cinema.We have a family who are so dumb it's sad. No TV, it's evil. Don't ever talk to the girl who swears again, she's evil. Don't ever talk to any people from out of town, they're evil. Don't ever call anyone by anything but their full name, it's evil. Don't prey, it's evil... or something, he doesn't know. Got it? No? Cry about it now, because every 35 minutes there's gotta be a crying scene.Now we get to the aliens. Not only are they absolutely the worst aliens I've seen in ages, they're the stupidest as well. They can't break down a freaking wooden door or boards. Give me a break... these absolute cosmic rejects would be destroyed in mere minutes. The most retarded aliens to ever cross space.This movie is so very flawed it's hard to find the right words to describe it. All I can say is if you see some kind of deep message that you find awe inspiring then you're grasping at straws. Stop praising this worthless lump of a movie and go join a local church group.

		<shortDescription>Well.... what can you say!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite a lot has already been said about this movie already. Certainly, if its director/writer wanted to cause a stir of mixed opinion then he succeeded.Spoilers Ahead.Me? Well I went from being highly impressed with scenes such as whenJoaquin Phoenix sees the alien in Rio, the reaction being so good you jump with him. Then we have the sheer horror as he replays the clip. Such a memorable scene? and this marked the down hill point of the film for me.Then we go over to the sheer insanity of the 'plot hole circumventor' UFO book that explains the alien ray-gun ban so 'mankind won't use nuclear weapons'.Why bother? Given my next points?..But most amusing of all is the fact that aliens with such an aversion to water seem to pick on a planet whose surface is 4/5s water and whose 'food source' is 70-80% water. Which also caused me some concern of the alien picking Rio in the first place. It's probably one the most humid places on the planet.Oh, but while we're on the subject, lets not forget the susceptibility to large twigs. You can imagine the scene on the mother ship. "We've taken over the entire Earth beloved leader" Shortly followed by "Hold on!! Oh, my god! Look out he's got a piece of wood! Run for you're lives!'And would that ancient 'Arabian' or 'Eastern' attack method be smacking the scrawny sods with a bit of 2 by 4? One can only guess.I think I laughed through the last 10 minutes of the film (much to everyone's annoyance) as these thoughts and more went through my mind.I'm sure if I watched it again I would pickup the merit points. After all, there are so many good parts to the film in the opening parts. Plus the fact it didn't turn into 'Independence Day' was a bonus I feel. After all, this was a story about a family, about loosing (and then regaining) faith. I guess what it really is about is 'about time M. Night Shyamalan stopped taping 'shock endings' onto the end of his films. What did Hitchcock once say? "I am a typed director. If I made Cinderella, the audience would immediately be looking for a body in the coach."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD!Great film. Very suspenseful. Have not been frightened like this since I was 8 years old. On the edge of my seat. At times even though I knew something big was about to happen and had time to prepare, the film still scared me senseless.Only one complaint: Some dull parts. Too bad there were no guns or explosives involved. It would have been quite an invigorating feeling to see those awful aliens blown to tiny bits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An audience of low intelligence will LOVE it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>caution: possible spoiler(s) in this quick review.Ok, a race of aliens, so intelligent and technologically advanced that they can travel through the depths of space, come to earth and are thwarted in their attempt to break into a rural country house because the windows are boarded up. And while they lay siege to planet Earth, the audience is given no information on why the governments and armies of the planet are just sitting idle. But not to fear - the aliens came all the way to Earth so they could run around naked in the streets, unarmed (except for "poison gas wrists"), and are easily defeated by water. So what if the aliens are so intelligent that they can build space-travelling vessels. If you're in danger, just lock one in your pantry. Your alien visitor will spend days scratching its head in its failed attempts at escape. If worst comes to worst - just add water.A COMPLETE lack of realism in this movie made it almost unbearable to watch. Global news coverage of the alien invasion, yet people are left to fend for themselves in their homes. How this movie became so popular, instead of the joke of the year is beyond me. This movie's box-office success sadly shows that intelligence levels of the worldwide viewing audience has reached an all-time low.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is an annoying combination of film making skill and moments that make you want to say "He's gotta be kidding". But he isn't kidding; a ponderous seriousness hangs over this film. Everything is so heavy with meaning that in the end nothing has meaning.And those claw fingered aliens...don't they ever learn? Three times in the film they stick their fingers under doorways. That just does not work when you are trying to open a door. If you have flown at FTL speeds through interstellar space, you'd think you would know how to work a door.</fullReview>

If u're going to have an "alien invasion" film, then have it. If u're going to have a "spiritual enlightenment and restoration-of-faith" film, then have that. What you DON'T do *film students take note* is p****foot around those two genres, bounce them off each other (2 themes that have NOTHING in common, by the way), never really come to full terms with either one, and leave an incoherent mess in your wake.Night's gotta do better, or he'll need to go back to Now You're Unemployed Film School...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's scary about this movie. . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Possible spoilers within* The first time I saw this film was in the theater, not long after it opened. I was so scared, I could barely move. My muscles were honestly sore at the end from holding tension in them. It was the best filmgoing experience. ..ever. On the way home, I analyzed it and realized what was so frightening to me was the way it echoed my own personal 9/11 experience. (When I found out, through the DVD extras, that filming started two days after, on September the 13th, I cried.)On that day, more concrete to me than the suffering of the people in the towers, was the fear of the people standing helpless nearby, watching the destruction. And even more concrete than that to me was what felt like a momentary dissolution of our country, the way things are done here, and the possibility of what might come next. I remember the most terrifying aspect of that whole day was hearing the f-word on NBC in some unedited video. ..then hearing that footage again and again and again. Similarly in Signs, the moment that we are "pushed off the edge," so to speak, is the moment that Graham opens the closet door and there's nothing but a test pattern on the television. That moment, to me, spoke of a terrifying "end of the world as we know it," similar to what I experienced on that day. Also, when Graham and the kids come out of the basement, the first thing we hear is the television news report, a clear "return to normalcy." I was put off too, once I saw the actual creature effect, but I was willing to forgive that one transgression, as the rest of the film to me was a beautifully crafted piece of cinema. The direction and cinematography are marvellous and thoughtful, most of the actors have obviously done their homework, the light and indeed the whole production design is beautiful(as a costume designer, I loved touches like little Bo being in her dress-up gown when she is frightened). Sure, it's got its plot holes. Sure some bits of the dialogue aren't as well-crafted as they might be. Ok, M Night Shayamalan isn't likely to win an Oscar for his acting. However, if you can get beyond these little issues and see the film as a whole, give in to willing suspension of disbelief, and buy into the world of the film, I think there's a lot to be learned, both emotionally and intellectually.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A silhouette. A leg. Fingers. They are wary. They are invisible. And they are coming in great numbers. This may disturb you...When I first pressed "play" button, all I knew about "Signs" is that something weird is going to happen on Mel Gibsons' characters' corn field. May be Steven King rising from the soil, or even something more terrible. Fortunately, it was nothing like that. Soon it became clear that it's definitely not rednecks vs. aliens type of movie. And it still scared. It's been a long since I almost jumped out of my chair last time. But "Signs" made me do it again. Thanks to all the film crew for that. No guts, gore, jaws, tentacles, torn body parts and other "meat" stuff.It is the presence that make you nervous. Presence of something unknown with intentions not clear. It's throughout the movie, all the way. You are scared by what you do NOT see. And when you finally do... The scene representing Merrill being watching a "genuine birthday video" is just great. First, TV host warns you, that you WILL see. Then children will point you WHERE you will see. You think to yourself: "Oh, now it finally will appear. Right now, right there". And it does. Exactly where you were supposed to. Still a shock. Look at Joaquin Phoenixs' face, then go look to a mirror. By the way, I found out, that in Russian translation they slightly altered the original TV womans' words to something like "I hate to say... I'm afraid this is real". Some personality touch, hmm...I liked the humour, too. It's not much fun usually in such situations, when there's "the same show an all channels", as we all now know for sure. But comic stuff happens, whether we want it or not. Well, it looks fun mostly to the viewer, not the characters, but still entertains.And after all, this is not horror or thriller or anything like that movie. It deals with faith (not necessarily in divine), the way we are facing the problems and trouble, no matter of what cause them.Read forth if you saw the film already. Else see first. (No spoilers, one just got to see the movie to get sense of what am I talking about).As final credits rolled, I was up to two questions. First - am I the miracle man, or not. And you? That is a harder choice that it may seem. Graham seriously doubts on answer too. And it looks to me that Merrill has nearly changed his mind at some point of the movie. And that leads us to the second question - in what we will believe, if the things will suddenly go the way they did in the movie. What if one day there will be the same show on all channels again... Yet haven't decided on either question, 9 of 10 goes to "Signs".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is without a doubt the most well thought out, scary,entertaining film of the year. WARNING-MAJOR SPOILERS "Swing Merill, swing,""Like it was ment to be,""why do you leave so much water around the house"? These are a few of the qoutes that, when you hear them, make no sense, but come together at the end to form what is totally the best summer blockbuster of 2002.Graham Hess is an ex reverend who no longer believes in god when his wife dies. The last thing she says to him is"tell Merrill to swing away, like it was ment to be,". He has no faith and believes everyone is on their own.Merill Hes, is an ex baseball star who moves in with his family when there mother died. He hit a 507 foot home run and the bat is in their living room.bUT HE QUITE BECAUSE ALL HE DID WAS SWING AS HARD AS HE COULD, AND STRUCK OUT A LOT. Of all the characters, he was my favorite.Bo Hess is a little 4 year old who is very funny and cute to watch. It is amazing how well she acts and could get a special oscar or an best supporting actress for her preformance. She has a thing with water, leaves about 10 gruops of 3 glasses of water in the family room and around the house becuase it never tastes good.Morgan Hess is smart allic 9 year old who buys a book that helps the family survive.Here is what the people on Earth know- The aliens don't like water, and their skin can change color.Graham is visiting the man who accidently killed his wife home. The man thinks he wil die soon so apologizes, and says hes going to the lake because they dont like water. Graham goes inside and finds an alien trapped in an pantry. He cuts off his fingers before leaving.That night, the hess's take refuge in their basement while the aliens invade their home. IN the morning they find that the aliens are gone all around the world and their house to.They go to their living room.Graham goes to get the t.v. from the clost under the stairs. when he comes back, the alien who he cut off its fingers is holding morgan unconscience.Gramham and Merill stand there paniced.Gramham think back to when his wife died. "tell Merill to swing away". He looks at Merill who is standing right next to the bat he used to hit ball 507 feet."Swing away merill" graham says.Merill grabs the bat and swings with it as hard as he can on the alien.He drops morgon and gramham grabs him and takes him and bo outside.Gramham ses the glasses of water on the tables. "MERILL THE WATER" He yells before he leaves.Merill hits the water on the alien, and merill beats the alien to death.Gramham belives in god again, thinking god made his wife die so she could tell him to say to merill swing away, and that god made Bo leave all those glasses of water around the house. The best movie. The last scene is great. It has Merill on T.V. with a reporter saying how he killed the alien. He gets baseball attention and gets a contract, while his father becomes a revernd. 10-10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Good news: Mel Gibsons shines like the true star he is. Mel Gibson can take any script, at all, even this one, and put that Gibson spin: the facial semi-comical expressions and the tension he can create changing from humorous to serious, or that thing he does so well: trying to be serious and being clumsy. Gibson gives a terrific professional performance, and he's fun to watch.Joaquin Phoenix undid his 'heavy' performance as the evil Roman Emperor Commodus in Gladiator. He is convincingly a humble, do good, down home farm helper and younger brother to Gibson's character. What I liked the most is that he doesn't try to out-play Gibson.Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin deserve honorable mention as Gibson's children and also fitting into their parts with Gibson and Phoenix.The bad news: This is a hodge-podge meal of every invasion-of-earth-science-fiction with heavy late fifties, early sixties entree of cold war get-down-in-the-basement-here-comes-the-invasion stew, with a Steven King 'sauce' and a subplot side dish. And it's way overcooked.The non-originality is so obvious at times, that you'll think that this 'thing' is a farce.It's okay for family entertainment, but I must say that it's light years from being an out-of-this-world science fiction. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Lesson Learned...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people who comment on this film's lightweightedness probably do not agree with one of its key themes--the nonexistence of coincidences. One very obvious reason to its warm reception at the box office was people's inner admission to the existence of God.The funnier moments (with Joaquin Phoenix) were a relief at the very tense situations. Joaquin showed a new side to his acting and I absolutely loved it. Mel Gibson, of course (to me especially), was absolutely brilliant. I don't think I'd ever see him in a bad light:-).This movie just grabs you--lets you feel what the Hess family was feeling. We were at the edge of our seats most of the time.Watch this film if you want your faith rekindled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to see this when it first came out, but couldn't make time for it. Am I glad I didn't spend the money to see it in the theater and instead just lost the $3 in renting it. First the good things. Gibson's interaction with the kids was touching and believable. The pace of the film was good and there were some good suspenseful parts that for most folks will make it worth viewing. And there were NO GUNS and really, except for two scenes no real violence. Sorry to be negative, but let's get to the bad things. First the scene with the alien trapped in the farm house, restrained only by a locked door with a table leaning against it. What? It wasn't capable of overcoming that? This lead to the scene later in the movie where Gibson's character notes the trouble the alien had with the blocked door earlier and reasons they can probably get away with the same thing. What kind of incompetent aliens are these? And Gibson's character just leaves it there? The flashback to Gibson's character's wife's accident was just as silly, why couldn't she had just been near death? Why did they have to have such a complicated scenario, and why did she have to seem as chatty as a valley girl on a sugar buzz at the local mall and not seeming as though she had just been in a terrible accident? I don't know if Gibson will ever or has been in a more pacifist role, acting more like Gandhi in responding to the threat to his family, than Braveheart. But in the movie's defense, he was a former man of the cloth. I was surprised to find the same director did The Sixth Sense, which I really liked. But hey, really good alien flicks are tough to pull off succcessfully.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remember Land of the Lost?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*a couple of spoilers ahead*I knew that it had been nothing more than my willing suspension of disbelief that kept me from bailing on this craptacular, cinematic train wreck as soon as they showed one of the aliens on the news. I really wanted to be scared. Honestly. I almost had myself talked into it too. Then they showed the alien walking through the alley, videotaped at the children's party in Mexico. I couldn't fake it anymore. The poor actor lumbering around the alley in the alien costume was a dead ringer for a sleestack, from Land of the Lost. Remember that Saturday morning TV show? Remember the sleestack that could talk? He would walk around in his red dress, with his big pimp necklace on, apologizing for the other sleestacks behavior, because he was from the future, and he could see the flaws in their actions. This movie needed one of the aliens, from the future, in a red mini-dress, to say to us, 'Jeez guys, I'm really sorry about this blowing so hard. I realize this is all little more than a third-rate morality play that Rod Serling would have passed on forty years ago. And please don't ask me why they had to drag us aliens into it. Well, you can figure that out on your own, can't you? No one would pay to see this if it was just about some priest whose wife, then faith, was smooshed by a mumbling veterinarian, would they? No sir, they wouldn't. So they bring us in, with some cockamamie crop circles, a little static on a baby monitor, and PRESTO! It isn't boring anymore. At least that is what was supposed to happen. Oh well. Sorry.'Plenty of holes, large enough to make one wonder if M. Night ever re-read ANYTHING having to do with this film, have been discussed elsewhere. Let's just say the films continuity is dicey at best. I know others have praised both of the child actor's performances, but I thought they were as one dimensional and wooden as that of the adult actors in the film. And whoever did the final alien computer animation should think about doing something else for a living. Perhaps open up a comic book store, or a frozen yogurt place. That has to be the worst thing I have ever seen. The nasty claymation scenes in the Sinbad movies looked better, and scarier, too.So why did I sit through the whole thing? One word. Tak. He still rocks, and with the exception of the horrible computer animation at the end of the film, it looked beautiful. Wow, there was something good about Signs after all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that this story had some serious potential, but when I watched it I soon learned that I was sadly mistaken. The whole alien thing was not explained well at all and there was virtually no chance for character introduction and development (because of the lack of them). I knew what the aliens were doing, but never actually saw anything, so the "impact" of the situation was extremely dulled (for me). I did, however, give the film a 5.0 and I will tell you why. I liked how they did the flashbacks to the accident, therefore explaining two of the seven main characters in the film. Anyone could have done this film and easily substituted the aliens with something else. I felt that the aliens served little purpose in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The good, the bad, the ugly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are lots of good things in this film, written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, of 6TH SENSE fame. He brings you into a world of invaders from space in a different way than most space films. You don't actually see that much of the creatures, but you sense their being there. At times they are terrifying. Also the good involves some pretty spectacular cinematography by the reknown Tak Fujimato, of 6TH SENSE, PHILADELPHIA, THE GLADIATOR and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, to name a few, who never ceases to amaze me in his creative and artistic eye of the camera. He captures the mood right off the bat as he introduces you to some of the most brilliant outdoor scenes of the vast fields of crops and land in the area. Bravo. The bad is in some of the performances. Unfortunately Mel Gibson gives a droll type of presentation of a man in the middle of the mystery. I found him not very creative or believable. I kept waiting for this fine actor to come through. He didn't. His better scenes were with the children. We have yet another Culkin child acting, by the name of Rory. How many of them are there? This one is less inspiring than the others. But his little sister, played by Abigail Breslin, was wonderful and natural. Culkin could take some lessons from her. I felt he was over the top with his performance. I did like Joaquin Phoenix, as Mel's brother. He captured a very simple quiet performance and was quite believable in his interpretation. Let's see more of Phoenix. Good choice in casting. Then there's Cherry Jones as a police officer, also a good and honest performance. I liked her. And then we have Mr. Shyamalan, himself, in the small role of Ray Reddy, who blames himself for the death of Gibson's wife. The ugly is the monster himself. A sort of combination of the predator, the thing and the body snatcher. Looking like an overgrown plant with human form, he appears briefly, but enough to bring the thrills to the movie goers.All in all, this was entertaining, but certainly Mel is much more capable of better work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If it had stuck to the horror, which it so well developed it would've been the good movie it thinks it is, but it has a few bad moments, and a disappointing ending which ultimately detract from what little it does well. I was thrown out of the movie as soon as the director cast himself as a supporting role. His intro was practically a spoof of itself. The camera techniques to avoid seeing the aliens, and letting our imagination scare us was a clever technique (much like Aliens), but as soon as they were seen onscreen (TV bit, and end bit) the whole mystery/terror was quickly erased. Plus the reason for thier leaving is completely obsurd (as well as the end confrontation with the aliens). Lastly the director did his trademork flashback explanation ending, only for this film it wasn't necessary. The twist was that the story wasn't about aliens but about religion/family, and frankly that's not much of a twist, and you really don't need flashback to explain that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a massive fan of Shymalan, I much prefer a film that has something meaty to say than something that tries to dazzle you with effects and promises something it ultimately fails to deliver. Speilberg's CLOSE ENCOUNTERS is one of my favourite films of all time and SIGNS is very much in that vein, it is a film about people, and the way people react to events in different ways. It is also about family, the bonds between family members and what they will do for one another. It was never intended to be an alien movie and that's why I love it so much.One big problem I have with the naysayers is the nitpicking about how the aliens are finally defeated with water. If you listen to the guy on the radio when the family wake up after the invasion, he mentions how he believes they didn't come for the planet as suggested by Morgan's book, but that they came to 'harvest' humans for experiments of some kind. In which case the fact that Earth is 80% water wouldn't have bothered them, plus who's to say they even knew what water was...from space they would have seen a planet ripe for the picking, the reconnaissance teams they sent out would have found water and that's why as Ray Reddy mentions, they eventually placed the crop circles away from water...they perhaps were hoping that humans wouldn't have time to realise they had an aversion to water because it was an attack to gather 'livestock' in a sense, they never intended to set up home on Earth...Every scene is wonderfully constructed, from the rippling glass window that echoes the water imagery throughout to the 'Blair Witch'-style horror tricks in the basement. You never know what's going to happen and Shymalan ratchets up the tension so that the final pay off is magical, wonderous and uplifting.To fully appreciate any of Shymalan's movies you have to immerse yourself in the world and atmosphere he creates and go with it, he understands how to take the viewer on a journey as well as Spielberg or Cameron but his style is all the better for it's minimalistic approach. I was amazed by Mel Gibson, his performance is powerful because it is so understated. He portrays a man burning with inner love but afraid and unsure where to direct it. The children are amazing, so realistic and effective as well as affective. SIGNS comes as close to perfection in a film as I need.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's official. I am not a fan of M.Night Shyamalan and his lame Spielberg-lite nonsense. And would someone please tell Mel Gibson that he doesn't do "emotional" very well or rather he overdoes it all too well. The films other flaws have been pretty well covered in other post but let me add just one more observation. I didn't really get the sense that there was a massive global invasion going on despite all the news coverage that the family watched. I just didn't feel it and that "news" scene where someone got a shot of an alien during a child's birthday party was incredibly anticlimactic despite the news anchor telling us that the footage we were about to see was "very disturbing". Oh please. The "alien" looked just like the guy in that old photo of Bigfoot that turned out to be a hoax.This is definitely the last Shyamalan I will ever bother to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very odd story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw this on DVD, and wonder about the high rating it's received on IMDB. Great acting helped very much with this slow moving piece. But the scares are non-existent, so there really was not much build up in suspense; OK, maybe a bit with the basement scene, but with the slow pacing of the movie, it seemed to take forever to get there. The story has some very odd twists that in the end just don't work.The most interesting parts of the movie were the religious conclusions. I didn't expect a religious theme in this movie, and am always pleased when Hollywood chooses to deal straightforwardly with such difficult topics. Introducing aliens and combining a large series of weird character traits and actions are very odd--and certainly not straightforward--ways to surmise that "God exists." I'm still not 100% certain what to think, and perhaps that's a good thing to say about a movie like Signs. Even so, the movie mainly leaves you with that uncomfortable feeling that it could have been a lot better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I said that Beneath Loch Ness was the scariest thing I had ever seen. I was dead wrong. Signs portrays the meaning of life, and why it is worth living. It also scares you beyond belief. I think Mel Gibson's greatest movie is Signs, no doubt, and every scene they use that frightening music that makes you quiver in fear, and you never know what is coming next. M. Night Shyamalan did a great job on this film, and so did Mel Gibson, they should not quit on horror.User Rating:*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hear many criticize Signs because of perceived flaws in the plot: the aliens would not have landed on a planet 7/10 water; why did Graham have no guns to protect his family; an advanced civilization would wear protective suits when they came to land etc.I believe that in order to appreciate the film you have to back off the analysis of the technical aspects and give it some leeway for minor holes in the plot and see that the story really is about. It is an illustration of Divine Providence. Once the viewer sees this, he can appreciate the film for what it truly is. I found it to be a very poignant illustration of this sometime difficult to comprehend spiritual doctrine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's scary isn't the scare -- it's the waiting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan continues to prove his ability to create genuinely suspenseful mood and scene construction in this film. As in "The Sixth Sense" and "Unbreakable," the strength of the story is not so much in the delivery of an elaborate structure but rather Night's uncanny knack for individual moments. In general, an ex-reverend in rural PA begins to suspect that aliens are invading 1) Earth and 2) more specifically, his backyard. Don't expect "Independence Day" here. Think of the use of silence as a scare tactic in "The Exorcist." Think of anticipation of the threat in 70s horror pictures like "The Legend of Boggy Creek." Think of the best parts in "Close Encounters." Plus the characters are funny, and you care about their struggle to survive the thrills and each other. The movie stars Mel Gibson, but the real attraction is M. Night Shyamalan. Get in line now for his next film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard a lot of good things about "Signs" before finally seeing it, but I was a little let down in the end. The basic plotline is inspired by "War of the Worlds" (explicitly mentioned by one of the characters) but the "meat" of the story concerns the parallel terror happening in a man's daily life on Earth as he deals with the death of his wife.In terms of literary analysis, Shyamalan seems a bit heavy-handed at the film's climax in the way he calls attention to the themes he's (up until then) weaved fairly subtly through his movie. In terms of sci-fi geekdom, the plot device which rescues our heroes in the end is, I'm sorry, completely unbelievable ("Worst plot device ever!") for all kinds of reasons which I'll be glad to explain at length down at the hobby shop.In the end, the movie is exciting, scary and certainly worth seeing, and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that Mel Gibson turns in another great, "human" performance in this movie and that all the rest of the cast is pretty good too. It's a fun piece of brain candy with slight pretensions to high art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>some nice work dampened by a holey plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The other reviews are right on the money: this film looks really good and has that Twilight Zone-like Shyamalan feel to it, but there really are some plot holes that will have you shaking your head and smiling when you stop to think about it -- which, in my case, was _during_ my first (and probably only) viewing. One review I saw said the acting was terrible; I don't think so. Another comment mentioned that the movie was a confusion between different genres of movie and the makers weren't sure what sort of movie they were ultimately trying for, and I think that says it best, and explains why the acting may have seemed poor, at least to some people or in certain places.There were some great shots in Signs, such as Graham's (Mel's) first initial glimpse of one of the aliens -- really spooky! Great job. I will also say the wife's death scene was dramatically compelling and I appreciated the emotional presentation of that event, including the faltering words of the female cop who gets the unenviable duty of explaining the situation to Graham when he arrives on the scene; she almost flubs her line, but that's exactly how real people would be in such a horrible situation: faltering and shaky. Thanks to the editors/directors for putting that take in the final film.Buuuuuut... the best review of all put it simply: can't wait for the sequel when the aliens return with raincoats and crowbars. LOL! My thoughts exactly. Nothing like having to trek alllllllll the way back to Arcturus IV (or wherever -- please no hate mail from astronerds that there is no Arcturus IV) for those little interplanetary raid materials that SOMEONE forgot to put in the ship, huh? Considering there were hundreds of ships, that's a rather serious case of mass forgetfulness.Good try; needed another pass on the plot to be really great. I give it 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen a movie, that for most part, placed some real and possible facts concerning this type of movie. It addresses the reality issue rather than pouring a lot of hype and special effects into it. By gripping the human emotion and engaging our minds, we become part of the movie rather than just sitting back a watching. Mel Gibson played an excellent role and he has placed himself into the arena of harms way. This area has been watched over for years being guarded by big brother and the truth concerning this topic avoided. The timing for this movie was right.Personally I would like to see MR.Night make another documentary applying this movie one step further including the same actors, but on a deeper level. With a return of these aliens with a new perspective on warfare with humans. But, without a whole lot special effects, yet enough to keep the audience on the edge of there seat. With that same eye catching and engaging our minds as Mr.Night did in this wonderful movie--- SIGNS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*possible minor spoilers*this movie starts out ok... builds up tension until its halfway done... and then it crashes and burns later. the alien crop signs are nothing but bull to bring alien movie geeks into the movie theather, the use and treatment of these signs is simplistic at best, no real meaning is attached to them. in the end it switches to other signs completelythe movie is full of cliches altho it does have some good moments, the end result of it all tho is to produce a film that doesnt make you think about things, it just sort of tries to rudely and forcefully stick ideas into your head about everything being predestined, this director cant seem to leave things a bit up in the air, he has to make everything extremely apparent for all the dumb moviegoers who cant figure out the idea behind the title, same thing happened at the end of unbreakable and 6th sense, only these movies were a lot better!!! and hes not going to get it because of all the good comments this movie got.the fact that aliens cant even open doors is stupid, the aliens themselves look brutal and dumb, and theyre naked!!! not the kind of thing youd expect to be capable of space travel and again... how can they be alergic to water??? at least war of the worlds came up with a better idea!!!this thing just tried to put too many things into one turning from a possible ET good alien scenario into a sort of close encounters of the 3rd kind undecided scenario and then into an independance day movie only now the aliens are pansies who cant break down a door and run around naked with nothing but poisonous spines to enslave the local population, ludicrous!! I guess it was all about addressing xenophobia and religion and destiny and so on and so fort..... ughI always wanted to see a movie like this about ppl who are nothing in the great sceme of things during an alien invasion or the group of ensigns in star trek who always seem to get killed. now that Ive seen it I never want to see it again, at least I can thank shymalan for showing us how bad these movies can be.oh and dont forget the crop signs have absolutely no significant role in giving the movie its name.All this said, the movie had the potential to be very good, it does keep you on the edge of your seat for about 3/4s of the movie and delivers a couple of good scares, the ending is what really spoils this film, it just takes the worst possible story tangent and flops into cliche and moral.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>!!Movie Spoliers &amp; Unusual Theory!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SINCERE APOLOGIES, THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. Firstly and foremost the hype surrounding Signs did not live up to the reality. I left the cinema with no definitive feeling!. The performances were good, especially the youngsters, and the film itself was intriguing from the point of view that you were waiting for something to happen. But in the end nothing happens and I felt a little let down.I put myself under the impression that a big crescendo was building and unfortunately, this was a mistake. I did however enjoyed the movie but, only afterward when I believed what the theory was behind the film (maybe). Hence the spoilers as opposed to a review.Here's the Spoilers!!!! (May I just add, that I do not, under normal circumstances, appreciate spoilers. One of the most wonderful commodities of film is that is can be want you want it to be and therefore I do apologise for providing spoilers, but on this film an exception is made!)My interpretation of Signs was that I was watching Independence Day from a sideward view! - A story that tells how one small family in a remote part of the US, not to far from a major US city, dealt with an invasion of Aliens!!Evidence forthwith.The director, Mr Shyamalan (who without any doubt is a very talented director), has crafted a well constructive thought provoking film that has certainly produced an abundance of healthy discussion.OK evidence and Spoilers to my theory! (May I just add I am no fan of Independence Day, nor have I seen the film many times, so please feel free to judge the evidence).* Signs was set over a 3-4 day period in the summer, 45 miles from Philadelphia. - Philadelphia was an initial prime target in ID (short for Independence Day from here on in).* The first telling evidence was the aerial shot of India. We see multiple areas (major cities) where the UFO's or corn circles are stationed. This interpretation is down to the viewer. - In ID a similar shot was used depicting the aliens above the US.* Signs makes continued references to the visitors being either hostile or friendly? It's 50/50, black or white...which one are you? - In ID some believe the visitors to be friends some do not.* I would say that the climax of the movie depicts the Aliens, albeit inconclusively (I Agree), as hostile. - This is fairly clear in ID.* The (saucer shaped) UFO's start to appear over many cities in the world - and they just seem to hang over them motionlessly for a couple days seemly doing nothing. - This again is clear and very similar to the events in ID.* A baby monitor is used in Signs as the family discovery of codes being transmitted. - Televisions come to mind for ID.* In Signs its mentioned that these codes may refer to a possible countdown to an invasion/or other!. - Goldblum discovers this in ID.* Signs makes reference of the use of hand to hand combat. (Armies) - In ID Will Smith gives us a Birdseye view of them.* When confined to the Basement: Merrill mentions that the radio transmission states that the Aliens have started to leave and that many people have been killed. - Part of the plot in ID.* Then for me, the clincher: The TV broadcast at the end (near end anyhow) of the film mentions that the Aliens had been defeated with the help of an old fashion form of communication (Morse code?) that originated out of the Middle East. - The woeful ending we are giving in ID.What makes me more convinced of this, is why would a talented and intelligent director as M. Night Shyamalan make a film about aliens with so many (arguably) similarities to a recently poor movie about aliens?There are numerous indiscretions, agreed. Like the water causing damage to the aliens (the Wizard of Oz perhaps!). But I see Signs told from the characters perspective of how they defended there small part of the world in the midst of confusion. Hence the visual differences.In which case I summarise by saying that I believe the director has had a little fun with this movie and I found it to be more of a comedy then a thriller. This is Independence Day told from an alternative perspective.For me this makes the film original and I take my hat off to that. But this is far from a great!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to this one, as friends reported, "a really good ghost story" and the trailers suggested strong suspense. It was tense for a while, but by its conclusion, this film left a sour taste in my mouth. It seems "symbolic", alright, of a US state of mind tuned up to xenophobic hysteria, in the wake of 9-11.Lacking imagination, all the writers and filmakers could come up with is a confrontation with laughable invading monsters lacking feeling or rational motive, thwarted by fearful but righteous and practical Earthlings, who win out 'cause they're hewers of wood and drawers of water--salt of the earth types. And the Lord, too, IS, on their side, and delivers up miracles to order.This being Hollywood, we could have at least been treated to some decent effects--sound effects aside. It really is rather low-budget. Pitter-pattering feet were about the biggest scare that Signs could muster. I think Hollywood, or this director, anyway, thinks an American audience hears pitter-pattering at the barricades, and served up some signs made to order.</fullReview>

Because logic is totally sacrificed to allow full play to symbolism.My biggest problem is that neither of the two brothers bother get a weapon until it is almost too late, or even plan elementary tactics. They neglect to secure their dog, who is their most reliable alert device. And what Pennsylvania farm doesn't have at least a shotgun around? (Neither of these wussies would last a week on the Ponderosa.) The `Home Alone' kid would have nailed at least five aliens with booby traps. Plus in a survival situation, young children get to vote? (Children are SO WISE.)As stated before, these errors are deliberate by the filmmakers, so that all serves the symbolic needs of the tortured inner world of the Gibson character. But I still don't know if this film is triumphantly politically correct, or a subtle satire of political correctness. My favorite scene is the brief one with the recruiting sergeant, who is a borderline psycho and absolutely right in his prognosis!Sci-fi buffs will want `more' in terms of scenario and special effects. But despite its deliberate defects, this film `works', has some genuinely scary moments, and is well worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but with big plot holes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs is a good movie, and I enjoyed it. But it had flaws. I really think there are two separate points that bother most people.The first is the way the film deals with faith and predestination. The film takes the beliefs of many Christian groups about predestination to their logical conclusion.The second bigger problem is due to the incredibly bizarre behavior and nature of the aliens, and the very strange reaction of the humans to the invasion.***Spoilers ahead***Suspension of disbelief only goes so far. Some things need an explanation or they ruin the entire movie. Yes, I know Signs wasn't really about aliens. But that doesn't mean that the aliens shouldn't make some kind of sense. I'm also willing to ignore things like the baby monitor that picks up space aliens and the book on aliens that is way too accurate. Those are minor things. I'll even overlook how a small boy manages to calmly kill a large enraged dog with a fork. But, some things were just too major to overlook.The aliens were burned and injured by water. That's possible I guess. As I remember it, we are immune to water because proteins don't dissolve readily in water. But it might be possible for life to be based on a substance that did dissolve in water, like sugars or something.But an alien like that wouldn't just go walking around on Earth naked. Even humidity would hurt them. One rainstorm and they would melt away. They would last about as long as a naked human would in the sulfuric acid atmosphere of Venus.Water is very common in the universe, very common. There's no way that any alien species wouldn't realize water was harmful to them. It would be like humans not knowing about ammonia or methane.The aliens crossed thousands of light years and they can't even manage to break into an isolated farmhouse? They didn't have a disintegrator ray gun or even a crowbar? They couldn't find a crowbar? They don't know how to start a fire? Nothing the aliens did in any way exhibited intelligence beyond that of chimpanzees.They just came to Earth, made a few crop circles, harassed people for a bit, then started kidnapping people. All of it seems very, very, implausible and this is from someone that has already accepted for the sake of the movie that there are freaking aliens running around on Earth.I guess I could explain it by speculating that the aliens we saw weren't intelligent and were instead a semi intelligent species that was transported to Earth by the intelligent alien species.But Earth has nothing a star traveling species needs. There are thousands of cubic miles of metal rich rock floating around in space. Water is also very plentiful in space too, not that these aliens need water. The only thing on earth that can't be found in space is life. But what good would this be to Aliens, except in a zoo. OK, so maybe the alien plan was to capture humans and put us in a zoo.I'm really having to stretch here. So far we have sugar based aliens that send their semi intelligent slaves to capture humans for zoo animals. I guess that works. The crop circles might have been something to mark pickup areas to the semi intelligent aliens or something.But the real question is, why didn't the family have a gun? That was a rural are where nearly everyone has a few firearms. Even if they didn't have guns in the house they would have managed to get one from somewhere when the problems started. They didn't even have a good pitchfork or axe to fight with.There's no rational explanation for that.I've always thought that people go to ridiculous extremes to explain things like crop circles, which are obviously man made. Perhaps the intent of this movie was to show how absurd some of those beliefs are. On that level it worked very well.Other than that though, I thought Signs was pretty good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In Defense of Signs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to the theatrical success of this movie and high user rating "Signs" would have to be considered a popular and well-regarded movie. But if one were to just read the user comments on this site, it would appear that this movie was a total flop and a total waste of time for anyone who hasn't seen it yet. I have to respectfully disagree- I found this movie (watched late at night by myself) to be totally engrossing and entertaining....MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD... First of all, many people had a problem with the aliens invading a planet that was mostly water, a substance which they had to know was extremely hazardous to them. I thought the movie made it clear that this was a desperate action by a desperate race on the brink of extinction. I'm sure that they would rather inhabit a world more hospitable to them- but the odds of them blundering into a planet that suits their needs perfectly are astronomical considering the vast distances between stars and the sheer infinite number of directions to travel. Just finding a planet that offered an atmosphere they could breathe and temperatures they could tolerate would be a godsend! Maybe they would just inhabit earth as a forward base while they continued to search for a more suitable planet to colonize. Perhaps they had the technology to alter earth's climate once they were established here, if they had the ability to travel to other worlds, would this be so far fetched? This "plot hole" isn't really that big of an issue to the central story, in fact I don't even think it is a plot hole at all! I found the minimalist approach in regard to slowly unveiling the aliens very intense and scary. The build-up to first seeing the alien scout on the TV and the scene with the alien in the pantry both had me on the edge of my seat! The hairs stood on the back of my neck when first glimpsing the image of the alien in the alley on the news clip... and I can't tell you the last time a scene freaked me out like that. Also, I found the whole issue of a man losing his faith after the death of his wife totally believable. No one I talked to after watching this movie thought this plotline was ill-conceived or not feasible.Unless there are glaring, ill- thought out major faults in a movie, harping on small, under-explained, or misunderstood themes does not ruin a movie for me. Some of these "plot holes" expressed by others are more suited in my opinion for "slip-ups.com" instead of a thoughtful review on this site. In the movie "Hoosiers," it was never explained how the point-guard named Buddy rejoined the team after getting kicked off the team along with his friend Merle. He just magically reappeared one game. It turns out that the scene with him rejoining was lost on the editing room floor. But that minor point never ruined the movie in my mind. Maybe through the editing process some of these themes so many of you had trouble with would have been better explained, but at the cost of a 3+ hour movie. Sometimes it's better not to dwell on the minutiae, but rather step back and see the work as a whole. This criticism is not directed at anyone that didn't like the movie overall, but rather for those who chose to just let a few points that they couldn't reason out or use imagination to overcome let ruin a movie that so many of us (7.5 overall rating on this site) have found to be well worth our time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than just an alien thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan's alien thriller is great on many levels. The acting is great, the story is great, and the directing is great. It is a suspense thriller and rightly so. You are on the edge of you seat the entire time. You are wondering what's happened in Graham Hess'(Mel Gibson) past, and what the future holds for him. It is a bit creepy, but it is more than that. It is about one man's struggle to refind religion. He struggles with the loss of his wife and the events of today. He wonders why he is being put through all of this horror both past and present, but he finds that it was meant to be. That there is some greater purpose at work here than what we see.

		<fullReview>I liked the suspense this movie created, however it lead to a disappointing climax and fell short of my expectations of the director. There were too many plot holes to list, but I will try.***SPOILERS***First of all, this movie was incredibly slow for what little the ending provided as far as relief from the buildup it caused. I could have handled it if it hadn't have had such a disappointing and pointless ending. Bo apparently has dreams of what is going to happen in the future, yet nobody seems to address this (except for her brother, who mentions it once). She stated several time that she had a dream that all of this was going to happen but it was all largely ignored. She said there was a monster outside her room, could she have a glass of water. The dad takes her back into her room, but doesn't even bring up the monster.The dog thing wasn't followed up on very much. One of the dogs freaks out and pees on the floor, then off camera apparently attacks Bo and the kid stabs him in the neck with a fork. Where did he get the fork? The dog thing was brought up in what it seemed as "for the moment" storytelling in order to explain what was about to happen, but there was no explanation *why*. This also happens with the crops. Later in the movie they mention that it *was* for locating areas.The issue with the preacher's wife was too drawn out, with him having partial dreams about what happened to her. As someone else here pointed out, it is ridiculous to imply that the wife died when she did in order to give her brother in-law a hint on how to hurt the alien, and Hello, I don't know about anyone else, but if I am standing in a room up against a hostile creature, alien or human, and I have a bat, you better believe I am going to use it, without having to remember some cryptic message from a dying family member 6 months before. The son is just plain weird. One minute he is fine, and then the next he is telling his father he hates him for letting his mother die. What? At this point of the movie, we don't know how his mother died, so I think this was lost on me. The kid borrows a book from the store about alien invasion and as they are looking through it, happen upon a page with a picture of a house being set on fire by rays from a UFO, then panning out to the yard where there is an adult and 2 children dead on the ground. The preacher says "Hey that looks like our house." Even that early in the game, I would have packed my stuff and gone to the lake. Had he have asked his daughter, she probably would have said something like "I had a dream about this" and they could have avoided the whole thing altogether.What happened to the sheriff?When the family comes up from the basement, they turn on the TV to hear reports of the aliens leaving, having been defeated "by primitive means" by some of the humans in other countries. Then they say they have no further information. Now. If someone figures out how to make the aliens leave, why wouldn't they broadcast that information everywhere? They send out emergency alerts telling people what to do in case of an emergency. Apparently the news stations in this movie wanted people to figure it out for themselves.Why is it that only one character in the movie, and seemingly the world, had the inclination to go towards water? He shared his theory with the preacher who decided to stay in his home, and board up the windows and doors, sentencing his family to certain death, and KNOWING it. He saw the picture of his burning house, his dogs were acting vicious, he knew the aliens were hostile because one tried to grab him while it was locked in a pantry. He had to chop that ones fingers off so he could get away.When in the basement, they realize that the aliens aren't really trying to get in through that door, they are just trying to distract everyone so they could come in through the coal chute. Once the director delivers a healthy scare to the viewers, showing an alien hand coming out of the coal chute about the grab the boy, the aliens grow quiet. Completely. Why did the family spend more time in the basement while Morgan was having an asthma attack? Why didn't they turn on the baby monitor right away to see if they could detect any activity in the main house?Why didn't anyone check the water for contamination? If this girl was so neurotic that she would complain about the water since she was little, why was dad asking so many questions and acting so confused about the water glasses being all over. They gave the impression at the beginning of the movie that this was strange behavior for the girl so I was really surprised to hear that it was common. It would have worked had someone realized that Bo was predicting the future, because to the aliens, the water was contaminated, however, once again, nobody even said anything. They just happened upon it by accident and paid no attention to the countless times that the preacher got a strange look on his face when he saw all the glasses all over the place.What was Ray's job in this film? He obviously wasn't known well by the family, the son asked if "that is him" when they were in the restaurant. If Ray had just killed Morgan's mother 6 months ago, wouldn't the kid know him? And let's say he didn't know him. How did the preacher know it was Ray calling him. There were other people in the town and he obviously didn't have caller ID. It could have been anyone saying "father" and then hanging up. Had they have gone into this a bit more, it could have worked, but this guy was obviously not a close family friend. Oh, and even in rural areas they have *69. They even have it for rotary phones.The preacher who lost his way thing was really well done in "From dusk till dawn" It was completely pointless in this movie. So the guy lost his faith, big deal. He still loved his family and it really had no effect on how he dealt with protecting them. He gets his faith back because he realized Morgan's lungs were closed when the alien sprayed poison gas in his face? (Again, it had just been discovered that the aliens had poison gas, and nothing further was mentioned). There were too many fly-by-night explanations and not enough curiosity by the cast. Even the sheriff acted like she had an idea what was going on, but she seemed more intent at hinting around instead of just coming out and saying something (before disappearing). I expect way more from Shamalan. I think that just like in "unbreakable", he is still expecting to fly by the notoriety that came with The Sixth Sense and proved, instead, to be a big disappointment.The only thing good about this movie is the comedy shared by Mel Gibson and Juaquin Phoenix. Juaquin was hilarious and I loved the jokes he made. I usually don't like the movies that he is in. Funny, I hated this movie, but I loved him in it.3/10***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Good For Alien Enthusiasts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film wasn't meant for the segment of movie-goers who want Alien war battles and special effects that are dazzling to the eye. It is made for sensitive people who love to think during a movie and be given good, juicy characters who are dealing with heavy stuff in their lives. I get tired of hearing people bitch about this film not having enough special effects or the story was too boring for them. Those individuals should never see a Shyamalan film because he's too good a director for them. They don't want to think or have to do any work while watching a movie. I rate "Signs" an easy 8 out of 10. The actors have a blast with the script and I had fun being teased by the story and it's twists throughout. Shyamalan is one of our truly great young directors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>enjoyable, although not very original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HG Wells should have been given a credit for co-writing the script for "Signs"; it bears far too much resemblence to "War of the Worlds". Lack of originality aside, I found this movie to be engrossing and often genuinely scary. There's also plenty of humor and some thought-provoking dialogue. Sci-fi genre fans will probably not care too much for "Signs", as the focus of the movie is not on technology, aliens, or babes in tight outfits; rather, it concentrates on one family's experiences and how they cope with the threat, with each other, and questions of faith. It's not a great movie, but it's definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sign says "this is crap"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT I was confused over the intent of the movie. It seemed like it was supposed to be some psychological sci-fi melodrama, it succeeded in boring the hell out of me with no pay off for the time I spent watching it. What level was this movie operating on? If it was supposed to psychological why was it so stupid? And if it wasn't supposed to be thought provoking.why was it so boring? My point is, if we are to believe that there really was a world wide alien invasion-why did the Mel Gibson family shelter themselves in their own world (house) with no contact to the outside world.this was probably the intent of the film. Personally I think if this really happened I would be holed up with my neighbors in a church or school and passing out the firearms like candy. Or when Mel found that alien in the pantry.he didn't call the authorities or tell anybody (in the outside world) he runs home and mumbles to his family he saw an alien in a pantry. So, because I could not suspend my disbelief enough to except this story and the behavior of its participants..I started thinking this movie may be an analogy for something else.and this suddenly made the movie more interesting. I spent a good amount of time contemplating (wrongly) that this movie was actually an analogy for Terrorism, and with that frame of mind it makes a lot of since. However, the movie was actually about aliens.silly aliens that couldn't escape from a pantry, (but yet could navigate a space ship?) Silly aliens that scratched at doors and windows, Silly aliens that snuck around outside little kids birthday parties and silly aliens that would melt with water. (ingenious how the little girl had a water phobia and there happened to be water glasses all over the place.even places she couldn't reach) Or if the movie was really an analogy for Mel's inner struggles, once again all hopes were dashed by those silly aliens. Were the aliens supposed to represent something else? I keep thinking if they had this would have been a much better film. In closing, I respect M. Night Shyamalan because he gets to do something he likes for a living and he even gets to act.but come on..if your trying to say something with the movie say it, or if your not `pick up the pace!'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a disappointment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the trailers for this film I was hoping for a really great story of alien intrigue, perhaps a cut above an X-Files plot line based on Shyamalan's reasonable but perhaps patchy efforts to date.Boy what a disappointment. I'm beginning to wonder if I saw the same film as everyone else based on the votes here. The story was just a total mess and the character behaviour frankly not believable. The coincidences in the story were just totally meaningless and not backed up by any intelligence. They just seemed thrown in because they solved the lack of plot substance. I guess the actors can't be blamed, but they also seemed weak and not believable but I would put this down to poor direction.In summary I was expecting so much and yet got so little. I hope Shyamalan works a bit harder on the story and direction for his next film.I guess if you really don't mind poorly constructed plot and are a total die-hard fan of any story with UFO's and aliens in you *might* like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I thought M Night was suppose to be a good film maker...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was dragged to this film over the summer and I have regretted the move ever since. I don't watch many Hollywood films and this just confirmed my belief that 99% of those films are not worth handing $7.50-$10.00 dollars over for. Ah the plot holes, where to begin, there are so many. Now I'm going to get attacked and people are going to say, "But your missing the point if you overanalyze the plot, listen to the message!" No, actually, if you like this film you are missing the point of fine film making. Great films do not contain such horrible plots as what follows.SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!1. M Night Shamlyan's character should be in jail. He killed a woman just six months ago with his car. Maybe under some obscure loophole he gets out of jail time, but at the very least his driver's license should get taken away for more then six months. Then the humor of this is that in every scene he is seen driving.2. The aliens creating super spaceships, but lacking in any type of protection or weaponing what so ever.3. Said super spaceships hiding themselves during the day, but happily turning on their lights so that they CAN be seen when humans normally would not be able to see them.4. The fact that the signs in the cornfield of the main family in the movie fail to cause any type of stir. Yes yes, Gibson yells to no one imparticular that he isn't going to report the Signs, but the problem is that he already has and that many people know about them: the police officer, the troublemaking brothers that the police officer said she talked to, and I'm assuming her superiors, who would have loved to report something big to the government.5. Gibson's character's failure to do anything that aligns with human instinct. I'm going to head to where more people are as opposed to try and take on the aliens that I know are going to come on my farm land.6. Then again Gibson's character does know that the aliens for some reason can not break through wooden structures and have nothing to help them break anything! Yeah, that's not a plot hole!7. The aliens' failure to realize that water hurts them. The aliens had done many scouting attempts according to the movie. Not once, not ONCE in all of their years had they encountered rain?Okay, there are more plot holes, but those are the big ones folks. See, good movies do not have these plot holes. Sure you can have a good message, but that doesn't give you the artistic right to have a crappy plot. A bad plot takes away from the movie of course, if you like this movie, you obviously have been watching way too many Hollywood films. Please, if you like this movie, check out the following films: Amelie, The Red Violin, O Brother Where Art Thou, Life is Beautiful, and Sex and Lucia. Those films are truly beautiful and might just change your life forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>standing alone in my opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought M. Night Shamayalan did an excellent job with this film. Though I did heavily anticipate viewing it, I am a difficult critic to impress. Watching the movie, I was reminded of genres along the lines of Hitchcock where the real action takes place in the mind of the viewer, with help from clever sound effects, and excellent acting on the screen.This film is not for those who need graphic representation or a storyline spelled out before them. Those with an imagination will enjoy the movie.I also enjoyed the detail the picture paid attention to; i.e. corn stalks bending but not breaking-this plays heavily into the modern urban myth about alien crop circles.I was quite surprised this film was not rated in the top 250 on IMDB. I thought it was excellent. Keep at it M. Night, there are intelligent filmgoers in your audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimately Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSI recently viewed Signs for the first time on DVD. I was very excited about this film after viewing the trailers just prior to its release, and the wait for its release to video was long in coming. I have been a great fan of hard core science fiction since I was a teenager, and I have always been fascinated with the possibility that we may not be alone in the universe. Films such as War of the Worlds, Earth vs the Flying Saucers and Close Encounters of the Third Kind were all awesome in their own right and for their time. Although I found a lot to like, I must say I found Signs ultimately disappointing.Shyamalan has proven himself to be a moviemaker of the highest caliber having directed the brilliant Sixth Sense. In Signs, his talent again comes through in his ability to grip the audience with rising tension. I found myself in the movies grip, anxiously awaiting the payoff. How was the Hess family, and Gibson's character's loss of faith going to play out? I cared about the Hess family and their predicament. Imagining myself in the Hess' place at the moment of seeing the alien figure on top of the roof of the neighboring building left me squirming in my seat. The movies pacing is fine, the acting adaquete, but the climax left me feeling I had been cheated.Perhaps it is my love of hard core sci-fi that was the root cause of my opinion that this movie failed in the end. The aliens were just too easy to defeat. How is it that a race of beings with the technology to cross the void of space could so easily be tossed aside by just sprinkling a little H2O on them? How would any self respecting alien super race have individuals that cannot find a way to get out of a closet, or break through a basement door? Give me a break.The problem with this movie, and so many more Hollywood sci-fi flicks is that the writer or writers just lack the imagination and the general knowledge of science to really blow true sci-fi afficionados away. It is in that regard that a movie like the Matrix was so brilliant. Someone with some real imagination sat down and penned a screenplay that truly stretched the imagination of filmgoers and hard core sci-fi buffs in that one. In Signs, the aliens are laughable in their ineptitude. I did not see how having faith had much to do with the alien races demise. This was an alien race of idiots.Signs has already greatly appealed to the general film viewing public. It will also appeal to the fans of horror/suspense in that the movie will grip you with tension. It will most likely be disappointing to many hard core sci-fi viewers like me that would like to see a little more thought put into the powers of aliens, and how they are defeated. Is it truly that filmakers lack the necessary imagination to produce high quality sci-fi, or is it that they just do not care enough?</fullReview>

I was left unmoved and mostly bored by UNBREAKABLE and found hisSIGNS to be boring, pretentious, preachy, poorly acted (except forCherry Jones),and an all around mess. Want something about loss offaith, read Graham Greene, especially his plays THE LIVING ROOM and THEPOTTING SHED. Want something about extraterrestrials?

		<shortDescription>Now I know what I didn't like about Unbreakable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this movie made it clear to me what it was about Unbreakable that bothered me.As with Unbreakable, I was anxious to see this movie and had high expectations for both of them. My anticipation was kept alive throughout both movies through the entire thing, until the end, at which point I found myself saying "Oh, is that it?"I don't think the problem is with the movie itself, or the plot, or the characters or even the acting. All of the above are great. I think there is something in the director's style that creates some melodramatic intensity, a severe, serious tone throughout, through the use of silence, scoring, and visual cues that tell you "something BIG is about to happen."Something BIG either never happens, or when it does, it's not quite as big as you were expecting. Once the movie is over, you don't feel a sense of disappointment in the movie, but rather think "Did I miss something?"Even though Mr. Shyamalan is addressing "serious" things in his movies, it appears to me that his movies take themselves TOO seriously. The humor he injects isn't even for levity - it's used as a contrast device to make everything else seem that much more serious.Suspense? I felt myself not so much in suspense as just annoyed. The line between the two is blurry in this film. Your attention is purposely directed away from the action at key moments, for no real reason other than to keep you in the dark and "on the edge." As far as creating suspense goes I think this is cheating. If you're going to direct my attention elsewhere, please direct it towards something vital to the story.I feel even more conflicted, because it's not that Night is not a good director, in fact he may be TOO good. He's like an author that gets his point across halfway through the book, but continues to try and prove a point that you already understand. This movie has great themes, important issues, great symbolism, and dialogue that would also be great if it, like the movie, did not take itself too seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the them of faith done for ages 5-7.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well i just saw signs for the second time on dvd and i must say my opinion has not changed. I think it's way to simple and it's view on faith is way to simplistic and kinda dull and pandering. I like alot of how the movie is filmed though. I think it builds tension well and has some creepy and somewhat scary moments but in the end it's paper thin story just does not give much reason to care. For it to have worked as a thriller it needed to be much more dark and driven in its structure i think.M Night says he based it on "the birds" and "night of the living dead" and "invasion of the body snatchers(1956)", but it comes across more as "Watcher in the woods" but without all the thrills and violence that watcher had. You think I'm kidding but I'm not. *****Possible Spoilers***** The them of the film which seems to be the ability to regain your faith after tragic things have happened in your life or how people keep faith in thier lives has been done much better in other films. I would say david cronenbergs movie "CRASH" is about how people keep faith in a world that seems devoid of things to trust or believe in. It shows this very well and in a very interesting way without lying to audience with sappy rhetoric. Speaking of which i think "It's a wonderful life" sappy as it is is a much better film about the same thing. It has much more character and feeling than Signs even attempts to. Also films like The addiction and Bad Lieutenant provide questions and answers about lost faith in much more honest terms. I don't know what i was supposed to get out of signs but i would much rather watch invaders from mars myself. if anyone else got something out of this more than the overly simple theme then kudos to you because i dont think the director is clever enough to put more into it and having just watched the documentary with the dvd, called making of signs, he proves my point. Lets hope Mr. Nights next film tries to explore something a bit deeper than this one did. Don't get me wrong the themes of faith and losing one's faith are deep but the way they are treated in Signs is not. A great comparison to find out what i am talking about would be to watch the other films i listed right after signs or better yet watch mike leighs "Naked" that should get ya thinking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can you say false advertising?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for this film, I was immediately interested in seeing it. I concluded from the trailer that this film would be a science fiction film about an alien invasion of Earth. And although the film does involve an alien invasion, it has almost nothing to do with the real meaning of the film. Having seen the trailer before viewing this film, I had high expectations of how much I would enjoy it, but even before the closing credits I was extremely disappointed with what I saw.I think this film was advertised the way it was in order to attract more viewers, or perhaps certain types of viewers, not to accurately describe the film (which in itself is not that surprising). Although it was fairly popular at the box office, it seems that most people were not satisfied. Just check out IMDB's discussion board to see how many people strongly dislike the film. So my words of advice for this film are "don't judge a book by its cover" (or a film by its trailer).</fullReview>

Mysteriously done, sometimes stunningly complex and beautiful, they're used as a gee whiz prop early on and then disregarded as fast as a highway sign at 60 mph. The pacing in the film seems quite a bit off too - slow and plodding as compared to the immediacy of the strange events.

It's got a certain B-movie appeal, but the dreadful philosophics and the turgid family issues that arise are completely unnatural and overripe. Mel Gibson and family seem to have been invaded by body snatchers long before the aliens arrive to wreak havoc. A little more dark humor and a lot less preachy enlightenment would have gone a long way in making this project more enjoyable. And who's not tired of Mel Gibson playing the stalwart, fatherly-figure type.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wanted to hate it as much as I wanted to like it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What threw me first off was that SIGNS used the aliens as a tool instead of them being the movie. SIGNS is a telling movie about human emotion and tragedy. The props in the movie that every 'User Comment' hated is beside the point. You cannot hate that. But what I did hate is that they sold the human emotion terribly. The movie stunk, where the camera did not save the actors and the build-up dwindles to disappointment. And sadly, I hated SIGNS even more because I still became caught up in the 'alien' story when it came to, even when it was obvious there was no reason to.Widower, ex-pastor Graham Hess and his family wake one morning to find crop circles on their land, and the dogs barking deliriously. It begins as a joke, but boy oh boy, is the joke on them.I will not give away the movie, but the aliens obviously picked the wrong planet, whatever their intentions. I will give credit for the pace of the movie, and certain sound effects (not the alien sounds, heck no) are put off rather well. I was sold on the movie, I wanted to like it and had to like it because of the sound effects, the music, the atmosphere and pace of SIGNS. And yet, I was not sold on SIGNS, wanted to hated it and had good reason to because the direction was horrible, using unrealistic, in your face tactics to scare the viewer and rough camera views that makes the actors look like actors, with clunky dialogue, an uninvolving story about loss and tragedy and a rather dumbed-down climax. It is a family movie, but I would not recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting but unsatisfying approach to religion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs is a good suspense movie. It works in a slow pace with the 'keep it simple stupid' motto. We hardly see the aliens, but they are constantly felt around the protagonist. It worked for Ridley Scott in `Aliens' and its working quite good for Shyamalan.(small spoilers - coming up)Mel Gibson's kids are scary as hell. They have lost their mother, and as the fargo-like policewoman says ` has gone through a lot'. Even considering that, they are still very `stiff' in their performance. However I think this was intended from the director's side, since it gives them an eerie radiance - almost as if them being kids makes them more susceptible to the alien's communication. Never the less - it doesn't seam realistic that kids should behave like that, not even if they were brought up the way they are (by a strict reverend).(Big spoilers coming up)Considering the genre, I very much like the idea that the aliens are not portrayed as the superior beings we are used to. Instead they are portrayed as being desperate and almost weak. That itself pulls my rating up, since it helps nuance the idea of extra terrestrial life.Also the revenge motive attributed to the alien scout that Gibson mutilates, gives the visitors a more `human' touch.However: The way that Gibsons character loses his belief doesn't convince me. And the whole idea about preordained destiny I loathe. The movie implies not only that Gibson lost his wife so that he later would save his son, but also that Phoenix baseball career had the same purpose (cf. scene in military office).The way the ending plays out shows such hesitation from all involved that one doubts it's realistic. However - considering that the alien most likely was left behind, and the terror the humans are in - maybe.That the alien has poison coming out of its arms, does not imply hunting (as for instance a snake) but rather some form of bio-bodyarmour, which we cannot see.All these weaknesses can however also be attributed to the high amount of water in the atmosphere that maybe weakens them.The way human fear is portrayed is humorous, and a good reminder of our irrational approach to things. On the same account it gives the audiance a needed breather from the heavy / horror stuff.Because of the less than creditable account of a reverends faith and the fate/destiny theme, I was constantly annoyed. From that I give 6/10.However - If you are willing to buy that stuff, its at least 7, maybe 8/10.To pull the movie down because of unrealistic aliens, is to speculate about things we can't speculate about. We don't know were they came from or why, and we don't know how our atmosphere affects them. I think this is one of Shyamalans points, and also one of the prerequisites for watching any movie.So it all comes down to belief - not aliens!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Simple Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I can't say that the film is as good as his previous work. I still feel "Unbreakable" was his best film. I did think the plot to this was very weak and predictable and not at all as good as his other efforts, but something about how simple this was appealed to me. I love that it's slow and takes it's time. I truly enjoyed the characters and came to care about them. It frustrates me that it fell so short when it had such potential. Phoenix was excellent in this and pretty much stole the show. Also the little boy played by Rory Culkin was very good and a much better actor than his older brother. The little girl was adorable and I really enjoyed the touch of her obsession with water. Gibson did a good job and it was nice to see him in a role were he wasn't the almighty hero with all the answers. In this he was a broken man who really didn't know how to handle the situation. His weakness was scorned by his children. I think there were strong performances from everyone even the local cop who I thought was fantastic. If you can get around the sub-plot of the aliens it's a very nice film. That's right I said sub-plot. The main point isn't about regaining faith either. The main point is that events in our lives happen for reasons we couldn't comprehend, but they happen for a reason. For people bent out shape over the religious aspects I just have to say get over it. It was a very simple film with a simple message. I enjoyed it and the people in the audience with me seemed to enjoy it enough to clap at the end. Although not everyone applauded I think we all got more than our money's worth.

		<shortDescription>Don't believe the hype...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wish I had taken that bit of advice before seeing this movie. This movie was billed as the scariest movie you'll see all year...sorry, it wasn't. What is supposed to be the scariest parts in the film they showed in trailers on TV. I was really disappointed in this film. I adore Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix--both are truly gifted actors and they did well in this film, don't get me wrong but I was always waiting for the story to actually start! When it finally did ten minutes later the credits are rolling. It isn't a horrible film, there were some good parts but it definitely didn't live up to the hype. It just wasn't that scary. If you want scary or rather creepy, rent "Night of the Living Dead" and watch it with the lights out. Now THAT'S creepy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As in typical Shyamalan's movie script could be filmed in 30 min, movie and gets simplier in every next movie. Some good thrilling scenes (corn field and basement), but that's not enough and sense of final does not at all 'connect' with the rest of the movie (!?).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun and good drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melly gibson was great in this. So was everyone else. Its a good movie. Its about a farmer living with his 2 kids and his brother. When the kids see a big marking in the cornfield they and farmer Hess and his brother start seeing weird things going on and soon aliens are taking over earth. Farmer Hess's wife got killed in a car crash and the family including Hess's brother fought them with water. The aliens would die get hurt if water touched them. At the end when 1 alien is left tring to kill the boy ( one of the 2 kids ) the brother picked up his bat and swings away because farmer hess told him to hit the alien. Hess told him to because the wife's last words were if the children or you were ever hurt swing away. This movie was great it wasn't the best horror drama in the world but it was great. Farmer hess was played by Melly gibson which he did great and Joaquin Phienox played his brother which he did great acting too. 8/10. Good drama Rated PG-13 for some language and sequences of frighting moments. This one you shoudn't miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not too bad and certainly well done on suggesting what is going on rather than spending millions on special effects. I am absolutely not against special effects, but when they take over a movie, like they often do, instead of adding to it,... Some very good placed humor as well and Gibsons children are absolutely the stars of the movie.However, it is pretty unbelievable they get so few information about what is going on the whole time and the aliens - again - look like they always do: like humans, slim and green - Ouch !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flaws + Explanations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read quite a few "flaws" that people have brought up, here's where I stand:-The Aliens: They supposedly planned on taking over the planet through hand-to-hand combat to preserve the resources, but this seems a bit weak to me. The "battle" scene was sorry, no fight whatsoever.-In the beginning of the movie, they were quick and agile, able to leap to the top of the roof. What happened? In the film in south america that was on the news, it was walking slowly, ignoring the nearby humans. Even in the battle scene, the alien looked like it had a stick up its butt. How could an alien that can leap up a 2-story roof get trapped in a kitchen pantry?Water: The humidity theory that people have presented is worthless, it was obviouse that the aliens had regenerative traits, because the alien who had contact with water disolved a little, then his flesh renewed itself.-I don't remember exactly why, (as ive only seen this movie once) but I remember thinking that the alien that poisoned the kid was the one whose finger was chopped off, this would be another display of their regenerative abilities.-So it's clear that a small portion of water wouldn't hurt them much, slow them down at its worst.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I realy liked Signs. It was one of the best movies that i have seen in a long time. I saw this movie two times in the theaters and each time i was scared. The people who made the movie did a good job making it suspensful and full of excitement. Their was really no down time in the movie which is good for a movie like Signs. I thought that the people who started in the movie were very good for the role they played, and did a good job. I liked the way it showed how the father went away from the Lord after his wife died but during the whole thing with the aliens he decided to go back to his faith. I made it more realistic and entertaining for the audience. I would deffinatly recomend this movie and can't wait till it comes out on DVD.</fullReview>

In this movie it showed that God can give you hope in your life and that you have somewhere to turn when you feel like there's no hope left. This is an awesome movie and i advice anyone to see it.....at least twice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A needlessly complex script strangles the director's vision.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs is the film that confirms that much talked about director and writer M. Night Shyamalan is a much better director than he is a writer. At least for source material such as this.When adding up everything in the film, you're left with negatives. For every plot point, there is one that doesn't make any logical sense. Even if you can ignore the fact that the aliens are taking over a water-filled planet and water is their poison. Even if you can ignore the sappy, anticlimatic rushed ending that's over before you know it.If you can ignore the plot holes, there is suspense to spare; you come to care about these people. There are cool moments as well; the viewer at times feels like they're right there. I mean, RIGHT THERE in the middle of the invasion, when the family turns their TV on to find extraterrestrial flying saucers over every major city. There isn't a greater feat a director can accomplish. Unfortunately this is squandered by a sloppy screenplay I won't go into detail about for fear of ruining important plot points.If you can check your brain at the door for some suspense entertainment, by all means, go ahead. But in terms of suspension of disbelief, which is very important...the script falls flat on its face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signs is not sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best sci-fi movie that isn't really a sci-fi movie.Okay, so "Signs" takes place on a farm of a retired minister (Mel Gibson). He has a son (Rory Culkin), daughter (Abigail Breslin) and his brother (Joaquin Phoenix) living with him.At the first of the movie we find there are some weird patterns made out in his crop field. We soon find his wife died suddenly a while back.The crop circles are explained away until later on when they start appearing at a rapid pace all across the world. We now realize this is either the real thing or the largest hoax in the history of mankind. Unfortunately is former turns out to be the truth.Aliens are invading. Unlike most alien movies that take place on Earth, "Signs" captures of feeling of utterly hopelessness. That there is no way in your mind that they could ever defeat the other worldly invaders. It being an M. Night Shyamalan film helps you come to this conclusion also.But then M. Night Shyamalan does his usual thing. He is the new Hitchcock. The movie really isn't about aliens. Like Hitchcock he has prepared and extreme circumstance for his characters to have to go through which causes everything that they've been able to keep inside of them to come spewing forth. The plot is just there to apply the pressure needed to allow this burst.Instead it is a character driven drama. We see how the children feel about there Dad, how the brother see things, and most of all, we are seeing a man confront God.Yes, there are flaws in "Signs." The movie can get bogged down, it could've used a few more lighthearted scenes, but the ones that were in this movie worked well. And the way M. Night Shyamalan handles the aliens after we turn the corner on it not really being a sci-fi movie was disappointing.The acting of this movie though is perfect, not a bad job (although Shyamalan should probably be more like Hitchcock in his appearances and not speak) in the bunch. The script is solid and the camera movements and angles are great, just like any Shyamalan film.So, if you are interested in a character driven drama with some sci-fi elements check "Signs" out. I give it a 7.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

Why wave a flag to show themself when they are preparing to attack ?For all the high tech they apparently seem to possess, they go out in battle naked without weapons. Without any kind of organization, spread themself out all over the world instead of focus on a single spot.What would you do if you found out there was a alien in your pantry ? call the police ? notify someone ? or just leave the house (which by the way is perfectly safe since badass aliens can not even knock down an american pantry door (we all know how fragile American doors are).In all, to many flaws to make it worth seeing, 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes the really bad movies inspire me to write in.I saw SIGNS before reading NYT or WASHINGTON POST reviews, so I think I was unbiased. As a science fiction fan I have learned to suffer through a lot of eye-rolling silliness; generally I'm fairly forgiving. Also, when I saw SIGNS, I didn't know the movie was made by the director of SIXTH SENSE, so I wasn't looking to compare this film to that top notch ghost thriller. I just wanted to be entertained by a good movie, one I had heard did fantastic at the box office.Sadly I was bored and disappointed by this movie, and I was relieved to see critics from some of the USA's biggest papers had the same feelings. The aliens were laughable (in fact they should never have been shown), and little of what I saw seemed fresh after so many episodes of X-FILES covered the exact same ground with better production, acting, and a necessary dose of eye-twinkling satire.I couldn't help comparing this dull movie to Kevin Costner's little sparkler, DRAGONFLY, which got so many withering, spiteful reviews. Similar themes, that were explored fairly well in Costner's film, are laughably diced and served cold in SIGNS. Somehow, maybe because of his huge budget films that bombed, Costner has become something of a Hollywood embarrassment, so his films, reviewed by critics who like to feel hip and in with the elite, now seem doomed in the press well before a cast is chosen, whatever the film's true merit. Many of the reviews of DRAGONFLY are filled with barely concealed attacks on Costner's character. No, DRAGONFLY wasn't a film that we'd rate as one of the 100 best of all times, but unless hatred for Costner colors one's judgment, by any standards it was entertaining and moving.But because SIGNS did so well at the box office, its bland hash of mawkishness, contrived, clichd weirdness with dogs and water, and goblin-like body snatchers from another world will earn the director, who really should hang his head in shame, a pat on the back.DRAGONFLY was a solid film that explored the edges of sanity that grieving widowers risk plunging over. Costner's character was believably neurotic in efforts to retain some of what he lost when his wife died. But in SIGNS, Gibson's performance seems contrived, a goofy attempt at somber homage to a lost American stoicism. In his performance he seems too self-conscious to be credible; I had the sense throughout he was overacting by under-acting. The result is Gibson never becomes his character, he just goes through motions that make him seem to be an amateur actor. Based on Gibson's countless fine performances, I'm sure this is the fault of the director who was trying for the foggy stiffness that succeeded well in SIXTH SENSE.This is just about as bad as WATERWORLD or even THE POSTMAN, but in a smaller, more stifling way, and with more clichs packed into less time. The science in this science fiction film is hideously tortured, as if the makers of the film are sneering at America's abysmal math and science education, as if they thought, "Oh, the movie audience is so dumb, let's use the most banal substance we can think of to be the aliens' Achilles' heel.Truly, upon reflection, the movie is so blandly bad that it isn't worth making fun of its many blunders.If you have any respect for the genre of science fiction, any hope that movies can be better; if you wish producers would assume that intelligent life exists in the audience, give this one a pass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>.... sort of Blair Witch (minimalist sound track; kept you waiting for something really scary) meets the X-Files (where is this thing going???) meets the Exorcist (Fr. so &amp; so has a crisis of faith, curable only by exposure to Earthly trauma). Yes there were some pretty silly elements to the plot, but I rather like the non-cinematic (and certainly non-theatrical) dialog which exposed the characters: I'd have to go back to Silkwood to find a film with characters and dialog this real. Should I be impressed, because the film had me on pins &amp; needles over ... nothing? Or feel cheated because after all, what I was afraid of was the wicked witch of the West? Also, don't know that anyone else mentioned it, but I couldn't help wondering if (**** SPOILER HERE: ***) the alien's presumed "poison" wasn't perhaps, some sort of cure for Asthma, which puts the film more in the camp of "The Day the Earth Stood Still" and others which warn us of xenophobic reactions to well-intentioned aliens. I just saw it last night, but I'm leaning toward liking it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trouble with many would-be Shyamalan reviewers seems to be this: as soon as they detect an apparent mistake (I say detect; in most cases it seems to be: copy from another reviewer!), plotwise or whatever, they stop thinking and start tearing down the movie. Obviously anyone is entitled to their (negative) opinion as to what Mr. Shyamalan is doing (e.g., you might not like watching 2 or more movies at the same time!), but there is of course NO reason to think he would not have spotted those elementary (presumed) lapses himself, which is to say that there is EVERY reason for those reviewers to start wondering why he did things the way he did them in the first place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>D: M. Night Shyamalan S: Mel Gibson, Joaquin Pheonix, Cherry Jones, Rory Culkin.One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, Signs takes place in small town Pennsylvania. Where a man Graham Hess (Gibson) has recently lost his faith in god, having trouble with his family and has now discovered that someone or something is making mysterious crop circles in his corn field. Now all he has to do is find out what the hell is making these signs.From start to finish a great ride. The performances are so excellent I had to get more. Mel and Joaquin work off each other so well you'd think they were real brothers. The performances of the children we're also spectacular, becuase we know without them this movie would have gone no where.Also has a cameo by Shyamalan himself as Ray Reddy.Co-Starring: Abigail Breslin, Patricia Kalember, M.

Unfortunately, I hate this movie. Why? Because SOMEone's belief in their talent (I'm looking at YOU, M.) has gotten bigger than their actual filmmaking abilities.The plot concerns a minister, fallen from grace, who wakes up to find a crop circle in his corn field. But this is no isolated incident; these thing are turning up all over the world. Hoax, or the real deal? Who cares.First things first: worst...screenplay...ever; beats Plan 9 hands down. The only time the screenplay works is when the actors aren't talking to or interacting with each other in any way. Conversations are awkward and forced. There's a scene when aliens are breaking into the house, and Mel decides to stop and have a heart-to-heart with his kids. Awful. Speaking of acting, outside the marquee players, the acting is truly terrible; we're talking dinner-theatre-in-Sioux-Falls bad. M. even has the audacity to cast himself in a crucial role, but, because he has no acting ability, it ruins all of those important scenes. There are some genuinely scary moments (one in particular made me jump), but they are quickly ruined by someone opening their mouth and speaking. And lastly, The Trademark Shyamalan Ending. Yes, this, as in all his other films, has The Flashbacks at the end. But they don't give us any insight into what's happened (as in his previous films); they simply make a statement about the difference between coincidence and fate. BORING. And The Trademark Trick End Scene. It's as though the studio demanded he put a Trick End on this, and this is what he came up with before the screenplay had to go to the printers. It's very tacked on, and has little relation to the rest of the story (ie it's not the logical ending for this movie; what is? Who knows). Overall, a bad experience.

		<shortDescription>Let down, but hilarious misunderstanding!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a similar let down to me as Unbreakable. I am just a little tired of movies where all the details in the story combine in the finale. It was fine in John Irvine's book "A Prayer for Owen Meany" (from which the construction of the plot and concept is stolen) but just seems so lazy in films today, unless some real surprise comes out of it, like in Fight Club or the Sixth Sense. Like Unbreakable, we are asked to care about character traits and history of poorly constructed and dull characters. The "surprise" ending, the "twist", is so weak as to be a disapointment.What is more, Shyamalan continues down his "tribute" to Hitchcock with a pointless cameo appearance again, and the rather blatant shots framed by foreground objects. When is he going to find his own voice? Don't claim Shyamalan is a genius until he does something original!However, what saved this cinema experience for me was the misunderstanding that ripped through the entire audience of the cinema I was in during the asthma attack scene where Mel Gibson tries to resuscitate his son. The combination of the dialogue and action in this scene immediately suggested itself to the South London audience that Gibson was in fact sexually molesting his son, and no one could believe this was in a movie. The whole place erupted with laughter at the double entendr of it all. I am talking about over 100 people simultaneously experiencing the same thing, and finding it more entertaining than the intention of the film maker. Certainly a more disturbing twist than Shyamalan's intention. I can't believe no one else has noticed this...The film was terrible, but hurrah for audiences that can rethink a dull movie into something amusing...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie with ending that many people can't understand - for me it was great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only thing I want comment is ending of the movie. While many comments here say that it's bad, or even horrible, in mine opinion it was great. It gives us some way of believing that world is full of _really_ mysterious things. Not extra-terrestials, not their technology, but something that can't be seen or touched, even if we sometimes feel presence of that.Either, I don't think that it's Christian Church ad. I haven't seen in the movie angels, or firing bunch, or anything that would say it's God of some kind of religion. For me, ending gives only one message. In world full of new, amazing technologies, human kind is still (and, I suppose, will always be) weak. This is that kind of weakness, when we lost someone very important for us, alien invasion starts, or when other tragedy happens. But there's always hope that someone (or something) very powerfull watches us all the time... I don't think that it's ridiculous or simplistic, since many people build their lives on that rule. It's only a matter of having Faith (unfortunately, odd thing in XXI century).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>if this movie was first, it would have been great, otherwise, the mix of movies it uses for its own is just that, unoriginal. it even throws in a bit of a twilight zone episode and the movie about the hysteria the war of the worlds created, the night that panicked america.spoiler here.if the aliens were not the bad guys in the end and just wanted to say hi to a bunch of paranoid humans, that would have been original and intelligently funny if done right. if not funny at least original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very intelligent to say the least....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that this was an excellent film. I don't care if some of you people continue to bash this movie, it just goes to show you how unintelligent some of you people are. The movie is not really about aliens, that is just the sub-plot, this movie is about faith. Though it could have used a much better ending, I still enjoyed the movie very much. It has great scares, heart-pounding suspense, and although at some points very slow and boring, very thrilling. The fact that they barely showed the aliens was a brilliant move, because it is a proven fact, we fear what we do not know, and we fear what we cannot and do not see. Everything is scarier when you dont see what it is.I think that to save the movie they should have had a better ending. I think what would have been an awesome twist of an ending was to have them abducted at the very final moments of the film. Remember that part of the movie were they were sitting down looking at the U.F.O. book when they came to page that had the space ship outside the house and 3 bodies on the ground that looked like them? They should have used that and they would have had a great twist. It could have been that after he gets his faith back, he finds his children laying on the ground outside of the house, seemingly unconscious. He comes outside, and notices a strange light over them. He looks up, and to his horror, an extra-terrestrial ship is hovering over the house. He tries to escape with his kids, but they are terrifyingly abducted into the ship, then, right there, the movie should end so that it can be a shocker ending. And instead of having the crop circle meanings as navigation for the ships, they could have said it is the own language of trying to communicate with us, in subliminal imagery (almost along the lines of the movie 'Contact', but not with radio signals. I highly recommend this movie if you are in to psychological terror, but if you want a really frightening film, go see "The Ring".Rated PG-13 for terror/frightening moments and some language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When someone, nowadays is shown a movie about aliens, than you should think : so far some of them were great, luring Independence Day away. But then you see it's a Shymalan film; than it becomes obligatory. Quite frankly, the movie started slowly, but great but in the mid part of the movie I was thinking that it was actually the worst movie of Shymalan. That was when the carpet was pulled from under my feet: as off the imminent attack warning, specially the ending and the basement sequence, I was shocked. I'm rarely scared in movies, but the reflection on the Tv screen near the end made me stop thinking. That only happened before with the Others. Than I knew, Shymalan didn't let us down. The whole suggestion of everything scares us. A lot. That's why Shymalan and Amnabar belong to the same school and restricted group of fear geniuses. Shymalan keeps his trademark, scary, suspenseful films with a major twist in the end. Sign's final twist is nowhere near as bombastic as Sixth Sense and Unbreakable's; but it is truly unexpected, and it isn't senseless. If you don't believe, go check for yourself, however take notice that as off the basement sequence, despite sublime it is also scary. Prepare; Beware; Behold!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining movie...funny, suspenseful, all ruined by horrible ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very disappointed by this film and surprised that M. Night Shyamalan would produce a work like it.First off, though, the positive: I like Shyamalan's sense of humor, and it was on display in this movie as in his others. The scene when Graham comes home to find Merrill on the couch with the children, glued to the TV, and Merrill has joined the children in wearing tin-foil hats?that was great. As was the dialogue between Merrill and the Sherrif at the dinner table regarding Scandinavian high-jumpers. During both these scenes, most in the theater laughed out loud, as did I. Likewise, Shyamalan knows how to set a scene to produce suspense. I cringed in anticipation of being startled and scared in two different scenes (the birthday party video, and the knife-reflection under the pantry door). Both these scenes were masterfully done.I really liked the supporting cast in this movie. Merrill and the Sherrif were both solid characters and well portrayed. And the children were cute and added plenty of comic relief (the precocious child who acts like a 50-year-old trapped in a 4-year-old's body is getting to be such a trite, Hollywood stereotype, but I can't hold that against Shyamalan alone).So, this movie made me laugh and cringe and grip the sides of my chair in preparation for a fright. And then, it made me groan. And groan. And shake my head in disgust. I don't know if Shyamalan read The Celestine Prophecy before writing this script or what, but the cheesy, someone-is-watching-over-us-all message at the end was ridiculous and simplistic. I don't know if he thought this would be an ending on par with Sixth Sense or if he was actually trying to deliever a message of faith, but either way, he ruined the movie for me. It went from a good, entertaining movie to garbage?nothing more than a two-hour commercial for the Christian Church. If this is indicitive of Shyamalan's works to come, then it's a shame for the movie industry. Until this tripe, he had appeared as a bright spot in an industry increasingly formulaic and mundane. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic film style makes a modern classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The modern "classic" monster films - Jaws, Alien, etc. relied upon suspense rather than shock tactics. This is mostly due to budgetary limitations, rather than style. For example, in Jaws, the shark model just didn't work. The production team found ways around it, and created a really scary, suspense filled film.In more recent years, film-makers have resorted to showing the monster in all its glory - George Lucas purposefully did this Empire Strikes Back Special Edition.Signs is a retreat from this habit. Barely do we see the monster (in this case, Aliens) at all, except fleetingly, or in shadows. The result is a suspense that can almost be cut with a knife. Literally. The first moment that the monster is seen, the whole audience is searching for it, desperate to find out what it looks like.This suspense could very easily break down into schlock horror, but M. Night S* cunningly interweaves moments of humour into the film. However, the build up for this suspense also results in the first act feeling painfully slow.Signs is not a work of true genius, but it is a valiant effort by man who is one. Without this slow section, the finale would not, nor could not have the emotional impact it does.I rate it 4.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When will Shyamalan direct a REAL thriller again?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The day before I viewed Signs, I saw The Sixth Sense for the third time. This made me think of the way Shyamalan's verve has been evolving - in my opinion, on a downwards spiral. In The Sixth Sense, Shyamalan knew what a thriller was all about - to thrill the viewer. Instead of scary monsters, troubled people who don't realize they're dead are used. In Signs, things get blurred. Stuck between the thrill and the spoof of itself, this movie wastes whichever creativity one could expect. Is it AT ALL credible that the sequence of events wich lead to understanding that coincidences have indeed a purpose can be put to a serious use in this plot? Haven't movies such as Julio Medem's Los Amantes Del Circulo Polar treated the same plot device in a much better way? Top this with the all too frequent humurous moments (which completely wipe away any seriousness one might feel towards this movie) and you've got a useless piece of would-be thriller with occasional jumpy frights. As for the acting, things just don't get any better. Movie after movie, Mal Gibson only proves to be Hollywood's most wasted talent. As for Joaquin Phoenix, he surely needs to rise from his ashes. I can only think of two things that salvage (though not save) Signs. First of all, Tak Fujimoto's cinematography - by far the greatest artist to be perceived here. Secondly, Shyamalan's own directing skills, wich remaining intact. But one does not have to look further than some of Spielberg's movies or Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down to understand that fine craftsmanship does not necessarily make a good film. Shyamalan needs to find his twist of inspiration, which seems to be further away in every new movie he directs.</fullReview>

Sure there were some scenes of suspense but that's it. The rest is poor plot and I regret not waiting for this one to come out on tv so I could have saved my money. Spoilers: so the assumption is that the aliens are hostile, want to harvest humans and take over the earth. Except they have a wee problem: they don't mix well with water. Let's see, how much of the Earth is water? How much of the human body is water? How much rainfall do we get? And haven't these aliens ever heard of wet weather gear? If you do watch this, make up some kind of drinking game in advance where you take a big swig every time you notice a major plot hole. I guarantee you'll be riproaring drunk by the end of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Science fiction movies basically fall into two categories. The first kind is set in the future and usually develops some sort of fantastic projection of things to come, envisioning the complexities of technological and social evolution of men. Films like Blade Runner, Matrix and Minority Report belong to that category. The second kind is set in the present. It often reflects the interaction between the contemporary everyday life with extraordinary events. This category of science fiction was very popular in the fifties and some of it's emblematic examples are The War Of The Worlds, Invasion Of The Body Snatchers and The Day The Earth Stood Still. This is an interesting category of science fiction, for it was often used as a metaphor for social and political criticism.Some contemporary films follow this line of science fiction. Even Spielberg's ET is a portrayal of a family's inner crisis originated by the absence of the father, that is united by the will to save an external (alien) element. John Carpenter's Starman also revolves around this concept, retaining an obvious criticism to military and political arrogance in the face of transcendent events (as well as being the story of a young woman coming to terms with the tragic loss of her husband).Signs belongs to this great tradition of humanist sci-fi classics. Once again Shyamalan creates an atmosphere by balancing just the right elements. He makes the viewer wonder, manipulating that intriguing `what if' element. In The Sixth Sense it was: `what if this boy can really see the dead'. Unbreakable had you wondering: `what if this guy really is a super hero'. And now you go again questioning: `what if aliens are really about to invade earth'. I'll get to that later...There's something refreshing about the way Shyamalan directs and develops his characters. In a time when cinema is so polluted by a video-clip culture, where frenetic rhythm superimposes itself on everything else, it's wonderful to see a young director going back to the basics of storytelling, taking it's time for dialog and dramatic interaction. Signs is a refined piece of moviemaking exactly in the way it balances it's different components, laughter and fear walking hand in hand. Humor is, in fact, used as a form of lowering the viewers guard, expanding the vulnerability for surprise and... revelation.(spoilers ahead) Right at the start you see the corn field, where the first of many signs Shyamalan sprinkled around this movie will appear. You see it through a window of the house, the window's glass distorting the view to tell you that things are not always what they seem. Apart from the obvious plot-line, Signs is the story of a family traumatized by the death of the mother. When the absurd threat of an alien invasion seems to be turning into a reality, the father figure, Graham Hess, is forced to surpass he's emotionless state and face he's own doubts, his fears, and most of all, what he represents to his remaining family, his children and his younger brother. The isolation of this family turns into a simbolism for the isolation of the individual in a society where even spirituality sometimes takes the form of a consuming product.There is a cynical debate going on about the religious tone of the story. It's all very silly really (and no, I am not a religious person). No, the way I see it Shyamalan is not trying to brain-wash you. Actually, the sense of religious was even used by Einstein to express the scientific sense of greatness before the transcendency of our limited knowledge of the universe. The wonder of asking one-self `what if there is some kind of intelligent life-form out there, somewhere in the universe' IS religious. Although the film poses the clear question of faith as the belief in God, it is not expressed in an institutionalized manner at all. It doesn't matter if you're some sort of church member or not. The question is `do you believe that the course of your life is driven by some sort of greater direction (God or whatever that means to you), some inner sense that gives you hope and strength when facing the difficult moments of your life, or do you believe that all is cast by chance and that you are all alone in the world.The way I see it, in the end, it stands for Graham Hess as it stands to us all, that faith isn't really the absence of doubt in considering that God exists, but it is a conscient attitude of will to accept the greatness of the inexplicable in one's life, for wich God is a form of expression. Watching Signs doesn't necessarily makes me a believer in God. But I do like to imagine that, in a misterious way, Hess's wife died for a reason, to give him a message that would, ultimately, save him and his family when facing the greatest challenge of their lives.If that is a miracle, or not, is something left for you to resolve. As for me, well, I want to believe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sub-Spielberg, but worth a viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie certainly owes a debt to Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind, but the director is skilled enough to make it his own.One of the best decisions Shyamalan made was to show as little as possible of the aliens. And he is very good at setting up his scares. A good example is the scene where Phoenix is watching the first videotaped footage of an alien sighting - very creepy.Tak Fujimoto (Twin Peaks, The Silence of the Lambs, The Sixth Sense) is becoming one of my favourite cinematographers. His camera work is extremely effective at creating moods, usually without drawing attention to itself. The cast is uniformly good (except for cop Cherry Jones, whose backwoods act is not believable). Mel Gibson is limited as an actor, but this is his best work to date.However, there are some things Shyamalan is not so clever at setting up. He was on the right track in wanting the sci-fi elements to be grafted onto a solid dramatic story, but his script veers from intelligent to heavy-handed.The biggest eye-rollers are the daughter's conspicuous glasses-of-water neurosis, and the phrase "swing away", which is ridiculously built up to be an earth-shattering revelation. I don't think Mel needed to remember his wife's last words to come up with the brilliant idea that helps save his son's life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>M. Night's Shyamalan's Signs is one of the best films of 2002. What makes the thriller so effective is that Shyamalan does not have to use a lot of gore or cheap thrills to captivate the audience. The movie's simple tone makes every thrilling move even more thrilling than it would seem in an average thriller. Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix and the child actors give a great performance as the family whose lives have been altered by these mysterious 'SIGNS'. Beware though, that by the end of the movie, you will find out the true meaning of 'SIGNS'. Really, the only disappointment with the movie is the ending, which has become a signature for Shyamalan in his previous films , "The Sixth Sense" and "Unbreakable". This movie is setup so well for a thrilling ending, that it comes off as rather anticlimactic. Overall though, one of the best suspense thrillers you will see. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Heavily hyped and expectantly positioned, SIGNS is casting a paranormal spell among the mainstream, tentpole-seeking flock. The third major work from one M. Night Shyamalan, it is a film which is rather simple in premise but rich in design.Let's propose an analogy. Ever buy a fish from a pet shop? What's the first thing you do when you bring the little guy home? You take that half-filled- or half-empty, if you're of a pessimistic persuasion- bag of murky water which serves as a transient home for your unblinking, fin-sporting friend and place it on the aqueous surface of the aquarium tank for a brief period of time for purposes of acclimating the swimming critter to the new environment's thermo characteristics. In a similar fashion, one has to acclimate oneself to SIGNS; it doesn't necessarily grab you from the beginning. It's not such a work. Instead, you have to float on its surface for a little while, get a feel for the different world on the screen; once you do, once you relax and are used to the fresh locale, you'll be in business.Up to a point. Let me explain.SIGNS is the story of a simple family of farmers led by Graham Hess, portrayed by superstar Mel Gibson. Joaquin Phoenix plays his brother Merrill Hess, and Graham's son Morgan and daughter Bo are represented by Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin, respectively; this is a tight clan, but one which is also filled with multiple neuroses. For instance, Bo can never finish a glass of water because she is obsessed with germs and contamination; Morgan never seems happy, like a kid his age ought to be; and Graham has a passionate hate for someone he used to love and work for- he loses all semblance of faith when his wife Colleen perishes after being struck by a hapless motorist and leaves the priesthood. Doesn't necessarily make for a happy family.Life goes on for them, hard though it may be, they tend their crops, go to school, try to make the best of whatever existence they've been dealt. But an intrusion suddenly appears: geometric shapes have formed themselves- or have been formed- in the vast acreages of corn fields growing on the premises. Crop circles. And it's not just on the Hess property; the weird symbols crushed into the fields begin appearing all over the globe. What are they.what do they mean?They mean this: an invasion is on the way. Extraterrestrials bent on raping the planet of its most prized and sophisticated resource: human beings. The family Hess decides to band together even more tightly than before, to try and survive the oncoming onslaught as best they can. But can Graham do it without faith? Can he do it without the help of his former employer? And what about his kids.can what was once a set of odd ways spontaneously morph into a set of useful mutations?The first thing you notice about SIGNS is the acting; it is the most stifled, stilted craftsmanship ever seen. It is done on purpose, and obviously serves a purpose- one valid interpretation would be that it demonstrates the fact that this is a family made gravely sober through tragedy- but, nevertheless, it does take some getting used to (hence the fish analogy). In fact, it took me some time to get past the perception of petrified wood reading sides during an audition at a casting agent's office. (This did make for some interesting attempts at dry, sarcastic humor.)What eventually got me over this stumbling block was the architecture of creepiness which slowly but steadily built itself over the course of the acts. The spook quotient crawled and slithered along in a very satiating buildup reminiscent of THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES. For acolytes of Mulder and Scully, the omnipresent X-factor is there and accounted for.There was also some superb foreshadow and follow-through present. As can be expected, Graham's loss of belief plays a pivotal role, as does little Morgan's nasty asthma attacks. Then there is the main theme, as depicted in an excellent exchange between Graham and his fraternal sibling: are there miracles, or are there only instances of random chance? Divine hand or capricious statistical clustering? Magic?.Mayhem? The aliens serve as a catalytic vehicle for such discussion and resolution, raising the philosophical intellect of the piece to an acceptable level.Yet, there are deficiencies.loads of them, in fact. Let's talk about one in particular: the aliens themselves. What word/phrase should I use? Insipid? Uninspired? Lacking? Devoid of creative imagination? Parched and looking to drink from the river Muse? How about this.they disappointed and subtracted from the grace which was forming. And let me mention a specific scene, the one in which one of the otherworlders is caught on tape at the opening of an alleyway; not only was I immediately struck by the sense that it was a guy in a horribly bad Hollywood suit, but the way in which it was shot valued any chance at instilling lurid fear in the hearts of the viewers at zero. Sorry, M. Night, you failed on that one, we're way past zippers running up the back of a costume accidentally getting caught in frame. (I have to agree with the sentiment of a friend: perhaps he should've Blair-Witched the aliens and either not shown or shown very little of them.)The unraveling of the plot also left me emotionally listless. In addition, there were some discrepancies of logic as well (big example is the Achilles heel of the aliens). Nevertheless, I enjoyed the experience of SIGNS. It was a bit volatile at times, like the NASDAQ, but like the battered index, it formed quite a sweet bubble at certain points- I was happy enough to have realized profits where I could.SIGNS. Shyamalan has pretty much batted a thousand at this point (if you begin with THE SIXTH SENSE). I ask you.miracle, or coincidence? Which one are you?.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As soon as you've seen the first 30 minutes of this film, you know how it's going to end. There are several annoying things about the plot of this film, which can be attributed to either laziness or to make it as sellable as possible. One example is when the policewoman automatically attributes the crop circles that have been appearing to extra-terrestrial life. Hoaxers, or any other reason, are quickly dispelled, dispute them being the most likely cause. The plot is unlikely, the writing is lazy, most of the acting is more wooden than a post and there are too many coincidences which are too easily explained away just to propel the movie along. The final nail in the coffin was the design of the alien itself-It's nothing more than a man in a cheap Halloween costume!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Successful 'pastiche'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this film, Shyamalan tries some new things.1) Unlike The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, this film has some Brechtian effects inside -such as the aluminium helmet, or sad, however funny dinner scene-. However, they are quite weak, and simply don't serve the aim.2) He pays tribute to films such as 'Birds' of Hitchcock, or 'Night of the Living Dead' of Romero -for the film, remember the finger cut scene, and the birds afterwards. Or the alien 'design'...I'm not quite sure about the casting in this film. Mel Gibson is really good in reflecting the 'aura' of a middle-class farmer; however, he simply fails to reflect the inner transformation of a former priest who has difficulties for believing in God. That's apparently not an important matter for Shyamalan, for he usually lets it go for the role. What he emphasizes on is the visuality and the dramaturgy, which is quite good in this film as well.Nevertheless, the end is by no means successful. It is understandable that Shyamalan avoids conventional action scenes, but the fight scene was really alienating. One can understand Shyamalan's real problem is to reflect the inner transformation of Hess, i,e., his return to belief, however, the ending is really weak for that. I highly recommend Bergman's 'Wild Strawberries' for anyone who wants to see a good example of that.Shyamalan continues Hitchcock's tradition to appear in his own films; however, Hitchcock never had a key role a Shyamalan did -and agonizingly failed- in this film.What Syhalaman always does best, is, the spooky and at the same time sad atmosphere in his films. Just remember the sad ending of The Sixth Sense or the sad family in Unbreakable, this film contains the very same sadness. It's a success if you make someone both sad and scary in a film.An overall evaluation: Not his best film, but it's always hard in Hollywood to shoot three successive masterpieces. Consider this as a kind of break, or as a successful compromise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps Signs is not as good as The Sixth Sense, but definitively it's a great film. I think Shyamalan is a dare-filmmaker who has the ability to re-invent what a thriller should be. That's why this is a movie which can't be categorized.Spoilers.Has it got a few plot holes? Of course it has. If we try to compare it to some others ET motion pictures. But from the bottom that's not the issue.In order this movie works, the audience doesn't have to worry about logical things because something else is happening under their noses. Obviously Shyamalan is smart enough to understand the thing that an alien specie which neither can't break wooden doors nor drink a simple glass of water, but is capable of build spaceships, it's beyond absurdity.So is he stupid? There must be a reason. If this is a nonsense, why did I shiver watching a fictional breaking news report showing an also fictional Brazilian home-made video tape? Because it doesn't matter WHAT it's outside our homes. Only matters the fact of not knowing if our own lives are in danger. I've read some comments complaining of this apparently lack of logic, assuming bad portraits of alien technology or behavior. I think these persons need to think twice, for no spaceship is shown, no extraterrestrial culture is developed. They can't assume things as wrong just because they don't fit to Independence Day's codes. I know Superman is an alien, but I don't complain the fact he has one head instead of two. We simply don't know what sort of creatures they are, so we can't figure out anything. All exists in our imagination. We build it thanks to sounds and blinks.And this is brilliant, because anything could happen. Anything. It's better if something is suggested, because it all depends of people's imagination. Besides this film has no other intention but to tell the classic story of the man who looses himself and re encounter himself in a context of a supposed extraterrestrial invasion. It might have been presented as a world war flick, and the core of the story would have remained the same. Not Shyamalan best work, but an extraordinary picture without any doubts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't usually write reviews, but after reading alot of misjudged comments on this film made by pretentious idiots I feel as though I have to defend it in some way as the weaknesses, noted by said idiots, are in fact what make the film better.******SPOILERS AHEAD!!!*******First off, the fact that aliens have travelled across the universe and have built UFO's but can't get out of a pantry and are allergic to water. Well, there is a possibility that the aliens may also be primitive, maybe more than humans, but in a different way. They just react badly to the earths natural resources (and were not aware of this), the same way that when astronauts attempted to land on say, Jupiter, but have realised that the gasses on that planet is what humans react badly to. Kind of like unwanted territoriality, they're just not meant to be there, as certain forms of nature, even, may not survive in anothers habitat.As for the pantry thing, well, we never get to see a UFO so there is a possibility that they're version of a door differs from ours (which it most probably does) so they may have problems opening a wooden door. CYNICS TAKE NOTE! Those who critizised this film for this purpose have missed out on one of the more intelligent portrayals of how a different life form is effected by another life forms natural habitat. YOU FOOLS!Thirdly, the alien itself, I thought, was kinda freaky. How it was portrayed at the end of the movie is kinda like how we might react if we saw something like that in out front room. It might have been a better idea had we just seen it's reflection on the TV screen, just a blurred image (better for our imaginations).Fourthly, the twist. I got news for you my freinds, THERE IS NO TWIST! Just cause Shymalan had twists at the end of his last two movies, it doesn't mean that they all have to. At least he's making a departure, avoiding the title 'That director like David Fincher who always has twists at the end of his movies'.***********END OF SPOILERS.***********Signs works great as sci-fi, character study, B movie tribute, horror, comedy, you name it. If there is one small flaw, the themes of redemption and faith are a little over simplified, it doesn't really tell you anything you don't already know (unless you are so simple and niave). Other than that it's great as the thinking persons popcorn movie. Maybe not much more, but this in itself is already a compliment, it's a great combination. I RECCOMEND IT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not Shyamalan at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard so many comments about this Shyamalan's work and since most of them are good ones, today I get to watch the movie with my friends and with quite a high expectations. First of all, I've been one of Shyamalan's admirer since Sixth Sense. It was the BEST thriller and ghost story for years. Everything is perfect; the camera, the casts, the plot twists, and especially the ending. I didn't quite remember the last time I got shocked by an ending so much till then. While Unbreakable is not such a bad movie itself, it didn't quite live up to my expectations and the level of Syamalan (in my mind) that's already been set by Sixth Sense. Don't get me wrong. Signs is not as bad as Unbreakable, and Unbreakable is actually a decent one itself. But I've been expecting too much of Shyamalan to show the miracle he's done with Sixth Sense to happen again, and I'm quite disappointed by Signs. The plot has holes somewhere. I can't exclusively point it, but I have this strange feeling while watching the movie. I'm continuously hoping the 'magic moments' where I could be stunned, but it didn't happen.Shyamalan did show his talents though. He's still one of the masters at building up suspense through every single objects of the movie. *spoiler* I've read a comments which pointed at the alien's form and behavior as the biggest flaw of the movie. While I didn't exactly agree with that. I have to admit that up to the point where the alien did show its true form I'm enjoying the movie much more. It's annoying to think that a supposedly much more advanced civilization as the alien (they've got flying saucer and some kind of camouflage force field for god's sake!) can't even find a way through the wooden barrelled door?But again I would say, if this hasn't been a Shyamalan's maybe I would appreciate and enjoying the movie much more. It COULD very well be my own 'too high expectations' of Syamalan that prevented me to do so.If only you could go to the movie and forgetting all about Shyamalan and just expect nothing, it's highly likely you will enjoy the movie.At last, the movie's still worth seeing. I'll give it somewhere around 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Signs" is a good film. "Sixth sense" is better and "Unbreakable" is worse. I you get caught, as I did, by the tragedy of family it is a good story. But I most admit there is some Spoilers in the film.--------------Spoilers: The aliens can`t stand water. I think it is too easy to scare aliens with water. And the aliens can make advanced spaceships, but don`t have any tools to open a barricaded door....Another problem for the film is, that you have in some way seen the kind of story before. The father looses his faith after the mother died. So did Harvey Keitel in "From dusk to dawn". And also you can guess that Merril(Joaquin Phoenix),who is a baseballplayer, will use that skill in some way."Signs" is a nice story, but not really original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview> I saw this movie just a couple of hours ago. The theater was all full, because it was the first time the movie was on show in our country. Although I personally don't like sci-fi movies very much,the good acting and the sense of humor that was successfully included made this one spectacular. I'd like to mention one detail that caught my attention close to the end of the film.I'm not sure if this flaw existed only in the copy that I watched, because there seems to be no other commentators who talk about it.Close to the end of the movie, you could see a microphone hanging on top of the actors.It was impossible not to notice it because it was right there and believe me it blew away all the suspense and thrill of the movie right away.The film lost its credibility right there.It really surprises me to think that directors don't take notice of these small details. As a viewer, I think it is a major detail. Because whenever somebody talks about 'Signs' from now on, that microphone will be the only thing that has remained in my mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd like to give a resounding "WOW", not only to the quality of this film, but also the stupidity of some of the comments that were presented here.The most aggravating thing I have heard people complain about is the acting. The acting in this film was simply MASTERFUL. Every single line was able to give us a perfect view of the entire character. People complained that Mel Gibson was "flat faced" the whole time. Guess what? HIS CHARACTER was a very plain, flat faced type of person.People also complained about the pace of this film. I'm sorry, but these type of comments must have been written by the same sad people who thought "Haunted House" was 'suspenseful' or 'exciting'. Whoever said these things obviously knows nothing about how to build suspense, and wouldn't know a scary movie UNLESS it came up and hit them in the face, as so many *cough* "horror" films do these days.So here's my review;1) This movie had the best written script I have ever seen.2) This movie had the best developed characters I have ever seen (see tangent below)3) This movie had the best directing I have ever seen.Tangent on characters: There's more something I have to say about the writing and character development. What I loved about these characters is that they were simple people. They lived quiet, simple lives. Graham and Merrill, while not being stupid, were not rocket scientists. They were farmers in a small town. They were perfect!So, I've done my ranting. You may now all flame me. =)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sign that M. Night Shyamalan is only getting better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, let me start by saying that I didn't hate THE SIXTH SENSE or UNBREAKABLE. However, i didn't love them either. I thought they were both good films but once you know the end of them what's the real point in watching them again. To me, UNBREAKABLE is only one long beginning to a possible superhero franchise. It needs a sequel to become a great film and then maybe it would be able to stand on it's own. SIGNS does NOT fit in this category! SIGNS is a great movie from beginning to end. It's an instant classic. Proof taht Shyamalan is only getting better with every film that he creates. Just because SIGNS doesn't fit in with either of Shyamalan's previous work doesn't mean that there aren't plot twists in store. There's plenty. SIGNS concentrates on the effects an outer space invasion has on one family (Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin) instead of taking the INDEPENDENCE DAY route. Without giving to anything away, it begins with crop circles and then transpires into a domestic siege. Gibson and Phoenix (who is always great and very underused) hold the film together as the two brothers, both bringing goofiness and dramatic despair to their characters. All in all, a great film. Sure to go down in film history as a classic. Check it out once, twice and thrice and then BUY IT when it comes on video! You won't be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Letdown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan is officially the next Hitchcock. But that's not necessarily a good thing.Everything about Shyamalan's newest film, Signs, reeks of the master of suspense. The camera angles. The blocking. The muted acting. Even James Newton Howard's score (which is really just a ripoff of Psycho and Vertigo). Does this make it more compelling? Not really.Shyamalan grabbed America's attention with his 1999 debut, The Sixth Sense, a film which was praised for its creativity with the ghost story template, its return to the glory of the suspense genre, and its "surprise ending". 2000's Unbreakable was not as well-liked as its predecessor, but I liked it more. I thought Shyamalan took what he learned from The Sixth Sense and expanded upon it, creating a film that was much more interesting visually and plot-wise. Many disagree with me. That's okay.Signs just doesn't live up to this. And it's because this simply isn't a story that lends itself well to the Shyamalan method of visual storytelling.Let's start with the setting. Shyamalan chose to play this story small-scale, choosing to show how a War of the Worlds-type scenario affects the common man. It's a bold move, one that should play out better than it does. In order for this to work properly, the actors have to have unbridled emotion, not muted tones. The tone has to be completely even, something which Shyamalan didn't accomplish here.The actors. Mel Gibson replaces Bruce Willis as Shyamalan's main horse. His emotional honesty seems like it ought to lend a credibility to Shyamalan's chosen plot. It certainly plays better than had Shyamalan gone with Willis, as Gibson has a certain world-weariness about his demeanor that the character needs. Does it work in the end? Not really. And part of that is because Shyamalan reins him into the same muted emotions from his previous films. Especially in a character that has such as a strong arc, with his struggle with his faith in religion and in humanity, Gibson doesn't sell the key moments.Joaquin Phoenix and Rory Culkin are both fine. They both show a grasp of the material and how to play it properly. Newcomer Abigail Breslin as young daughter Bo doesn't get it. Part of that is a weakness of the script. Shyamalan tries to inject a certain amount of humor at what ultimately prove to be untimely moments. Bo is "Full House" when the film should be "X-Files". It just doesn't work. Odd, considering that Shyamalan has written such strong roles for children in his previous two films.I did like "The State"'s Michael Showalter showing up in a cameo. I dig that guy.The cinematography works great. Fujimoto's choice of camera angles, showing key moments obscured, utilizing reflection, worked extremely well for the movie. An overall palette of earth-tones brings the film to a more resonant place, adding warmth and humanity.Okay, the ending. Shyamalan's stock-in-trade now seems to be the big shocker ending. Once again, I saw right through the ending of The Sixth Sense, as would most people who have a grasp of visual storytelling. I didn't see the end of Unbreakable coming at all, which may be the reason why I enjoy that film the most. The ending of Signs doesn't shock, doesn't hit you emotionally. It just kind of happens. It seems like a bit of a copout, in a movie that had a lot of surprises up until that moment. It doesn't work, and I think it erodes the credibility of what came before. Maybe it's just me.I'm interested to see what Shyamalan does next. It's obvious he's taking a lot of risks with his pictures, which I applaud him for. In a world where so many pictures seem so safe and easy, he chooses to make films which aren't obvious and simple. But next time, try to create a story that works for your method, not try to shoehorn a story into your established modus operandi.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As this is far from a serious film, I shall not credit it with a serious review. A friend and I saw this tame and overly symbolic yarn in Amsterdam, and were far from surprised to hear other members of the audience greet it with the derision and contempt it aroused in us.Where to start? Mel Gibson plays Father Graham Hess, a Priest who has lost his faith. The irksome and deformed Joaquin Pheonix plays his slightly strange brother Merrill, and they live happily in their Pennsylvania house with Graham's two children. Rory Culkin plays Morgan; a child prodigy who could have given Einstein a run for his money, with Abigail Breslin playing his equally irritating sister, Bo. The story is the usual extra-terrestrial nonsense. Higher beings come to earth to study the human culture and to rape and pillage the planet for valuable resources. Just one question here: Why do we always assume that "aliens" are more powerful and advanced than us? Anyhow, using crop circles to frighten Hess' family, the aliens cleverly manipulate and expose human weaknesses.Panic ensues, with painful recollections of the death of his wife along the way. His faith is questioned, and when it turns out he believes in "luck" and not in the wrath of God, Dear old Joaquin attempts to persuade the ex-Priest to see the error of his ways. Script is terrible. Acting derisory. The cast even start to wear foil hats to prevent the aliens from sucking their brains out. Yes, it is that bad. I cannot fathom how M. Night Shimalayamalan has attracted praise from any quarter. Okay, it will certainly appeal to those of a more religious persuasion, due to its endless symbolism, but for those of a more sound mind, I would steer well clear.Mel Gibson is frankly awful as Father Graham Hess. His temper tantrums are slightly bizarre - see the last supper for details. Is this supposed to represent a man coming to terms with inner turmoil, or simply a b****rd of a man who regularly upsets his children? Either way, his acting skills are sadly lacking, and his days as a surefire hit are hopefully numbered. Pheonix is his usual self - peculiar, quiet, and trying to act. And those children... Well see for yourself how irritating they are.Just don't watch this film. It is a waste of your time. See something worthwhile like Cinema Paradiso, Rear Window or The Third Man. People say M. Night is a genius. And yes, I would agree that he is. How on earth he persuaded the bigwigs at Buena Vista to make this nonsense is beyond me. If this is one of the best films of 2002, then it just goes to show what a God-awful year it has been for the cinema-goer.Avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Malt does more than Shyamalan to justify God's ways to man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amazingly, SIGNS is worth seeing. Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan uses all his skill to tell his message-laden story with beauty, passion, humor, and spine-tingling suspense. I won't say that it doesn't matter that the story is absurd and that its message can't survive critical thought. It does matter, just not as much as I would have expected.SIGNS' hero is Graham Hess, who lives on a beautiful farm in Pennsylvania with his brother and two young children. Graham is an ex-minister who lost the faith after his wife died. Now, strange things are happening all around him. He finds his crops flattened into odd geometric patterns; tame dogs inexplicably turn savage; mysterious visitors appear on his roof and then vanish. Then, similar events start happening all over the world. As the family realizes that these signs could portend the extinction of the human race, Graham faces the question of whether the God he forsook is controlling these events, or if instead he and his family are facing the impending apocalypse alone.Shyamalan proved in THE SIXTH SENSE that he is a master of building tension, and that ability does not desert him in SIGNS. Shyamalan lets the audience know no more than the Hess family knows, so the viewers share the characters' dread and bewilderment. He also cunningly uses the tension generated by the bizarre phenomena going on around the Hesses to spark the tension between the characters themselves.But (and hereafter there are some spoilers vaguely hinting at the ending), regrettably, all this skill goes to support Shyamalan's untenable thesis: that there are no coincidences. He is shilling for Alexander Pope's old nostrum: "All Nature is but Art, unknown to thee / All chance, direction, which thou canst not see / All discord, harmony not understood / All partial evil, universal good." Thus, SIGNS would have us believe, it is not really a random tragedy when a young mother dies in a freak accident, but rather it is God's secret way of saving her son by using her last words to spark a life-saving plan in her distraught husband's mind months later. Similar divine providence is suggested in a young boy's asthma and a little girl's fussiness about her water. Apparently it did not occur to Shyamalan that a God who was really pre-ordaining the world in mankind's best interest would have found a way of saving the son that did not include killing his mother or inventing a disease that kills thousands of youngsters annually. I could easily name five other "coincidences" that would have saved the boy's life just as effectively without using any grisly tragedies, and if I had the omniscience traditionally attributed to God I could probably think of a few more than that.Nor is the vapid message SIGNS' only flaw. The movie also undermines the sense of menace by representing the hostile aliens as idiots. An advanced civilization that has conquered the barriers of interstellar travel is portrayed as behaving in such a manner that Stone Age barbarians could have beaten them off. Indeed, they are so ineffective that not until the movie is almost over is it clear that they are hostile at all. The aliens' weakness is a weapon that Earth obviously possesses in abundance, but the aliens don't take any precautions against it, not even the precautions that humans invented in their prehistory. The Hess family's defensive measures would not have discouraged a good Roman centurion and his men, but they are able to stop hypertechnological creatures cold. These absurdities don't just make the movie implausible, but also rob it of any lasting impact. You don't walk away from the theater shivering at what you have just seen; you walk away hoping that any interstellar invaders that may someday happen by our planet are as incompetent as the ones in the movie.Was Mel Gibson good? Of course he was; you didn't need me to tell you that. All the other actors do well except Shyamalan himself; he takes on too large a role and delivers a flat, robotic performance. Unfortunately, that kind of acting is routinely praised as "understated" by people who forget that you can't "understate" something you didn't say to start with.SIGNS is also surprisingly funny at times, and none of the jokes misses its target. A lazy writer would have written a cardboard buffoon into the script to provide comic relief; Shyamalan took the trouble to make each of his characters dramatic and comic by turns, and the movie is much better for it.There is no getting around the fact that SIGNS is a failure. It's on a mission to convince its audience and will not do so; the only people nodding their heads will be those who were already convinced before they watched the film. But the movie is such a pretty, humorous, and tautly made failure that it's enjoyable anyway.Rating: ** 1/2 out of ****Recommendation: Watch on video or DVD on a slow night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense. A good mixture of humour &amp; suspense [POSSIBLE SPOILERS]</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a fantastic atmosphere when I saw this film about a month ago. People screaming, laughing, making stupid comments (like "That's their house!" when we're shown the illustration of a farmhouse in flames), etc. I have never been to a movie with such an amazing atmosphere before, so [on that alone] this is a movie well worth seeing.M. Night Shyamalan directs this perfectly lulling the audience in with humour, then hitting the shock moment. The sense of dread is maintained throughout the movie, as we see the Invasion from the point of view of a widowed minister who has lost his faith, his two children and his brother. It's good to see the effects of an invasion on a small-scale, as opposed to a global scale like 'Independence Day', a vehicle for Will (uh uh Big Will ha-ha ha-ha uh yi-yi-yi-yi) Smith. The effects on the family makes you CARE what happens to them, which is good, obviously, since what good is a movie if you really don't care what happens?Excellent acting all round. Shyamalan really knows how to get the best out of child actors- Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin (who got "awww" ed everytime she said something cute) were both terrific. Gibson &amp; Phoenix were also good as usual.I don't really see the point of doing a whole GoodStuff/BadStuff that I usually do, as the film is almost flawless. It is easily more suspenseful than 'The Others' and 'What Lies Beneath'. My friends and I started a round of applause when the film ended and, while only about 10 others joined in, it certainly deserved it. Why don't people clap at movies anymore? I can understand people not clapping if a movie was crap, but if a film is good and you've enjoyed yourself why not show your appreciation? CLAP for god's sake!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense. A good mixture of humour &amp; suspense [POSSIBLE SPOILERS]</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a fantastic atmosphere when I saw this film about a month ago. People screaming, laughing, making stupid comments (like "That's their house!" when we're shown the illustration of a farmhouse in flames), etc. I have never been to a movie with such an amazing atmosphere before, so [on that alone] this is a movie well worth seeing.M. Night Shyamalan directs this perfectly lulling the audience in with humour, then hitting the shock moment. The sense of dread is maintained throughout the movie, as we see the Invasion from the point of view of a widowed minister who has lost his faith, his two children and his brother. It's good to see the effects of an invasion on a small-scale, as opposed to a global scale like 'Independence Day', a vehicle for Will (uh uh Big Will ha-ha ha-ha uh yi-yi-yi-yi) Smith. The effects on the family makes you CARE what happens to them, which is good, obviously, since what good is a movie if you really don't care what happens?Excellent acting all round. Shyamalan really knows how to get the best out of child actors- Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin (who got "awww" ed everytime she said something cute) were both terrific. Gibson &amp; Phoenix were also good as usual.I don't really see the point of doing a whole GoodStuff/BadStuff that I usually do, as the film is almost flawless. It is easily more suspenseful than 'The Others' and 'What Lies Beneath'. My friends and I started a round of applause when the film ended and, while only about 10 others joined in, it certainly deserved it. Why don't people clap at movies anymore? I can understand people not clapping if a movie was crap, but if a film is good and you've enjoyed yourself why not show your appreciation? CLAP for god's sake!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cliche ridden and full of plot holes... avoid!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This poor movie has neither the depth to be a drama nor the scares to rank as the suspense/thriller that it's been marketed as.ROPEY PLOT:The low-key plot sees a family headed by Mel Gibson living in a farm house, struggling to come to terms with the death of Gibson's wife (who is also the mother of his two children), which has caused Gibson, an ex-preacher, to loose his faith. Then comes the alien invasion... ***SPOILERS***PLOT HOLES &amp; CLICHES:The aliens are rather ridiculous big green men, who seem remarkably primitive considering the UFO's they are supposed to have built.It later transpires that these aliens dissolve into goo when sprayed with water. It doesn't really seem to pose a serious threat to mankind when all you need is a f***ing water pistol to see them off...Gibson's family barricade themselves in their farmhouse, and this must be the only movie in history where this actually works, successfully keeping the aliens at bay.Eventually, a radio broadcast announces that the aliens are retreating, though it is not yet clear why. Maybe it just started raining.Worst of all is the oldest cliche in the book, preacher Gibson losing his faith after the death of his wife in a car accident. You can probably guess what happens to his faith at the end of the movie.***END OF SPOILERS***CONCLUSION: Shyamalan doesn't even have one of his usual gimmicky twist endings to redeem this feature, and his Spleilbergian use of the family unit is somewhat cloying. Not recommended. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frustrating!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the first time I can remember - a films opening credit sequence made me sit up in my seat, smiling and rubbing my hands with glee! The on-screen text was huge! The music was straight out of a 1980's Spielberg/Horror film... and from there on in -- the movie didn't... well, it didn't improve, nor did it deteriorate. The whole overall product is very classy. Very cool, very confident. It's the product of a film-maker who KNOWS what he's doing and knows how to do it. But at the end of the day (and the film) -- the overall effect, to me... was like eating a delicious port-wine trifle that had grains of sand in it. Tiny elements in the film that could've played well, just didn't roll.* SPOILERS COMING UP, FOLKS -- SORRY! *The scene when Morgan realises he can hear "alien transmissions" through the baby speaker. I mean, hey -- I love a good sci-fi flick. I can suspend as much disbelief as you like! But that scene just seemed to be smacked in our faces. And the camera-angle with Morgan holding out above the family on the car-roof; sorry, Mr. Shyamalan - but that was a bit self-conscious. Now, I know I'm starting to sound like a 3rd rate film-arsehole who complains about the "little things". But in the case of SIGNS - it was these little things that ruined the whole thing for me. And sorry folks... but it didn't work in CLOSE ENCOUNTERS and it doesn't work here: actually SHOWING the creature from outer space at the end just made me say - "Nuh, not happ'nin." I was happy with the implication of said species.But on a more pleasant (and final) note - I have to say my fav'rite scene was when Father Graham tells Merrill the story of how his dying wife spoke of Merrill's baseball game. Saying something like - "swing away"? And he says something to the effect of: You know why she said that? Because a part of her brain was punctured [or something] and it triggered off an old-memory response. That, to me - was creepy. And that couch-dialogue scene was well done. And it's also fun to see Mr. Shyamalan turn up in his pictures again!Thanks for your time, folks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a wonderful job Shyamlan did with this film. Not only does it scare you, but unlike most sci-fi/horror films it does it the correct way. It has an even balance of scare and comedy relief to keep you on your toes and jumping scene after scene.The film also has a theme, a message. Faith. The characters do a great job at making you have believe in what is going. Mel Gibson was fantastic in this movie. The children were also incrediable. the little girl was eerie and innocent all at the same time with the older brother (Maculy Culkin's younger brother) providing that stability. The over all feel of this move was great. I have seen it twice so far and would see it again and again.If you haven't seen this movie; "WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR." Run don't walk and experience this in a theatre...you'll be glad you did. **** out **** 4-4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signs of God's Involvement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie `Signs' made me cling to the edge of my seat. But more importantly and more profoundly it made me realize what a precious and practical commodity faith is. That's what Mel Gibson's character, Graham Hess, learned, too.Graham was a minister at a local church until he questioned his faith after his wife's tragic death in a hauntingly strange accident that brought him to her side for the last time as she clung to the final moments of life, pinned between a tree and a pick-up truck on a rural Pennsylvania road. Graham reasoned, wrongly, that there could not be a God if such a freakish coincidence could happen without Him noticing in time to intervene. From that time on, he believed that there was only coincidence, and that we are powerless against it, for there is no one to look after us. He determined that he would not `waste another moment of [his] life on prayer' from that time on.His despair increased after crop circles, that later turned out to be navigational aids for an invading alien army, appeared in his cornfield. He, once again, wrongly believed that himself, his younger brother, and his children were helpless against their circumstances, as there was no one powerful enough, nor caring enough, to look after them.He eventually came to realize, however, that nothing, nothing at all, is coincidence. He came to realize that everything (from his wife's prophetic last words to him, to his younger brother's propensity to swing hard at every ball that was pitched during his days as a minor leaguer, to his daughter's quirkiness about tap water, and even to his son's potentially deadly respiratory condition) is all tied together in a vast conspiracy of grace and salvation created by God. The movie title struck me as being more representative of the signs God uses to show us He is still in charge for our good, than it is about the signs the aliens made in grain fields around the world as navigational aids for the main body of the invasion that was to follow.I read a review of the movie on Screen-it.com the other day, and either they missed this aspect of the movie, or they wanted us to see it for ourselves, but I saw it as plainly as I can see the Hand of God in everything-everything, that is, whenever I am willing to look for the truth through the chaos of what most would call circumstance. I give the movie `Signs' two thumbs up and a chorus of `Halleluiahs.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie, Christawful Finish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has been wrongfully promoted as being a full-blown alien invasion movie. The actual invasion turns out to be a lot less prominent than you expect. The film focuses, instead, on the family of Father Graham Hess (Gibson), a priest who leaves the church after the death of his wife. It also has a strong message about faith, which some might find too preachy. Another part which goes uncommented on is the light-hearted comedy that is on display (`I am insane with anger!', `It was very dark.'). Perhaps disappointingly, the aliens end up being a mere vehicle for the true meat of the film; the emotional responses of the characters to the deadly situation they are put in. Nonetheless, suspense is masterfully built up throughout the film, with excellent usage of light and particularly sound. I can't say much more without spoiling the plot. However, I will say that the conclusion is extremely disappointing, and ends what was a very good, suspenseful production on a slightly low key. Also, you may soil yourself at the scary parts, or just laugh, depending on your disposition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Independence Day without explosions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(SPOILERS HERE) I have a mixed up feeling about this film. Sure, the suspense in it builds itself, real slow. Nice. The way it all made me think of an Independence Day without Will Smith and without the air combats could satisfy me only because from the beginning, I was just curious of one thing: what's the catch? What will happen with this one? Certainly no nuclear weapon set off in space!Well, the ending is dissapointing. Until then, you have seen a few glimps of extra terrestrial creatures, but not much...just enough too be scary. In the end, though (spoiler) you get to see all of it. By then, the alien population left earth (for NO reason) and it's all of a sudden easy for Gibson&amp;Phoenix to beat the last one out there, threatening Gibson's son. This is in daylight, and we get to see the poorly designed alien holding Rory Culkin in his hands. Why do these aliens always have to look the same: green (although this one can change colors, which is nice), barely naked humanlike body and a big, triangled head? It was a major dissapointed towards the end of a movie, where the first question (before starting) remains your only question through out the film: What can possibly be scary about some crop circles in Gibson's field? Well, these 'signs' aren't that important, and apparently, the rules of suspense aren't either to the director, showing us the alien in the (happy) end, it being nothing more than a regular thriller/horror movie with an outstanding cast.This means: a great movie for the average cinema-visitor, but a little dissapointed concerning the gifted mind of mister Shyamalan. I expected more of him, as I was afraid of. Maybe next time he can direct a Schwarzenegger action flick or a Sally Field drama, or maybe a Jim Carrey comedy, because this genre brings up too much expectations for him to achieve.</fullReview>

It goes pretty well up until the last 20 minutes, when it derails on a desperate will of putting up the two different agendas together (aliens/faith). Could work out fine, and it should have... But the director just shows how bad he is. He is far from successful, specially because spoiler here) the treatment the aliens receive in the end is pure non sense!!! The way they leave earth all of a sudden... Helloooo, havent a civilization that seems to be light years ahead of ours ever heard of space suits? Well, there is a message, beautiful and all? Yes.

		<fullReview>This is very reminiscent of a 50s sci-fi movie. It uses the medium of science fiction to explore a larger perspective whilst putting the science of the fiction into second place, as so many films did back then.The obvious one to recall is "The Day The Earth Stood Still", and less significant but unfortunately overlooked gems such as "I Married A Monster From Outer Space".If viewed in equivalent terms (and you are a fan of such films) you might appreciate it. Although, most of those films back then had less holes than this one, and better acting.</fullReview>

Pretty interesting to see a alien get hit by the baseball bat with Joquain Phoenix playing a young former baseball player. The little girl that was in the film was terrific as well as the young boy played by one of the Culkin kids.

I thought the acting was very stilted (especially Mr Gibson), and the children's acting, in particular, was painful to watch. As for it being scary - I had enough trouble keeping my eyes open in the first place; not, I may add, because of my apprehension as to what was coming next, but through sheer and utter boredom.

		<shortDescription>Are they serious...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some fine craft in the visual realisation and an excellent sense of pace fails to make anything out of a frankly laughable story. Am I missing the point here? Is the staggeringly banal dialogue and simplistic approach to faith actually a sly comment on the credulity of the audience? Or are we really - as I suspect - supposed to swallow this dull-witted stuff whole?The writer/director can make a tense and engaging sequence, with a very nice sense of shading in performances, no doubt about that, but his technical facility isn't matched by his way with a story in this case. The hackneyed and bowel-numbingly predictable storyline, last seen circa 1970 in one act tv plays (told more economically and with equal tension by less self-important directors), goes exactly where it signals in the first five minutes, telling us nothing new on the way. The script of Signs seems to me like an apprentice piece, and one that M Night would have been advised to leave in the bottom drawer. If he's running out of material, maybe it's time for M Night to direct someone else's story - I think he'd benefit both as director and as a writer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wake me when it's over</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know, I know, everyone loves this movie. My husband did too, until I watched it with him. I enjoy sci-fi and suspense very much, but I spent most of the movie squirming in my seat and checking my watch. I don't mind movies that move slow (I loved Road to Perdition, which friends complained was too slow), but this one kept me struggling to stay awake. Every time a little suspense started to build up, it was squashed by yet another dull flashback of Our Hero's wife's tragic demise. Said demise was contrived to manipulate emotions, which always sets me off. Note to Mr. Shyamalan: the audience isn't as stupid as you think. Trust us to feel for your characters without manipulating us. It would have been much more effective to show the horror of her death instead of just telling us about it. Of course, that would have required lowering the cast's dosage of tranquilizers, which appeared to be fairly heavy. The children especially seemed to wander about the movie in a fog; effective, perhaps, in evoking a mood, if we'd had anything at all to contrast it with.The worst part of the movie, though, was the bruises I sustained from the anvils being regularly dropped on my head. It's all about faith. I got it already. I'd like to see Mr. Shyamalan go back to trusting his audience the way he did in The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable, which were truly wonderful movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M. Night Shyamalan is definitely the next Hitchcock!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today, I just went to the mall to see Signs for the third time. And it keeps getting better every time! I was watching The Sixth Sense on ABC this June, and I saw a preview for Signs, and when saw that it was written, produced and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, I KNEW it would be terrific. He has now officially become my favorite director, writer, the whole shebang!First of all, his camera angles are what do it all. During a particularly emotional or explosive scene, the camera becomes shaky, as if it is a home video. That's what makes it so real, for instance when they're in the basement, you feel like you are in there with them. It takes away the glitzy-glamour big Hollywood movie thing and really grounds it in reality. And second of all, what makes the situations (aliens, ghosts) in his films so real is that they are NOT CENTERED ON THOSE SUPERNATURAL THINGS. Like The Sixth Sense has ghosts in it, but that isn't the point. Signs has aliens in it, but that isn't what it is about. Because the focus isn't on the aliens, it makes it more realistic. One big message that the film sent to me was "This IS most likely the end of the world, and this is how it affects this particular family." Its like its saying, "How would you prepare yourself for the end of the world?" You would have to come to terms with not just your family issues, but yourself. Graham had to "see". (If you've seen the film, you know what I mean there.) Bottom line, "see" it! It will absolutely blow your mind, and....get ready for some shocks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a very enjoyable movie full of suspense and in the begining you really are interested in what is going to happen next and the film does begin to give you a sense of fear and forboding and you wonder exactly what is going on. But unfortunately the film for me sold out big time in the end. The Sixth Sense and The Others work because they keep you wondering all the way through the film and the Mothman Prophecy also worked for me because you leave the cinema still wondering who or what is the Mothman. In Signs as in Jeepers Creepers you are eventually shown an unbelievable alien creature and the storyline just loses the plot completely. For a film to work it has to be believable. But I think an intelligent Alien race that can travel across the galaxy but can't open doors and are afraid of water just dose'nt make sense to me.I think if Signs had left us wondering just exactly who did make the crop circles and what exactly where they and what did they want then it would have made for a much more interesting film also if the storyline had remained a local phenomonon and not gone to world wide one it would have been more believable. I think leaving a piece of the supernatural in this movie would have added to its suspense. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS. After seeing 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable' I expected Shyamalan to make a in-depth thought-provoking movie about crop circles and aliens. Instead I got a 'make you jump' suspense, which is great if that's what you're expecting. However, from the previews and the director that was not what I was expecting so what was a good movie in its own right was a little disappointing. Now that I know what it's like I want to see it again, and this time I would like it much better because I wouldn't be expecting it to be something it's not. Maybe the fact that I knew most of the things about aliens before I watched the movie that made it seem like it wasn't in-depth, and maybe I would have felt the same way with the others movies if there wasn't anything new in them. However, I find it hard to image being disappointed or unsure how I liked it after watching 'The Sixth Sense'. I think mostly the reason 'Signs' was like that was because of the previews making it look like something it's not. This is something I think previews do WAY too much. So if you want a suspenseful-jumpy-watch-it-in-the-dark type movie, this one would be my first suggestion. It's very good, even if they use still-cameras way too much (making the picture jump around the screen a lot). However, if you're looking for something in-depth about aliens, etc. it might not be what you where expecting. If you do watch it, it's worth it (Just make sure you don't get dizzy watching the camera bounce all around). It's a pretty good story, and has some really good scenes. As long as you don't expect too much, your expectations will be exceeded.</fullReview>

It takes a good idea (an ex-preacher finding his faith again) and spoils it with some silly ideas, that makes the whole story completely unbelieveable.Science Fiction is Fiction supported by Science, even if its just the means to tell a bigger story. I was offended by the end of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Interesting Point of View, of UFO's and Alein Encounters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very enjoyable film, assuming you have an interest in extraterrestrial encounters etc. Although to be fair it does have a very good thriller aspect to it so it may also appeal to the sort of person that enjoys a good jolt. Mel Gibson as per usual was excellent. The story's perspective is clever, as we rarely see this sort of story from the ordinary person's point of view, with regards to Aliens invasion.You know most films seem to have the government, army, etc., in the film somewhere. This does not. Also the clever lack of background music is the reason for the very eyrie atmosphere that the director seems to have strived for and achieved.Although I felt that the charters did some strange things.For example if you where being pursued in your own house by someone or something the natural reaction is to arm your self, even if only with a tennis shoe, to lash out at, no one did. They seemed happy to wait what ever fait would come. When the son is under grave threat, the notion of striking out, at the threat seems to evade the brother, who is portrayed as a bit of a thug come nice guy. The end was also a little lame, but these complaints set aside I would recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cathartic experience! WARNING: SPOILERS!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie has its scary parts, and the good thing about them is that they provide a cathartic experience. I came home from the movies, and frankly, many times, I'm afraid of the dark outside the house late at night. But, this time when I came back, there was this vision of Mel Gibson's brother in the film swinging his baseball bat at the alien, and I felt much more confident than ever before. Sure, I used to be frightened of ghosts, but nowadays that is factored in the "aliens" category, and bashing up an alien surrogately on film did provide therapeutically cathartic wonders for me in that it rid me of some of my fears. So, I'll say, if anybody has such kind of fears, take them to see this film, and they'll be better off, and they'll thank you for the relief. As regards the plot, I wish they'd gone into some more depth on crop circles. In the film, the crop circles are merely an incidental feature. Perhaps, this and the other omissions [many of them are catalogued in the other reviews] are on account of the impressive CV of M.Night, and his triple role as writer, producer and director, that may have deprived him of much valuable feedback that could have enhanced his script. I'll give only 2/5 for story development, but 4/5 for the screenplay, 'coz despite its defects its really good in terms of plot, character and conflict, and 4/5 for direction [maybe it could be 5/5, I am not that expert in critiquing directorial abilities, screenplays are my forte].</fullReview>

		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan's most exciting film! Sure, it has no surprise ending, and the script sure as hell won't get nominated for an oscar next year, but hey? It was fun! If you go see it in the cinema for the first time, youll find yourself holding your breath. This is what makes Night's latest film good. The most crucial element of creating suspense it the anticipation of action. Sure there are frights, but don't worry they won't kill you. When I saw the teaser for this a couple months back, I thought it was about Mel trying being fooled by scam artists, but it's not. You'll know earlier that the film is about aliens. It starts when the family parks the car in front of the house, and they hear the alien's voices from Morgan (Rory Culkin's) walky talkie. But the film had something else to it. Graham's dilemma whether he should start believing in miracles or "signs", Graham questioning his faith. It gets resolved in the very last scene. It's worth the money. Go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In what can only be a tribute to hype (of the movie and the "genius" who directed it), this movie is rated very high. Yes, the director and the actors do a fine job, but the story is silly. How can a movie be great if its plot is downright silly. One example for readers of this to ponder is the purpose of the crop circles in the movie - what if there are no crops, what do they do? What if the farmer mowed the fields after the crop circles appeared? Why weren't they using the stars or satellites or ground-based beacons or even maps and photographs?While watching it, I could not help wondering whether Signs was intended to be a comedy or not. I'm still not sure. My hope is that Shyamalan made Signs to find out just how far his skill as an director could carry him on its own, without any help from the plot. I hope the next film he does has a plausible and well-written plot, one that does not rely on tricks such as the one in The Sixth Sense. His sense of camera, lighting, frame, pacing, etc. deserve better material with which to work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say about this movie, I loved every minute of it. Shyamalan is a master of suspense and he certainly managed it with Signs, without incorporating really any action, and the few effects shots were also done superbly. One bit in the film I guarantee will have you jumping out of your seat, I actually reacted similar to Merrill (with the addition of a few well known words). Overall, this movie was brilliantly done. there was brilliant acting all round (one thing that I think puts this ahead of 'Unbreakable') and I was glued to the screen practically all of the time wondering what was going to happen next.Very highly recommended, but I would not recommend watching it in an empty cinema (mine was full and I'm still going to have trouble sleeping tonight).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Puzzling Signs? MAJOR SPOILERS!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MAJOR SPOILERS!!!I watched this film over the weekend and have to say that I was a bit perplexed at how things panned out. I suppose it's a credit to M Night Shyamalan when each time you now watch one of his films you prepare yourself in advance to anticipate a sting in the tail (a creditable trait on his part). It was with this in mind that I sat and watched the film and perhaps I thought about it too much because the ending I expected turned out to be completely wrong!!!??? Here's my take on things so if anyone else out there is on the same wavelength as me I'd like to hear your views.I expected that the daughter Bo was an alien!! And that the aliens had come to take her back home!! There are always stories doing the rounds about women claiming they have been impregnated by aliens and I had the impression that Bo's mother had been one of these. At the end when Mel Gibson explains to Bo about the circumstances of her birth it would appear that she displayed an uncanny (alien??) level of knowledge and maturity. The other thing that seemed strange was Bo's preoccupation with the state of her drinking water and this being the aliens' Achilles Heel. Was the alien part of her refusing to drink the water?? She also didn't appear as scared as everyone else? (Could be the innocence of childhood, but did she break down in tears or get hysterical at any stage? Apart from when her dog was killed?Another facet of the film which struck me as odd was the apparent attitudes of the family. Knowledge and ability seemed inversely related to age?? Morgan was the one who knew all about the aliens, and at one point he even rebuked his father for `adopting a tone'? I felt like I was watching Big?Finally, at the end I was convinced that the Alien was benevolent and was actually trying to cure Morgan's asthma? Am I alone? The truth must be out there!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different and interesting Alien Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. night Shyamalan movies are always different, very different from one another and different from those made by other directors. Thats why some people admire their movies while others hate them, but it is the same with all "different" filmmakers: David Lynch, Tim Burton, Cronenberg and David Fincher(I think about his "Fight Club" which was wonderful but still some people didnt understand it). About "Signs" dont expect to watch a typical Alien thriller or a great Scarefest because there are some good scares, specially one related to a birthday party which almost made me jump but thats not the point of the movie and for those who think that the plot is disappointing I must say that it always kept me interested , so if you like different and clever fantastic movies not based just on special effects, try this and you wont be disappointed. On the contrary, if you only like typical Sci-fi movies, forget about it.</fullReview>

But I just couldn't get past the religious BS this movie is riddled with.Someday, someone's going to write an intelligent script about a character losing their faith, and nobody's ever going to see it made into a film because from the tripe we've seen in recent years (ie.

		<shortDescription>I enjoyed both the proposition and execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has no action. You might think that's a bad thing, and certainly the people I went to see it with thought so, but I liked it. Far from being disappointed, I was pleasantly surprised.Without giving too much away, its proposition is an examination of how a fairly normal family might deal with the threat (real or imagined) of an alien invasion. Naturally, the characters all have their hooks and foibles, and there is a crisis-of-faith subplot, but the central theme is tightly focused on a normal, vulnerable, rural family faced with a situation for which none of us would be prepared. I enjoyed seeing the progress of the characters from the first interruption of their normal existence to conclusion and consequences.I particularly liked the way the whole thing was resolved without recourse to action hero shenanigans, despite Mel Gibson playing the lead. Mel fans may be disappointed with this, and others may be disappointed with his attempts to portray "tearful", but his performance otherwise fitting.It was good to see that movie makers still exist not only willing to forego the quips and flying bullets but doing it in a way that kept me interested, excited and - yes - a little scared, for the entire duration of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This "Birds" rip-off makes a great gift for enemies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My boyfriend insisted and I acquiesced . I "knew" this film would be lamer than a three-legged octopus. I could "see" the tedium before it enveloped us in the theater at the lovely new casino off of the strip in Las Vegas. The experience of seeing films in the theater gets heightened these days with the LOUD trailers and the computer-designed Welcomes before the film. The lights dim and "signs" [sic] (I will have my fun!) begins. Ah, people in the cinema. Ah, people in the cinema scared a bit by the sudden film cuts and Dolby bumps and our contagious sarcasm wafting o'er the seats like the *Spoiler?* poison gas of the (unscramble so as not to be a spoiler) ISANLIE.To stretch this soft bit of bombast on the bias, "signs" ' director/writer/producer/egregious cameo of the most pretentious self-consciousness a nerd can splay/mother/father/brother/good cop/... takes away two hours (oops, almost wrote "years") away from the viewer's life, therefore this film would, to order, make a lovely gift for someone you don't really like. Just warn the others...The film borrows from Alfred Hitchcock's super "The Birds" (1963). It borrows the mood, being trapped in a house, the flashlight "tour" (here relegated to bottom of the barrel actions by our tedious male dults --is that "projection," director?), the teary eyes of the cast, like our good cop who gives good Jessica Tandy. There are the pictorialized gazes at the mysterious, clouded skies. And Mel Gibson is the spitting image of Rod Taylor as Mitch Brenner in the original, but he's emoting like Tippi Hedren!So it borrows from "Birds." So the director "gets it" when a master hits us full force, the way David Lynch has learned but still can't quite paint the same way. So! That's just a comment. This film is like a pungent but thin Jean Rhys novel left to rot in misty watercolors of the insensitive mind of a male. I'm sorry to say that, especially since I am male. A sensitive, feminine epiphany, common in better Indian epics, threads its way through this torture of glasses of water and faux-macho Joaquin posturing. I doubt you'll be able to appreciate it.Lame film about aliens not being the nerdy hoaxsters of England's '70s past, an option trammeled immediately. Some dumb, illogical touches jump out afterward. A good example: Mel follows his children's cries into the cornfields. He finds a crop circle. Camera pans up and there are more circles, unbeknownst to them. It does not engage the viewer. It is a stale movement. And then there is no helicopter investigation for the Philly media. So it's suddenly global. Flashbacks, Star Trek time wormholes, wicked witched killed by water, murdered dogs (?!).I did not very much care for this movie. Mel Gibson is losing it, but good. God, I miss Carl Sagan!I hope, gentle readers, that my review has taken you on a copy-cat journey, like the "cut-about, jumble it with snail pacing ("thought?") and a cavalcade of symbols" journey of this film. I should've known, because an infant in the lovely, new theater was throwing up harshly a little after the film started.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M Night Shyamalan fans will not be disappointed (except perhaps by the ending)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Gibson plays Graham Hess, a man who lives on a farm with his two young children and brother (Joaquin Phoenix). One day, the news headlines on television reveal that large crop circles have appeared around the world (one of these has appeared right outside the Hess' house!) The world speculates that there are only two possible explanations: either it is a hoax or signs of an alien invasion. We also find out that Graham Hess was previously a priest but lost faith when his wife died. The events in the film cause him to embark on a voyage of discovery which helps him regain his faith by the end.Having been a fan of M Night Shyamalan's two previous films ?The Sixth Sense' and ?Unbreakable', I was eager to check out his latest offering. This director has a very distinctive style which is again apparent in ?Signs': he uses strong child actors; takes time in the story-telling; focuses on only a small number of characters and there is a flashback sequence in the final reel. Part of the fun of his films is also looking out for the director's cameo appearance! It is a style which I find very effective but I do know some people who have found the build-up to his stories too slow and uninteresting.The two male leads give engaging and subtle performances. The child actors are also good; they are never irritating and very believable ?this comes as a surprise considering the son is played by one of the Culkin brothers! I found the story both suspenseful and engrossing. It is also quite a scary film in places going for suggestion of what cannot be seen in the shadows rather than ?in-your-face' scares. All the audience gets for most of the film is strange noises on an old baby monitor and glimpses in reflections on a kitchen knife and the television set. There is a sense of the family being in real isolation with their link to the outside world being provided only really by news updates on television while outside there is an unexplained presence which is made more threatening by a picture of a house in flames in the son's extra-terrestrial textbook which looks eerily like the Ness' home.The only let-down in the film is perhaps the ending which gave me the sense that the director couldn't be bothered with anything fancy this time round. Without giving too much away I can only describe the ending as being too convenient.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good bad story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw The Sixth Sense (Shyamalan 1999) I was in awe. "You've got to add a few twists and turns," I think the little kid Cole (Haley Joel Osment) said. Well, sadly that's what's lacking in Signs. It begins very well, though. All in all it's extremely exiting, funny and not to mention down right scary. There's some good acting too. That man does magic with kids. So, there is no doubt that Mr. Shyamalan has gotten much better at calculating story effect and to execute it on the screen. In that respect it is a powerfully entertaining film. In fact it's so well done, technically speaking, that it almost makes up for the extremely closed up Hollywood-happy-ending. I suppose it isn't a spoiler to reveal that yes, it has a happy ending. There's nothing wrong in that either! The Sixth Sense had a happy ending as well, but the big difference is that Sixth Sense wasn't a clich. Or maybe, after seeing that already classic film, and the lesser but still very good Unbreakable; is it that I just have too high expectations? In Signs he doesn't once dare to challenge the audience (other than scaring us a little of course, but that's expected of a thriller), and he takes that to the bitter end. Well, this is OK as long as you're just trying to entertain. But I don't think that's all Shyamalan is doing. He's throwing in a huge chunk of morale as well. He is trying to teach, which isn't a bad idea if you've got something new and important to tell. This however, wasn't terribly important, and not really new. So stop insulting my intelligence! Next time I want the same amount of superb technique and thrill, but please; get rid of the blatantly cute moralistic clichs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, the film uses a science-fiction angle as a background story to a widowed minister (well-played by Mel Gibson) who loses his faith, but hopefully re-gains it in the end. No one would probably see a film like this unless there were some aliens involved. The director M. Night Shyamalan cast himself, not too convincingly, in a key role, while Joaquin Phoenix is simply too young to be Gibson's brother, but Cherry Jones is excellent as the town sheriff. Effective elements of producer Val Lewton's 1940s films, "Night of the Living Dead" (1968) and "Blair Witch Project" (1999) are utilized here, creating effective suspense and eeriness. The aliens' invasion is very low-key, with a most unsatisfying denouement for their demise. Well-shot, scored and directed, it just doesn't soar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting great things from this film, largely on the basis of a very good trailer. I have to say I loved the crop circle designs, but really, that and the trailer was the best of the movie. Large flaws abound throughout the movie, which, since it is SciFi, one could largely expect to forgive. But there really are gaping flaws exposed at the end on the level of the intelligence of the aliens (who were intelligent enough to presumably come across millions of light years in the interstellar ships they've built)I also have to say, the dialogue was stilted and artificial indeed. The kids put on a great performance, and are totally as you would expect kids to be when faced with a weird situation. But Gibson struggles to keep his character believable at times, witness the scene at the dinner table for instance. Phoenix is a bit of a loss in this film, he mostly stands around, hardly developing his character at all.Wait for the DVD... or even better, buy a poster with a picture of the cropsigns on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sixth Sense brought an original spin to the Ghost genre. Unbreakable brought an original spin to the Superhero genre. Clearly M. Night Shyamalan likes to bring original spins to his films, since, with his third major feature, he tries to bring an original spin to the Alien Invasion genre.Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is a former priest, who has lost his faith in God and himself. Following the pointless death of his wife, Hess throws in the collar and struggles to raise his children with the help of his brother, failed baseballer Merill (Joaquin Phoenix). When crop circles inexplicably appear at his farm, Hess blames local pranksters. But, as local and world-wide news begin to reveal, these signs may come from an otherworldly source whose intentions are decidedly ambiguous.Shyamalan once again demonstrates where both his strengths and weaknesses are. The acting is uniformly terrific, and Shyamalan coaxes exceptionally naturalistic performances from both Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin, as Graham's children. Shyamalan, himself, is effective in a scene that reveals the truth behind Graham's loss of faith.Long scenes and slow, lingering shots crank the tension up to maximum for most of the film. This tension is utterly deflated, however, by a couple of lengthy flashbacks that interrupt the grand finale. Shyamalan has a tendency to undo a lot of his good work by over-explaining the clues (or signs, if you prefer) that are laid before us. It's a shame that he falls back on this again, because, unlike his previous two films, there is no real twist for us to figure out.Stylistically, Signs is very similar to both Unbreakable and Sixth Sense, and many of the characters feel overly familiar. Indeed Mel Gibson is directly interchangable with Bruce Willis, as a morbid hero who denies the truth behind his identity. The mood and lighting also make Signs feel derivative of Shyamalan's other efforts. However, it's a credit to the quality of this style that it still works to such an extent. The distinctly personal view of a world under invasion makes you feel more for the characters than should be possible given the hokey subject matter, and will linger in your mind longer than most films this summer.</fullReview>

An alien race travels millions of light years in space crafts with Klingon cloaking ability yet have to mow arrows in fields in order to navigate. 2. They are able to blend in to their environment with chameleon-like ability, have super human strength, but can't break down a two inch door. 3. To incapacitate the human race they rely on poison gas emitted from a gland in their wrist and evidently must be approximately two inches in proximity for this to work. 4. Despite their technology they can be defeated with a Louisville slugger and a glass of drinking water.I would be able to overlook all of this if I was presented with a gripping story/unforeseen twists (eg. The Sixth Sense). Instead I got a anti-climatic story about losing one's faith. How does this stuff get made into a movie?!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well this took a long enough time - figuring out what Signs was maybe about. After reading some of the more perceptive viewers' comments there opened a welcomed possibility of Signs not being simply a hole-plotted, square-moralizing ridicule of a film.At a surface level Signs is well made. It has good actors, good atmosphere and a bad plot. But what if alien invasion is not all we are looking at? Maybe this is reaching for the impossible, but if the director was not leaning toward these possibilities while making the film, the very least he would probably say is: Believe what you want, it's good you have imagination, I wanted you to think!So, to those possibilities: There's been suggested that the whole invasion - or at least certain parts of it - were imaginary. Some have commented that most of the on-goings were just dreams of the little girl or possibly even the father initiated by the family trauma and somewhat claustrophobic living arrangement. Aliens represent fathers inner demons, plot-holes little girl's imagination. In signs there wasn't a real twist in the end (how conditioned one gets just after two films!) unless you count the silly "baseball bat-asthma-total redeeming of faith"-concoction. So MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, the whole film was but a big twist. Or maybe not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>film explores interesting themes and issues of personal struggles and growth (&amp; faith). The director is brilliant in building suspense and telling the story without showing much (ie: aliens) - constant surprises and chilling moments - but the "horror" elements seemed overdone and ridiculous at times. I wasn't sure if I was watching a serious drama, sci-fi or a teenage slasher film. In the end, the messages and important questions raised were heavy and excellent, saving the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You should see this movie. It is full of signs, right down to the curtains in the house with crop circles as the pattern. I liked the acting. The kids were a little numb but I figured that was because they were still experiencing a great deal of grief. Being more patriotic than I've ever been before, I couldn't help but feel irritated when they reported that someone in the Mideast had discovered how to get rid of the aliens. Also, I couldn't help but notice how utterly defenseless the family was. No weapons except a baseball bat? That's what scared me the most. Was the director trying to tell us something about ourselves?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There were SIGNS that this was going to be good. Shyamalan's last few films (especially Unbreakable) were SIGNS that this would be good. Another SIGN that it would be good was the very creepy trailer. I began to notice some SIGNS that I might like to see it, like when I said to my friends, do you want to see this film? A SIGN that I was actually going to see it was when I was buying my ticket in the cinema lobby. After it started, I began to notice some SIGNS that it wasn't that good. The first half of the movie is pretty slow. Then the aliens start to appear (first rule of filmmaking, don't show the alien!!!!), which was a SIGN that it was pretty bad. The ridiculous denoument was another SIGN of a not very well thought out film. Perhaps I'm seeing too many SIGNS, but that appears to be common with respect to this movie.I do have to say that everyone acted well (the kids were terrific, and I don't think that often), the direction was slick (but possibly a little too laid back), but it was all let down by a very poor story. And the foundation of a good movie is a story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yup. This one definitely worked for me. Found myself squeezing the handles white-knuckled most of the time. The idea is not that original (the TV-series "V"), but I don't recall anyone using the signs-in-the-cornfields- idea before. Also directing and screenplay are brilliant- it's amazing how, in a production the size of this, little they invested in the aliens. And regarding, how such a tense atmosphere they managed to create. Let's see: all they needed was ONE guy in an alien suit for footage of about 4 minutes, and some grady, low-quality "news-footage" - of lights in the sky! Of course, in horror flicks often more is less, since what you CAN'T see is scarier than what you DO see and goes for this, too, for the last reel... but for horror-fans, here is a perfect example of minimazing the income and maximazing the outcome- "The Signs" is truly the work of an undeniable genius!P.S. Did anyone of you whiners think that it might of not been just the H2O that kills these aliens? Maybe it's the dissolved ions in it that are present on Earth (that is, in the 1)tap water of 2)Earth), or the pH... or the amoebas?

		<fullReview>As most people I have seen the two previous movies by this very promising director. And now I have to ask myself: is he done already? "Signs" was very disappointing compared (of course) to "Sixth Sense" and "Unbreakable". It just seems to be such a mixture...Major Spoilers ahead: Maybe it would have worked without the appearance of the Ufos all over the world. I think it is much scarier when you and your family are the only one who notice the invasion. But the way Shyalaman wrote it, its obvious that the world is visited by aliens and the audience is just guessing all the time: why are aliens using theses signs navigating on earth when they have done all the very, very long way through our galaxy without them? Why dont they use any weapons? Why is there no chaos in the streets and evacuation like shown in ID4? And how can one possibly trying to avoid invasion by aliens by just blocking doors and windows? Dont aliens use tools? How do they build their spacecrafts? And is it clever to invade a world of 70% water and kidnapping people consisting of 70% water when you wind up dead by the pure contact of water to your skin? (There is a french fun movie from the 70s with Louis de Fun?s with aliens you react just the same way.)So Id go with ONE sign, ONE ship and crew probing the neighborhood of Mels house and with the horror of being attacked without the sheriff and townfolks believing me... and by the way: Gibson cant act at all...stick to WillisBetter luck next time, nuff said, Night!Macaulay J.

		<fullReview>"Oh, no," I thought. "Dogs in a film about aliens. I already know that outcome." Please, please don't allow any other animals to die in films - ever! (Why did that stupid family forget their surviving pet Isabelle?) I tell myself that this is fake -- but still -- I cannot sit through a film while anticipating those dreaded scenes. My daughter and I liked the build-up to the invasion, and both of us (SPOILERS) were disappointed when "he" was revealed -- kinda like a leather-clad mummy with a strong allergic reaction to fetid water. We considered the boy to be a bad actor whose character needed some serious behavior modification. When his father corrected the pronunciation of the author of the prized book on aliens (Was the purchase Fate or Coincidence? Ick!), the son did not like the "tone" of the correction. What's with that? And how did that kid become an expert on aliens? Did he read and recall the exact passages ole Father Mel would question? (Insert ghostly music here -- Fate or Coincidence or Inane Writing?) And director MNS's cameo was more like a supporting role. We liked the corn rows -- like "Children of the Corn" -- "He who walks behind the rows (or something like that)." *SPOILER* The ending with those fateful words about swinging away was tacky. Why couldn't the wife have said, "Leave the farm - take the dogs - go to a motel - swim away - remember the medicine - pack a lunch - put on the collar -- preaching is easier than farming - clean the house -- it's a mess." The film was a simple way to spend an afternoon, and not too much was lost - time-wise and coin-wise - So see the film if you favor eerie stories with a profound message attached. I hope those German Shepherds and their stand-ins are sleeping in the Hollywood sun, bellies full and beds worn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD *** It had everything in it for a good fright: The family in the isolated house, the bad aliens outside wanting to get in, the family hides in the dark cellar, so that I thought, finally, it will get scary. But it didn't. I mean, I wanted to get scared, I wanted to have that feeling of claustrophobia and helplessness, but I just sat there in the cinema and thought, "well, in THE NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD they did it much better". And when they discovered that they forgot to take the boy's medicine with them, I thought "don't I know that from PANIC ROOM?". I mean, I've seen other Shayamalan-films (SIXTH SENSE which was good, and UNBREAKABLE, which was awful), so I knew this wouldn't be an action flick, but this one never got any tension. And in the end, the aliens just left. Just like that.Basically it's a film about someone who lost his wife, lost his faith because of that, and got it back. So why did Shayamalan put the aliens in it?Thankfully I watched it on a matinee, so it wasn't such a total waste of money.</fullReview>

The Sixth Sense was about a spirit-seeing gifted boy who ignores his gift has a purpose : to help the spirit in their last task. Unbreakable was about a depressing man who cannot be harmed or hurt. He needs to find his purpose in life in order to retrieve happiness.Signs is less about the person in itself than it is the purpose of our acts, should they appear deceiving or futile.

Signs is about crop circles in the field of a Clergyman...and aliens. The Armageddon pictured by a swarm of lights in the sky, and every channel broadcasting the "attack" are common occurance and were already seen in ID4. But frankly, there is no further comparison between the 2 movies (a bit like trying to compare X-men and Unbreakable). The whole movie takes place almost only in a single house, and, thanks God, no overswollen patriotism and aerial fight!Could have been a very scary movies if the games of shadow, noise and space would not have been disrupted by alternating funny moments and silly acts. But 18yo restricted shoot-them-up scary movie was not the aim of Mr Shyamalan, and all in one this remains a good movie with a surprising end.The cast is good, without Mr Willis this time, as Mel Gibson is probably more suitable for a Corn-farmer-single-father-Father.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan continues to impress</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the heavyweight box-office success of `The Sixth Sense', and the less-successful but equally gripping `Unbreakable', M. Night Shyamalan is rapidly establishing himself as very much the writer/director of choice. Forget about the Steven Spielberg comparisons; Spielberg didn't have this kind of insight this early in his career, and wasn't writing the hits like `Jaws'. Spielberg is a great storyteller, but they aren't necessarily his stories. Moreover, with a few exceptions, Spielberg's `fantasy' work tends to be plagued with over-sentimentalism and comedy. With `Signs', Shyamalan completes a trilogy of work that while not related directly, are certainly linked in his strong grip on the medium of storytelling and also share certain other `Shyamalanisms' between them. (Try saying that one after a few drinks.)`Signs' is very much a movie that I could completely ruin with a spoiler-heavy review; hence, I'm going to keep this one very brief, and while I will outline the basic premise, I'm going to avoid anything that adds to the resolution of the film or provides any major element of suspense.In Bucks County, Pennsylvania, an enormous crop circle is found on the farm of Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), who lives on the property with his two children, son Morgan (Rory Culkin) and daughter Bo (Abigail Breslin), and his brother, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix). Hess is still mourning the passing of his wife, who died six months previously in a horrendous car accident that occurred whilst she was out walking. Pinned to a tree and effectively torn in half, she held on long enough for Hess to listen to her final, gasping words. As a result, Hess, a former preacher, denounced his faith and retired to the farm.Initially, Hess and his brother perceive the discovery of the first crop circle as a joke. However, as more circles begin to appear around the globe, and then on the farm itself, they, and the world's media, begin to take the events more seriously. Moreover, other strange developments begin to play on Hess's mind: his dogs start to act violently, turning on his own children; both Hess and Morgan notice strange shapes and noises coming from the corn fields; Hess's daughter Bo becomes obsessed with the cleanliness of her drinking water, and begins to leave half-full glasses all over the house; most eerily, a long-abandoned baby monitor starts to pick up creepy, sinister noises. Could they be voices? Could they be alien voices? Morgan discovers a book on extraterrestrial activity in a local bookstore, and begins to quote from it as if it is a modern-day bible. Hess remains sceptical, but as Merrill and his children come to believe, he is slowly turned.The situation darkens when television coverage reports that (what would appear to be) alien starships have appeared in the skies around the globe; in each case, the ships are within one mile of a crop circle. The ships do not move or present any immediate threat; rather, they just hang in the sky. Moreover, on daybreak, they appear to vanish ? or is it some kind of cloaking device?When the aliens finally play their hand, it is worst than could have been expected. Initially, the media had suggested that the creatures wanted to harvest the planet ? then, when the aliens begin to kill people in droves (assisted by a kind of in-built poisonous gas) their motives appear far more sinister. Do they want to harvest us?Now fearing the worst, Hess and Merrill work tirelessly to seal themselves and the children inside the family home, blocking all doors and windows with wooden barricades.Throughout this Hess continues to question his faith, his God (who incidentally is never really explained; Hess appears to be Catholic, but he is married.) Over a final meal Hess berates his children for wanting to pray before they eat. When the meal is complete, they retreat down to the basement to await their fate?As a complete movie, `Signs' is not without its flaws; the explanation for Graham Hess's loss of faith is somewhat of a clich nowadays (i.e., virtually every ex-preacher has either lost a wife or child in Hollywood) and as mentioned the lack of explanation for his religion makes it seem a little false. Furthermore, the discovery of the book is a little too convenient for my liking (one book on extraterrestrials in the whole town and it's pretty much dead-on with its analysis.) Perhaps the hardest part to swallow is watching the movie come so neatly together at the end ? yet that is unquestionably the underlying message.In a premise that was somewhat touched upon by `Final Destination', Shyamalan suggests to us that if we look for the `signs' in life, we can, to a greater or lesser extent, determine our own destinies. (In this way, the director turns the trailers for the film completely upside-down. They very much referred to the `Signs' of the title as the discovery of evidence that pointed to alien invasion. The film concentrates instead on the signs and clues within life. It makes me wonder if this was a clever ploy or total ignorance on the part of the marketing team for `Signs'.) We are also informed of that old chestnut `things happen for a reason', laced with a little `it was like it was almost meant to happy' flavouring. But these particular clichs aren't too tough to swallow; Shyamalan engages us in the story to such an extent that you warm not only to the strong characters but also to the equally firm message. (Although the kids are, as always in these kinds of movies, a bit creepy.)The acting is very strong throughout the film; Shyamalan's cameo aside (annoying because not only is he a pretty mediocre on-screen performer, but he chose for himself a role that turned out to be somewhat pivotal), the cast are generally excellent, with both Gibson and (Waaa-keeeen) Phoenix excellent. Young Abigail Breslin is very promising, as is Rory Culkin (although I found myself continuously expecting him to start making bizarre faces at the camera, en route to booby-trapping the house and capturing the aliens `Home Alone'-style, much like his older brother did back in 1990. Brace yourself ? a fourth `Home Alone' movie is planned for next year, thankfully sans any of the Culkin clan.)Where the movie scores particularly well is in its subtlety. For a film that is primarily about the threat of alien invasion, this is as much of an antithesis to `Independence Day' as you could possibly imagine. Which is a good thing, and not because `ID' was a bad film ? taken at face value, i.e., a popcorn picture, `ID' was splendid ? but because it gives us an insight into how the `normal' man would factor such a circumstance. `ID' was mostly about the militaries take on the alien threat, whereas `Signs' looks at the equally real ? and undoubtedly more terrifying ? perspective of the single-parent family. Hence, it's the little things that Shyamalan brings to our attention that end up owning the movie; Bo's glasses of water, reflections in television screens, strange noises amidst the soft gusts of wind outside. And when the Hess family barricade themselves inside their home, I was very much reminded of a similar scene in Romero's `Night of the Living Dead' (1968), which took a similar viewpoint to a different (but certainly as terrifying) threat.As I opened, the completed trilogy of Shyamalan's work ? `The Sixth Sense', `Unbreakable' and now `Signs' ? on a standalone basis is certainly on a par with any other directors effort. (He also has the screenplay of `Stuart Little' to his credit, but let's put that aside, nice family movie that it was.) The films' share certain qualities. In particular, the use of flashbacks to tidy the plot, but also the director's innovative touches with reflection and an ability to turn simple, everyday items and events into complex paradigms and even weapons. Each has had a resounding impact on the movie-going public (perhaps the underrated and generally misunderstood `Unbreakable' aside. Yet even that film begged for serious discussion, whether you enjoyed it or not.) This reviewer, for one, cannot wait for his next project to begin. `Signs' comes highly recommended.RATING: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre and way too many loose ends!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems to me that Shyamalan cannot make up his mind whether he wants this film to be a horror movie, a suspense thriller, or a Sci-Fi flick, as it has elements of all three, but unfortunately fails at all three!***************************************** *********** SPOILERS AHEAD ************* *****************************************The movie does have it's moments, and is not terrible as some viewers have indicated, but there are so many unexplained circumstances and loose ends that it left me feeling very empty. First of all, I think it's a total cop-out that Shyamalan never really explains why these aliens are here, but only gives you possible reasons so that you have to guess for yourself - now that's poor movie making!The second thing that struck me as totally implausible is that these aliens have the superior technology to come all the way to the Earth, hide their ships with a "shield" technology, and yet have no sophisticated weapons of any kind with which to fight us!!The next problem, which to me makes no sense whatsoever, except for Shyamalan to be able to make this movie continue, is the fact that Mel Gibson's character and his family stay in a totally isolated area right near one of the crop markings when he knows that by doing so he is potentially putting himself and his whole family in mortal danger! Uh Duh, maybe if we leave and go to an urban area we can get some help!?The final item however truly takes the cake. We supposedly have a very superior, sophisticated alien race (who by the way never heard of clothes), who has some kind of deadly reaction to water, yet they come to a planet that's about 70% water!!! I guess their technology was unable to determine that the Earth not only has massive oceans, lakes and waterways, but has a simple thing called RAIN!!! I'm sorry, but this totally blew this movie for me, and as I liked both The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, I have just one piece of advice for Shyamalan, please stick to those type of films and for the sake of true Sci-Fi fans like myself, do not attempt any more Sci-Fi flicks, it's not your bag.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspense the way it was meant to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit it: M. Night Shyamalan is becoming the new master of suspense. He has already proved it with "The sixth sense", but now with "Signs" it looks like he's bringing his skills to perfection. The tension goes from zero to infinity in a perfect pace during the movie. I honestly didn't expect "Signs" to be that scary from what I saw in the trailer, but fortunately I was completely wrong. Many think that "The sixth sense" is Shyamalan's master piece, but I say it's still to come.In "Signs" we get to see, finally, a non-psychotic Mel Gibson without a gun. He plays now a very peaceful, and depressed, ex-priest Graham Hess who has lost his faith. He lives with his two children and his brother Merrill played nicely by Joaquin Phoenix. The three of them bring the necessary (and almost too many) comic reliefs to the movie. You have to have a laugh between those moments of sheer terror. Moments that are mainly created by your imagination; it's the typical "Oh no, don't go in there! Run! No, not that way! What's going to happen now?!". This is the type of movie that doesn't work in a TV. You need to be surrounded by a crowd ready to wet their pants and, most importantly, you need the sound of a cinema theater: the movie relies a lot on the sound FX to build up the tension (something I really loved). What I did not like about the movie is that in the end it's not about giant circles in crop fields, and it's not about alien invasions; it's all about father Graham and his faith. I think that's the reason I see so many plot holes, which I will not mention here; I don't want to spoil it for those of you who haven't seen this movie... and have actually read this review. Bottom line: Very good suspense movie, but aliens and priests? Not a combo I liked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The UK perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had gone to great lengths to watch this movie without knowing anything about the plot other than what I had learnt from the numerous viewings of trailer before every film for the last month or so. I had managed to ban anyone who had seen it from telling me anything about the plot, just so that I could go into the film with my own expectations, and could then have the pleasure of trying to work out the inevitable plot twists that you expect to accompany a Shyamalan film. I had enjoyed his previous two efforts (although I am not a fan of Stuart Little) and was hoping - expecting - to be entertained and confused by the writer/producer/director/actor's movie.The Signs opens by throwing clues and red herrings about so that your brain immediately starts to calculate likely outcomes and try to fathom which information to discard. Assumptions that we all know and understand the various theories behind crop circles and their hoaxes helps to maintain the narrative's speed in getting to Shyamalan's version of events. Based almost exclusively on a farm owned by Mel Gibson, where he lives with his brother, son and daughter, there is clearly meant to be a sense of claustrophobia within the film. Gibson only leaves the farm twice within the movie, once in his memories and once to visit the man who killed his wife (played by Shyamalan) in the car crash he continuously flashes back to. The enclosure is further strengthened when the family barricade themselves into the farm house.Its not giving too much away to state that this is essentially an alien invasion movie. The Signs is presented like a microcosm of Independence Day, and would have perhaps been more suited to an episode of ID: The TV Series should they have ever made it. The clues given earlier in the movie that forshadow the ending are all too easy to spot and work out their importance. Even if you are the worlds worst sleuth there isn't an overwhelming realisation moment when you finally spot the connections between the opening and the end. For those of us who enjoy seeking out the connections, we are left disappointed as many of the earlier events are left unexplained whether they bore any relevance to the conclusion or not. This is particularly disappointing if you are a fan of Shyamalan's writing as, until now, the plants and woven links running through his movies were part of his massive appeal. Similar undertones and issues are dealt with, most of all being Shyamalan's constant investigation into the spiritual world and the conflict of religion with the unexplained. Unfortunately, like almost everything else in The Signs, the study falls short of either reaching a conclusion or creating enough conflict to justify its inclusion in the script. Here it is a particular shame as a three way fight between religion, the unexplained and precognition could have been the boost this movie so badly needed to take it from average (by an average directors standards) to at least something that bit special.This film is ultimately unimpressive. The cast are underused, criminally in the case of Phoenix, the plot is underdeveloped and feels like one half of a story, and visually what could have potentially been a stunning mix of unexplained imagery and haunting glimpses turned into straight-to-video mistakes. The scariest thing about Alien was that you never fully saw the one thing that caused the fear, this is perhaps something that could have been considered when this movie was being made. On a more positive note, should you go to see this movie having no preconceptions about it being a movie by the man who made The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, then you are far more likely gain some pleasure from it. This is not a bad movie, but it must be questioned whether its release would have been quite so widespread and successful, or even attracted the cast it did, had it not been for the fascinatingly monikered author.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>E.T. Was Scarier Than This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After hearing all of the hype and also my wife insisting that we see this one because of our mutual interest in crop circles, UFOs, extraterrestrial encounters, etc., I actually had my hopes up that I could finally see a first run film in a theater that didn't make me fall asleep because of Hollywood predictability. Wrong again.If you haven't seen this film and expect memorable acting performances or anything interesting or informative about the phenomena listed above, forget it. 'Signs' is actually a story about a reverend who loses his faith when his wife is killed in an accident and his personal struggle to reclaim it. That's it. Yes the world is invaded by hostile beings who use crop circles as road maps and they try to snatch Mel Gibson and his family, for some reason, but these themes are lost in the sad puppy-dog looks of Gibson and Phoenix as they whine through the film and strive to prove how one is sadder than the other.Stiff acting, dabblings ripped out of E.T., Close Encounters, Independence Day, Alien and sappy emotional drama are all a viewer will get from this incredibly overrated waste of time. The aliens show up, make crop circles, and everybody gets confused and concerned. Then the aliens are actually spotted and the world sits on its hands, scared and unable to apparently do anything, at least in Mel Gibson's self-absorbing world. The whole alien encounter thing could have been left out and replaced with a rabid gang of kangaroos that were menacing Mel Gibson's family and the result would have been the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary but some shortcomings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***** CONTAINS SPOILERS******* In terms of tension and suspenseful build up this film has it all but I feel ultimately what lets the film down is the cop out ending. The film has a Blair Witch type feel in that the menace is felt but not seen (for the majority of the movie)which works really well. I for one gripped the sides of my seat thought large portions of the movie! What doesn't work is the sudden reversal in the plot to dovetail in with the various strands in the story and connect this to Mel's restoration in his faith. It just doesn't work and leaves you feeling short changed when you leave the cinema. I almost felt the film would have worked better if it ended in the cellar when the lights went out, at least the outcome would then have been left to the viewers imagination. Having said this the film is still well worth a view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Signs is really about (SPOILERS!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: FULL OF SPOILERS!After leaving the cinema, I was somewhat confused, but sure that the movie was NOT about alien invasion. Later on, I figured out some pieces of the puzzle. First of all, I was shocked after reading some many posts in which people thought that the movie was crap, because the aliens had no weapons, earth is covered by water mostly, the aliens were green, man-like and so on... It think it was pretty clear, that it wasn't about aliens invading earth (this was definitely a metaphor).There are many scenes that should really disturb you when think this movie has no second, subtle meaning: E.g., the boy killing the dog with a bbq fork (very strange, should be impossible, and the reaction of the other people is strange as well). Generally, some of the main characters act strangely in numerous scenes, which together with some of the little girl's comments might hint at a dream. The vet who accidently killed Gibson's wife plays a very important role. He is sorry for what he did, but Gibson is unwilling to forgive him (in one of the key scenes of the movie). He lost his faith including forgivingness as one of the major parts of chritistianity. Before leaving, the vet tells him that there is an alien in his house. This alien is the ONLY one that is seen in the entire movie (except the one on TV). This is Gibson himself, i.e. his faithless part, a demon. He created this demon by giving up his beliefs. The vet was haunted by the demon, couldn't take it anymore, and left. Most importantly, you never see an alien doing harm to anyone! Even when attacked by Phoenix, he does not defend himself. This is not an alien and he is not hostile. I believe the main topic of the movie is Gibson's bad relation to his son (after having lost his faith): his son wishing Phoenix was his father, the dispute at dinner,... If you paid attention, you might have noticed, that the alien (Gibson's faithless part) only haunts his son (in the cellar, upstairs). One of my friends was 100% sure to see a kind of reflection of Gibson on the alien's skin in one of the final scenes. This could be explained by the fact that the alien represents a part of Gibson. The three remaining characters are able to jointly displace the demon: Phoenix' baseball bat, the boy's asthma, the girl's water toxication problem. You can basically forget most the stuff that is shown on TV and said in the radio (about the invasion) as this is NOT real. E.g., it could be part of a dream. However, some things are hinting: "people in middle-east" found out how to get rid of the aliens (middle-east is the birth-place of many religions), water (holy water is of great importance in various religions) destroys the demons,...Things that are ambiguous, but that I don't understand (yet :) :- The boy killing the dog (the dog became aggressive when they tried to give him water...) - The killing of the second dog - The army office scene - It seems like the little girl had some ambiguous lines, that I was unable to comprehendFinally, I wonder how one can ignore the subtle meaning of the film: aliens that can fly through space but cannot open wooden doors?? The same alien that Gibson met at the vet, comes to his house to take his son? And, think about it: If the director would have wanted to show evil aliens, he would have at least made a different "fighting" scene at the end. The "alien" seems pretty harmless. There are no flying saucers, just "lights".Besides all that stuff, I didn't like the movie that much. I liked the first part, but was disappointed by the ending. The same holds for Unbreakable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very entertaining and well-directed sci-fi horror. It geinuinley has moments of utter brilliance. Like the camera showing a torch on the floor only hearing the noises in the background. Moments like that reminded me of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre-in my opinion the best horror of all time though Scream is also flawless its more of a comedy while Massacre is so clausterphobic.

		<fullReview>Signs takes us back to a time in film making when suspense was a mainstay of pictures bordering on horror or science fiction genre. From the start, until it's finish-Signs gives us an old fashioned way of telling a scary story. It is a film in which the mood is felt in a very subtle way-from a soft breeze blowing across the rows of corn to the camera shots showing both a mixture of bright light and shadows. Mel Gibson does a great job with his role. His reaction to what is transpiring before him helps to build the suspense even more. He is able to convey more with his facial expressions, than with words. Hats off to the director and writer of this film. One of the best films I have seen in a long time at the theater.

		<shortDescription>Well?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure about this film at all, yes it was well directed, and Gibson and co were fine, but I was disappointed with this film when I left the cinema about an hour ago. To say why I was disappointed would need me to reveal to much of the storyline, and since this film has only been in the country for 3 days I can't do that. What I will say is the trailers on TV for this are in my opinion VERY misleading. I notice in some magazines the director of this film is being compared to Steven Spielberg, well I noticed something he done in this film that was very similar to Spielberg, there is a section in the film when Mel's character is flicking through a book about Aliens, and the audience has the chance to see the pictures in the book, this reminded me of the part in Jaws when Roy Scheider is flicking through a book about sharks, which was a clever way of showing what could be about to happen. This film is a long way short of films of the class of Jaws or Close encounters though... a long way off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reheated Sixth Sense with a fundamentalist message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a reasonably atmospheric and scary film, but only because it's directed in the same style as the vastly superior Sixth Sense (including the use of the colour red to signal turning points). What is really disturbing is the message behind it. At first the idea seemed so silly that I assumed it was a satire on the less intelligent side of religion. It was frightening to find that the concept, that all things happen for some divine reason and every bit of luck is proof of God, was being taken seriously by viewers (and probably by the director too).SPOILER: I found the idea that the son had asthma to protect him from the alien gas particularly nasty, considering the number of people who die from that condition. SPOILER ENDThis is the kind of idea that gets religion a bad name, and leads the gullible to fundamentalism. Especially worrying when violence for the sake of faith is causing such terrible problems.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We like Mel Gibson, but the sum of Signs is less than the total of its parts. I thought I was paying close attention, but there were some plot jumps that would even challenge an Olympic class athlete; indeed they were leaps of faith.Gibson, in a persistent mournful state, seems more Victoria pining for Albert, than one living out a crisis of faith.Speaking of faith, another troubling point are the last words of Gibson's wife that later in the film become prophetic and prescient. What conclusion is to be drawn when the focus of that prediction, an American icon, the baseball bat, becomes the instrument of vindication, victory and violence.Perhaps it is all a question of what you do when confronted with terror!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not War of the Worlds, but War on the Farm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan has respected the canons of really great horror-movie production, but with a limitation that to me is a flaw.Mel Gibson plays (Father) Graham Hess, an ex-clergyman from an unnamed Christian denomination, or probably an ex-Catholic priest in an alternate world where priests can get married. He is a widower, and it is shown in flashbacks that he "lost his faith" when his wife was hit by a truck in a ghastly collision where she was pinned to a tree, nearly severed in half but still conscious enough for Hess to drive over and witness her choke out a few last, cryptic words.Hess lives on a farm in rural Pennsylvania with his brother and two small children when a crop-circle is cut into his cornfield. Mysterious happenings trickle into the movie from that point, as Hess (and the audience) struggle to find meaningful explanations to what they are experiencing...Here there is no doubt that Shyamalan conducts expert pacing of the story to build tension, but this is not a grand epic of skies filled with UFOs like War of the Worlds. This war is all told from the perspective of one man and his farm, as they barricade themselves at one point similar to one of the LIVING DEAD horror-movies. We get flashes of the mysterious but large-scale invasion echoed in the news reports on the family TV, but like most TV news it seems unreal, uncertain, hard to believe from where they are. So far this movie would not rise above any other low-budget horror movie that is not epic in scale, but Shyamalan brings in an excellent plot hook where the quirks or disabilities of the family-members become significant, and turn into "gifts" with which to nullify the alien threat in the final show-down.But the big flaw is that this movie is one, long commercial in favour of religion and belief. At one point Hess, although supposedly Atheist, is talking to God in moments of stress, and when he forbids his daughter praying at the kitchen table, she actually cries (although most children would jump for joy at the prospect of more self-determination). The unspoken question, "Why would a loving God make my children this way?" become answered as they help fight the aliens, although this could be turned around to ask why a perfect God would make aliens with a classic, deus ex machina, War of the Worlds-type flaw. A belief is reinforced that God helps some of his creations more than others, and this belief has killed more billions of people in war than anything else. At the very end of the film, we see Hess donning his clerical collar once again, at which point I decided to boo the screen.This is an outrageous sub-plot. Now, Atheists are still not free in the U.S., where George Bush said Atheists could not be good American citizens. However, in Canada they outnumber regular worshipers (27% to 21%) but must still endure constitutional mentions of "God". Ironically Atheists had more freedom in the Soviet Union, where spreading Atheist and anti-religious propaganda was protected by the Constitution. I will say only that Atheists should not be misrepresented as "lost sheep" who hypocritically turn to God in times of trouble, and that if people want to learn about Atheists the way they really live, and maybe get some exit counseling from religion, they don't have to look far on the Internet.</fullReview>

Alright, the movie didn't bore me, which is a good sign, but it sured bored a lot of people at the screening I saw. I've never heard more mumbling or people shifting in their seats.First, the acting. The kids were good, and Mel &amp; Joaquin did reasonably well, but some of the supporting roles were really poor: the female cop, the army sargeant &amp; especially M Night himself. I really hated the bit where they were sitting in the diner going "Is he the guy?", which was clearly intended to carry a double meaning, of "Is he that talented young director everyone's going on about?". His role was too important to the movie to squander on such a poorly-acted ego-massaging cameo.SPOILER: Second, the alien invasion was lame: I really didn't get why they wouldn't use any weaponry. To avoid nuclear attack? That is SO lame! Surely an unarmoured ground assault is far more vulnerable to nuking that a highly mobile air war? It is completely illogical, as Mr Spock might say.However, my main sticking point with the movie was the horrible "you gotta have faith" theme. SPOILER(ish): You could see a mile off that Mel was going to recover his faith in god, but what a lame way to go about it. What kind of weak stupid capricious deity just interferes in the world by giving people good luck? Surely the whole concept of a benevolent one-god depends entirely upon his/her pro-active engagement with the lives of the people he has chosen to "care" for?Enlightenment comes with the rejection of superstitious outmoded belief structures and the acceptance of your status as an individual in control of your own destiny. In explicitly stating that faith makes you a stronger person, more able to deal with trauma and tragedy, M Night spits in the face of those of us who have achieved some small aspect of enlightenment and rejected such superstitious, uneducated, blind folly. Only see this movie if you are one of the sheep. Peace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I normally gauge a film whether its worth the money you pay for to watch it. This film is definitely worth watching. The most important factor in any movie is the story. In the case of "Signs", the story is told well with simplicity and craftsmanship. It is almost a classic. It forces the viewer to use his/her imagination and gives a feeling that you want take hold of the camera yourself to see beyond what is not shown. Although there are scenes which are a little dragging and the lighting is dim, this movie is a "back to the basics" of filmmaking amidst the proliferation of "in your face" Hollywood flicks which have become tiring. M. Night Shymalan has indeed redeemed himself from "Unbreakable".</fullReview>

It is a wild conglomerate of scenes which do not in any way whatsoever enable the viewer to understand the meaning (if there is any at all...maybe the extra-terrestials with their shrewed minds can make sense of it). The movie offers a half-baked delivered postulation that one can be redeemed if one only interprets signs given him by the eternal, amorphous, all-knowing benevolent one. Same old message; I could take it if it weren't presented in such a hokey and poorly conceived array of events. This movie is one of the three worst I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan has become one of my favorite directors. Though many were disappointed in 'Unbreakable', which had big shoes to fill following the successful 'Sixth Sense', 'Signs' restores Shayamalan to the top. The best horror films, in my opinion, rely largely on suspense, and 'Signs' makes an art of it. I was never quite sure until the very end if the outcome for the Hess family would be positive or negative. The acting of all the main stars is simply stellar.This film had plenty of moments that made me jump, which I don't do very easily. However, it was not overdone to the point of predictability. And in true Shyamalan fashion, the "signs" are everywhere, but not usually realized until the end.I truly enjoyed this film. If you want a good suspenseful movie, this is the film for you. If you're expecting a whiz-bang special effects 'Aliens' type movie, this is not it. This is a thoughtful movie, a subtle movie, and pay-attention-to-the-little-details movie. And an excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I normally gauge a film whether its worth the money you pay for to watch it. This film is definitely worth watching. The most important factor in any movie is the story. In the case of "Signs", the story is told well with simplicity and craftsmanship. It is almost a classic. It forces the viewer to use his/her imagination and gives a feeling that you want take hold of the camera yourself to see beyond what is not shown. Although there are scenes which are a little dragging and the lighting is dim, this movie is a "back to the basics" of filmmaking amidst the proliferation of "in your face" Hollywood flicks which have become tiring. M. Night Shymalan has indeed redeemed himself from "Unbreakable".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan has become one of my favorite directors. Though many were disappointed in 'Unbreakable', which had big shoes to fill following the successful 'Sixth Sense', 'Signs' restores Shayamalan to the top. The best horror films, in my opinion, rely largely on suspense, and 'Signs' makes an art of it. I was never quite sure until the very end if the outcome for the Hess family would be positive or negative. The acting of all the main stars is simply stellar.This film had plenty of moments that made me jump, which I don't do very easily. However, it was not overdone to the point of predictability. And in true Shyamalan fashion, the "signs" are everywhere, but not usually realized until the end.I truly enjoyed this film. If you want a good suspenseful movie, this is the film for you. If you're expecting a whiz-bang special effects 'Aliens' type movie, this is not it. This is a thoughtful movie, a subtle movie, and pay-attention-to-the-little-details movie. And an excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The viewer should be paid to watch this movie and not pay for it! Even with the best and wildest imagination it is impossible to see any sense at all. It is a wild conglomerate of scenes which do not in any way whatsoever enable the viewer to understand the meaning (if there is any at all...maybe the extra-terrestials with their shrewed minds can make sense of it). The movie offers a half-baked delivered postulation that one can be redeemed if one only interprets signs given him by the eternal, amorphous, all-knowing benevolent one. Same old message; I could take it if it weren't presented in such a hokey and poorly conceived array of events. This movie is one of the three worst I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard a lot about this movie, both good and bad, and wanted to check it out for myself. I was so glad I went to see it and ignored all the bad reviews, cuz I thought this movie was fantastic. It was so scary- and you were constantly in suspense. At every second, you were just waiting for something horrible to happen. I was practically sobbing into my fiance's shoulder. And one thing that made this movie stand out from all the other alien, or scary movies, was that it had some depth to it. It actually ponders a greater issue- that is, if the world were to end, would you have hope? It really makes you think about that. It makes you realize how scary a world we live in, for those of us who don't have faith. And it really makes you rethink what you believe, when you're forced to face the issue. The acting was great. Mel Gibson was fantastic. Instead of the heroic character we are used to see Gibson play, he plays wonderfully as a man with great flaws, who is unsure of the future, and is in the midst of suffering. Mel Gibson is so versatile. Joaquin Phoenix and the children were awesome as well. I give this movie 41/2 stars out of 5. Go see it!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the 2nd MNS movie I have seen after Sixth Sense.I have to say I really admire him. First of all Signs is not an excellent sci fi thriller but it surely is a great movie.I liked the story of a man regaining his faith.I also liked the humour and the performances(especially Joaquin Phoenix). So don't go to the movie expecting a scifi thriller.Expect a well made movie portraying human emotions very beautifully.It has its creepy moments too. It has its flaws of course.I didn't like the alien because it looked stupid. The ending was tame.But otherwise this is one hell of a movie and I recommend it to every person who can appreciate good art. 9/10</fullReview>

Oh yea, and how did the Alien with his hand chopped off know exactly where Father Graham Hess's house was. DUMB!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I walked into this film expecting a good movie with a surprise ending. I got 2 hours of extremely interesting, sometimes funny, and mostly unsettling fun. As I sit here, I just got home, I know that all the windows and doors are locked and I am well defended. I took a date to see this movie and she throughly enjoyed it. Now I wouldnt recommend this as a first date or a romantic evening film, but I'd go see it again tomorrow. Dont wait for pay-per-view or DVD. It was dark and disturbing and will be much better on the big screen. I'm not saying this wouldnt be good on the home screen, all alone at night, but go see it at a big screen, with DTS or THX. The acting was pretty good, who would have thought a Culkin can act, the little girl and Phoenix were funny and scary. Mel Gibson was pretty much the same guy he is in most of his films, but it fit well here. I havent been this scared after a movie since Dawn of the Dead. I'm gonna hear every sound in my house tonight. Thanks Mr. Shyamalan !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>so deep and christian</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hi I just want a say that this N.Night Shyman movie is sooooooo deep and profund. It is about Mel Gibson with his son River Pheonix who own a house in a cornfield and these creepy ghosty aliens arrive to write "Signs" in his cornfields. Then Mel because an Atheost instead of the Reverend he was before, and it is about Spirituality and I shouldn't tell you the ending but it's SOOO clever! it turns out that one thing the Aliens didnt bank on from there Alien world back 'Home' is WATER! I would never of thought of that i swear. So they must of thought that America is a dry land, not a land of water! But anyway their are these CNN stories that remind me of 911 and i swear i nearly balled my eyes out at the end... and at the end Mel becomes a Christian again since after all only Christianty is the answer against these Aliens. so i love the religious massage to. All in all i think Shyman is a genius like Speelberg and Bruckhiemer. Congratulations! Eleven out of Ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the biggest let down of the summer of 02</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now now, don't get upset. This movie was far from the worst (I can't tell if that goes to MR. DEEDS or EIGHT LEGGED FREAKS) but as excited as I was for this movie, I did not walk out of it the happiest person on the block. First things first, M Night is a remarkable director. That hasn't changed at all. The movie did still scare me, but so did his other movies (with the exception of WIDE AWAKE, which I also enjoyed), but his other films left you with something more to think about. This was nothing but good direction, good acting,and no point whatsoever. SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Now, I'm not one of these people that are upset because there really was no HUGE TWIST ENDING a la UNBREAKABLE or THE SIXTH SENSE. In fact, I choose to look at it as though no huge twist ending was the huge twist ending. And like I said, the acting is great from everyone involved, and there are some genuine thrills, but for a movie that based it's entire marketing strategy on the crop circles angle, the pretty much left it in the dust. What we are left with is another INDEPENDENCE DAY told from the point of view of one family. The biggest letdown was the ending. Started off good with the basement scene. When Joaquin's character knocked the lights out, I was shocked, and excited. I was looking forward to a great battle scene filled with only sound, letting your mind fill in the picture, but no, the kid miraculously finds a light in about 30 seconds and it's business as usual. and that whole "SWING AWAY" thing at the end made me want to puke. Beat the thing with a bat and through water on it. I can almost be sure that M NIGHT did no studying of aliens or outer space of any kind and just wrote from the heart. It works well on the family plot lines, but not on a very involved subject such as this. Give the movie a try, Half of the people like it, half don't, but I was just looking for something more.

		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to Signs because I enjoyed watching the Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, but I was very disappointed after seeing Signs. The acting was good, I only wish they had a better script to work with. I've heard some people say this is one of the best Sci-Fi movies they've seen???? It makes me wonder have this people seen such movies as Close Encounters of the third kind, 2001, or Star Wars. My main problem with this movie is it doesn't know if it wants to be Sci-Fi, horro, or some religious drama. M's first two movies were very good so hopefully his next movie will makeup for his hickup called Signs.</fullReview>

If you're looking for a science fiction movie, forget about this one. It might be a thriller, or a horror movie if you are afraid of aliens, but for people who believe that aliens (if exist) are good, this movie just doesn't make any sense. If the movie had ended differently it might have been a good one, even great one. Maybe they'll make another ending for it... :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock reborn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether it was his attempt, or not, M. Night Shalaman has recreated Alfred Hitchcock's style, and in essence, made it his own.Structurally, there aren't many differences between this, and a film like Psycho. The opening credits follow Hitchcock's style of very distinctive music while showing all those associated with the film. As well, Shalaman's cameo performance in the film, although larger than most of Hitchcock's roles, show the influence that he had on him. Not to mention, the pure psychological aspect of the film's suspense. Much of the action is either implied, off screen, or very, very brief, keeping the audience guessing at what is behind the tension, etc.The difference between the two, however, is the brilliance of the story itself. The dual purpose of the title itself, "signs," is brilliant in its own right. Firstly, the actual signs, directing extra terrestrial life to various places on the planet, as well as the signs that Mel Gibson is recieving from God, to renew his faith.This outing by Shalaman is comepletely different from his previous exploits, and some may be disappointed with the absence of such a bizarre twist that exist in his previous films. However, the mere suspense alone, makes this film worthwhile, and worth anyone's $13.50, or however much it costs in your neck of the woods.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A second look at the movie ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enough has already been said at this site and at many other places about the disappointment that 'Signs' has churned out. So instead of giving a detailed review of the movie per se I thought I'd mention some other observations. Let me start with my very brief comments about the quality of the movie: Did you like the movie - Yes ! Were you glued till the end - Definitely ! Acting/Music Score etc. - Lovely ! Did the ending disappoint - *smile* :) umm... read on ...MNS, notwithstanding the small list of movies he has produced till now, has a central theme to the movie which he wants to convey. I believe he comes up with, what I would call, a central 'moral of the story'. That is of 'primary' for him. Please note that whatever be the 'moral of the story', it has got nothing to do with the actual story and characters.Now when MNS really likes a 'moral of the story' he then cooks up a story which does the 'secondary' job of conveying 'moral of the story' So far so good - nothing wrong with it as long as the end product rocks ! Incidently his second movie 'Unbreakable' was an amazing experience for me. I happen to be in that small minority which believes that 'Unbreakable' was better than 'The Sixth Sense' - anyway let me not digress. The central 'moral of the story' for 'Signs' is clearly 'Nothing is a coincidence' and all events (however trivial or sad or what ever they might seem when they happen) have their importance in the Grand Scheme of things. The movie definitely does an astounding job of conveying this to perfection. If you havent watched it then go ahead and see it to understand what I mean !So what went wrong ? Why all this murmur around the world about what a disappointing ending and all ... I must confess that I too was disappointed by the movie. Difference being I was not disappointed in the end. Half way through the movie I kinda figured that the ending would be rather bland - what eventually put me off and am sure is the central reason for most people not liking the movie is the fact that maybe ... maybe the story selection was not right. A concept as strong as 'Nothing is a coincidence' needs a story line which does not distract the viewer from it and leads to that concept. Though 'Signs' does convey it but the concept of Aliens and all is such a strong concept in itself that the mind is diluted. As I see it when you in the business of making thriller movies (MNS) you must make sure that the viewing public is not distracted from the central theme.So in isolation 'Signs' is a very good Alien based scary movie and also has a very interesting 'theme' to it. Possibly the two are so strong in them selves that mixing the two did injustice to them both and also the movie goer !That was my two cents :)Btw the 'Psycho' fans will love the opening of the movie with characteristic reference to the 'Psycho' theme music :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Audience Participation Req'd, but not as you'd expect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Possible Mild Plot Spoilers Forthcoming** Many moviegoers are jaded today. This has affected the way we see movies. Not just our viewing habits, but actually the way we perceive the films themselves. Horror is an incredibly mood dependent genre, and one difficult to accomplish without some measure of audience participation.The expert craftsmanship of M. Night Shyamalan as a filmmaker is evident in this film's use of traditional horror elements, from the Hitchcock inspired credits and score, to the "fake scare, now...jump!" techniques, even paying homage to old B-style invasion movies with a genuinely creepy military officer in a minor role providing some exposition while echoing other marines with similarly angular haircuts. With all of these elements, his direction takes and uses time honored traditions, and adds his own brand of magic, to save the movie from descending into camp, and to give a meaningful message to transcend a genre that has been done many times before.If a viewer walks into this film believing they can't be frightened by it, they are right, and I pity them. The power of belief is a strong theme in this movie, that filmgoers would do well to recognize. Accepting the film's reality is essential to relating to the situations, and experiencing fear. Other reviewers comment on the "unrealistic" physical weakness of the Intruders, failing to notice that the film establishes them as physically no more powerful than a little boy. If this easily dispelled "error", or the Christian elements involving a man in a crisis with his faith which are in line with his established character, have gotten in the way; then the viewer has missed something. The opportunity to enjoy a horror movie made "like they don't make 'em anymore", flavored by a brilliant modern director is worth a small leap of faith.</fullReview>

I understand that his wife was recently deceased, but I don't recall him smiling once throughout the entire movie. And the alien being a typical green man? Oh puh-leeze! That just furthered the common misconception of a "martian" having the physique of a human being but with green skin.One last thing that irritated me was the whole spiritual miraculous thing. Everything was there for a reason...the baseball bat, Bo's cups of water. Then...awwww....how sweet, Mel became a priest again!I laughed hard throughout the entire movie...it didn't scare me at all.

Seems that the publishers are slowly finding out if you don't call something science fiction that a lot of people will read it and like it if they soft peddle it enough. Signs is definately soft core and will have a broader range of sales that just SF fans, but for the same reason it was NOT for me in the least.

And during that time did you and your friends try to scare each other with stories about what could be lurking there, just feet from the safety of the front door? Did you play the ?what if' game? `What if you woke up one day and there where circles impressed in the corn field? What if you started hearing things rustling behind the stalks? What if you started hearing things that go bump in the night. What if, what if, what if?' As a child the game could go on forever it seemed. And as the stories grew and the night got darker, your imagination started playing tricks on you. Sometimes you could actually hear those bumps and rustles and feel the eyes staring at you through the leaves but just out of reach of your circle of light. Now, what if it wasn't your imagination. What if it was real? That seems to be the starting point for M. Night Shyamalan's latest venture. It seems at some point he started playing ?what if' and then took it a step further. This movie seemed to play on near primal fears at times. There are scenes in the movie that are straight out my childhood; being of the generation that grew up with ?Chariots of the Gods' and ?The Legend of Boggy Creek'. There is one scene that emulates that famous footage of Big Foot so well that it creeped me out to the core. I'm sure by now the premise of this picture has been outlined very well. I will just say that the stories are one: about a possible alien encounter and two: the questioning of one man's faith. Sounds like a bit of a paradox, huh? For most people the thought of aliens from other planets alone would put a question to their faith. But in this treatment we have it as a possible restoration of one's faith. The movie starts right away with the discovery of the crop circles in the field and from their keeps adding fuel to the fire of imagination. It keeps winding-up like the string on a top and then rips the cord and lets it spin away. This movie builds tension slowly and then throws in just enough bumps and jolts to keep you rivetedTo me the intent of this movie is to, of course, entertain but also provoke questions. Questions about fear, loss and courage, family and forgiveness but most of all faith. In one segment the question is asked, ?what kind of person are you?' One that believes in miracles and has faith that everything will be ok or one that believes that there is no one out there, that we are all on our own. It suggests that the kind of person we perceive ourselves to be could be questioned under certain circumstances and that we may be better, stronger people than we thought in the end. Strong performances by all but Abigail Breslin stole the show for me. I especially liked how the children where not condecended to but given respect by the adults. All in all it was a completely enjoyable experience. If I where a star man I'd have to give Signs a four out of four star rating. My thoughts. Yours?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An objective view of Signs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an age in which movie soundtracks are marketed as separate albums and singles, where soundtracks contribute to the overall ambience and mood of each scene in a film and moviegoers are subconsiously aware of a soundtrack throughout the running lenght of a film, the one thing that strikes anyone when they watch Signs is the spartan soundtrack, which by virtue of its sparseness, heightens many scenes and delivers more feel and tension to scenes in the film. Everything seems unusally loud and moviegoers are transported into the film along with the cast. There is nothing to distract anyone from what unfurls onscreen, nothing. Another aspect of signs is the camera work. The photography is indirect and has a very artistic feel to it. But it is also a letdown.What may have otherwisebeen accomplished with pomp and superb camera work is not. The camera angles and shooting of the concluding sequence in Graham's living room is surprising and lacks what one would expect. It's as if Shyamalan couldn't handle an action sequence. What Shyamalan wins by way of build-up and mystery, he looses in leaving too many loose ends and too much left unexplained. In an era of films like Independence Day and such, Signs leads us to beleive we will see more of some contact between intergalatic races and then when we do not, it is a letdown. A sort of anticlimax. And then, in retrospect, the film is not smooth. Scenes just seem to be put together with no flow and some times even border on ridiculous and cumbersome. What saves the movie and is worth serious moviegoers' time, is a superb performance by Mel Gibson, climaxing in an emotional dinner scene with his family. All in all, SIgns is a grabber upto the last ten minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie of 2002</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Signs' is a movie that is so multi-faceted that it is near impossible to sum it up in a single review. The movie is terrifying, hilarious, inspirational, moving, thrilling, and very rewarding. Director M. Night Shymalan (`The Sixth Sense') goes against the grain of modern horror movies and emphasizes character over action and suspense over violence. The result is a chilling and effective sci-fi thriller that may just be the finest movie of the year.Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) doesn't like to be called `father' anymore. His stint as a reverend ended six months earlier after a personal tragedy caused him to lose his faith. He now lives on a small farm in Pennsylvania with his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix, in the movie's best performance) and his two children Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (the adorable Abigail Breslin.) He enjoys a calm life, until the crop circles show up.The huge patterns carved into Graham's crops seem even odder when thousands of others turn up all over the world over night. Even more startling are the strange lights that appear in the night sky over Mexico City. The faith of Graham and everyone involved is tested as the world and their lives change around them.The director (who lives up to all the `next Spielberg' hype that surrounds him) uses many techniques to evoke fear in his audience. What works the most is the personal level he establishes. Whereas most alien invasion flicks use high-tech weaponry and government forces to evoke extra-terrestrial thrills, `Signs' shows what might happen to ordinary people, should aliens invade. The result is both realistic and affecting.`People break down into two groups,' Graham claims. `those who see signs and miracles, and those who believe we just get lucky. What you have to ask yourself is which kind of person are you. And is it possible that there are no coincidences?' Tough choice. And every person who sees this movie will ponder that question because the movie forces them to. And, for once, they will have time to think. As previously stated, this movie emphasizes character over action. In fact, halfway through the movie there is a 5-minute long scene that consists merely of the two main characters having a discussion. There is no background music, no diverting visuals - just two people talking. It is one of the most well written and acted scenes of the year.Don't get me wrong though. No matter how philosophical the movie may be, it has more than it's share of thrills. Taking a cue from Hitchcock himself, Shymalan truly "plays the audience like a drum." I have seen audience members scream, cry, and all but wet themselves in fear during this movie. I can't wait until Shymalan's next work.(****/****)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Alien Invasion film is back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film with M. Night Shyamalan as writer/director is becoming more of something to look out for. His unique style or emotional story telling places a fresh spin on the Hollywood formula films and Signs is no exception. Just like Unbreakable, which was basically a super-hero film that look nothing like a super-hero film, Signs is a war of the worlds film that looks nothing like a war of the world film. Loosely labelled a Horror movie, Signs is about a small family living on a farm that finds a crop circle in their fields. Soon after a series of events occur that changes their lives forever.Father Graham Hess played superbly by Mel Gibson has lost his faith in God and removed himself from the church. He lives with his brother Merrill Hess, played by Joaquin Phoenix and his two children Morgan and Bo Hess, played by Rory Culkin and Abigaul Breslin respectively. The four form a unique emotional connection that centres on the tragic death of Graham's wife, which is the cause of most of the drama in the film. The course of the plot is basically Graham's journey back to faith and the belief that miracles are more than coincidence, that someone is out there helping us.The film is also a return to the traditional edge of your seat suspense formula. You are constantly searching for answers and at time the painfully constructed tension is too much to bear. The entire film concentrates on the vulnerability of the key characters and their sometimes very close encounters. It also never forgets to humour you along the way, and the comic relief is both very funny and well constructed. In terms of rewarding you for purchasing the ticket, this film gets top marks. Whilst all this dramatic story telling takes place, the rest of the wider world is experiencing events that equate to an alien invasion, nothing short of the original War of the Worlds, and in many ways very similar to The Day of the Triffids. One could be excused for becoming frustrated that the wider story is not being told, but that is not the point of the film and it may also be the reason critics have received the film with a mixed response. The film did enough to my mind with respects to the wider world without losing focus on the four characters and their story at home. The film is basically a domino effect, where several dominoes are established in the course of the film and they all fall over in one key moment at the end. Some found this emotional and symbolic domino effect resolution somewhat unsatisfying, but I would certainly disagree.The film is not without flaw however, at some key moments the tension is interrupted by a lack of both physical and dramatic action. Some of the special effects towards the end of the film are questionable and you perhaps see a little too much of Shyamalan's not so little green men. Perhaps most of the film's flaws can be attributed to the fact that this is Shyamalan's first alien film.Overall however the film is a rewarding and entertaining experience, it can frustrate those who prefer an Independence Day style production but at the end of the day that is not what the film is about. If only more films could display the level of intelligence and maturity of this film. Still it has received mixed responses and chances are you will either love it or hate it, I for one love it and will probably go and see it again.</fullReview>

Shymalan's use of silence is fantastic making you hear ever little sound. I went to the movies thinking of alien invasion and surprise ending and left with thoughts of faith and purpose. The invasion actually becomes a secondary plot to one of premonitions. The title signs doesnt refer to the crop circles but to the 'signs' around us everyday. we just have to be aware.

		<shortDescription>Nice Suspense, Awful Script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My hat is off to the director, who crafted this movie with the idea to duplicate the suspense of an old twilight zone episode or Hitchcock thriller. While he succeeded at creating the sense of fear and the surreal I hadn't felt since Stephen King's Cat's Eye, he forgot to create a movie around the suspense with enough coherency to suspend the belief of a 21st century audience. All I kept thinking was the characters could have been so much more with so little effort and while very funny at times, the dialogue was forced and contrived and didn't fit like I great movie does. Ultimately however, the failure of this movie was the terrible science-fiction. I'm not complaining that we didn't hear an explanation to the mystery and incredulous visitors and their methods, what I'm p***ed off about is that I paid good money to see a movie where air breathing aliens (which largely consists of water) are also harmed by it --- must be they only dislike it in liquid form, eh? Funny how the aliens avoid the lake, but fly in clouds too. These aliens are intelligent enough to fly trillions of miles, and possess technology that we cannot dream of, yet one cannot get out of a flimsy locked pantry. Please don't brandish me as `not getting it' and one of those people who fall into the group that at my core must fear, rather than hope, that's not it. Maybe I am a bit mad that I was alienated because I choose to believe that luck is luck; maybe I think it is a bit indulgent that God choose to give Mel advice about how to save his family, while in the meantime millions were being abducted and killed by the aliens (maybe they weren't Christians?), but mostly I am mad that this movie was good is so many areas that so few aren't and was so bad in places it didn't have to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very very good, creepy, and frightening..but less ending...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know how to comment Shyamalan movies. To me, his films are always very very complicated (the plot is simple, but I can't tell the story without giving spoilers..so..see how hard is that??). Despite all of that, Me, you and all of you must agree that Shyamalan movies are always great, calm, atmospheric..and brain twister. If you know his habit of making twist in the end of the film (the Sixth Sense, Unbreakable) you will be very surprised wafter watching this one. This movie is undoubtly one of the creepiest movie Hollywood has ever made! The atmosphere is tense, the plot is simple (like every horror pictures), the acting is superb (Mel Gibson is really convincing) and the environment is very very isolated dark..and scary (I don't want to have any crop fields around my house!! No way!). I won't tell the story to you. No. It will ruin everything. You just have to see it and enjoy it. No, don't even think about logic. Because this movie isn't talking about logic, but about faith and scariness behind the trees...and the weird sounds...(in particular scene, Shyamalan uses no music, but "natural" sounds that really come from the grass and the crops.. so you have to hear every little sounds that came out...and that's creepy I tell you!). This movie is a masterpiece. No, not as great as the Sixth Sense, but it is better than Unbreakable, and darker and creepier than any horror movies I've ever seen. This one is really scary, believe me. Hey, horror fans out there, face your fears here! In the middle of the crops!! (Note: Please tell me if any of you saw an UFO in this movie, OK?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw SIGNS with my wife on Labor Day. We enjoyed the film but did feel the ending was somewhat flat. Now, that I've had some time to think about it. Perhaps this is more a "sign" of our expectations of having some big twist at the ending like The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable. I'm not sure this is a fair expectation to have of Mr. Shyamalan. What I found remarkable about his style is that he is becoming a master of suspense. Perhaps the Hitchcock of the 21st century? He certainly likes to show up in his movies like Hitchcock. While I think the ending was somewhat flat, I truly appreciated the non-gore factor to the movie. Without giving much away, Mel Gibson's character has a violent response in one scene and does something that should cause a lot of blood but instead we get a scene similar to one done by Hitchcock where the blood is less of a factor than the actual shock. Its a nice touch in a medium that tries all too often to out gross and out disgust the fans. Is this a horror movie? Is it a sci-fi movie or is it a "ghost" movie? You decide! I think Mr. Shyamalan has created a movie that looks at earth shattering events from the eyes of a single family. All too often Hollywood likes to see the world from the eyes of the President, executive or entire government view. Its nice for a change to see how a world event like "War of the Worlds" or the Second Coming would be dealt with by real people having REAL reactions. So for the critics, wake up! This is how people would really deal with this stuff unlike Independence Day or The Omen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me this film suffered the same problems "Unbreakable" did, which were many. First off, you take a fantastical story such as super heroes and alien invasion and you try to spin a human side to them. It's repectable in theory, but both of these offerings failed to capture an interesting home life with it instead feeling shallow and prefab. Then to make it more clever, just as the action is reaching its denouement, we switch in even closer so as to avoid showing the audience anything interesting. The world is supposedly run amock with thousands of aliens and we get a standoff with one. I don't need big flashy effects, but it honestly seems like a not so clever Ed Wood trick to save money.At least to me anyway, the first part of Unbreakable was better. This one seemed much more excrutiating. I was 30 minutes in going...gee I wonder if the daughter's problem with water is going to come to be something important later... We are not stupid.. we don't need something drilled in with a power tool. Please help me get this piece of junk out of the IMDB's top 250. A list for movies of a slightly higher caliber.</fullReview>

Character insight seemed forthcoming in the films description. So what went wrong? The film needed to go deeper. It's main action line was just too simple. I could not ignore the fact that we needed not just to be frightened, but needed to have an epiphany of thought as well. It did not happen for me. The acting was subdued, albeit good. However, the screenplay should have given us more to think about. It did not. I wanted to see more psychological turmoil, not just physical confrontation. The "signs" should have revealed more than damaged crops. It's a relatively simple task to make a film that scares us; complexity, however, can drive that emotion even deeper and ultimately make the experience more meaningful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have the unfortunate handicap of scrutinizing the premise and plot of films as I watch them. This would not be advisable when watching Signs. The film was a bit like religion in general (itself a sappily inserted subtext of the film)--scratch the surface (i.e. read up a bit on religious history) and it all starts to crumble like a house of cards. The concept behind Signs was utterly unoriginal (Aliens invade the planet), and to make things worse, the 'monster' was about as good in terms FX quality as your average B-monster movie from the 50s - one could have mistaken it for an attempt to mock those old movies, but that could not be the case since the film took itself so *very* seriously when it came to the Religion thing, which made it all the more sappy. And what happened to M.Night's absolutely brilliant twists at the end? The plot of this film essentially progressed *exactly* as one would expect. The only funny, original, or unexpected about this film was the jokes cracked by the two kids - though even those were few and far between. Three Big Alien Thumbs Down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, the anticipation for this movie was almost unbearable with trailers being shown something like three months before its release. I felt they really promoted the heck out of this movie, building it up like they did with Unbreakable, which in my opinion wasn't really that suspenseful of a movie but they were trying to ride the success of The Sixth Sense, and who wouldn't I guess. Anyway, I digress. "Don't See It Alone" was really the icing on the cake for me. That little tag line was like a magnet pulling me into the theater.Jackpot! M. Night Shyamalan has to be one of the most promising filmmakers of my time. Of course, my favorite genre is Horror/Suspense/Thriller so you can understand why I enjoy his work so much. With this movie he remembers the key to making a good scary movie: music, suspense and the ever elusive leaving things to the movie goers' imagination. He knows just what NOT to show to keep us on the edge of our seats, biting our nails. Plus he knows how to add humor to make you relax just enough to scare you even more in the next scene. You feel safe while you're laughing and he knows how to get you when you're feeling safe.I enjoyed the plot, the characters, and the overall film. The only complaint I would have (if I had to have one) is that Shyamalan messed up where a lot of other filmmakers mess up in a scary movie by showing a little too much. However, I am still extremely pleased with the movie and can't wait for Shyamalan to take me on my next ride of suspenseful intrigue and fear. Scary movies now stand a chance of being good again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely weak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very surprised to see such an ordinary theme in Shyamalan's latest movie. The leitmotiv in his two prior movies dealt with how the protagonist comes to terms with an extraordinary ability, while in "Signs" its about a priest who has lost his faith and how he finds it again. But instead of using the development of the protagonist as a theme, Shyamalan chooses to tell the story about an alien invasion and how its affects the protagonist and his "faith". If you look hard you may find some submotiv about if events are accidential or destiny (as in "Unbreakable").Even more surprising is how weak the visual construction of the movie is. Despite some stunning compositions, especially in the early stages, Tak Fujimoto's skill seems wasted. The compositions are flat and at certain points almost banal.The story itself takes alot for granted without informing the audience of it, but worse, it has elements which are so coinsidential that they belong in a bad b-movie. For instance, the only bookstore in town has one book about aliens and that book is perhaps the most insightfull book ever written, since it predicts everything which the aliens later do. Another example is when Gibson encounters the alien, locked up by Shyamalan, who for some reason knows they dont like water, he basicly leaves it be and doesnt call the police. "Signs" has many coinsidences which function as nothing but a temporary suspence/scare motiv.Overall a extremely weak movie, which has none of the originality that "Six Sense" and especially "Unbreakable" had. I cant help feeling that this was an amazing pitch that was rushed thru production and never found the time to mature into what it may have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why all the praise?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been wondering why this movie has been getting such high acclaim. First of all it lacks one of the most fundamental aspects of a movie; pace. It takes half of the movie for it to get past boring talk and uneventful scenes.Once the movie does get going, it has a few suspenseful scenes that make you anticipate an amazing ending, but leaves you at the edge of your seat wondering what happened to the rest of the film.The only good aspect of this movie is the great acting from Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix. The film could have been so much more. I give it a 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overdramatic, not scary, and full of holes (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The actors in this movie seem to have been told that the whole movie rested on every line of dialogue. I don't think I've ever seen another movie with such overdramatic acting.For example, SFC Cunningham was nothing but a parody of a military guy in an old horror film. If this film was meant to be taken seriously, (and I think it was), then that character was just a horrible disruption of whatever mood the director was trying to set. That happened over and over.So many acts by the characters didn't make any sense! Merrill went up from the basement to check the house, and even though there was an axe handy, he went up empty handed! Also, the aliens are smart enough to get here, but not smart enough to bring raincoats? Come on...The style of the movie was too much like Hitchcock - right down to some of the music, and while I was startled a couple of times, but I was never scared. I was really disappointed in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe I need to see this film again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an interesting film. The plot is kind of stupid and unbelievable, but that is secondary to the human struggles going on with Grant, Merrill, and the children. The events occuring worldwide are out-of-focus and surreal, but the fear, confusion, and family bonding of the family are intense. The characters are stressed out by the death of their wife and mother six months prior, and the alien invasion puts them all close to psychosis. They make it through the crisis of the attack, but whether the strength comes from a mystical message from the dying wife/mother, common sense (hit them with the bat, stupid), or a little of both, are questions that this film tantalizes with. I would view this film again, just wouldn't pay top $ - wait until video. It's a philosophically exotic film on one level, and a 20 year old B-Movie alien invasion on another.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, the anticipation for this movie was almost unbearable with trailers being shown something like three months before its release. I felt they really promoted the heck out of this movie, building it up like they did with Unbreakable, which in my opinion wasn't really that suspenseful of a movie but they were trying to ride the success of The Sixth Sense, and who wouldn't I guess. Anyway, I digress. "Don't See It Alone" was really the icing on the cake for me. That little tag line was like a magnet pulling me into the theater.Jackpot! M. Night Shyamalan has to be one of the most promising filmmakers of my time. Of course, my favorite genre is Horror/Suspense/Thriller so you can understand why I enjoy his work so much. With this movie he remembers the key to making a good scary movie: music, suspense and the ever elusive leaving things to the movie goers' imagination. He knows just what NOT to show to keep us on the edge of our seats, biting our nails. Plus he knows how to add humor to make you relax just enough to scare you even more in the next scene. You feel safe while you're laughing and he knows how to get you when you're feeling safe.I enjoyed the plot, the characters, and the overall film. The only complaint I would have (if I had to have one) is that Shyamalan messed up where a lot of other filmmakers mess up in a scary movie by showing a little too much. However, I am still extremely pleased with the movie and can't wait for Shyamalan to take me on my next ride of suspenseful intrigue and fear. Scary movies now stand a chance of being good again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern day Book of Job that would make Hitchcock proud.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** If you are a believer that a suspenseful story cannot be well told with a compensating shock in the end to justify the telling, if you think that suspense requires action and flash more so than innuendo and suggestion for the mind's eye, if you are convinced that rich subtext and characterization cannot compete with a focus exploration of the actual menace made manifest before your eyes, then Signs is definitely not the movie for you.But, if you like what Hitchcock used to do with audiences, if you admire way Kubrick would frame the shot, or if you like films that explore internal human struggles as much as they expose the external forces with which we contend then you will find Signs to be a very satisfying achievement.The crisis of Graham Hess is brilliantly intertwined with a worldwide crisis. But things develop slowly, carefully, meticulously constructed such that far more is happening in your mind than on the screen. This is a precious, rare commodity in today's filmmaking. M. Night Shyamalan deserves the highest respect for this achievement. Sure, the film will have its detractors because it doesn't sizzle, it doesn't have very much action, there are some minor plot holes and it doesn't really grab you and throw you for the loop you expect to get after such a long, relentless build-up. But, for those who enjoy subtly of narrative development and depth of character, Signs is a refreshing moment in a summer filled with utter mediocrity.Shyamalan uses the film to ask `Is it possible that there are no co-incidences?' or, to put it another way, `Can events be `signs' of bigger things?' His main character, Graham Hess, a former Episcopalian Priest, thinks he knows the answer. But, the events of Signs lead him to ultimately reevaluate his answer. In this way, the film effectively works on two levels simultaneously thereby making it Shyamalan's greatest work to date.On one level we have the invasion of the earth by extraterrestrials. We slowly learn this based upon glimpses (small signs) of their physical presence and an outbreak of a worldwide crop-circle phenomenon (large signs). On another level Graham Hess has lost his faith due to a personal tragedy. We slowly learn the nature of this through various characters insistence on calling him `Father' and in dreams that he has reflecting his final meeting with his now dead wife.Shyamalan plays both these levels off each another throughout the film in and by the extensive use of irony. Here are several examples.When Graham and Caroline are in the cornfield, he turns and walks away from her, pausing and states: `Caroline, stop calling me Father.' Caroline: `What's wrong?' `I don't hear my children.' In this sense Graham's response refers most immediately to the fact that he can't hear Bo and Morgan playing. But, at a deeper level it means he no longer hears his congregation and therefore, introduces his spiritual crisis.Bo leaves dozens of `half-empty' glasses of water on furniture throughout the house. Many of the film's critics find fault with this. Like most of the film's detractors, they attempt to apply (shallow, obvious) reason where it doesn't belong. This is offered as a sign of some nebulous form of metaphysical trouble. By the same token, these glasses - `half-full' - represent a sign that some force is making ready to take on the alien that invades the Hess home late in the film. Water burns the alien's skin like acid - which perhaps is the primary reason for their aborting their invasion of the earth.To `protect' the children from `becoming obsessed' with news events on TV, Merrill secludes himself in the closet under the stairway with the TV thereby becoming obsessed himself. In this way he learns that `experts' now think the crop-circles engulfing the globe are signs by which to navigate the planet, by which to `make sense' of the earth's terrain. In the end, however, it is the coming of the aliens that provides Graham with the signs he needs to recover his faith.Before Graham reaches for the knife by which to see what lies under the door to Ray's pantry, Shyamalan shows us sliced vegetables on a cutting board - signs of a knife. Then we pan left to reveal the knife lying there. Graham then cuts off a couple of fingers of the alien within the pantry when it abruptly reaches out for him from under the door. Later, these missing fingers are a sign as to which alien captures Morgan toward the end of thefilm and feeds with other memories of signs in Graham's mind resulting in what becomes a resolution to the immediate crisis.Merrill's reference to events being `like War of the Worlds' plays nicely into the TV's description of ground forces assembling and people flocking to churches and synagogues. Here, Shyamalan pays tribute to that classic sci-fi flick. That's exactly what happens in that movie. But, Graham reacts to people turning to religion in this moment of crisis lukewarmly. `I'm going back to the windows,' he says and returns to boarding up the house.so things can't get in.so you can't see out. No signs allowed, that's the attitude of the former Father Hess.Here we need to discuss to more criticisms of the film. Many contend that the boarding up of the house is a rip off of previous films. They also contend that Graham and Merrill are inept in the manner that they deal with the crisis. The second criticism is ridiculous. Graham and Merrill and not strong characters. The critics want something that Shyamalan is not attempting to provide. The main characters are not heroic, they are faced with this crisis while bearing a tremendous wound and while having little or no inner strength to draw upon. You might not like this fact, but it is handled quite well, works as Shyamalan intends. Not liking a character is not evidence of either lack of character development or poor characterization.The first criticism fails to see that the film seeks to pay homage to the genre (particularly to Alfred Hitchcock). Sure boarding yourself up in your house has been done before. But, never in this context. It is the context that is important whenever reading a sign and Signs is a collection of signs. In this context, it represents an attempt to shut out the world, mirroring the psychological struggle of the whole family in general and in Graham in particular. The criticism is shallow outcry of a viewpoint greedy for action, reason, strength, and effect when the entire point of the film is based on none of these.As the family is crying together at the dinner table, we pull back through the food and, more significantly, glasses of water to reveal the baby monitor, which immediately picks up on alien signals. Graham then goes to check the TV only to discover there is no signal, a sign that, as Graham says, `It's happening.'In the final memory of Colleen, Graham hears her say that the truck hitting her `was meant to be' which is exactly the way a dejected Ray describes it earlier in the film. In other words, they are telling Graham that the accident is a meaningful co-incidence. He has rejected such a view. But, his rejection has blinded him to signs both past and present. (Just like the critics of the film.) Graham tells Merrill that the last thing Colleen said was `See' and `Swing away.' That Colleen was remembering a baseball game where Merrill was at bat. But, in reality what she said was for GRAHAM to `see' and for Merrill to `swing away.' Whether Graham intentionally misrepresents the event to Merrill or he simply doesn't remember clearly at that point is not made clear to us. But, the point is that Colleen is calling Graham to `see' and in the context of the film to `see' the signs - which is a sign unto itself.The conversation between Graham and Merrill takes place during the second most important scene of the film. Merrill is seeking comfort from Graham, he wants Graham to say something to take away the anxiety of Armageddon. Graham, in a philosophical tone, tells him that there are basically two kinds of people. Those who see events as signs and therefore have hope and those that see events as random chance and are therefore filled with fear. Those with hope have it because `deep down they feel there will be someone to help them.' Those with fear have it because `deep down they feel they're on their own.'Merrill says he is `a miracle man,' a man of hope. But, Graham insists that things are random and `we are all alone.' The irony of this statement comes later when Morgan has an asthma attack as aliens invade the Hess home. This is the film's most important scene. Graham takes his son in his arms and helps him through the asthma attack without medication. `The fear is feeding it,' he tells Morgan. `Believe it is going to pass. Breath with me. Together. We're the same.'This marvelous scene sets up Graham's - and the world's - redemption. Simultaneously, while helping Morgan through his asthma attack, as he tells his son to `believe,' Graham begins to believe in God again. How? Ironically, by declaring his hate for God. This hate is his first step on the road back to the priesthood.It is perhaps the greatest irony that Morgan has asthma and it saves his life. Because his lungs are closed (placing him near death) when the alien attempts to inject poison gas through his nose, Morgan survives the assault. Equally ironic, because Bo has left glasses of water lying around the house, the final alien is scalded and falls under the blows of the bat from a minor league baseball strikeout king.There are many levels to Shyamalan's screenplay and they are all orchestrated in terrific harmony under his directorship. Signs is a film that clearly tells us `there are no such things as coincidences.' `Everything happens for a reason.' `Hope will win out over fear.' Whether or not you agree with this message, whether you find flaw with the film's ending in relation to its relentless build-up, Signs is nevertheless a modern version of the biblical Book of Job. It is meant to create anxiety as entertainment while offering you an optimistic message as well. You can either accept this offering or not. But, M. Night Shyamalan has crafted his story well and has given us a work that will affect you in many ways the deeper you look into it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...and incredibly heavy-handed. In the first few minutes, Mel Gibson INSISTS that he is NOT a preacher any more. From that point on, it's just the watching and waiting for the big moment when he regains his faith. And when it does eventually happen (come on, it's not like we believe Mel WON'T regain his faith), it's in a scene that's utter gibberish. Don't get me wrong. There are some GREAT scenes in this movie--about five in all. The rest is inconsistent (characters are capable of building spaceships to travel across the universe, they're strong enough to jump straight up onto the roof of a house, but can't get out of a locked pantry?) and s-l-o-w, presumably to let the suspense build. Someone should've spent a little more time on the script and a little less in a too-large supporting actor role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Misunderstood Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the film last night with 3 of my friends, and I think they completely misunderstood the "punchline" of the movie. The movie is called Signs, and while you are led to believe that the title refers to the signs that the aliens are leaving before the actual invasion, the title has a much more sophisticated meaning.Watch the movie from the beginning. There are many signs, or clues, to the eventual restoration of faith in Father Hess. Every member of the family has some significance, and Father Hess just has to take their traits as more than just coincidences -- Bo's phobia of dirty water is an eventual life saver, as well as Morgan's asthma, and Merrill's old baseball bat (and Hess' wife's last words). The movie slowly slowly comes to show that there is a reason for everything, and that a little faith can come a long way. Hess has to trust his own faith when curing Morgan.The movie is not about alien invasions. It's about people questioning their faith when the unbelievable happens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Sci-fi/drama summer flick of 2002</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie with some friends and I can honestly say that this film had to be one of the best summer movie of 2002. The other being Minority Report. Both excellent in its respective genre. Some of my friends didn't like it simply because they didn't understand the double meaning of the word Sign and to those that think the movie is about aliens, well it's not. It's more than that and I won't give out any spoilers. I am just here to give my comments of why this film was amazing.First, Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix were superb as well as the children which I thought did an excellent job.Second, the story-telling and the build-up of suspense was the main emphasis of this movie compared to other thrill-and-scare movies where they were not as great.Third, I like how the film focuses on just Hess's family because otherwise, if M Night had blended other elements like the news media, the neighbors, and the whole sort, then the audience would have been totally lost. But then again, M Night was being careful not to include those things.Overall, I enjoyed this film. I'm not sure about what my friends think but nothing I can say will change their minds. Even if I explain to those the underlying meaning, they would stand by their comment. I guess if you're gonna trash talk Signs, AT LEAST back it up with some reasoning. It doesn't mean I have to agree, just say why you didn't like it. If you can't, then you're either full of it or you want to be the odd man out.I'd give this movie (Signs) 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By far the dumbest movie I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***BIG TIME SPOILERS ALERT***This movie has finally prompted me to write my first review of a film on the IMDB website. This is one of my favorite web-sites but I've never felt strongly enough about a movie to write a review. Anyway, again this was the most moronic movie I've ever seen. I would say this is the movie I hate most if "AI" hadn't come out last year, but that one still holds that place.First and most obvious comment: What kind of dumb-a#$ aliens would invade a planet that is 80% water when they melt when they come in contact with it. Not only that but they can't open a fricking door or defend themselves from a baseball bat either. Stupid.Although I will praise the producers of this movie as they came up with the best concept ever in the history of filmmaking. I would have loved to have been in the room when this idea was pitched to the studio to pay for it, the meeting lasted about 5 seconds and here is is how it went: Producers: "We want to do a remake of "Independance Day" and we won't spend one cent on special effects!!!!" Studio: "Sign me up!!!!!" (By the way "Independence Day" is one of my favorite movies. The premise was almost as dumb but the special effects more than made up for it.)As a christian, I will say that the underlying message of a pastor finding his faith was a good one, and I'm very much in support of that. But the way the director depicted that was just plain annoying. He kept putting in these flashbacks of that car accident right in the middle of the action. It was the equivalent of Bill Pullman having a flashback of his dying wife right before he engages the enemy in his fighter jet in ID4.And the way that Mel's kid was saved was really stupid too. God closed the kid's lungs from asthma knowing that poison alien gas was about to kill him. I don't think a real miracle would be that complicated. I will admit there was alot of suspence, but the way the movie turned out made me regent all of the time I wasted on edge. I still can't believe these lemmings that have spent all of that money on tickets for this cr#p.Don't waste your money.... 1/10 ***'s</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit I did read a lot of the user reviews and it left me with mixed feelings about watching the film. But I am glad I did. It is definitely one of the best films this year, and I recommend it highly.There was a lot of negative criticism about the plot holes and the ending of the film. I am not here to justify Shyamalan's logic but to address the main criticism, if the aliens are water averse why are they here? Well, why do we assume the aliens to be that smart? Just coz they can travel across galaxies???? Cant they have weaknesses that they are not aware of? Just coz we have been exposed to films that portray aliens to be distinctly superior to humankind or read books that translates the same, are we to assume that they have no weaknesses at all? Maybe, their weakness is water, and they are not aware of it.The ending, heavy-handed as it is, could have been better. That got me thinking on the possible endings. My friends and I came up with a few but they were either ludicrous, lame or predictable. Unless some of the reviewers can come up with something smart, I think any other ending that Shyamalan would have drawn up would have met with just as much criticism or disappointment.It is a pity that the director came up with 'The Sixth Sense' as his first film, and it is all the more unfortunate coz most of the users are criticizing 'Signs' in comparison to that film.'Signs' is a good film in many aspects. I enjoyed it thoroughly for its execution, and if people stopped dissecting the film as much, they might also enjoy it. The acting, the camerawork, and the music complement the film very well.I rate the film 8.5 out of 10. ENJOY!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dissenting Opinion: Shyamalan sacrifices characters for "surprise endings"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Knight Shyamalan's "The Sixth Sense", and his latest film, "Signs", have both done very well at the box office, not to mention gaining some critical acclaim. He brings a wonderful sense of mood to the screen, portrays human emotion effectively, uses dialog well, and his slow, determined pacing takes the audience through wonderful psychological distresses. He also presents interesting and compelling supernatural ideas for a premise to get us to wonder and imagine other-worldly situations. Mixed in with that, his surprise endings successfully leave the audience feeling duped, but happy. We were into looking one way, while the magician skillfully removes our wristwatch without our noticing. What a clever skill, right?Well, the problem is that his technique for getting us to look the other direction is, frankly, done on the cheap. To illustrate the point, understand that supernatural/sci-fi films require at least two storytelling elements: "suspension of disbelief" and "staying within the circle of plausible possibilities." That is, "suspension of disbelief" is where an impossible premise is used as the framework for a story. For example, we can believe in aliens, or that a child can see dead people, because we can imagine a fantasy world where that may take place in our mind's eye. Because we know it's not a true story, which we would "disbelieve", we instead "suspend" that disbelief in order to keep the fantasy going. And, as long as everything that happens that story makes sense, we're willing to continue playing the game. This is the "circle of plausible possibilities." If the boy who can see dead people suddenly becomes an award-winning chef and gets a TV cooking show, we don't like it because it distracts from where the story was going. If the story and the characters don't remain consistent with the premise, we are left unfulfilled.Let's address how these take place in two of Shyamalan's films, "The Sixth Sense", and "Signs."In "Signs", Mel Gibson plays Graham Hess, an ex-priest who lost his faith after his wife died in a freak auto accident. When crop circles suddenly appear around the world, followed by a hostile invasion of aliens, he begins to wonder about his own faith in God and the meaning of life. Challenged to face his own demise (and that of his family), he desperately searches for true signs, purposes to life, anything to help him come to terms with his situation, and the ultimate meaning of life. Yet, during the struggle for survival, he pieces together what had appeared to be unrelated statements or events from his past, enabling him to save his family and regain his faith in God.Here, the suspension of disbelief is "aliens attack from outer space." The circle of plausible possibilities include ways he deals with that, and his personal search for the meaning of life. Whether he actually saves his family, or how, is not really important. The story, and the one the audience is really watching -- is the development of his character. How does come to terms with his own loss of faith? How does he reconcile the struggle between logic and faith, the two classic opposites that challenge most people in their quest for belief in higher powers? These are universal themes, and we're given a story that promises to tell us something new. What we are looking for is something that brings him around to whatever conclusion he's going to come to. Yet, when we are given the surprise at the end, which suggests that there are no coincidences, and that everything happens for a reason, and God has a reason for everything, this premise is presented so unambiguously, so far-fetched, that it falls outside of the circle of possibilities for this story line. It's not that it be the case, but it detracts from the story we were being told. All of Hess' objectives are gone. It's as though God himself spoke to him and said, "it's like this". All you can say now is, "oh, ok." What happened to the story we were being told?In "The Sixth Sense", the same thing happens: the suspension of disbelief involves a boy that can see dead people. The other story involves two characters with personal struggles: the aforementioned boy and his relationship with his mother and others in his environment; and a child psychologist who has to deal with his own inner demons and his failing relationship with his wife and search for personal meaning. The circle of possibilities includes all the ways that these people have to face and deal with these problems. Whatever happens to help them come to terms psychologically with their searches is fine--as long as they come to discover something about what they're looking for. However, the surprise ending shows us that none of these issues are even relevant anymore, so we can toss out all the invested emotions we put into them. Their stories no longer matter.In each movie, the endings are surprises because they addressed a simple "fact" of the backdrop -- how it is the boy saw the psychologist, or how god now unambiguously exists. We were surprised not because we didn't see it coming (even though we didn't), we were surprised because we didn't NEED to see those stories solved. Sure, it's fun that we did see them solved, but the movie isn't over till the character's stories are concluded too. It doesn't matter that we can't predict the ending; what's important is that all endings tie together.Compare either of these films with Alfred Hitchcock's classic "Psycho." Here, we are lead to believe that Norman Bates and his mother live in a hotel and are killing people, and the surprise at the end shows us that it wasn't quite what we thought. Yet, the was his psychological profile: why he did what he did, and how other characters were affected by it. This is addressed the characters' issues; we weren't left hanging.Granted, "complete" filmmaking is harder, since tying things together effectively requires an extra level of ingenuity that only a true master of storytelling can accomplish. Shyamala's skill is his portrayal of the human spirit and character. He gives us three-dimension people, not just kids in a summer camp about to be murdered. These people have motivations, ambitions, goals, or losses that they need to come to terms with. He just needs to learn how to incorporate their issues with his surprise endings, so that all holes are filled. What makes a story compelling, is the characters discovering things for themselves, through their own interpretations of events, and have the conclusion - surprise or not - come from the results of those learned lessons. Otherwise, we lose the bonding that we feel for them. Shyamalan's films are good, but not nearly worth the critical acclaim they are getting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Found My Cure for My Insomnia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know what I was thinking when I decided to see this movie.The trailers definitely made a lasting impression on the film, and I made a note in my mind to watch it.I know that a lot of reviewers are going to disagree with me, but this is the one of the worst films I have ever seen this year. Again, this is just my opinion.The film can't seem to be on the right side of the fence. It tries its best to combine science fiction and drama in one slice, which Shyalaman fails to do. There are plotholes in the movie that I won't talk about.I just felt so cheated after watching this film. The backstory was a nice bit but everything else just didn't seem to fit.Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix were the only saving graces in this film, giving good performances. The production design was also superb, and the editing was decent. However, the film in itself just fell short of my expectations.When the DVD comes out, I am buying it not because I like the film, but because this apparently might be the cure for my insomnia that I've been looking for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A whole lot of nothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has some very good things going for it. Mel Gibson gives his best performance to date. Joaquin Phoenix, who played the evil, whiny, wimp in Gladiator convincingly plays the polar opposite in this movie. Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin are very talented young actors. M. Night Shyamalan proves to be a very good director. His camera angles and long shots build suspense very well. With all of that going for it, this is still not a very good movie. As good as Shyamalan is as a director, he is just as bad as a screenwriter. From the get go there is a plothole through the middle of this that makes the whole movie not make any sense. He gives us a priest from a religion that probably doesn't exist that has lost his faith, his ever faithful brother, alien obsessed son, and cute but spooky daughter. We meet the sheriff, the bookstore owner and wife, the man that caused him to lose his faith, and thru flashbacks, his recently deceased wife. There are a few other people in the movie, but not many. Shyamalan gives us an isolated area in Pennsylvania that seems borrowed from an old Twilight Zone episode. The lack of speaking parts makes it seem all the more isolated. And then he blows it by asking us to believe that a global conspiracy may be afoot. He tries to pay homage to so many films from Independence Day and War of the Worlds to E.T. and the famous bigfoot home movie that it comes off as hokey. The final scene just adds to the ever growing list of plotholes. And in the end we find that this far-fetched and plodding film is trying to tell us that life is not an accident and everything happens for a reason. Shyamalan just goes a strange and pointless route to get there. The Sixth Sense this isn't. 5 of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signs of a Lazy Audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I left the theatre after seeing SIGNS, my first reaction was, "What an incredibly accomplished build-up this movie had--and what a disappointing ending."Having had time to think about it, I now see I did what a lot of people (including some in the user comments below and above) did.I didn't judge this movie on its own terms.This movie is not THE SIXTH SENSE. It was not supposed to be THE SIXTH SENSE. If people want another SIXTH SENSE, they're only deluding themselves. There will never be another SIXTH SENSE. So move on, people. If you want Shyamalan to just make the same movie over and over again, you are only wasting your time and his. **SPOILERS AHEAD**Okay, I admit it. When the aliens finally arrive, they are a failure. Although one person in the user comments came up with the ingenious explanation that what we saw were actually only bioengineered warriors working for the real aliens, the fact remains that reducing an alien encounter to extraterrestrial Morlocks looking for human food is not worthy of the superb buildup Shyamalan accomplished through the first three-quarters of the movie. But maybe the point is, NO ending could be worthy of that build-up.Or maybe the point is, the movie wasn't about the aliens after all.**END OF SPOILER ALERT**This movie won't leave me alone because the response to it by so many people points out the big problem with movies today.The audience.How can filmmakers make "the quality movies they USED to make" when the audience won't let them? Some people have pointed out that Shyamalan made the crisis of faith for the Mel Gibson character an alien invasion because that was the only way to get the audience to go see the movie. I think it's more complex than that, because Shyamalan wanted the crisis of faith to concern a personal encounter with the ultimate challenge to faith, the end of the world.Still, the ball is being put in the audiences' court. Do we want movies to affect us in personal ways anymore? Do we want them to ask questions about deeper issues like faith, love, or the universe around us? Or are we only out for the big bang now, and any movie that doesn't deliver that big bang makes us pout like toddlers.Some people want to dismiss this movie because it didn't "deliver". But I can't. I don't want to.This movie tries to say something about us. Don't we want that from a movie anymore?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan blew a chance at genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhat of a SpoilerI think Shyamalan's "Sixth Sense" was brilliant in that it gave a different view of ghosts and how some people after death may inhabit the "astral world" and not realize that they have died. Shyamalan didn't resort to making a typical scary movie about hauntings. Shyamalan also had a chance to make a different movie about crop circles. The movie could have been a break-through explanation of why these truly advanced extraterrestrials are contacting us with beautiful crop circles. There have been no reports of people being harmed by these ET's. Quite the contrary, the crop circles have been shown to have health benefits to people who visit them. Instead, Shyamalan shows us that he is just out to exploit the crop circle phenomena to make a buck using fear and the standard Hollywood portrayal of ET's. I'll be taking my $'s to go see the movie "Crop Circles: Quest for Truth" by William Gazecki.</fullReview>

There is a greater reason for her doing so, even is she herself doesn't know it. This was NOT a movie about aliens. This was not the sixth sense. This is a movie about a fall from grace, and the finding of your faith once again. Why did they use the alien scifi pretence... would half as many people have seen it if it were a drama like steel magnolias or the divine secrets of the ya ya sisterhood? Probably not.The only thing that did annoy me was that there wasn't an explination of how the aliens were defeated...

		<shortDescription>MY Advice on Watching this Movie ... Don't !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just when I thought there is no way someone can make a movie worse than Unbreakable along comes Signs to prove me wrong. This had to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Signs is a mixture of the ultimate rip-off flick The Blairwitch Project (1 hour plus of pure nothing) and the excruciating boredom of The Panic Room. The movie even managed to work in the classic prolonged dark blank screen shot we so fondly remember from Blairwitch (how clever). I still don't know what kept me from getting up and walking out on this trash ? oh maybe it was the work of aliens keeping me there against my will ? oooooo I'm so scared. This movie had a lousy script (a great cure for insomnia though) which made a mockery of the whole idea of `conflict resolution'; the acting was brutal; the directing was even worse; and overall it was just a cheap looking movie which an appearance by Manoj Nelliyattu Shyamalan only cheapened it more. This guy is no actor and it is starting to become evident he has no business on either side of the camera. Manoj Nelliyattu Shyamalan is a one hit wonder with the Sixth Sense. Irregardless of the fact that his movies are making a profit for the studios (how can they not make a profit, they are such cheap productions), bottom line is he's only embarrassed himself with his last two movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only Gibson makes this worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, I thought to myself that maybe I was wrong about M. Night Shyamalan after seeing the Sixth Sense the second time. Once I paid attention to the little details, camerawork, lighting, set design, I realized he has a real touch for suspense, even if the plotting is a little naive and childish. Then came Unbreakable, which again had a couple of cinematically interesting moments but ended with an awful plot twist. And now Signs.  I'm sorry, people: while the cinematography and camerawork are great, somebody needs to teach this guy how to write a good movie. There were maybe one or two somewhat spooky moments, but the last 10 minutes just ruins it, with the idea of an alien invasion that just happens *SPOILER* to fail because "some primitive towns found a way to beat them."  What is this movie really about? Faith? You want to make a movie about faith in God, really MAKE IT! God knows we could use it! But don't have Mel realize his spiritual calling because *SPOILER* his wife was telling him before death to remember to hit the alien standing in his living room with a bat! Two standout performances by Gibson and Phoenix (who make quite believable brothers), in spite of a limp-ass script, are the only things that make this film bearable. I just hope somebody begins helping Shyamalan out with his scripts: he's got a great sense of timing, pacing, and dread, but his plots and scripts are those of a child with a bankroll. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan has again delivered a very watchable movie. The actors performances were well done. What did bother me was the bold assertion that superstitious people (IE: people who believe in miracles) are better prepared to handle adversity than rational people. The movie is a good, old-fashioned, return to the horror movies of the fifties, portraying off-world aliens as monsters. And the movie is fun on that level. I just did not appreciate the heavy-handed religious message. I get enough of that in the newspaper and on the radio every day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very entertained through this movie. I laughed a lot more than I thought I would, and I jumped a few times. It sucked me in up until the end, when I realized that the movie wasn't about the aliens: where they came from, what they wanted, etc. It faded to the credits and I sat confused saying, "What the hell was that movie about?" I was disappointed when I realized it was about Mel Gibson's character's faith and not the aliens. It took me a couple of days to realize this. "Oh, Signs, I get it." I walked out of that movie entertained, confused and with a very unsubtling feeling in my gut. I've never such conflicting feelings for any other movie in my whole life. But I thought it was very well made and scripted. I just hope that the next time Shyamalan makes a movie he makes it clearer what plot the audience is supposed to focus on. Maybe I I need to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Signs" Struggles to Find Itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are looking for a film about crop circles or even some good sci-fi, you will be disappointed. Crop circles, which most of us in the real world believe to be hoaxes, don't play much of a role in this film. They only seem to be used here to attract an audience. Once you get beyond the first few scenes, which are incredibly slow and stilted, there's none in sight or even any mention of them. M. Night Shyamalan drags things out over the first 75 minutes and doesn't develop what turns out to be the theme until the last half hour. Even the extraterrestrials seem to play bit parts as this film boils down to one man's struggle to find his faith. Mel Gibson, as Father Graham Hess, had some good emotional scenes, but I was surprised he allowed the denomination of his character's religion to be blurred since his faith is so important in the end. I laughed through many parts of "Signs," not because the characters were all that humorous but because most of the film is just that ridiculous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signs of weakness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing I'll say for this movie; no one is indifferent about it. However, to be blunt, it's a waste of money and time. What I found the most frustrating is I could not identify with any of the "what ifs" unless every person portrayed was under psychiatric care. In other words, not one person behaved believably in what I would call a universal set of given circumstances and responses. Consequently, many times as I watched I would go "huh?" for example ***Spoilers***:If a child of mine killed one of the family pets, we would ALL have a rather hysterical reaction to it... especially the kid who stabbed it with a barbecue fork. In the movie, this is perfectly acceptable behaviour.If a child of mine had a penchant for drinking (and not drinking) water, I would talk to that child about it and I would make sure she didn't leave the glasses all over the place. In the movie, this is perfectly acceptable behaviour.If I saw a person with a bloody wound in his side, I would ask about it. I would want to know that he was okay. If that person told me that he had locked an alien in his pantry, the LAST thing I would do is go check it out. In the movie, this is perfectly acceptable behaviour.And there were two scenes that made me do that thing... you know when you run your fingers hard down your face because you can't believe what you're asked to believe? Well, when Merrill Hess is talking to that army guy (why is he there anyway??) and this guy says "Hey, didn't you used to play baseball?" right out of the blue. It was a glaringly obvious "plot point" that I did that fingers thing. And oh, the ending, oh my... "Swing away" Okay folks, you're in a life and death situation, your child is being held for who-knows-what reason by an alien and you decide to speak cryptically. That was when I did the other fingers thing.The pacing of the movie is just too slow, the pauses drawl to the point where it is no longer acceptable or normal that people are not speaking and/or responding. It worked in Sixth Sense because of the juxtaposition of the "two worlds" we were in. But in Signs it feels as though they stretched a 10-page script into a 2 hour movie.The whole business about the "water is to aliens as kryptonite is to Superman" thing is too silly for words.Say good night M. Night. Loved Sixth Sense, liked Unbreakable, but yer gonged on Signs!</fullReview>

Wow was I surprised when the aliens started walking around and breaking into peoples houses.Very suspenseful. Great job of portraying a family coping with fear and death.But could have still done all that and been a great or better film without the special effects. I think it could have been done subtly like just hinting that ut was real aliens and giving the audience a choice to decide what to believe was happening in the end.Anyway great movie overall. But crop circles can be done by a couple of drunk guys with boards and ropes - but does that mean that all of them were pranks.......???You Decide !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a ride...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whew. That's the first sound out of my mouth at the end of Signs, the newest film from director M. Night Shamaylan, the man behind The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. I expected spooky, creepy, jumpy, and I pretty much got all three, but not exactly in the way I expected, and I suppose that was Shamaylan's intention. We've all seen the ad campaign for this movie, crop circles and what that may portend, but I'm pleased to say that the ad campaign has not given away too much of this movie, and in today's movie marketing, that's a very unusual feat. I'm also very glad that even despite reading a couple of other reviews for this film before going, I don't feel as though anything was given away (well, nothing of significance, anyway).Mel Gibson, despite not even being visible on the movie's poster, is the star of the show. He's a fallen Episcopalian priest, having lost his faith after the seemingly pointless death of his wife, leaving him alone with his two children and his brother, a failed minor league baseball player, played by Joaquin Phoenix. He awakens one morning in his very empty-feeling house to the sound of his children screaming outside in his cornfields. Rushing outside, he finds some of the crops depressed into an eerie pattern, a `Crop Circle' phenomenon that, as it turns out, is being repeated at various spots all over the globe. What could it mean? Is it some globe-spanning hoax? Are the E.T.'s finally about to invade? Does it all really matter in the end?This picture has a pace and a mood that is unlike anything any other filmmaker is utilizing these days. Shamaylan is an original, and in my opinion has yet to make a film that belies that label. He can take premises that, on the surface, most moviegoers would write off as lighter fare and treat them with a weight that demands serious consideration on the part of his audience. After all, ghost stories and comic-book super-abilities? Who would pay to see such movies? Somebody sure has, since more than $400 million of combined box office can't be wrong.Shamaylan's use of comic moments is ingenious, using just enough of them and spacing them out just enough to put us at ease before something else jumps out and goes `boo.' His use of silence is wonderful in conveying anticipation, which is often more frightening that what we end up seeing. The music in the film is sparse, primarily used in transition from one scene to another, leaving the sounds from the cornfields and the bumps in the night and the looks on his actors' faces to convey the tension of each scene. I won't say this movie is Hitchcock-like, because Hitch never delved into the subject matter Shamaylan does routinely, but the effect is similar.We don't see much of what it is we're supposed to be afraid of in this film, and that's part of what makes this film so effective. With all of the time and emotion these characters have to anticipate what it is they fear, we learn what it is that makes them respond the way they do and what issues they have to resolve. Even when we do see what we're supposed to be dreading so, we don't see it/them all that well as it/they remain/s almost ethereal. There are so many idiosyncratic and seemingly ridiculous plot points that, in the end, all come together in an almost laughable logic that I kicked myself afterwards for not seeing it sooner.Of course, Shamaylan had help in this wonderful work in the part of his cast. Gibson's tortured Graham Hess is likely his best pure acting job since Braveheart, but in a completely different way. Gibson displays a quiet intensity I don't believe I've seen from him before. This fallen man of God, claiming to have lost his faith, has probably not lost it so much as he just hasn't dealt with being angry with God for the first time. He tells his brother at one point that if the events unfolding around them indicate the end of the world, no higher power will be at hand to help them. Even when his brother tells him that he needs to curse and sound like he means it, Graham finds it difficult, and even is laughable in trying. The two young actors playing Graham's children are wonderful, displaying an off-center emotional state one could believe coming from those six months removed from their mother's death. The director himself even has a small but key role, and his one big scene is very gripping (but I certainly can't tell why).I wonder how Shamaylan would fare if he were to use his obvious talents in other genres, such as a slapstick comedy or a lush romance or a grand historical epic. He has obviously mastered the spooky, creepy, jump-in-your-seat genre, so why not try something else? But then again, why should he bother? After all, nobody ever asked Hitchcock to do a slapstick comedy, either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Signs' is a tribute to Steven Spielberg's 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'. What we don't see is more interesting than what we do. A man with a family he is afraid of losing and the unexplainable concept of why 'THEY' are here. M. Night Shyamalan does a good job of building the tension to a finale that doesn't end like his other films where there is a huge twist but rather the ending of this film is one that seems right and makes one feel tranquil. Mel Gibson does some very fine work here and for a guy who has outperformed Harrison Ford in terms of quality films in the last ten years, he seems poised to carry the torch for his generation along with Tom Hanks.</fullReview>

Suddenly, crop circles appear. Mel Gibson and his on-screen brother, Joaquin Phoenix, think its the neighbors' bad boys. Let's guess...could they have made those perfectly cut circles? Didn't think so. The rest of the movie could be described like this.... annoying children (can i get a glass of water? there's a monster...that line is just plain annoying)... long moments of silence ... driving to town ... watching the news ... and then the end is slow and does not captivate the audience. I would have to give this movie a 1 1/2 out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie last night, August 23rd. I'm probably the last person in America to see this film, and I wish I hadn't. The trailers for the film had me fooled, as many, that this was a movie about aliens. Sure there were aliens in the movie, but the movie was about bringing a people together. There have been many movies like this, whether it's a volcano (Dante's Peak, Volcano), tornado (Twister), flood (Hard Rain), meteor (Armageddon, Deep Impact), and now aliens. The only thing that made this movie different was it had M. Night Shyamalan's trademark epiphany scene. He takes you through the movie wondering and questioning what is going on, then justifies them all in 2 minutes. Sixth Sense was original, and the other two just reuse the same story telling. Wait for it on video and use a free Blockbuster rental to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really boring and lousy sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched the movie this evening, and I can safely say it is truly a bad and confused story, this movie is not for people who likes to actually see alien creatures, this movie has far less alien shots than Contact, but unfortunately it is also very boring and has extremely poor acting and script. The main characters are two kids in the range of 6 to 12 years, along with Mel Gibson and some other guy. I would hesitate to call this a sci-fi, it's much more of a drama about religion and family than about UFO's and crop circles. Finally the movie does not even try to answer anything and leaves the viewer quite empty.</fullReview>

That's the reason the movie didn't delve into any alien-discussions outside of the immediate family.

		<shortDescription>Sign Should Say "Exit Theater"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really expecting an entertaining, thrilling movie. I became a big fan after the Sixth Sense but should have been a bit leary after Unbreakable....The movie started out with some promise and left me flat. It was a basic movie about a man losing his faith when personal tragedy struck and then gaining it back. How he got from point A to point B was dull and uneventful. I didn't care about what happened to any of the characters, earthly or alien. The only emotion I felt was sadness and regret...first, for the dog who was left out alone when the aliens came and secondly, for me paying to go see this movie. When we were leaving, a young woman was waiting outside of the theater as her mother exited. Her mother said "Where did you go? Were you that scared?". Her daughter said, "No mom, I was that bored".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film in two parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film started very promisingly with some clear nods to some of the masters of suspense (very Hitchcockian opening). It develops some interesting tension and gets pretty creepy - but then it seems to lose its way. It goes from a chilling thriller to little more than a vehicle to get Mel to come around. (I also thought M Night Shyamalan's cameo was a bit too substantial to really be a directorial cameo but that's neither here nor there.) Still, in all not a bad movie - it just took the route too easy rather than the one less travelled. That's Hollywood I guess. My vote 7/10 (and a bit surprised to see this film currently in the top 250 of all time!).</fullReview>

Joaquin Phoenix was excellent as Gibson's little brother, Merrill, who was once a minor-league baseball player. Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin are both equally impressive as Gibson's children. Culkin as his asthmatic son, who believes that the crop circles are real from the very beginning. Breslin is as adorable as she is talented and always seems to stick by her brother. An all-around thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat and wondering "hey hey are they going to get out of this alive?!" It scared the sh*t out of me and, even though I scare surprisingly easily, I heard the screams from the rest of the audience in the theater. It is a movie that I would go see again...and again...and again...</fullReview>

The movie was not so much about a mans search to find his lost faith, but rather the opposite--his faith searching for him. The only real mistake that M. Night made was making this film after he made "The Sixth Sense" and for that reason I feel this film will never be accepted by the fans as it should be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, let me tell you that spoilers are ahead. Now, bout the movie. The aliens are stupid. Any creature that has the ability to travel to our planet and invade must be much more advanced. Yet they choose to attack using hand to hand combat. They don't even have knifes and seem to not be able to kick in doors. Also, for some reason, water readily dissolves their skin, and they do not even have suits. So of course they attack a planet whose surface is nearly 70% water. In terms of acting the cast does well, except that M. Night had to put himself in the movie again. From very limited amount of data his character comes to the conclusion that the aliens dislike water. I do not know, this movie is just too stupid to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcockian elements done well, but poor sci-fi ruins movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some say that "Signs" is a movie that must be appreciated for its human elements, a salute to Hitchcock, where the plot is not so important as the experiences lived on the screen. To director/writer Shyamalan's credit, the first 30 minutes is a fun ride, displaying lovable quirks in the characters and several "boo!" moments that are uncommonly innocent in their setup and resolution. But the lame sci-fi elements and the religious grandstanding at the end simply ruin the movie.SPOILER ALERT: If you don't want to know who is making the crop circles, don't read further.The trouble with "Signs" is that it builds up to something that requires a solid plot in order to carry the movie's end. This movie is built around the experiences of the Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) family as a result of the aliens who created the crop circles. In the beginning of the movie, Mel and his little brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix, whose distinctly un-muscular build makes him poorly cast as a former minor league hitting champ) try to corner the crop circle artist, but seem to be dealing with a foe who can jump from ground to roof and scamper off into the corn fields like a superhuman. Throughout the movie the aliens are scaring the living daylights out of everyone, what with crop circles on a massive scale, animals sensing something really spooky, and space ships that are hovering over big cities but somehow cloaked to invisibility during the day.We see through a series of flashbacks why it is that the Hess family is in a constantly on the edge of complete emotional breakdown, and Graham explains to his brother that he has completely lost his faith in God and concludes every person is on his own. "There are two kinds of people in this world," he says, people who believe God is guiding our lives, and people who believe that life is a series of coincidences/random occurrences. The plot that Shyamalan is interested in developing is how Hess shall regain his faith and the love of his shell-shocked family.Where the movie starts to feel cheap is where the aliens begin to show themselves but they have absolutely none of the superhuman strength displayed at the beginning of the movie, nor any degree of intelligence that must be expected of a race traveling through space and carefully plotting to pillage the earth.The aliens are simply pathetic and the ending feels like a sham in order to wrap it up in under 2 hours and deliver the dramatic payoff. And the payoff may work for some people: the people who believe that God is guiding our lives in intricate detail. For the rest of us, this movie concludes with a heavy-handed theology statement by Shyamalan that, together with the ridiculous resolution of the alien problem, simply ruins the good feeling the first half of the movie gave us.I rate this movie a 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-made and interesting movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of the more original movies of 2002. If you like this movie you'll probably like it a lot and if you want a standard horror/blood/slasher movie you'll probably dislike it since it isn't a standard hollywood no-brainer.I'm not going to bother summarizing since there are plenty of summaries elsewhere.GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS MOVIE:Joaquin Pheonix as the brother, Cherry Jones as Officer Caroline Paski, the child actors, Mel Gibson in one of his better roles, Less-is-more approach, good script that rewards paying attention to details, lots of funny moments, lots of suspenseful moments, lots of subtle nuances, letting your imagination fill in the scary parts, well thought-out script and interconnectedness, the baby monitor, scary noises &amp; good soundtrack, not overwhelmed by special effects.BAD THINGS ABOUT THIS MOVIERory Culkin had a few bad moments, not everything is explained and you have to figure some things out for yourself (this is good or bad depending on how you look at it), the director making an appearance as Ray Reddy (not too bad, but his acting was not quite as good as some of the other people), a long build-up of suspense that some people may be bored with (I loved it though).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I live in Bucks County and saw some of the shots ofNewtown being filmed. This movie was a real disappointment. Ithought it had an implausible script, a director who studied AlfredHitchcock (and used several of his signature techniques) and wasvery insulting to the residents of its location. It portrayed Bucks County as a one horse (or was that one policeofficer) town with the majority of its citizens as bozos. It looked likeMel and his family lived some hundred miles from any civilization.The plot also made no sense. If there were reports of alienssighted in an area not only would there be a ton of police, the newsmedia (from Philadelphia) crawling all over his farm and maybeeven the military. The majority of the acting was weak and evenJoaquin Phoenix who is a superb actor just walked thru the part. I could take the film apart but reserved that right for the critics.</fullReview>

And no, I'm not necessarily afraid oflittle green men and UFO's, but this movie played so well on thefear of the unknown. I was psychologically terrified. When the alien popped out from behind the tree at the MexicanBirthday Party, my heart dropped to the pit of my stomach. WhenMel Gibson was hearing sounds all around him in the field, Ilooked all around to make sure nothing was behind me. I was literally afraid throughout this movie. And a lot of "horror"movies are just gore fests with bizarre looking puppets and knivesand chainsaws. But, not this. Watch it... I was even more scaredduring this than I was "The Exorcist" the so-called "scariest movieof all time." Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>~*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*~ I recently saw this movie and it was excellent. I was blown away by the performances of all of the cast, especially Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix. What most people want to know is....Was it scary? Yes. It was. The scariness didn't exactly come from the look of the creatures, but how they appear out of nowhere.For days after seeing this movie I thought that there was somebody in my house. The vibe that the movie gives off is undescribable. What most people don't realize when they go to see the movie is that it isn't all about Aliens or Extra-Terrestrials taking over the world. The movie is mostly based on one man's faith. It is wonderful how M. Night. Shayamalan ties everything together and makes everything work. If you are religious this movie somehow gets you thinking about you own faith. Besides being scary and making you question your existence this movie also has a lot of comic relief. Just simple little things will make you laugh histerically. I definitely recommend this to everybody. It was a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too easy and formulaic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Warning Spoiler*I can only assume that the real point of the story is Mel Gibson's character regaining his faith in God, as the rest of the plot is so thin that it can only be considered a convenient prop for the main story line. Unfortunately this piece of the movie doesn't work either. If his change of heart were to have any real meaning it should have been based on something of more substance than a string of coincidences such as his son's asthma protecting him from the poison gas or the baseball bat on the wall coinciding with his wife's dying words. Why not just have his Alpha-bits spell out "Hello Graham, this is God, and I do exist"? If Shyamalan had guts and was willing to forego the typical happy Hollywood ending, it would have been more effective for the family to face a much more believable sad end at the hands of the aliens, but for Graham to find his faith through the examples of his children and brother, the memory of how his wife faced death, and his own internal resources. On the plus side, Abigail Breslin was charming as Bo and I enjoyed the cinematography by Tak Fujimoto with the crop circles being frequently echoed by such things as the Hess' driveway, the baseball field in town and the throw rug in the living room. Overall 2 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a beautifully made movie, Shyamalan is clearly a good director as he brings out solid work from his actors, and creates a suspenseful and even somewhat insightful film from a B-movie plot. The cinematography is beautiful as well. However, the plot is weak, no matter the angle one sees it from. Is it a film about a person's quest for spirituality and meaning in life's twists and turns? Is it a film about aliens? Whichever one of the two somewhat ill-fitting plot lines is so superficially developed as to be laughable. The alien plot line is so full of holes that I found myself laughing out loud.Pity, as the director clearly has a lot of talent at creating a consistent atmosphere of tension through clever management of subtlety (which is refreshing). I see Shyamalan also wrote this film. He should stick to directing only. Not a film I would recommend to anyone. Maybe on video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard bad things about this movie. The first "sign" in front of the theater for this movie should be DO NOT ENTER. M. Night Shamalayn, who I will refer to in the future as Sham a Lam a ding dong, is losing his touch. His first movie was great, "The Sixth Sense". His next movie went down from there, but was no slouch "Unbreakable". However, this movie was, in a word "disappointing". Sham a Lam also makes the mistake of starring in his own movie. His acting is very "wooden". He should not do this again. Looking for some originality from Sham a Lam was something I looked forward to. He had done so well with "The Sixth Sense". The only thing I noticed was that he used a lot of shadow in his lighting. Many scenes just showed half a face. His flashlight tricks in the movie were a rip off from "Blair Witch". Mel Gibson plays a minister who has left his church for the past 6 months. He has given up on God, because his wife died in a car accident. He has two kids, about ages 8 and 4. His oldest child is a son, played by Rory Caulkin. That's right, another Caulkin - like we needed that. He looks and sounds just like McCauley (his brother, think "Home Alone"), at his age. Mel's brother is played by an actor that I loathe, Joaquin Phoenix. Although, he wasn't that bad in this movie. Crop circles are popping up all over the world, in a manner that is too fast to be a hoax. Then alien spaceships show up, sort of like in "Independence Day". No one is sure if they are here to take over, or just to observe. The aliens are only able to be detected by dogs. They are also very fast, and can jump at least 10 feet in the air. Scientists seem to believe that the crop circles are like points on a map to tell future aliens where to land. Mel and his family make a last stand at their house. They board up all their windows and try to hold out against the aliens. The main thing that I found wrong with this movie is that the pace in many parts is excruciatingly SLOW. Mel and his brother have a confrontation at the end of the movie with one of the aliens. Again, I question Sham a Lam here. The look of the alien was not original at all. For those of you that remember "Marshall, Will, and Holly - on a routine expedition" from the 70's Saturday morning television show "Land of the Lost", it is basically a Sleestak. I give this movie a 5/10.</fullReview>

This is an average work because it is only about alien invasions and also there are a few 'illogical' holes in the plot. Those that thinks this film is great is probably because they see it more of an exercise to the meaning of faith and humanity. The reasons why I think this movie is excellent. Yes, if this movie is only about an alien invasion, this movie would be below average, but I do not think M. Night is trying to do only that.It is not by chance that the movie is named 'Signs'. It is not by chance that there are certain 'strange' signs incorporated in the movie. It is not by chance that there are inept dialogs and humour in the film. It is not by chance that Bo mentioned so specifically about 'dreams' three times (out of context in a normal conversation). It is not by chance that this movie has crop circles in it. YOu see, M. Night is playing with the viewers. Not only giving the characters in the movie 'signs' to play with their faith, he also did the same to us viewers. However, not everyone will see these signs and hence, miss out on a big portion of what the movie is about.  </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good execution of a very weak plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a beautifully made movie, Shyamalan is clearly a good director as he brings out solid work from his actors, and creates a suspenseful and even somewhat insightful film from a B-movie plot. The cinematography is beautiful as well. However, the plot is weak, no matter the angle one sees it from. Is it a film about a person's quest for spirituality and meaning in life's twists and turns? Is it a film about aliens? Whichever one of the two somewhat ill-fitting plot lines is so superficially developed as to be laughable. The alien plot line is so full of holes that I found myself laughing out loud.Pity, as the director clearly has a lot of talent at creating a consistent atmosphere of tension through clever management of subtlety (which is refreshing). I see Shyamalan also wrote this film. He should stick to directing only. Not a film I would recommend to anyone. Maybe on video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film starts out quite well, the build quite a bit of tension and there are some nice characterizations, but as soon as Alien life makes its way into the plot - any sort of grip on reality goes out the window. News for the people that have voted this horrible, horrible movie up to an 8.0 - 'Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind' did a better take on this 20 years ago! The Alien scenes are tacky, an unrealistic, unbelievable and completely contrived ending, and some thoroughly awful, wooden acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILER Signs is a much deeper movie than most people seem to expect - and to read a lot of the negative reviews here, too deep for most IMDb users to even understand. Sure, the aliens are a bit weak and predictable, sure the plot has a lot of holes in it, but anyone who focuses on either of those issues has completely missed the point. Signs is not a movie about aliens - it's a movie about faith that happens to have aliens in it. It's a movie about how normal people react to abnormal situations - and the way that the actors showed that to us was far better than almost anything else around.Yes, Mel Gibson's character behaved irrationally - even incredibly stupidly - at times, but in the context of the character it was completely believable. We all do stupid things - and in the face of such stress we do them more often than not.The acting was superb throughout - the children were brilliant, and it says a lot about Shyamalan's abilities as a director that he can bring such performances out of them. This and Sixth Sense have the best performances from children I have ever seen. The atmosphere was superb - as long as you weren't a nerd looking for plot-slips and error, but a movie-lover looking for an experience.If you have any sort of a spiritual life, you'll enjoy this movie immensely. For me it was something very special.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a Mel Gibson fan, I have seen most of his movies, but I cannot understand why on earth Mel chose this role. I don't like to know too much about a movie before I see it, therefore I won't spoil it for anyone, but if I can be honest, I would like to say it doesn't come up to par with the movie "The Sixth Sense." I found it very slow moving, and just not believable.I would say the two children in this movie may well be the best thing about it. I thought they were very good little actors, but oh how I was disappointed with Mel Gibson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What signs?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER!! They may as well call this movie "Father Graham Hess' discovery of inner self". Shyamalan must have missed the point of the script. The story about alien invasion was almost like a side plot.It didn't fit in with the "main" idea of the priest losing his wife and his faith in God along the way. Subtract the "signs" and the aliens from the plot and you almost get a good drama.Mel's and Joaquin's acting was superb though. The film had its moments and some potential but Shyamalan lost it 30 minutes into the movie. All the negatives aside I did enjoy the last scene where Merrill gets to kill the alien by spraying it water.Ah, on the point... Why would creatures from other planet with super technologies to travel great distances and make themselves invisible, run around "naked" when their skin is sensitive to the most abundant material on the planet they came to invade?? And what's the deal with them unable to break through pantry doors? Doesn't sound like super race to me.Aliens were certainly underdeveloped by the script writers. Discounting the phone ringing and the door banging, the sound effects were absent from the movie full stop.Very disappointing film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan has often been compared to a young Steven Spielberg. He has the same ability to craft and build up a story that Spielberg has always had. Where the comparison ends is that Shyamalan has not proven that he can finish the job. All three of his films, this one, The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, are superbly crafted. He's good at writing suspense, buildup, and quiet horror. Not many can argue that the payoff of the Sixth Sense was about as good as it gets. Unbreakable played along the same lines, but the payoff, while ingenious, practically ruined the film, in my opinion. The payoff in Signs also ruins the film, and even lacks the ingenuity of Unbreakable. It is dull, unimaginative and disappointing. Shyamalan's angle in Signs is not to show the invasion of the aliens (Independence Day), but to show one family's reaction to that invasion, Kind of like Night of the Living Dead. The difference is, the people in NOTLD are acting and reacting to what's happening around them. In Signs, the focus is more on a dead wife/mother, faith, and the eccentric behavior of two children. And it's not very interesting and makes for a lousy payoff. So where did Signs go wrong? I don't know, or I'd be getting paid 12 million per movie like Shyamalan did for this. I don't have the imagination to devise a film/script like this, and Shyamalan doesn't either. This film didn't make me think. It didn't scare me. It wasn't profound in any way. And I think it was trying to be/do all those things. I can't say how this film should have ended. But the way it did end was the wrong way. After an enormous success right out of the gate, Shyamalan has failed twice in a row. And all of his films have been "pass or fail", in my opinion. Films that build up this much throughout have to deliver a knockout punch.On the plus side, Signs was very well acted. Mel Gibson was solid, albeit unbelievable as a farming reverend. Joaquin Phoenix, normally an enormous ham, gave a solid and quiet performance as Gibson's younger brother. However, the real acting chops in this film go to the two kids. Rory Culkin, in my opinion, has confirmed himself as the best child actor currently working in Hollywood. I thought he was outstanding in You Can Count On Me, and his mature performance here shows that wasn't a fluke. Abigail Breslin plays Bess, the young daughter. Despite the fact that Shyamalan was trying to do something spooky with her character and failed, she still gives an outstanding mature performace. It's a shame she couldn't have done more. The nice eye that Shyamalan has demonstrated in his previous films is not lost here, either. His Hitchcockian knack of filming creatively and not relying on static shots and angles plays well here as it did in Sense and Unbreakable. But Shyamalan needs to spend as much time, if not more, concocting dazzling endings to these films as he does building them up. Again, while I didn't care for the ending of Unbreakable, I at least give him credit for creativity. The ending of Signs is lame and unimaginative. Spielberg would have blown us away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Minor Mel Gibson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The whole crop-circle phenomenon, likely a nice tourist gimmick thought up in rural England, is a pretty thin handle on which to hang a major movie. But, then, since this movie has almost nothing to do with crop circles except - surprise! - as a marketing gimmick of its own, the powers that be behind this minor Mel Gibson outing must have something else in mind. What is it? Well, a mildly interesting tale of a preacher's recovery from tragedy that robbed him of his faith. That wouldn't sell nearly as well as "spooky stuff," though.This film follows the formula Stephen King worked out so well in his classic "The Stand." That is, dream up some cataclysmic event that puts the entire human race in peril but - and here's the hook - make that not the focus of the movie, but instead simply a fairly thin background against which the actors get a chance to seem heroic while not actually doing much. It is a way of elevating the prosaic to sublime by association.The difference here is that the background "event" is neither original nor particularly well handled. We learn about the possible destruction of humanity by watching reaction shots of characters watching tv shows. Not too exciting. Otherwise, it is just a case of things that go bump in the night and the characters' reactions to same until the climax.Speaking of the climax, there is no real "twist" in this movie. It all plays out exactly as you would expect, given a predisposition to believe in these sorts of modern myths. Occasionally we see glimpse of the tv programs are watching and they have all the drama of out-takes from some "Wildest and Wackiest home videos" show or something. Sometimes the thing behind the curtain should just be left there, as a fertile imagination will conjure up a far more believable demon than Hollywood can assemble.The acting standout is Joaquin Phoenix, who injects some needed comedy into his scenes. His use of a baseball bat is amusing and he works well with Gibson. Why, though, do alien attackers always come in essentially unclothed and unarmed? They flew here in spaceships, then rely solely on their bad breath or something to defend themselves. Seems a bit silly even for those who believe in crop circles. They turn out to be no more deadly than some bear that walks in off the local National Forest. Perhaps if the film had avoided cliches like that, this might have been better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT If you haven't seen the movie, don't read my review SPOILER ALERT First of all, i think cameos are cool, but why did the director feel the need to have such a big part? For those of you who don't know he was the guy that hit Mel Gisbon's wife. And the scene where they were all eating pizza and going "is that him?" made it too obvious.Overall the movie was good. It was supsenseful and fun, UNTIL the family went into basement to hide from the aliens. The first time a flashlight got dropped and everyone screamed was scary, then it got really annoying. Especially when it took forever for the director to show that everyone was still in one piece. Yeah, he was leaving it up to the imagination, but it got old quickly!For me the movie pretty much went downhill from there. When everything wrapped up at the end it was just too calculated. The asthma, the water, the bat, "swing away" it was all too much. I went to see a movie about aliens, not get lectured about having faith and reading the "Signs" in the world around us. I don't mind happy endings, but like I said this was way too calculated for my taste and ultimately ruined a movie that i thought had lots of potential.</fullReview>

The only thing good that can be said about it is that at least the majority of crop glyphs appearing are attributed to extraterrestrials and not human hoaxers.

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking forward to "Signs" but, unfortunately was let down big time. Stylish and atmospheric, yes, and marginally suspenseful -- but for what? An incredibly silly plot that somehow meshes ex-minister Mel Gibson's loss of faith with a full-scale earth invasion by some pretty dense aliens. Here we have extraterrestrials who are apparently advanced enough to travel umpteem light years to our planet, carve elaborate crop circles all over the globe, yet can't seem to figure out how to enter a boarded-up farmhouse. And what is their goal? It seems to be to abduct earth kids and squirt them with poison gas from an extendable nozzle in their forearms. I mean, this plot would have been laughed off the screen in the 1950s. And what is the aliens' Achilles heel? Water! Who'd have thought? Certainly not these brilliant green E.T.'s who travel to a planet that is 75% water! The ridiculous plot machinations seem all the more insulting because Shyamalan is a very talented director -- but please, PLEASE don't let him direct his own scripts anymore!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>these 'Signs' go the wrong way...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We've seen it a million times. A trailer that doesn't live up to the actual film. All the laughs are revealed, all the scares are revealed, all the whatever is revealed. But never has a trailer so unfairly disguised a movie as what it's not. An earlier poster brought up the old sales terms "bait and switch", which is exactly how you'd describe this. Here, let's show crop circles, and spooky figures lurking, and a creepy little girl who has a funny line. But once they're in the theater we'll make the movie about something else. Something totally monotonous. I was all keyed up that 20 years after "Poltergeist" we were finally going to get a genuinely scary haunted house (or at least near the house) flick. Even the opening music sounded Jerry Goldsmith-ish like in "Poltergeist". Instead it turns into an affirmation tale where a bunch of references earlier in the movie weave themselves into important moments near the end. Too easy. And talk about your false build-ups with ZERO payoff! Oh, boy, finally the big showdown with an alien and...a three-minute flashback by Gibson. Momentum buster!! I mean, I actually enjoyed the opening twenty minutes of COMEDY more than anything else! Although I will say that Shyamalan is masterful at getting the most out of his kid actors. We all know Osment and "I see dead people". Well, here he introduces us to Breslin, a terrific little actress who provides most of the film's good moments. And Culkin, though a much more impressive actor than his infamous brother, is hugely unbelievable as the equivalent of an Einstein in a ten-year-old's body. But, of course, good kid actors are never enough to propel an uninteresting drama to a recommendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Misunderstood Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert!! People who didn't like it are definitely not getting it. But that is totally understandable. Signs is a highly symbolic movie.People don't "get it" because North Americans are not used to heavy symbolism in film. The symbolism gives it a "dream-like" quality that is confusing to some. Symbolism is also "alien" to the genre of science fiction.From "The World Treasury of Science Fiction" "So much science fiction was... unreal on one hand, and so concerned with the gritty realities of science and technology on the other, that a majority of educated readers had no interest in learning how to read the genre, a practice easily picked up by children and teenagers - by taking every detail literally at first, until given other direction by the text. This is just the reverse of the way we approach the prose literature..."Science fiction is a product of the post-modern materialist world. A world in which there is no God, and only technology can save us from the random dangers of the Universe. This is precisely the ideology that the filmmaker is against! He even pokes fun at the sci-fi fans with "Dr Biimbo" and the brother's theory on "the nerds".Far from being a science fiction film that needs to conform to the expectations of the genre, Signs is actually out right "anti-science fiction". It doesn't make scientific sense on purpose (how could aliens that melt in water walk around in earths atmosphere, which contains high quantities of water, without environmental suits?), because it's not about science. It's about faith. It's about symbolism.... signs...Most science fiction is written as "what would aliens really be like?" "What is the most realistic alien invasion scenario I can come up with?" Signs isn't like that. In Signs, the aliens are just symbols. The invasion is a symbol. The house is a symbol. The signs are a symbol.So for all the atheist sci-fi fans who didn't "get" the symbolism, here it is put very simply:"when you don't have faith, you are alone in the world. Isolated and vulnerable to the soulless whims of nature. You are like a boy with asthma trapped in the basement of a boarded up house in the middle of nowhere surrounded by invading aliens."That's it. Get it now?This is one of the best films I have seen... until the last five minutes. It has some flaws, but what great work of art doesn't have a few flaws somewhere?And BTW, the most unrealistic aspect of the film is not the aliens, it's portraying a rural American farmer who doesn't own a shotgun. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Signs tonight and it was far from what I expected. I expected a movie w/lots of suspense and action, something scary, but what it ended up being a movie which, to me, gave a great spiritual lesson. The movie did have aliens and its scary parts, but the whole message throughout was the awesome part in my opinion. It taught about faith in God and believing. It details a mans spiritual journey from being a priest to a man who didn't want to believe and then.... well, you have to see the movie. There were a few times I was scared out of my wits, but all in all, it's a good movie... Had it's comedic parts also... I highly recommend this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was fun in the theaters, it had some good scares. But whereas the Sixth Sense (and to some extent, Unbreakable) made me want to see them again immediately, this movie could not stand up to a second viewing. In the 6th Sense, the twin stories of the supernatural and human drama were closely intertwined, making a tight story. Here, Shyamalan cannot make the separate plots work together. They become two completely different stories that end up dragging each other down.Aliens are coming... what will happen? Suspense.They will knock around the house for a few hours and then run away. Stupidity.The more I think back to the movie, the more problems I find. Too, too many problems to even begin listing them. Problems that render both stories ineffective. The director feels he has to keep making the same type of movie every time. Even the formula itself is getting old.</fullReview>

The best parts of the film are the ones were we see the human characters interacting, and the ending could have been contrived just as successfully in a more earthy scenario.I rate it 6.5 out of 10 (anything over a 5 is worth seeing).

It's also a shameful waste of Mel Gibson's talents -- unless you find pleasure in viewing Mel's face constantly filling the screen, wearing a constipated expression that's presumably intended to convey extreme concern. Weak plot, negligible character development, oh-hum action shots, and senseless inconsistencies add up to a major disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointment (this review contains a spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually stay to see the credits at the end of the movie; I didn't bother this time. The premise was great, but the delivery was poor. The family's farm is located outside Philadelphia - not in the middle of nowhere. But their crop circles don't get the same media attention as all the other circles throughout the world. No planes go over that part of Pennsylvania?? When it is learned that the aliens use the circles for navigation (what a clever idea, haven't heard that one before), the family stays there and it not encouraged or forced by anyone to leave (like the police or the national guard). And then one of the main "emotional" scenes in the basement when an alien tries to attack the little boy, the aliens conveniently decide to leave. I guess they knew the movie was nearing 2 hours. Aliens are so thoughtful. There is no real explanation of why the aliens are there, why they leave, etc. Background on that is given by the boy reading from a book about aliens. I expected more than cliches from Shymalan. Why didn't he make the aliens malevolent? In general, the acting was good. However, Mel Gibson was not well cast in this. His "emotional" scenes were forced and overdone. But then, the script was pretty weak, so it is hard to say if anyone could have really done any better. Wait for it to come out on video - and it really doesn't matter if you're alone or not. It is not scary at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made, but was it satisfying?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's now a couple of days since I watched Signs, and I still can't make up my mind about it. It is an extremely well made film with excellent cinematography and sound. The suspense is maintained throughout the whole film, but the outcome is disappointing. About two thirds of the way through, I found myself no longer expecting to jump out of my seat at the climax of any specific scene because most did not have a climax. Any tension that was built, just dissipated and fizzled out. With the exception of Mel Gibson's character, the acting was very good and believable. Mel's character, "Father", didn't seem real. At the very start he seemed overly suspicious, but totally unemotional, about the crop circle, but then didn't seem to react "normally" to the unexpected demise of a family pet. Most people would freak out whereas he took it all in his stride, with little or no emotion. This film was played using an old 50's method, where all the horror happens off camera, leaving you to your own imagination. If it wasn't for the inclusion of the relatively recent phenomenon of crop-circles, the film might actually have benefited from being shot in black and white. I'll be pondering this one for a while, or may have to go see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slow pace eventually going ... nowhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many similarities between Shyamalan's movies - slow pace, building tension gradually and a climactic ending. It worked in 'The Sixth Sense' and to a lesser degree in 'Unbreakable.' Unfortunately in 'Signs' we're only left with the slow pace.Without giving much away (there isn't much to give), most of the movie deals with the issue of unknown aliens. We aren't given many details, but this is used effectively to build suspense for the first half of the movie. Then we're give a few more details that are so absurd as to cause you to suspend belief. Once that happens, the suspense dissipates and all you're left with is a feeling of how much longer you'll have to endure to get to the inevitable twist. When you do get to the end you'll wonder why you waited at all.If you liked 'The Sixth Sense' and were hoping for something similar, check out 'The Others.'</fullReview>

At least I prefer those people who hated the movie because me too after the first viewing hated the movie. but I was unsatisfied and would not believe that the man who made Sixth Sense would make such a movie with so many obvious plot holes. I am glad there is more to this movie than you think. I think the whole alien story is Bo's dream. Key to that is the book which Morgan referes to. If you see the thought process in the Alien story it is really as if a child would think. The use of baby monitor, water, baseball bat all indicates that she is behind that thinking. I think she was reading that book and fell asleep, now she is imagining the things from the book (Farm House, Crop circles, Aliens) and people she knows. I am pretty sure about this part. The part where I get confused is how Father Hess' personal story(losing and gaining faith) connects to Bo's Dream. Comeon friends stop dreaming and start thinking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could be much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course after watching the first two masterpieces by M Night Shyamalan, I went to the theatres to watch "signs" with very high expectations, and I am really sad to say that my level of disappointment increases as the movie went on.No doubt that the acting was superb, all the actors did a great job and I was even surprised to see Mr. Shyamalan himself playing a role in the movie.Yes, now to the disappointing part, that is the plot of this movie. It is true you might say that this movie is not so much about aliens, its about a man who loses faith and finds it again, there are so many plots that could be used to tell a story about how a man would lose his faith and finds his faith again. However, since Mr.Shyamalan had chosen to use the invasion of aliens on to earth as his plot, I think he should develop the plot well enough. I think that he should explain more about the "Signs" and how are they related.**Spoilers** Subsequently, while watching the movie, I was giving hopes on how Mr.Shyamalan would end this movie as many people think that the invasion of the aliens would bring this world to the end. Sadly, I almost burst out laughing at the part when they just said that the aliens have left our word as we humans have found a way to defeat them and they are afraid of water. This concludes that the aliens were not as smart as we human beings, which is redundant to what the story told us earlier that the aliens were smart as they anticipated humans would use nuclear weapons to defeat them and the world would be no use to them after that. Adding to it, while the aliens were searching for the Hess family in the basement, it also told us that they were smart and they were able to solve any difficulties that they confront. At that point I thought the story was getting interesting as the pace of the movie was picking up while suddenly it ended up that the aliens just "left" the planet! Do enlighten us something more about the signs, the aliens.. some new ideas that we don't know!!However, I think the acting alone made this movie worth watching, Mel Gibson along with Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin did play their character very well. The managed to capture the emotions of the audience and it was well done! On top of that, I did enjoyed the part about the reason Mel Gibson quit being a priest and the idea that does coincidence really exist.In summary, the movie was okay .. the movie actually does have a bit of scary and frightening moments, it's just that the plot about the invasion of aliens should be improved further!

		<shortDescription>Well done movie, BUT...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The inspired directing, underplayed acting, atmospheric cinematography, and just about everything are well above typical Hollywood fare for Signs. So many things are good about Signs that it is difficult to bring myself to write this commentary, but I feel I must.The director keeps the 'monsters' off-screen, as many sensible directors do, until the very end. It is unfortunate that, in the last few minutes we discover the aliens are the stupidest extraterrestrials villains since "Morons from Outer Space".One might account for some behavior being part of their alien nature. They sneak around, yet leave huge markings as evidence of their presence. They have 'invisibility screens' yet hover directly over cities (where birds hit them) and they are sometimes seen. They are from an advanced race yet can't figure out doorknobs, carry no defenses or weaponry. They are close enough that the poison their 'stingers' give off is toxic to us, yet they are burned by water.That's right, they came down, weaponless, naked, to a planet covered 75% by water, and started kidnapping people (for unknown reasons) and are surprised that they are beaten back by kids with super-soakers. It's lucky the aliens didn't get caught by the sprinklers while making crop circles. And the first place they notice the aliens can be burned by water is in the Middle East, the farthest place from natural water sources in the world. Ironic, huh?An even worse 'blind spot' in their natural evolutionary defenses is that they are also hypnotized by the swinging of lumber. The one alien we see clearly stands still to be pummelled unmercifully by a baseball bat.After all the fine work that went into making the atmosphere, acting, and other aspects of the film so excellent, couldn't they have spared 2 I.Q. points for the aliens? It ended like the worst Super-Friends episode ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Signs was dreary, dark and dull and with few surprises. Clues were so broadly drawn and overdone that the viewer couldn't help but know what was going to happen. And,when it did happen, they knew what was going to be done about it. And, what is this 2002 movie cliche about someone forgetting to have their life-saving medication in their possession before they lock themselves in a small, dark room to avoid attackers?If you had found an alien invader locked and defenseless in someone's pantry, wouldn't you alert the local law enforcement agency? Or, tell someone? Mel Gibson didn't. And, as far as Mel Gibson goes, when I told my husband we were going to see Signs, starring Mel Gibson. His comment was, "I hope he doesn't cry". Well, he cried. And I cried too, at how bad this movie was after I had "heard" others say how good it was.Signs was good for a laugh or two. How about when they nailed a few thin boards from the inside of a room across a doorway whose door opens out from the room? So, the invaders can open the door toward themselves and crawl through the 2 foot gaps? Who let that gaff go undetected? And, how and why did the invaders carve out elaborate moon, star, and sun cut-outs on one of the boarded up windows? Just for good photographic effects? Don't bother going to this movie; wait for it to come on TV where you don't expect very good movies; you won't be disappointed. This is NOT a very good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved the Sixth Sense. I really didn't care for Unbreakable. Signs was awesome.If you think that this is just an alien movie, you will be disappointed. It is an exploration of faith, the consequences of it's loss, and what it takes to prove to one man that he never should have lost it in the first place.It is a beautiful movie about family and faith that oddly enough scares the bajeezas out of you and makes you laugh in the process.Confused yet? Well don't worry. Nothing is random. Everything happens for a reason. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signs should be renamed "sins"; sins against good film making.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs was dreary, dark and dull and with few surprises. Clues were so broadly drawn and overdone that the viewer couldn't help but know what was going to happen. And,when it did happen, they knew what was going to be done about it. And, what is this 2002 movie cliche about someone forgetting to have their life-saving medication in their possession before they lock themselves in a small, dark room to avoid attackers?If you had found an alien invader locked and defenseless in someone's pantry, wouldn't you alert the local law enforcement agency? Or, tell someone? Mel Gibson didn't. And, as far as Mel Gibson goes, when I told my husband we were going to see Signs, starring Mel Gibson. His comment was, "I hope he doesn't cry". Well, he cried. And I cried too, at how bad this movie was after I had "heard" others say how good it was.Signs was good for a laugh or two. How about when they nailed a few thin boards from the inside of a room across a doorway whose door opens out from the room? So, the invaders can open the door toward themselves and crawl through the 2 foot gaps? Who let that gaff go undetected? And, how and why did the invaders carve out elaborate moon, star, and sun cut-outs on one of the boarded up windows? Just for good photographic effects? Don't bother going to this movie; wait for it to come on TV where you don't expect very good movies; you won't be disappointed. This is NOT a very good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you hate the "old bait and switch", then do not go see Signs. The ads make it seem like a Sci-fi thiller about crop circles, but it is not. I think the opening weekend success was due to sci-fi fans looking for a movie about crop cicles... They didn't find it. M. Night Shyamalan has been hailed as a Brilliant new talent. I think his films are slow and predictable. Once the point has been made, move on. M. Night just beats the point to death. And as far as being original... I think he should send a check to "the Blair Witch people". The scene in the basement was a total ripoff. I thought Mel Gibson was going to make the kids stand in the corners and wait for "Rustin Parr". The scene in the corn field was super hokey. When Mel shines the flashlight in his own face (who does that in real life) I swear I thought he was going to apoligize to Josh' mom and Mikes mom. But if you like slow, predictable, repetitive movies that have a little "bait and switch" promotion to them ... then this is a Fairly good effort.</fullReview>

And, oh yeah, the planet is 70% water, so be careful around all the lakes and rivers and oceans and water sources inside the homes." Please!!!!!!!!The director is a one-hit wonder -- he had a cool premise for Sixth Sense and is trying way too hard to be cool again. Skip this movie, save you money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad movie, I'll take a shot at explaining the aliens.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS!!!There are really two stories going on here that kind of merge in the middle they are:1. A man piecing his life together after a horrendous tragedy.2. An alien invasion.Weird, I know.Story one is by far the more superior of the two. It really gets into the minutia of the emotional devastation wrought over the family. It really is along the lines of "In the Bedroom" as far as character development goes.Story two is kind of thrown in there for a kick. The aliens could have simply been rabid racoons terrorizing the family and nothing else. It's that irrelevent to the movie. Story two just kinds of drops off and wraps up at the end. I gotta few netpicks of some user comments about story two however...1.) Complaints about aliens not wearing clothes.Maybe they where, or maybe they don't need them. Who knows, they're aliens. Different biology, culture, technology etc... I wouldn't stretch too much to look for similarites between them and humanity. It's like getting mad at them for not following the US Constitution.2.) Complaints about aliens not using weapons.Again, they're aliens, it could very well be that they prefer hand to hand combat for cultural reasons. Obviously, they can travel through space, they do have the technical prowess to create weapons.Hell, some Native American tribes used to consider simply getting close to an enemy to touch them as an act of bravery. This doesn't mean they couldn't create an ax.Also, maybe it wasn't a full blown invasion, just a recon mission of some sort. No point in bringing out the "big guns" when you simply want to scout out the environment and get some "local" samples. It'd also tip the natives as to what weapons you have and give them a chance to develop counter measures when the "big invasion" starts.3.) Aliens being "human-like".Why not? Makes for some intersting plot twists (ie. Man like figure gibson sees on the roof) and spookier video footage.4.) Aliens being "water phobic"I agree this is simply non-sensical at first though. It's the logical equivalent of humanity invading a planet that has a methan atmosphere. However, everyone is missing the obvious.THEY NEED WATER BADLY.Why else would they invade a planet that has a substance, that's deadly and toxic to them, UNLESS THEY DESPRATELY NEED THAT SUBSTANCE.5.) Alien invasion simply ending.I don't think it was a full blown invasion. The crop circles, probing attacks, etc... are really no different than simply marking out a territory before an invasion. That invasion could be months/years/centuries away, but it's not stupid to simply have the invasion end, its genius. The aliens get to learn from the experience and retool for round two (which may be "the big 'un"). It's actually more realistic than the "Independce Day" scenarios.</fullReview>

But then, when you are expecting something really cool to happen, the movie kind of dies out and the credits roll. The movie is kinda twisted around this weird plot of Gibson being a former Reverend and his loss of faith. How strange is that for a "scary/thrilling" movie? Also, you would expect some really cool effects; but aside from crop circles that a 5 year old could make on a computer and an alien that looks like a human in a colored jumpsuit that clicks to make its "sounds", there is no special effects.</fullReview>

The director and writer of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable has created a suspenseful movie that will surprise, thrill, excite, humor, and scare you. Mel Gibson plays a priest who questions his faith after sighting crop circles in his corn fields. You can't help but feel curious along with him, wondering what is going on. The supporting cast is also strong with Rory Culkin, younger brother of Macaulay Culkin, as Mel's son and don't forget especially Joaquin Phoenix as Mel's brother.

		<shortDescription>Overhyped, ridiculous b-movie that doesn't try to be one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-- Spoilers, because you shouldn't waste money on the movie anyway --Signs is not horrible. Let's get that out of the way at first. But it is a very mediocre movie, especially considering the rating it has on this ridiculous website. Much like The Others, which was another supposedly creepy movie, there's really nothing scary in this movie. You don't get to see what's scaring you -- some people have pointed this out -- and yet, well, yes, you do. The movie's "faith" question that everyone seems concerned about is essentially trivial -- some people believe that weird things happen because of coincidences, others think that weird things are signs, and when Mel Gibson breaks down, crying out, "his lungs were closed!" you see Shyamalan's take on the question. But it never really mattered whether Mel lost his faith in the first place, because Shyamalan is far from a gifted writer and Mel's character development was poor. I cared more about why the little girl wouldn't drink her water (which we never found out) than why Mel's faith even mattered. At no point in the movie did he really seem to have lost it, or did it matter whether he did or not. (And speaking of the water, thanks, M. Night, for the ridiculous aping of Gremlins.)The problem is that Signs is a B-movie trying to masquerade as something deeper than that. The plot is silly, but I found no evidence that Shyamalan was trying to pull a big joke. I wondered out loud during the movie whether this was supposed to be a farce (having looted ideas from Gremlins, Close Encounters, Aliens, Evil Dead, even Blair Witch!) on the order of a Scary Movie, but it ended up taking itself too seriously. The joke's on Shyamalan, and, I suppose, anyone who's actually scared by little green men, especially when the plot is so obvious from the get-go.Shyamalan's movies keep getting worse. Sixth Sense was pretty good. Unbreakable was intense and powerful, but ended up cluttered and confused. Signs is a sloppy mess. Let's pray the "next Spielberg" figures out what the ____ he's doing before he makes another complete dud and pulls the wool over the eyes of another massive audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good popcorn, but hold the "pop" ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan likes to take a pop culture genre gimmick formula seriously. There is a lot of sincerity in this film and I teared up a bit, but some people do have a problem with one central issue. The theme of those who believe and those who don't plays like acknowledgment from the writer-director-supporting actor that if you don't believe in the first place this movie won't convince you. It passes off screenplay structure mechanations as proof that God exists. Perhaps God on this case is the sure-footed writer-director. As in The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, the movie ends up being about reflection and re-interpretation of past events, and that seems to be the the brand name stamp. It also tries to advance on the searching for God theme which caused his first feature Wide Awake to tank. As in Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, such a search is a doomed set-up - either you find God and ta-DA! or you don't and you continue waiting for Godot. Here, very genre specific pay-offs in the script - which work on their own - would have played better for most of the audience (and not so corny) if they had appeared in a Will Smith film. In fact, there is a bit of an early John Carpenter low-budget fun aspect with Shyamalan using the limitations of space to avoid being distracted by Independance Day-style FX. The heart of the film is in a dinner table scene and the way it portrays human beings confronting the prospect of losing each other and life itself. If you have no rooting interest in seeing a faith character arc play out, don't see the movie. But it worked for me. I have to give Gibson and Shaymalan credit for daring to go for their ending shot in such a cynical time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well..I'll have to say I liked this better then Unbreakable. I thought Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix did an excellent job acting in this movie. I do believe the movie was a little misleading, as most people thought this movie would be about crop signs, but instead it was more about a family becoming stronger and a man believing in fate and his faith. The humor and suspense pretty much carried this movie through. They worked hand and hand, and kept you wondering what would happen next. (*Spoilers*) Once the alien was shown though, the suspense wasn't as high and I think the audience really wanted to see what was happening outside and around the town. The ending left a lot of things unexplained. Why did the aliens come and what had happen around the world. We only know that water hurt them and the military drove them away. The movie was still entertaining. I don't think it was boring (see The Time Machine..now that's boring). Thought there could have been more to the story then what was provided. Definitely worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, there will be SPOILERS in this.I'm going to use a sort of rating system that I haven't quite seen yet. 1-10, though.PLOT: (3) Aliens. Oh no! Wait a minute, that really has nothing to do with the story. This story is about Gibson's character finding God... again. When I saw the previews to this, and even in the first half hour of this movie, that isn't what I was expecting to see. MUSIC: (2) The theme song, which was pretty much all the music, sets the mood with scary string music, but then goes into some upbeat garbage that really upset me the 5th time they used it.CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: (0) Where I have the most quarrels. The ONLY character development was on the part of Gibson's character. All other characters could have been replaced by almost completely different people. The brother could have been a boxer, a lumberjack, a gymnast, most anything. See the axe on the wall, swing. See the picture of you as a boxer on the wall, swing. See the pipe on the ceiling, swing. The son could have been much older, a female, a friend, as long as he had asthma. And, as an asthma sufferer myself, I find it sad that a father would force his seemingly bad asthmatic child to live on a farm. The daughter could have been anyone who didn't like the taste of country tapwater. Who does, anyway? I don't even want to know why Shyamalan decided to appear as a bad actor.CONCLUSION: (0) Wow. Pretty much what Shyamalan did was give himself a memo that said "Write a movie with a lot of build up, anticlimax, lots of stars, where there's a sick boy, a washed up athlete and a disbelieving priest," and then he saw an episode (bad episode) of the X-Files. What he did in the 6th sense was great. He started with a theme and built FROM it. In this case, he built AROUND it. FOR it. It was really sad to watch. The aliens (which I've barely mentioned) were explained in less than 2 minutes of dialogue, and that goes for the appearance and disappearance of them. To think that aliens allergic to water would come to EARTH, a planet that would probably in reality have enough water vapor in the air to harm the aliens, to harvest people made mostly of WATER, only to run away because they'd been attacked with (what we assume the rest were attacked with at least)..... water. The idea that we can fend off aliens with waterguns just made me want to cry.Terrible movie. I'm beginning to think Unbreakable was better than this...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Picture it - you're driving along at a pretty nice clip. It's a route you've traveled before and it won't be long before you get to where you're going. Suddenly, you round a bend and you have to hit the brakes because of a sudden traffic jam. You then inch along; it takes you 20 minutes to drive one mile. Frustrated, you exclaim to yourself, "There better be a dead body at the end of all of this to explain this mess!"After more tedious moments, you pull forward and the few cars in front of you then drive on at their former brisk pace. You finally see that the only thing that held you up for so long was someone getting a traffic ticket. BIG FREAKIN' DEAL!To all who would like to see SIGNS, apply this scenario to watching the movie. For the first hour, the film glides along at a pretty nice clip. The suspense turned up a few degrees by M. Night Shyamalan, there is a sufficient number of heart-in-your-throat moments that ALMOST put THE SIXTH SENSE to shame. Wow, M. Night really outdid himself with this one.Then, it all stops. The suspense peters out and the film begins to drag. What gives?Before you know it, the film is over, its ending reminiscent of other films where the writer (in this case, M. Night Shyamalan) wrote himself into a corner and couldn't find a satisfactory way out. It seemed as if his only option was to wrap the story up as quickly as possible with unexplained (or under explained) developments (the aliens' sudden departure) and tidy resolutions to profound storylines (questions of faith and religion by Graham Hess - the protagonist played by Mel Gibson).The payoff we waited an hour and a half for doesn't come. Out of courtesy to those who haven't seen the film, I won't describe the final big scene. Suffice it to say that what should have been quite effective ends being quite anti-climactic. Once it's over, you end up shrugging your shoulders and saying, "Now what?" (Even the way the final big scene is played out comes across as formulaic and hackneyed.)All that suspense, all that great storytelling laid to waste by a lazy, cop-out ending. I'd like to give M. Night the benefit of the doubt and think that maybe I missed something. I doubt it, though.This film ranks alongside UNBREAKABLE as another disappointing creation from M. Night. With two disappointments like these two under his belt, it's beginning to look as if THE SIXTH SENSE and its superb quality were just flukes. Let's hope his follow-up film lives up to the standards he set for himself with THE SIXTH SENSE.On a scale of 1 to 10, give this one a 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How can you like this (well acted, ok) load of manure?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is well acted. Mel is good, the brother is ok, the kids are great. PERIOD. The story does not make any sense whatsoever. It seems like they ripped some pages at random from random numbers of "National Enquirer". Aliens crop family grief crooks faith god. No punctuation, and i MEANT it. This film is no SF, no family, no faith, no sitcom. This film is STUPID. Zero out of ten if it wasn't for acting, so 4/10. Oh, and - special effects mention for the green sell-o-taped aliens.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie began and grasped my curiosity right off the mark, but unfortunately ground itself into a slow, boring, and non-engaging sci-fi thriller dud. Many things in this movie are done the same way as in the Sixth Sense, but it doesn't work - the plot developments are foreseeable, and waiting for them to occur is like waiting for water to boil.I give this movie a Thumbs Down. Save your money or see something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan has done it again! The director and writer of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable has created a suspenseful movie that will surprise, thrill, excite, humor, and scare you. Mel Gibson plays a priest who questions his faith after sighting crop circles in his corn fields. You can't help but feel curious along with him, wondering what is going on. The supporting cast is also strong with Rory Culkin, younger brother of Macaulay Culkin, as Mel's son and don't forget especially Joaquin Phoenix as Mel's brother. Newcomer Abigail Breslin is also wonderful as Mel's son. You will not regret seeing this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More aliens please!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that this was a pretty good movie, and I thought that they did a good job of adding some funny scenes in with the seriousness of the movie. I have to say that at many horror flicks I have walked away without even one jump! Well let me tell you, Signs made me jump more than once! I wanted to see more aliens, because I love aliens, but more aliens might have made it seem cheesy and too hard to believe, but I'm sure the director and writer could have had more aliens in a tasteful manner. I also thought it was weird to have the camera shoot the dropped flashlight so that you only hear what is going on with Mel and his kids, it made me want to scream at the movie, saying, "Hey I want to see whats going on with Mel and not the floor!" But overall I thought this was a good movie, and I loved it because it was different.Rating: 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful except for the microphones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERSI liked signs. It was creepy, suspenseful and expertly crafted. My only problem is that at least 4 times in the film you could see the microphone bobbing up and down above the actors. Shyamalan must of been in a rush or something not to notice this. Hopefully they will fix it for the DVD.I've been reading some of the comments here and I'm surprised so many people are complaining about the film. Some have said that they didnt show enough of the aliens. I think they did show just enough because when you start seeing armies of obvious CGI it makes the film less believable. If you were expecting some epic alien vs earth battle then of course you would be disappointed with the film. The film isnt even about aliens. The title Signs is not even a reference to the crop circles it goes along with the theme of the movie that everything happens for a reason and there are no coincidences. Someone also mentioned the children weren't realistic. I thought the kids were excellent. When the son kills the dog he isn't sobbing because he is in a state of shock. And for all the people complaining about the plot holes with the aliens you can't really call them plot holes because you don't know everything about this alien race so just let it go. It's called willing suspension of disbelief. You can't enjoy a movie without it. I also liked the little funny moments during the movie. It kept the movie from becoming unbearably intense.Overall Signs is worth your time.</fullReview>

All the characters have their own dilemmas, and like a painting we all take something different away from it.Signs is entertaining, it has a Hitchcock flair to it. You don't get the easy "give-away" shots that you expect. Mostly though, you will be provoked to think about your own perception on life, and your choices. I came away asking which type of person am I?This movie isn't an "Independence Day", it is a 1 hour and 45 minute long question about your self image and self-awareness. Do things just happen randomly, or is there a higher reason? If they do happen randomly - we should be very afraid. But then there are those that have more Faith than that, they have a quiet confidence, and a hope that carries them through the struggles of life. Be it a fire, disease, lost child, or even aliens - it's about Faith in God.This is an excellent movie, it asks a question that some don't like to think about, and leaves no place for an answer.

		<shortDescription>**SPOILERS** This is Good Garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two issues with this film. One, is a thriller, in the same dark eerie mode of Unbreakable and Sixth Sense. There is wonderful tension, wonderful cinematography, fascinating camera shots and decent performances.Then, there's the story. It's crap. Very disappointing, over-sentimental and maudlin to the max, the plot (?) is fraught with improbable, silly notions of prophecy, predation and predestination. Aliens are coming to earth to "harvest" us humans. They're running around naked, they've the technology to come through the galaxy but are unable to get out of a locked closet (forgive me, pantry), they squirt poison gas and leave crop circles as landing sites.This is the same Mel Gibson who gave us Braveheart, Mad Max and Gallipoli. This is the same Joaquin Phoenix who was the slime in Gladiator.A very disappointing and unbelievable film. Unless you are in need of a strong emetic, stay home. It won't even be worth renting on DVD or video.</fullReview>

Do things just happen randomly, or is there a higher reason? If they do happen randomly - we should be very afraid. But then there are those that have more Faith than that, they have a quiet confidence, and a hope that carries them through the struggles of life. Be it a fire, disease, lost child, or even aliens - it's about Faith in God.This is an excellent movie, it asks a question that some don't like to think about, and leaves no place for an answer. But it's not about crop circles...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signs=Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs is an interesting picture with not so interesting dialogue and character development. Shyamalan didn't think this one all the way through. I think it is very over rated. It was too slow and nothing really happens, the twists at the end are predictable and uninventive. Signs is a average film at best. Shyamalan is extremely talented no question, but I think he's worn this genre out. Maybe he should try a new angle on his next picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much potential...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SMALL SPOILERS CONTAINED WITHIN.Unfortunately, no matter how rosey your glasses are, Signs is your basic "rediscover your faith" movie that has been done to death over the years, this time thinly veiled as a sci-fi thriller. Even worse, it was obvious this was going to be the case right from the "there are two kinds of people" monologue about 30 minutes into the movie.Don't get me wrong, at the end of the day I did enjoy this movie - it had some nice humour, good suspense and (if you ignore the spiritual stuff) a reasonably good plot. I particularly liked the way you (the viewer) knows no more about what's going on than the rest of the characters - the deliberate lack of the usual "eye-of-god" viewpoint was refreshing.The sad thing is that at the end of the day this was a very shallow and predictable movie from quite early in the piece (although that being said, the marketing revealed very little of what the movie was really about - reminds me a bit of "Dangerous Minds" in that regard ;) ). A typical "along for the ride" type fiasco where you don't actually have to any thinking for yourself - unfortunately all too prominent in Hollywood. I personally don't like having all the details laid out for me, but it appears that I'm in the minority. Interestingly, this reason was exactly why I liked The Sixth Sense so much, but it was obviously wrong of me to expect more of the same.I said above that the suspense was good, but I did feel it was overdone - A bit of a one trick pony really - the only really effective and (vaguely) original use was the scene near the end where the (presumably two) aliens were stomping around outside - *very* good use of the surround sound too! I agree with a lot of the previous posts that the "amature video" scene, while being 'scary', actually took a lot away from the intensity of the film - fear is largely based on the unknown, yada yada.One interesting point, on a personal note, is that this movie did make me feel a bit uncomfortable. I was thinking about this, and came up with the following conclusion: because I believe that it would be very arrogant of us to think that we are alone in the universe, this scenario, while not probable, is (IMHO) quite possible. The basic level of fear was quite effectively communicated in several scenes (ah, so much potential, Mr. Shyamalan!) and this in turn translated into quite a primal feeling within myself. So much so that I found myself checking nervously over my shoulder while sitting reading these posts at about midnight after seeing the movie. AH! you say - that was the point of the movie... unfortunately, not so - please refer to first paragraph. However, it does hint at the talent of this particular director, not seen since The Sixth Sense.There was so much promise in the opening minutes of this film, including good development and some excellent screenplaying, all ultimately betrayed by the "human" element. A solid 6 out of 10.Aidan</fullReview>

It offers nothing new, insightful, or surprising.Given that it's a huge budget movie with a big name cast, you would think that if might offer something special in the way of visual or sound FX or the music. Nothing but clich here either. Blair Witch camera work borrowed for suspenseful scenes and typical alien sound FX. Even the music is essentially a copy of the X-Files theme.I'm not giving it the lowest rating possible simply because all the technical aspects of a film are taken care of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm beginning to think that Shyamalan had one great movie in him (Sixth Sense) &amp; that's it The set up on Signs is long &amp; boring w/enough unnecessary padding to make another short film or a lot of guitar picks. No question the acting is excellent but the conclusion made me angry that I had wasted 2 hrs of my time on this dreck. I realize that the weapon used to end the nightmare was necessary because of words spoken earlier in the film. BUT---have these people NOT heard of automatic weapons to protect themselves from danger? Shyamalan the new Hitchcock or Spielberg? I think not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Religious vehicle and full of plot holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**** Spoilers *********Very disappointing (2/10).This movie is a religious vehicle in a very heavy handed way. At the beginning of the movie, the lead character is a reverend that loses his faith because of his wife's accidental death. At the end, due to a ridiculous set of coincidences (i.e. a "miracle") he regains his faith. The whole alien/sci-fi thing is completely incidental - it could have been a non-sci-fi movie and it would have achieved the same goal. It would have been nice to know it's a religiously inspired movie ahead of time - I would not have watched it.And let's talk for a second about the plot holes. The aliens have to fight without technology because "we would nuke them and make the planet uninhabitable". They use poison to kill their victims. Why in the hell can't they have at least light weapons? And if they are spread across the planet, why would we nuke them and kill ourselves in the process?At some point, the aliens carve large star and moon shaped holes in a door. But before that instance, they couldn't go through any of the barred doors in their way. The protagonists fend them off nothing more than planks of wood and some nails. If they can carve those shapes out, they can surely break down a door. Give me a break.The kid forgets his asthma inhaler before going into the cellar. You'd think he'd have it on his person.They keep dropping their flashlights for no reason.They walk around with aliens about but they take no weapons (such as an axe they previously used to bar a door with).And the list goes on...Oh, and there's a slow three minute flashback interrupting a 20 second action sequence near the end. You'd think a professional director wouldn't make such an amateurish mistake in dramatic pacing.In all, it's the worst movie I've seen in years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You want cheap horror? You want gore? You want mindless moronic terror? Go elsewhere. This is a thinking person's horror movie. And in the end, its not a horror movie - it is a movie about something deeper. It is a movie with a message. It is a movie about faith in something bigger than one's self.Society has a tendency to avoid this topic, taking a more relativistic and materialistic view of life. But what if there is more to it? What if keeping-up-with-the-Joneses is not what its all about? What if there is a larger purpose?Those of you in "group 1" know what I'm talking about. We know this to be true. Those of you in group 2, seeking a 2 hour thrill ride with no message, will likely say this movie sucks. You better be sure your world view is correct as the consequences may be large. And THAT is what this movie is about.A thinking man's thriller. Along the same lines as Green Mile. Thanks Mel for having the courage to bring something like Signs to the big screen.

		<fullReview>*********SPOLIERS AHEAD***************It seems I had been watching trailers for "Signs" for months in the pre-feature darkness. I was led to believe this movie would scare the CROP out of me. Unfortunately, that is precisely where I feel this movie fails.Sure, there are a couple of pop-you-out-of-your-seat moments, but there was no sensation of impending doom, despite the best efforts of Gibson, Phoenix, and the two talented tykes to convince me the end of the world was nigh.I now believe much of my disappointment is rooted in the now-thoroughly debunked phenomenon known as crop circles. Anyone who still feels aliens are hard at work making geometry out of greenery probably sleeps with a wreath of garlic to ward off werewolves. When Spielberg brought us the return of Flight 19, mysterious radar echoes on the air traffic control screen, and toys that spontaneously came to life, he established the plausibiliy of alien visitation before we ever saw a spaceship or creature. Crop circles fail to tee up the terror,I don't mind that the director goes cheap and only tells us about the destruction going on outside Mel's private little world, but perhaps a few frames depicting awesome alien power might have heightened the tension. There were only vague reports of armageddon on the radio and tv. While I'm on the subject of those TV reports, I thought after spotting the home video of the "scary" alien, that when it re-appeared in person, it might look more, oh, I don't know, realistic??? Come on, ILM, this baby had a 62-large budget, and you give us a dude in a space suit with pointy teeth and a wrist-deployed vaporizer? Yeah, I know this isn't a movie about aliens, but did the ONE we do see have to look like fodder from Mystery Science Theater 3K?"Signs" does elicit some hearty laughter. Sprinkled in among the faux fear and trumped-up terror are several genuinely funny lines and set pieces. I'm sure they were intended to break the gripping horror, but for me, they only punctuated the mediocrity.</fullReview>

I was going to say boring, but I won't go that far. Contrary to some long-winded reviewers opinions' this is not an exceptional film and is by far the least accomplished of M.'s three.The clues (which I won't reveal) scattered throughout the film are far from subtle and less than intriguing. The tension that M. attempts to build through "everyday sounds", dogs barking, wind chimes, etc. are atmospheric, but never scary.Like the somg says, 2 out of 3 ain't bad.</fullReview>

When Spielberg brought us the return of Flight 19, mysterious radar echoes on the air traffic control screen, and toys that spontaneously came to life, he established the plausibiliy of alien visitation before we ever saw a spaceship or creature. Crop circles fail to tee up the terror,I don't mind that the director goes cheap and only tells us about the destruction going on outside Mel's private little world, but perhaps a few frames depicting awesome alien power might have heightened the tension. There were only vague reports of armageddon on the radio and tv. While I'm on the subject of those TV reports, I thought after spotting the home video of the "scary" alien, that when it re-appeared in person, it might look more, oh, I don't know, realistic??? Come on, ILM, this baby had a 62-large budget, and you give us a dude in a space suit with pointy teeth and a wrist-deployed vaporizer? Yeah, I know this isn't a movie about aliens, but did the ONE we do see have to look like fodder from Mystery Science Theater 3K?"Signs" does elicit some hearty laughter. Sprinkled in among the faux fear and trumped-up terror are several genuinely funny lines and set pieces. I'm sure they were intended to break the gripping horror, but for me, they only punctuated the mediocrity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dissapointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been looking forward to this film for well over six months, and the first (and most accurate) word that comes to mind is dissapointing. I was going to say boring, but I won't go that far. Contrary to some long-winded reviewers opinions' this is not an exceptional film and is by far the least accomplished of M.'s three.The clues (which I won't reveal) scattered throughout the film are far from subtle and less than intriguing. The tension that M. attempts to build through "everyday sounds", dogs barking, wind chimes, etc. are atmospheric, but never scary.Like the somg says, 2 out of 3 ain't bad.</fullReview>

The kid had his inhaler the whole darn time, but now leaves it behind? With all our great special effects, we couldn't have a decent alien? Are we supposed to believe the wife is severed so she can save her son? The kid buys one book on aliens which happens to have their house in it?

		<fullReview>SMALL SPOILERS CONTAINED WITHIN.Unfortunately, no matter how rosey your glasses are, Signs is your basic "rediscover your faith" movie that has been done to death over the years, this time thinly veiled as a sci-fi thriller. Even worse, it was obvious this was going to be the case right from the "there are two kinds of people" monologue about 30 minutes into the movie.Don't get me wrong, at the end of the day I did enjoy this movie - it had some nice humour, good suspense and (if you ignore the spiritual stuff) a reasonably good plot. I particularly liked the way you (the viewer) knows no more about what's going on than the rest of the characters - the deliberate lack of the usual "eye-of-god" viewpoint was refreshing.The sad thing is that at the end of the day this was a very shallow and predictable movie from quite early in the piece (although that being said, the marketing revealed very little of what the movie was really about - reminds me a bit of "Dangerous Minds" in that regard ;) ). A typical "along for the ride" type fiasco where you don't actually have to any thinking for yourself - unfortunately all too prominent in Hollywood. I personally don't like having all the details laid out for me, but it appears that I'm in the minority. Interestingly, this reason was exactly why I liked The Sixth Sense so much, but it was obviously wrong of me to expect more of the same.I said above that the suspense was good, but I did feel it was overdone - A bit of a one trick pony really - the only really effective and (vaguely) original use was the scene near the end where the (presumably two) aliens were stomping around outside - *very* good use of the surround sound too! I agree with a lot of the previous posts that the "amature video" scene, while being 'scary', actually took a lot away from the intensity of the film - fear is largely based on the unknown, yada yada.One interesting point, on a personal note, is that this movie did make me feel a bit uncomfortable. I was thinking about this, and came up with the following conclusion: because I believe that it would be very arrogant of us to think that we are alone in the universe, this scenario, while not probable, is (IMHO) quite possible. The basic level of fear was quite effectively communicated in several scenes (ah, so much potential, Mr. Shyamalan!) and this in turn translated into quite a primal feeling within myself. So much so that I found myself checking nervously over my shoulder while sitting reading these posts at about midnight after seeing the movie. AH! you say - that was the point of the movie... unfortunately, not so - please refer to first paragraph. However, it does hint at the talent of this particular director, not seen since The Sixth Sense.There was so much promise in the opening minutes of this film, including good development and some excellent screenplaying, all ultimately betrayed by the "human" element. A solid 6 out of 10.Aidan</fullReview>

It's not a bad movie, don't get me wrong, but I haven't decided whether it's a great movie. It certainly doesn't deserve to be ranked #176 of 250, as it currently is.Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, and Rory Culkin are all incredible in the film. The young Abigail Breslin is fine but a little too quiet for the movie.As has come to be public knowledge of M. Night Shyamalan, sound plays an extraordinary role in this film. The sound from the baby monitor, the haunting hiss/click noises from the supernatural beings, and the whirring wind and shaking corn husks that make you feel a cool breeze as Gibson rushes through a corn field. Even silence is a major character in the movie.The only reservation that I have for Signs is the ill-timed, often inappropriate humor that Shyamalan feels the need to inject just as the tension is building to a break. The "quirky" if not sometimes "stupid" humor that is sandwiched in with the startle scares often times takes away from the thriller genre this movie should be trying harder to achieve.I could not give a decisive thumbs up or thumbs down to this movie.

Many others have offered their opinions of the plot, the characterizations, and the director's point of view. I simply wanted to add that the movie's theme--an exploration, if you will, of man's faith--has already been produced into a cinematic masterpiece, namely, "The Seventh Seal." Instead of Death playing chess, however, we now have aliens as the driver of the plot. I'm afraid that Mr. Shyamalan, with his most recent movie, does not even come close to the mark set by Mr. Bergman, in a movie directed more than four decades ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Some spoilers) Signs is one of the first movies in a long time where I glanced at my watch not to calculate when the mess might end; instead it was to rue my fascination's end approaching all too quickly. I was listening like the husband nudged by groggy wife with "did you hear that noise"-- the entire movie. I felt Shyamalan's grip as an artist- not deigning-down to me with the avant-garde but using commonplace sensations like fleeting visions and noises half-heard. I'm sure this engrosses an audience of sentients more than explosions and special-effects. All that and surprisingly generous dollops of laugh out loud funny dialogue make this a must-see event. Topped off by an audience-rousing splat of slugging brother's bat to alien's head, I wouldn't have changed one thing. Those who complain about the pacing can re-watch Fast and Furious for the 37th time but for me this was edge of my seat thrilling entertainment. It delivered that ephemeral magic most movies can't muster. Don't ever stop making movies M Night.</fullReview>

(Yeah, I know, Mystery Science Theater 3000 is not on the air anymore, but you get my point.) On Signs premiere night I went to the movie theater without any knowledge of what this movie was about except I knew that it was about crop circles and Mel Gibson was the star; I didn't even know Joaquin Phoenix was in it. I became amazed at how little this movie had to do with SciFi and much to do with faith and family, yet the SciFi aspect is spectacular. If you love Hitchcock, you will love this movie. Signs follows the Hitchcock suspense formula wonderfully where scares are more important than gory scenes and where we can see the difference between suspense and surprises. If you need a little help with the definition, Friday the 13th and its brethren (Halloween is the exception) is about surprises. Watch this movie. You'll love it!</fullReview>

You have a very weak ending to a cliche plot that is marred with the usual (let me stand in the living room and let the aliens break-in mentality) Gibson fans will also be let down by what I feel is his worse acting job of his career. Gibson once again plays the guardian of a household (yes another Braveheart, The Patriot, role) in which his strong ideals and moral glue hold the family together through "tough times" Without giving much away, don't expect any wonderful visual effects, or any deep thinking characters in this stroy.. There are many similarities to Independence Day and Children of the Corn, I counted at least 3 from ID and 2 from COC. The reason I give this movie a 6 is the way the suspense flows well without having to constantly see an alien.. But the ending is a letdown and there are some flaws.. ** minor spoiler** - The Aliens can read minds ( the end of the movie does not reflect this, ex- swing away.. - No one in their right mind isnt going to get some kind of weapon to fight the aliens off.. Instead you have both adults standing there waiting for the aliens to enter the house.. gimme a break! - Asthma inhaler.. Ok if your kid has asthma, isnt this a top priority item?/ Instead lets just leave it upstairs so he can have an asthma attack. Ok there are more, but I dont want to talk myself into giving this a 5. You might as well watch it and see for yourself.. Girls that like to be a little scared but not have nightmares will like this movie more than guys in my opinion. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signs of Spielberg - Is Your Sixth Sense Unbreakable ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a moment of joy for me. For an indian like me to witness a loud applause from the audience for a hollywood movie in an american theatre directed by an indian. And it was truly breathtaking. Yes, Manoj Night Shyamalan does it again. First by sixth sense he swept us near the oscars then he dusted the childhood heroes inside us through his unbreakable . Now he comes back to touch the spiritual and human side of us with a backdrop of UFOs in his signs.Signs is a movie to relish quietly in a corner of the theatre without catcalls and whispers. It really impacts you with a melodramatic and an eerie mood. Make you rethink your beliefs. Only condition - Listen to the dialogues carefully, else you might be lost in this complex screenplay.Shyamalan love for philadelphia, where he was brought up is evident and this one is set there too. The greenish farm which is the heart of the movie increases the suspense. Amazing location.This movie is ceratinly Mel gibson's career high. Shyamalan's builds Mel Gibson's character slowly yet strongly. He is such a cool actor that his character builds up in you. Thats what he did to me in ' What Women Want' . You become him after some point of time in signs and you get involved in the during the course of the movie and try to save you and your children from the UFOs and aliens.The twist which you would expect in shyamalan's movie is certainly missing but that is the wish of a creative writer which cannot be questioned. To the given story and characters, shyamalan gives rationale and ends it great. Some might think that it was an abrupt ending but that again depends on your taste of movies. Night doesn't spoon feed you. Just makes you realize the need of using your brain and co-relate events. Thats why you so feel special while you see such movies. You feel elevated to the heights of thinking and you certainly do. Your sixth sense would not be unbreakable and you suddenly rise up from your seats in fear. Especially in a scene while the dog which is silently eating and suddenly barks the nerve out of you.A Spielberg is on the making and we are witnessing one of the to-be-legends of all time. Is that so? Your catch on this is welcome.</fullReview>

But why do things always level out on the side of the first group, those who believe in a higher being dictating events/lack of coincidence, just to appease a God-fearing society and probably the film's backers? What about a voice for us lot in the second "sh*t happens" group for once?And why did M. Night Shyamalan feel the need to show us that rubbery 'alien' wobbling about at the end? After all that had gone before it, did it scare ANYONE? Really, much scarier to have left it remain unseen....come back Blair Witch Project, all is forgiven!But a nice cast, even in tin foil hats.

		<fullReview>About halfway through M. Night Shyamalan's 'Signs,' Mel Gibson's character tries to console his younger brother (Joaquin Phoenix) by posing this question: Is he the type of person who sees the signs and believes them to be divine, or is he the type who simply writes them off as coincidence? Mel then raises the stakes a bit by qualifying that the former type will be comforted in knowing that they are not alone, that God is with them regardless of how things turn out. The latter, however, do not have that comfort, and will live their lives knowing that they are alone. While Mel's farmer-under-attack probably won't be getting any job offers from Hallmark any time soon, his statements form the core of the film, and ultimately will determine how you the viewer feel when the credits roll.If you are the type of person who plans on going into 'Signs' waiting for this year's greatest suprise ending, then you'll definately get it. Suprise! There's not one. What Shyamalan has created is a superb rural science-fiction picture that works terrifically as a summer popcorn thriller, and as arthouse-type discussion fodder. He gives you a lot of thrills for your buck, and the atmosphere is genuinely creepy throughout. The camera direction is extremely tight, hiding the evils that may (or may not) be lurking just beyond the visibility of the actors and the audience. It's almost as if the viewers are wearing blinders, forcing them to look only where the director wants them to. Much like and escalating roller-coaster, we know we're about to take a huge plunge but we still can't see anything but the top of the hill.Interestingly, Shyamalan turns the "big question" on his own audience. It is either truly brilliant or totally egotistical (probably both) to actually guilt-trip your audience into liking your film. If you are the type of person who believes what you are shown as intentional displays of the higher power (the film director as God), then you will be rewarded with an enjoyable film experience. If you choose to disregard the director's intent, and pass pieces of the film off as coincidence or, more "blasphemously," as poor sci-fi filmmaking, then you are like the film's hopeless characters, lost and alone. Most importantly, as you walk away from 'Signs,'ask yourself how many times in the last hour-and-a-half you had to squeeze your date's arm just a little harder for comfort. This should be the true sign that you have been in a master's hands.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BIG disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creatures allergic to water but who make signs in cornfields consisting largely of water; creatures walking in water saturated air; creatures who can travel interstellar space but can't break down a boarded up house (even BIRDS could do that); creatures who burn strange shaped holes in wood doors but cannot burn a hole in a similar door being held shut by an axe; creatures who look strangely human like but who are intolerant of water; if you believe all this, you MIGHT enjoy signs. But even accepting the idiotic premise that crop circles are navigational aides (in the age of GPS!) the science of this film is SO BAD and inconsistent that I found the film utterly lacking in appeal. Sixth sense ten times as good; Unbreakable at least 10 times as good. To me, this film was a waste of time, effort and money. If it is about choice and coincidence, make another film, guys! If it's about signs, the film missed its mark. If it is about science, this is the worst SF film made in a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'SIGNS' of a weak script.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a fan of "The Sixth Sense" and "Unbreakable", I was largely disappointed with this latest effort from M. Night Shyamalan. I felt the script was weak on several levels. First is the whole 'former priest who has lost his faith' cliche. We've seen this premise done much better in numerous other films. Second is the crop circles as 'signs' of the impending invasion. I hardly think that a highly intelligent race of aliens, already able to navigate their way here from some distant planet would need to map out navigational landmarks with the use of crop circles. Third, and perhaps the most absurd, is the ability to destroy the hostile aliens with mere water. This premise works for wicked witches, but doesn't fly here. The hostile and highly intelligent aliens would hardly mount an invasion without first investigating all the possible dangers that a new world might hold. Water being one of the fundamental ingredients for life throughout the cosmos, the aliens surely would have encountered it before, and, being as susceptible to it as they are, would not the act of breathing our air, given them problems as well? It would seem that M. Night opted for a quick, and I might add, cheap method for defeating the aliens. I realize that M. Night didn't want to redo War of the Worlds, but he could have given us more in the way of the invasion and the battle to defeat them, with a more plausible outcome. Fourth, this movie was neither scary nor suspenseful. It actually works better as a comedy, as there were several comical moments. And there were other implausible events as well. Aliens that produce poisonous gases, and yet able to be easily defeated with a baseball bat. Why did the alien not use that defense against his attacker(s). An alien seemingly unable to escape a locked pantry, or break through old rotten boards over the windows. Aliens bent on destruction, would surely not let a few boards or a locked door stop them. Again, not plausible, and really, when you think about it, this movie was nothing more than a modernized version of "The Patriot", and not nearly as good. You've got the alien invaders (redcoats), the widower (struggling not with his faith in religion, but with his countrymen), and his attempts to save his children. All in all, a very weak effort from a director and screenwriter who showed such promise in his previous efforts. Sorry all you M. Night fans, I have to give this one a D-.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely a case of the hype exceeding the reality.Decent acting spoiled by a weak storyline and 50's B-Movie style view of aliens.Surely, if alines had the technology to get here they would be a bit more intelligent than to be wiped out by baseball bats and glasses of water.The tv news sequences were really weak, unlike recent movies like Deep Impact that used tv news to add realism.The director should have decided at the outset whether he wanted the audience to be afraid orlaughinh hysterically. He tried to accomplisg both and ended up creating not too much of either.Oh well...

		<fullReview>After reading all the positive reviews on this movie i figured I would give it a chance. After being hit and miss for past month I was looking for a good movie to watch that would be actually scary? When was the last scary movie? If you think Signs is THAT MOVIE. You are wrong. It started off good but after the first half hour is slowed right now, which seems to be the directors trademark his past 2 films. 6th sense was awesome, Unbreakable was decent and I felt this movie was poor. I truly felt it was money wasted on this film. The story is original however, and the concept was decent. But the surprise ending wasn't really a surprise because Shayalam has overplayed the "surprise ending". So folks do your self a favor and go see something else because this was what i would consider an ABC Special.</fullReview>

Shyamalan has become a master of tension. He creates great characters, blends mystery, with horror, warm and humor like he has been make movies all his life (he has by the way).If you like Hitchcock, if you like the X-files, or if you just like agood scare, you will love this movie.**see the movie then come back and read this last part...What I love about Shyamalan's films is that all three major releases, Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs, are total fiction; a ghost story, a comic book and alien sci-fi. But he handles them with such plausibility that they we connect effortlessly to them and are touched by them. Whether the emotion be fear or sympathy we feel for these sci-fi characters, because they act like real people. We let them get to us faster. After you get past the shock of the twisted endings, the films take on a new feel. Signs is what would ACTUALLY happen if alien landed in your backyard. No laser blasters, no fast acting military, no scientist or flashing ships. A family barricaded in their house watching the news. Someone I saw this film with complained that all they did was watch tv in the movie. Well I think we all remember sept 11th, what happened... we all planted ourselves down and watching thinks unfold on a small screen. Shyamalan's three films are fantastical, but grounded in reality. Because of this, things like swings, end tables, dogs barking and train stations, things familiar to our everyday, have the power to thrill or terrify us. I hope M. Night is around for a very long time.Go see Sign.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The director tries to make a name for himself with a deep message about lack of faith and fancy visual images, but he leaves out major plot elements that make ZERO sense once you think about it. For one, the aliens had been in/around Mel's home for a few days. they bother his dogs and bend over his crops and jump on his roof, but for the most part (at first) they are not deadly. Then all of a sudden, out of the blue, Mel realizes that one night the aliens will come to kill him. He is right to barricade his family in his house, but how did he know an alien attack was coming THAT particualr night, when the aliens previously had been there for several peaceful nights? Joaquin lives in the guest house behind the main house. Why would his prized baseball bat and trophies be in his brother's house and not his own? When they notice the alien is hurt by water, why don't they all just take the 50 million glasses of water laying around and douse him? Junk junk junk.</fullReview>

What a GREAT WAY to manipulate an audience.I could understand HALF of what Bo, the little girl, had to say. She mumbles too much. When it was revealed that Merrill set the home run distance record in the minor leagues and "still has the bat at home", it was OBVIOUS that this bat would be used as a weapon later on in the film.The dialogue wasn't realistic, it was contrived. The tension was contrived. Why are these aliens fighting with their bare hands? If they are so afraid of water, why don't they wear a water-proof outfit? Duh. I guess this is a film for stupid viewers.If you go to the movies to be entertained, skip this one. Don't even rent it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that's like a life-size birthday cake and you know a beautiful woman is going to pop out, but low and behold, some aged-withered, sagging breasted granny pops out instead. I saw this movie last night and I spent the majority of my time jumping out of my seat. Signs sets you up in such a way that you just know that there is going to be an awesome climax and all loose ends will be tied up.GUESS AGAIN!The ending was one of the most major disappointments of my entire movie-watching career. Even more worse than Unbreakable and you know that sucked.M. Night Shyamalan (hope I spelled his name right) took a great idea and fumbled it on the forty yard line. He took a plot and wrapped it around a totally different plot. He started out with aliens and then ended up with self-rediscovery. Two of the most unlike themes ever.The problem with Signs was that the premise is totally misleading. From aliens and crop circles to finding one's faith again? *********SPOILERS**********Too much set up and not enough clarity.How did the aliens form the crop circles? Where did they come from? What was their intent? How did the reverend's son become so insightful as to what was happening? What did the aliens do to the water? How and why was it harmful to them? Why were the spaceships only visible at night (and only as spots of light), but invisible during the day?The buildup of suspense is intense (sometimes frustratingly unnecessary) for instance, when the aliens finally show up at the house and family locks itself in the cellar. The fear and terror of the aliens is expressed through loud, thud-sounding pounds on the door. The son, who has asthma has an attack (they would leave his medicine upstairs) while they wait out the night as the aliens try to get in. And while all this is going on, you never see not one alien. What kind of $#!t is that! Obviously a plot device to move things along quickly to the disappointing climax.Finally...the so called climax!You finally see the alien (the same one who the good reverend maimed while it was trapped in the pantry in the house of the man who killed the good reverend's wife...it was an accident). A rush job at best. No tidying up of loose ends...and there are quite a few.Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, and Abigail Breslin give great performances. Too bad they weren't enough to overshadow such a dull movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Nitpicking?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERS HEREIN: I was disappointed with Signs. I don't mind slow, quiet films but this was too slow for me. I thought Mel Gibson was sort of one-dimensional and a bit rigid. The other actors were good, however, and the film did have a couple of really intense moments, without stooping to chaotic, overblown special effects.Most of all, the religious aspect of it bothered me, especially coming from the seemingly multicultural Shyamalan. I would think that actually being confronted with beings from another world would make one seriously question organized religion and the traditional creation and morality stories we've been told all our lives. I wonder....does Christianity (or any mainstream religion) mention alien life forms (and what to do about them)? It seemed to me that Mel Gibson's character retreated to religion in a knee-jerk, frightened way; it became his sanctuary away from science and reality and thought. That probably happens all the time in real life but wouldn't the film have been less prosaic with a broader view of humankind's place in the universe? Maybe not.I wanted to know more about why the creatures were there and what else was happening in the rest of the world. I wanted to know why the aliens didn't have weapons. How could they be so advanced in space travel but need mapping signs (crop circles) and not have a clue about the water situation--couldn't they have worn protective gear? I just don't buy the whole scenario and think that M. Night, while directing some really scary moments, ultimately had a weak, frustrating story. I could be wrong, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horizon points to phenomenal "Signs"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the box office smash hit of The Sixth Sense and the shaky, butstable Unbreakable, M. Night Shyamalan succeeds masterfullywith his third suspense/thriller film Signs. Once again set in PAonly this time 40 miles away from Philly, Shyamalan centers hisstory around a family living on a farm in Bucks County, PA. MelGibson playes Graham Hess, a farmer who is also a formerreverend who after a very tragic event turned his back on his faithand god. Joaquin Phoenix plays his younger brother Merill Hess.Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin (I think she may be sister toSpencer Breslin from Disney's The Kid) play Gibson's childrenMorgan and Bo.This movie was in my opinion far better then Unbreakable andreally neck n neck with The Sixth Sense. Shyamalan's knack forflashbacks at various intervals in the film shed a lot of light on the"emotional troubles" the family is experiencing lately. Shyamalanpreps the audience in the very first scene to stay in the isolatedsetting of the farm for the next two hours with the families discoveryof the sudden appearance of the crop circles in they're field. As towhat happens after they see these?........Well you'll just have to seethe film for yourself won't you?The acting in this was phenomenal especially from the smallchildren who know something is up from the very beginning evenwhile they're dad and uncle remain with they're doubts. Gibsongives an incredible emotional performance (although I still wouldhave preferred seeing Willis in Gibson's role after Willis'sperformance in The Sixth Sense) and you come to find yourselfemotionally drawn in to the families woes also.Not only was this film scary to the point of jumps and slight shrieksor screams in the theatre, but it does have it's comedic moments.Bo (Abigail Breslin) in particular is very cute and adorable with herpuzzling comments and actions (to not give too much away, anobession she has concerning drinking glasses is by far absolutelyhilarious).As much as I loved Signs though there is one thing that I foundmyself to be dissapointed with. I won't say because it has to dowith a very crucial part of the film. See it for yourself though andwhile your watching it keep in mind of something in particular fromThe Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. In the end though Signsmessage points out that whether or not you are a person whobelieves things are just coincidence or luck that if you have a littlefaith even the most horrifying experience will turn out alright in theend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still not convinced....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, I loved the Sixth Sense - I thought it was original, scary and moving. Secondly, I was disappointed by Unbreakable - good concept that didn't quite work. Again, sadly, I feel this is the case with Signs.It's a good premise with loads of potential, however to be blunt I feel M.Night is probably overestimating his own talent. He needs to work with someone else's material I believe as his own material is beginning to mystify me. I am a paranormal freak, and the promise of this movie was greatly anticipated by myself, however the story didn't seem to flow. Some of the dialogue was clunky, and Rory Culkin was gravely miscast - he is certainly no Haley Joel. The funny bits were often mistimed, and again to be blunt, I found M.Night's self-casting to be somewhat overindulgent.On the good side, the video footage of the sighting in Brazil at the birthday party was genuinely clever, and frightening. Indeed the looks "outward" from life in the house were often the best moments. The appearance of the alien at the end was also quite shocking, but again the dynamics were extremely odd. In short, I simply feel that this is a good idea that again failed to fire. Mel Gibson was good, but the script did him no favours. The ebbs and flows of the story just didn't work for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have not seen Signs yet, you have probably guessed it is about extra-terrestrial life on earth. After you have seen the movie you may or may not think differently. Signs goes into detail about the emotional well being of the main characters. I was surprised to see the movie achieved this in such a short time. Graham Hess (played by Mel Gibson) is a former reverend, and seems to be loosing faith throughout the movie. Gibson superbly acts out this emotional distress that Graham has. I can't tell you much about Grahams emotional role in the movie, seeing as it would give away too much about the film. Merrill Hess (played by Joaquin Phoenix) is Graham's younger brother. Allot of the story is shared with Merrill. Merrill also has his mental weak points. Phoenix to has an excellent performance. Morgan and Bo Hess are Graham's two children who play almost a bigger role than the adult performers. Rory Culkin delivers and makes the movie all the more entertaining as well as Abigail Breslin. Almost all of the things showed in the film build up to the ending. Though I have to say I didn't know how it was going to end. That is one of the things that make Signs and excellent movie. M. Night Shyamalan weaves a most original plot. He of course, plays a small, almost cameo role in the movie. The movie will in a way scare you so that you don't even know how deep the story line is until later. This movie is one of the most original pieces of cinema I have ever seen. My opinion simply stated:' See the movie".</fullReview>

We primitive humans have GPS systems. One would think the aliens would have something better. 2. They can be killed by water but come to a planet that is 70% water! Huh? They also come naked with no protective suits or weapons. Maybe they do have advanced weathermen though. Don't need to worry about rain EVER while they are making crop circles for their friends. Maybe they are related to the wicked witch... 3. Mel Gibson's wife is killed in a tragic accident stolen from a Homicide episode (which was stolen from a true incident). To set up a ridiculous finale with a baseball bat.  4. Thousands of people are killed by the aliens, but ONE kid is saved by a bunch of lame coincidences.

		<shortDescription>This movie blew me away...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Nyght has created a tale that absolutely blew me away. I tried to stay away from spoilers before going to see this movie, and I'm glad I did. All I knew was that it had to do with aliens, crop circles, and was set on a small farm. For all those that have yet to see this movie, I think you should know that this movie is not about aliens, but don't let anyone ruin it for you. There is not a twist at the end like the sixth sense or unbreakable.. the whole movie is twisted.The performances are top notch. I peg Mel Gibson to at least get nominated for Best Actor, and if he doesn't.. that's a shame. Joaquin Phoenix plays his part well and so do the children. Even M. Nyght's small but important character was performed well.The story is great, once you know what the story is. M. Nyght tells his tale like a master. This is one scary movie up to the very end. It's got the 'jump' parts and it's full of 'chills' and suspense for characters you beleive in. Even without the last ten minutes, this movie is great. But the last ten minutes punches you with emotions that are not suppose come from a movie like this, and you won't see it coming.SPOILERS AHEAD. I felt compelled to write this because I feel strongly about this movie and people who trash it. I feel that people who bash this movie as 'a let down ending' just don't get it. This movie is NOT ABOUT ALIENS. This movie is about Graham getting his faith back. Aliens are a device to mislead you into thinking this is what the movie is about, and he does a good job of misleading you. When else can you question your faith unless you beleived the world was going to end? Graham doesn't even get his faith back in that dire circumstance.. it's later when he sees the 'signs'. That is why I think people don't get it. They want a big, alien gunfight or something, and are disappointed because he gives you something else entirely, a different movie. I don't know many movies where a subplot becomes the main plot, and the main plot doesn't mean as much once you realize the subplot was what he's been trying to say all along. It's brilliant. It works on so many levels. Watch the movie again and pay attention to Rory Culkins first couple of lines. Wow. Pay attention to M. Nyght's character talk to Graham Hess. All the loose ends get tied up. Sure the movie isn't perfect.. there are some plotholes that deal with the aliens and whatnot, but it's near the best movie experience I've ever had. As I sat in awe at the end, I felt wonder at being fooled into thinking I was getting a movie about aliens.. but I got a whole different movie instead. Good stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILER ALERT* I grow tired of people running down films and filmmakers who try to do something different. Filmmaking is not an exact science; it is art, and suffers from the same ills that other art forms (dance, music, theater, etc.) do -- what the artist sees in his/her head is not always able to be duplicated in the chosen medium. This "constipation of vision" is why artists cut off their ears or drink themselves to death or commit suicide.Love it or hate it, "Signs" is proof that M. Night Shyamalan has perhaps discovered visionary Ex-Lax (sorry for the pun). The film quickly establishes a pace, rhythm and tone -- both story-wise and visually -- and follows through beat for beat, measure for measure. Shyamalan frames his scenes the way his characters are meant to see them and is true to their voice. For example, Mel Gibson's character, Graham, has become emotionally and spiritually withdrawn following his wife's unexpected death. So nearly every one of scenes is quiet and introspective, with only the slightest reactions registering on his face but clearly taking hold within until he reaches a breaking point, effectively displayed at key moments in the film as catalysts for action -- both within his character and the story itself.Many people have complained that the "alien invasion" logic doesn't work. They appear stupid and clumsy (unable to escape a pantry) and susceptible to water (which is in abundance all over the Earth and in the human body). The alien invasion, however, is not the focus of the story. This is a film that uses its alien invasion theme not like "Independence Day" (told on a huge canvas featuring military heroics and technology) but rather like "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" -- as a backdrop and catalyst for an examination of one man's spirituality and faith in a higher power, a destiny. In that regard, the film works brilliantly. Gibson's Father Hess is a man who has turned his back on his God, believing that there is no hope -- only fear -- only to find himself, like Job, tested to the extreme to rediscover his faith.His family, in turn, illustrates the various types of faith that exist: his brother, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix in a terrific performance) is a "believer" who doesn't question but accepts what he sees as fact and acts upon it as such; a son, Morgan (Rory Culkin, also terrific), who takes an academic approach to his faith, believing because it can be proven in a book or by hard facts; and a daughter, Bo, whose faith is perhaps the strongest of all -- she sees and believes everything with eyes of a child, innocent and unsullied.There are those who would complain that Shyamalan is preaching in this film, putting forth Christianity and God as the solution and savior in times of peril. For atheists and non-Christians alike, that is a tough pill to swallow, no doubt, for it is not what they believe. But this is a film not about Christianity or God, but about Faith and its power. Believing that things happen not by chance, but for a reason that will be made clear. That's why the film begins and ends with the Hess family and their farmhouse and doesn't need to show a global story of us vs. the aliens. And also why (again a major complaint) it's not important for us to know how or why the aliens have retreated. Ultimately, this is why the film -- and Shyamalan visions -- works.Shyamalan is not the next Spielberg (the "Next Anyone/Anything" concept is completely ridiculous, by the way), but they share a common trait, one found also in filmmakers like Kubrick, Hitchcock and even John Ford: An ability to take the picture in their head and translate it into the picture on the screen, with its scope, drama and power."Signs" is brilliant, both as entertainment and an illustration of the power of filmmaking, unique in conception and execution and as powerful and thought provoking as any film I've seen this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would first like to say let's see YOU, or ME, try to make a movie and see how well it turns out. It is easy to criticize. With that in mind, I review.***yes, there are spoilers here***I think the movie was great. Great soundtrack and cinemtography. I jumped, I laughed, I cried, I predicted what I thought would happen, I was entertained and what's more, challenged to think. Sure, more holes than swiss cheese, but it was a FANTASY, it's not suppossed to explain anything but FAITH. Don't you think the director knew how cheesey it was to have non-opposable thumbed aliens (bordering on retarded, as one person's comments went) fly through space to earth without weapons or a raincoat or knowing how to open doors? And then after flying through space to get here, they need crop circles to navigate or communicate? That's part of the point, even. It wasn't the monsters that we had to fear, it was fear itself. And just because it's called FAITH doesn't necessarily make it RELIGIOUS. M. Night made Gibson's character a spiritual man by trade, but maybe it was only to hit us on the head with the point. It's possible to have faith that there are mysteries in the universe without believing it was a god-like figure that put them there. It's the same dilemma as posed in Contact, and please forgive the director's if they were not able to provide you with a definitive answer to the universe's ultimate questions. I give them kudo's for not boring us with, although entertaining when well done, made-up anomolies and technologies such as the Star Trek series are famous for.On a different note, one person here had a very interesting take on the movie that I thought was interesting - they thought that the whole movie was a dream of the little girl's, Bo. There was a scene in the very beginning that was never explained where she ask's her Dad, after just finding the crop circle "What are you doing in my dream?". At the time, I took it to mean that SHE thought she was dreaming still and not actually awake. But the case could be made that the whole movie was a child's nightmare after her mother's death, therefore explaining some of the immature aspects of the movie, like foil on their heads to keep aliens from reading minds, aliens that are threatening and creepy yet not fully realized, her father's child-like loss of faith despite his training, and a lack of information from the outside world about the goings on of military action etc. This would truly be in the vein of M. Night's directorial style. Maybe M. Night is having a royal laugh over all of us trying to "figure it out". Maybe that's the point.Either way, it was scary enough to keep me looking over my shoulder for a few days. I just can't get that scene out of me head when they are in the basement and the hand comes out of the grate to grab the kid. Totally predictable, but flawlessly chilling! I can't wait to see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Signs is one of those movies that require a certain suspension of disbelief to be entertaining. If you walk into the theatre having decided to ignore any discrepancies between the film and your beliefs, it is a very enthralling, scary movie. However, it is very easily ruined if you often find yourself saying "Well, that would never happen" or "Why did they do that?". That having been said, I enjoyed Signs despite having asked myself those very questions on 3 occasions.SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!1) I don't know about anyone else, but I find it hard to believe that a race of aliens capable of traveling millions of light years through space to come to our planet would be unable to open a wooden door with an axe under the doorknob. I know that the kid said the book claimed they would avoid using excessive technology to avoid nuclear attacks, but why couldn't they have brought a laser or even an axe of their own?2) At the end we find out that the aliens were harvesting humans. Halfway through the TV report says that the alien vessels were over 266 cities world-wide. This makes sense because cities are a good place to find lots of people. Why, then, would the aliens choose to land in the middle of Mel Gibson's corn field in the middle of nowhere? There were, what, 4 people within a mile radius? Why didn't they go 47 miles down the road to Philly where there were hundreds of thousands of people to harvest?3) At the end when Merriel is beating up the alien.....why doesn't the alien fight back?! It just stands there and lets itself be beaten until water falls all over it. Why didn't it spray that poison gas on him?Thankfully I was able to look past these issues and enjoy Signs as it was meant to be: a tense, paranoid feeling throughout with sub-plots questioning faith and belief.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Signs is a movie that left me with chills and excitement in my stomach twenty minutes after I had left the theatre. In one span during the last half hour, I was scared to death and then nearly in tears from the sadness portrayed in the next scene. There's a scene of a birthday party shot on a home video camera that I will never forget and is one of the creepiest things I could ever witness in my entire life. During the first twenty minutes of the movie, I thought everything in it was so weird and confusing, but this story weaves itself together so perfectly that it makes you just be in awe of M. Night Shymalan. If he keeps making these visually spectacular, deep human emotion dramas filled with incredible story telling, I will keep watching as long as my eyes are able. This movie was just simply amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie blew me away...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Nyght has created a tale that absolutely blew me away. I tried to stay away from spoilers before going to see this movie, and I'm glad I did. All I knew was that it had to do with aliens, crop circles, and was set on a small farm. For all those that have yet to see this movie, I think you should know that this movie is not about aliens, but don't let anyone ruin it for you. There is not a twist at the end like the sixth sense or unbreakable.. the whole movie is twisted.The performances are top notch. I peg Mel Gibson to at least get nominated for Best Actor, and if he doesn't.. that's a shame. Joaquin Phoenix plays his part well and so do the children. Even M. Nyght's small but important character was performed well.The story is great, once you know what the story is. M. Nyght tells his tale like a master. This is one scary movie up to the very end. It's got the 'jump' parts and it's full of 'chills' and suspense for characters you beleive in. Even without the last ten minutes, this movie is great. But the last ten minutes punches you with emotions that are not suppose come from a movie like this, and you won't see it coming.SPOILERS AHEAD. I felt compelled to write this because I feel strongly about this movie and people who trash it. I feel that people who bash this movie as 'a let down ending' just don't get it. This movie is NOT ABOUT ALIENS. This movie is about Graham getting his faith back. Aliens are a device to mislead you into thinking this is what the movie is about, and he does a good job of misleading you. When else can you question your faith unless you beleived the world was going to end? Graham doesn't even get his faith back in that dire circumstance.. it's later when he sees the 'signs'. That is why I think people don't get it. They want a big, alien gunfight or something, and are disappointed because he gives you something else entirely, a different movie. I don't know many movies where a subplot becomes the main plot, and the main plot doesn't mean as much once you realize the subplot was what he's been trying to say all along. It's brilliant. It works on so many levels. Watch the movie again and pay attention to Rory Culkins first couple of lines. Wow. Pay attention to M. Nyght's character talk to Graham Hess. All the loose ends get tied up. Sure the movie isn't perfect.. there are some plotholes that deal with the aliens and whatnot, but it's near the best movie experience I've ever had. As I sat in awe at the end, I felt wonder at being fooled into thinking I was getting a movie about aliens.. but I got a whole different movie instead. Good stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Signs wasn't what I thought it would be. It was very funny and had a great message. I love the way it dealt with God and Faith, Howeva; I was in the mood to be scared and have Nightmares, that didn't happen!!!! I wanted more thiller and less humor. There were a few surprises, things jumping out at you, but nothing like they said it would be. "Don't see it alone!" They says Whateva, It's wasn't like that at all.</fullReview>

Filmmaking is not an exact science; it is art, and suffers from the same ills that other art forms (dance, music, theater, etc.) do -- what the artist sees in his/her head is not always able to be duplicated in the chosen medium. This "constipation of vision" is why artists cut off their ears or drink themselves to death or commit suicide.Love it or hate it, "Signs" is proof that M.

Shyamalan frames his scenes the way his characters are meant to see them and is true to their voice. For example, Mel Gibson's character, Graham, has become emotionally and spiritually withdrawn following his wife's unexpected death.

This is a film that uses its alien invasion theme not like "Independence Day" (told on a huge canvas featuring military heroics and technology) but rather like "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" -- as a backdrop and catalyst for an examination of one man's spirituality and faith in a higher power, a destiny.

		<shortDescription>Okay but overrated...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** Possible spoilers **As a Christian, I was looking at a Christian movie review website and it said that this film was pro-faith, about a minister (Gibson), struggling with his faith in God, along with finding crop circles in his cornfield.It seems that Mr. Shyamalan tried to squeeze in two plots at once. Now, I don't know what the film really is about. Is it about Gibson's character who struggles with his Christian faith or is it about a bunch of aliens cutting crop circles all over the world? The ending was just too sudden and brief. It should have been expanded, like maybe, a shot of Gibson's character addressing his congregation or something like that. The trailer of the film looked awesome and from the trailer, I expected some heart-racing jump scenes but those were few and far between.From the six bucks I paid to see this film, it's worth about three bucks. My advice is to wait until it comes out on video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Holes in the plot -- SPOILER INCLUDED!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER WARNING: There are plot details discussed in this comment so please don't read it if you haven't seen the movie yet. I enjoyed watching this movie, but once it was over I was annoyed at some enormous holes in the plot. The most obvious gaping hole is that the aliens could be destroyed by water. Don't you think that if they had the intelligence to send fleets of ships through light years of space they would have known to wear some type of protective covering on earth with its water laden atmosphere? These creatures would be killed every time it rained. For us it would be like going to a planet where the rain is a powerful acid instead of water. We would wear some type of protective clothing. These aliens wouldn't even have been able to run through the corn field at night because at night in the summer the corn stalks would often be covered with dew. Another hole: the aliens made these giant signs in the corn fields which people suspect (correctly as it turns out) are aids to navigation. First of all, you would have trouble seeing them from space, especially if it's night on the ground. Second, don't you think the aliens would have some better form of technology to navigate the earth's surface? And most important, wouldn't some bright person have gotten the idea to mow the fields where the signs had been carved to erase the signs? Another hole: the neighbor (played by the director) catches an alien and locks it in the pantry. Mel Gibson knows it's there because he cuts its fingers off. Shouldn't one of these guys have mentioned this to somebody like maybe the police or the military? Said something like "There's a spaceman in the kitchen"? Instead the neighbor drives off to the lake and Mel runs home and boards up the windows. That just doesn't make any sense to me. Like I said, while the movie was playing I really enjoyed it because the performances are uniformly strong and there are some wonderful moments of suspense and humor. But afterward I just felt annoyed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie (possible spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really dont like to like movies that have been given a lot of hype such as "signs" was. However, when I went to see it in a relatively packed theatre, everyone was into the movie. It did make you feel uncomfortable, and there were about 4 parts that made you jump. There were a lot of funny parts, and overall it was funnier than it was scary. But there are faults with the movie: 1) If the aliens are allergic to water, why would they choose to invade a planet which is 70% water, and harvest human when the human body is mostly made of water also? 2)If I aliens had just been trying to get into my cellar door, there is no chance in hell I would pass out and go to sleep for 12 hours. It is far more likely that I would pass out for 30 minutes, and every slight noise I would hear would wake me up. The film had a feeling very similiar to the superior film called "The Others", and it also reminded me a lot of "Night of the Living Dead", but it is worth the money, and its an anjoyable film. As for if it is worthy of an oscar, I say no. The oscars are awards that have no basis on whether a film is good or not, its just a bunch of old people sitting around playing movie buffs. Come on, like a Beautiful Mind should have won best picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sign, Sign, Everywhere a Sign</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Gibson stars as a former pastor who has lost his faith in thelatest effort by M. Night Shyamalan. "Signs" is a return to form forthe writer/director of "The Sixth Sense " who stumbled a bit with hislast outing, "Unbreakable". While this is no "Sixth Sense " it isgood, compelling storytelling. When mysterious unexplained crop circles appear overnight in hisPennsylvania cornfield, Gibson and the local authorities figure itsthe work of local pranksters. But soon the patterns appear in fieldsall over the world. It becomes obvious something global is aboutto happen. Convinced by his wife's accidental death several months ago thatthere is no God watching over people, Gibson decides he and hisfamily can only depend on themselves, whatever happens. Sojoined by his brother, a failed minor league ballplayer (JoaquinPhoneix) Gibson's son (Rory Culkin) (yes, ANOTHER Culkin) andhis irrestibly cute daughter (Abigal Breslin) the family prepares forwhatever might happen.A lot happens, but I won't ruin it for you. You should go see foryourself.A suspense thriller, "Signs" is never gory or gross and bloody.Instead, director Shyamalan masterfully builds up the tension in&nbsp;Hitchcockian fashion. There's no nudity, but there's nobody in thisfilm you want to see naked anyway. Shyamalan must learn that inaddition to making films suspenseful, Hitchcock never forgot tothrow in a Grace Kelly or a Kim Novak or Janet Leigh. I must tellhim this next time I see him at the club.Another weakness is Shyamalan's Tarantino-like decision to casthimself in a key role. It's not that he's bad in it, he's not; but hispresence in the picture and the way he is introduced totallydistracts from the film's central story. M. (a Fritz Lang homage?)would be better off limiting his acting to a brief Hitchcock likecameo and hiring real actors to act.Some people have complained a bit about the film's ending notliving up to the rest of the picture, and I can see their point.However, I enjoyed the storytelling enough to give that a pass.Besides I rather like campy 1950's sci-fi films, so I had no problemwith the ending.What I had a problem with is Rory Culkin. Are these kids beingcloned now or what? There seems to be a never ending supply ofthese Culkin kids. When one grows up and is no longer cute, twomore spring up to take its place. This is perhaps the real invasionwe have to worry about: the attack of the Culkins. Now that bigbrother MacCaulay "Home Alone" (with his 22 brothers andsisters--Christian, Kieran, Quinn, Shane, Rory, etc. etc.) Culkin is21, I expect he'll be pumping out more replacement Culkin kidsbefore too long. And then his brothers and sisters will be oldenough to have kids, and then his kids will have kids and beforeyou know it, we'll be running in the streets screaming like that guyin "Invasion of the Body Snatchers"."Help! Wait! Stop. Stop and listen to me!...These Culkins who'recoming after me are not human. Look, you fools. You're in danger.Can't you see? They're after you. They're after all of us. Our wives,our children, everyone. They're here already!"Now that's scary.http://go.to/senor_sock</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is becoming increasingly apparent that Mr. Shyamalan is in danger of becoming a one-shot wonder. Both Signs and Unbreakable are stylish thrillers with excellent acting and excellent direction, but the stories in both leave you scratching your head afterwards - is that it?! The structure of the movie is great, all kinds of disparate events coming together at the end when all is made clear, but to what end? It's like building Fort Knox to house a Ronald McDonald Happy Meal toy! I keep holding out hope that he will be able to recreate the terrific adventure that the Sixth Sense was, but, sorry to say, it doesn't look like it's going to happen. So much talent, so little payoff!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>** Possible spoilers **As a Christian, I was looking at a Christian movie review website and it said that this film was pro-faith, about a minister (Gibson), struggling with his faith in God, along with finding crop circles in his cornfield.It seems that Mr. Shyamalan tried to squeeze in two plots at once. Now, I don't know what the film really is about. Is it about Gibson's character who struggles with his Christian faith or is it about a bunch of aliens cutting crop circles all over the world? The ending was just too sudden and brief. It should have been expanded, like maybe, a shot of Gibson's character addressing his congregation or something like that. The trailer of the film looked awesome and from the trailer, I expected some heart-racing jump scenes but those were few and far between.From the six bucks I paid to see this film, it's worth about three bucks. My advice is to wait until it comes out on video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some plot elements are revealed here.Do you remember the TV series Dragnet? Everybody in the show had the same taciturn demeanor; the cops, the crooks, victims, witnesses, everybody. Even the kid wacked out on drugs!Now we have a new Jack Webb. His name is M. Night Shyalaman. Everybody in all his movies have the same muffled monotonous narrow emotional range you would expect to find in a phsycho ward that depends heavily on sedatives to keep the inmates under control. Even someone who is horribly mangled &amp; about to die drones out a few sentences as if reading pages out of an insurance policy.This is not my only complaint with M. Night. I loved Sixth Sense. The way he presented the movie was fresh &amp; worked very well with the subject. But then he did Unbreakable in exactly the same way. The subdued 'don't show the action' style was totally bogus for what was essentially an action movie subject. When I 1st saw trailers for Signs I suspected he may do the same thing, but it looked good so I gave him the benefit of the doubt.But again he followed the same formula with the same style &amp; the same drole characters. The 'don't show the action' device goes way too far this time. Instead of generating suspense, it only exasperates &amp; irritates.In addition to the stylistic shortcomings, this movie has some serious technical flaws. The aliens would have to be so astoundingly stupid for the events in this movie to occur that it would strain the imagination to believe they could even find their way here, let alone create the space ships.nuf sed</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I figured-out the message in this movie within the first 10 minutes because it's the same old garbage heartstring plot Hollywood has sold in many packages over the years.I challenge ANYONE to defend the incredibly silly bits. Aliens that can fly between star systems but have to use patterns in corn crops to navigate/coordinate once they get to Earth. They can also be locked in pantries but have ways of flattening corn for miles and their only weapon is a little tube which expels poison gas about 4 inches away from their wrists. Absolutely the worst looking movie alien in years! Moved like claymation figure, always in shadows, not one "smart" sign in anything they did.The kids show about as much emotion as department store mannequins... for instance, when the family dog dies he only rates one sniff and no tears... after going under in a spine-chilling asthma attack, the kid (Culkin), wakes and immediately says "did someone save me?" I'm sure if you look in comic book stores you could find much more surprizing and intelligent dialog than the moronic exchanges between these unbelievable characters. For instance... in an Army Recruiting station we learn by the sudden recognition from the local military recruiter that Phoenix has the long-distance home-run record in local minor league baseball.. then... suddenly... a character pipes up after keeping silent throughout the whole silly monologue to say that he also holds the strike-out record. Both the recruiter and the suddenly appearing local kid look and act like characters out of cartoons.Terribly slow pace for little emotionally engaging or suspenseful dialog. Bad acting, bad casting (noone looks like family here), silly plot which puts the extraterrestrials last in line of importance... yuch. The popcorn was much better than the movie.Swing away... swing away!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Happy Surprise (Minor Plot Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of M. Night Shyamalan's. I thought "The Sixth Sense" was great and consider "Unbreakable" one of the best movies I've ever seen, so I was obviously looking forward to "Signs". I wasn't disappointed.I went into "Signs" expecting something completely different than what it was. I thought it would be more about the crop signs and aliens. Being a Shyamalan film, I expected it to be different, but I didn't expect anything like this. What surprised me was that this is not about an alien invasion or even crop circles. Yes, they are devices used to spark the story, but they could have been replaced with another setup and the film could have easily told the same story. More than aliens or crop circles, this is a film about faith, losing it and gaining it back.If I have a problem with the film, it's that I wanted to know more. More about what the aliens, more about how the rest of the world reacted. Ultimately, however, that is not what the movie is about. It is about Mel Gibson's character's search for his lost faith.I've read comments from this and other sites saying the aliens were too stupid with their strategies and they were weak and there weren't enough of them and other things the aliens should have done better if they were so advanced. The thing is, they explain that this is merely a small recon wave of them to check things out. That explains the small number of them and the lack of weapons.The movie is expertly executed, building up suspense, adding small character quirks and issues that seem insignificant- just minor character development, but in the climax come together perfectly without seeming contrived.This is a great film. Possibly Shyamalan's best ("Unbreakable" may still be better) and easily one of the best (if not THE best) of the year so far. See it without any expectation about what is going to happen and just go where it takes you, you won't be disappointed- and if you are, you're wrong.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>May Contain SpoilersThis movie was good... but there were a few things I didn't like. For one, I'm not a religious person. I know that a lot of folks get annoyed with people like that, but it's just my choice. Now, I think the media is more open to different beliefs nowadays than about 20 years ago, which is good, but I felt a strong - I dunno, "God" vibe at the end of this film. It was as if they were saying 'if you believe in God the aliens can't hurt you' or something along those lines. The second thing is the fact that they showed the actual alien. It was scarier to me not knowing what was there or what it looked like. And the computer animation was good, but not convincing enough. Some good points of the film were the suspense and the little funny things thrown in. Anyway, I don't think this is M. Night Shamylan's best movie, but it is a lot better than some I've seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't usually see suspense movies but i have seen the Sixth Sense and Signs and I think Signs is better. It has some very suspenseful moments and does a great job of leaving the Aliens up to your imagination except for one brief spotting and the climax fight. It lets you think for yourself what's "behind the door" or " in the cornfield" without really showing you and that can make a movie all the more scarier. Altogether a great film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great pacing marked with a perfect balance of humor, suspense, and purpose accentuated by an intense musical score. I'm buying this on DVD.But a movie is more than entertainment...it's a commentary. And this is an all too important film in light of the times we live in.Father Hess breaks it down for us -- When 'bad things' happen, they scream at our flesh one of two options: God a) does not exist or b) must be malevolent.SIGNS tells us though God may seem aloof, apathetic or nonexistent, He is ever present and He cares. SIGNS tells us that God is good and He is in control. SIGNS is a story about faith...about listening closely.I thought Night used the aliens as a clever plot device to communicate an all important message to an otherwise deaf world. Our world is very intrigued by 'aliens' and entertained by the possibility of their existence...and night used our interest to feed us simple truth. And since Sept 11th, the whole world has been asking: Why do bad things happen to good people? How can a good God exist in the face of such evil? Well...SIGNS answers those questions.There is no such thing as coincidence. Chaos cannot produce order. Everything happens for a reason and is under the providence ofone good God.Thank you Mr. ShyamalanAtheists will probably hate it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About faith, the film decides to focus on aliens.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Several reviewers are correct in that this is a film about the personal struggles within a family and specifically the struggle of one man (Gibson) with faith. Gibson's character, once a reverend, has lost his faith following the seemingly pointless and horrid death of his wife in an accident. The plot of the movie is mainly the renewal of Gibson's faith as he discovers his wife's death is not a random and pointless accident, but has a designed purpose behind it. The events that cause this renewal in the character's faith is an alien invasion. Frankly I found the film to be lousy - and not because of the film's focus per se. I did not expect a slam 'em bang 'em flick as Independence Day nor did I expect amazing special effects. Neither of those elements make any film good alone. I did expect a deep story about Gibson's character's faith. As noted above, the idea was there, but it was executed rather badly. Most of the film centers around these signs of the alien invasion - but they are useless to the story other than driving Gibson towards the ultimate rediscovery of his faith in divine purpose. The film therefore is simply a bunch of scenes that are driving to the rather short and unsatisfying ending. Because the ending is so important to the film and you realize that the alien stuff is just backdrop to the whole story, you sit in the theater just waiting for the film to end. It could easily have been a half hour episode of the Twilight Zone rather than the 2 hours (or near) that it is. The backstory of Gibson's loss of faith take up about 15 minutes of screen time if that. The rest of the film is taken up with 'tense' sequences dealing with the characters trying to figure out if the aliens are out there and what they're up to. But we the audience already knows the point of the film has nothing to do with aliens, so who cares? In additon, the tense scenes aren't scary or that tense either. The cinematography of the film was good. Mel Gibson and the actors playing his family did all do a good job with what they had - but very little they had actually added to the theme of faith in the movie. Other scenes and actors gave weak performances. Particularly I remember a scene where the 'uncle' is speaking to an army officer where I wondered why the scene was even taking place (oh yeah, to establish the whole baseball bat thing!) I'm rolling my eyes.POSSIBLE SPOILER I don't want to reveal too much, but the whole baseball bat idea of 'swing it' was a rather weak way leading to reinspiring faith. It almost seems like Gibson's character is stretching to give meaning to his wife's words so that he can get through the disaster that is at hand at the film's end. Perhaps that is the point, but if it is, nothing more is said or implied to give the film any true meaning.I liked the Sixth Sense. Unbreakable was okay. This film could have been good if it would have stuck to its main theme of rediscovery of faith. The focus of this film is instead misplaced around the aliens And thereby many theater-goers are understandably surprised when the end FINALLY comes to learn it's supposed to be all about faith. No matter what you go to this film for (faith or aliens) you should be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved Sixth Sense when it came out. I was actually one of those that saw it before the hype and was amazed. I also saw Unbreakable which was good but not mind blowing. Just some fun entertainment and a reunion of one of my favorite duos Willis/Jackson. I've been waiting to see Signs for quite some time now. Shyamalan really knows how to market his movies by hiding what the reasons behind the crop signs are. I wanted to see this movie just to find out what the heck the answer was. What were the signs? Who was doing it? This was major when I watched the film because even from when the First credits were rolling I was excited and anxious. I couldn't wait to find out the answer. It was a great marketing job which affected how I saw the film. Now to the actual film. This story is probably the most wonderful work of story telling I have seen. Just how everything ties together and the dialogue of lines makes me think, "How could anyone ever think of this?" I could better explain the what I mean here but that would mean spoilers, which I want to avoid. Just go see it and you will know what I'm talking about. It's a great story because there are the obvious connections you can find and then there are those deeper more complex connections that you can only find by seeing the film twice, yes i have seen it twice. I also love the title of the movie because I went into the movie thinking the title "Signs" was about crop signs, but I came out of the movie with a different perception on the title. This is just a fantastic movie told in a fantastic way. Shyamalan is a true story-telling genius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one I'm in the middle on. I was certainly disappointed, so I can agree with most of the negative criticisms SIGNS has gotten. I'd have to say that I found the savage invective hurled against it here far more enjoyable than the movie.On the other hand, I liked it. I expected something broader, more serious,more subtle, but in the end I at least got a pretty good old-fashioned monster movie. A few chuckles, loads of goosebumps. I'm not sure that it's fair to review movies as antitheses of expectations based on previous credits of the director, or comparisons to true classics of the genre Hitchcock etc... What's up there on the screen passes muster as good solid popcorny entertainment. Exquisitely moody cinematography, superstar charisma (but this has to be Mel's "gulpiest" performance outside of RANSOM)and a fine supporting performance by a peculiarly intriguing actor, can work magic on the drippiest of screenplays.But boy, that religious business... Almost as ridiculous and out-of-touch as all those wimples and robes in SISTER ACT which real nuns hadn't worn in 25years. A high school drop-out PLUMBER will lose faith in God over a squashed wife and express his idiosyncratic apostasy in the terms used here, not a theologically adept Reverend Father. In fact, a really up-to-date and with-it Rev would have taken a least a few pages from the God Is Dead School of Theology and not had too many "Father In Heaven, Eye on the Sparrow" notions to begin with. Also, coming face to face with Alien Beings would be a devastatingly UnBiblical experience for many believers, not an occasion to put extra oomph into the recital of Psalm 23. In any case, the "faith" which the Rev recovers is only the vaguest of intuitions, one more in line with unchurched agnosticism than with Being Saved in the John 3:16 sense. If you're basically on the same page only with Voltaire it's best not to go charging off in full clerical dress like Thomas a Becket...Someone was listing movies SIGNS cribs from.

I know that a lot of folks get annoyed with people like that, but it's just my choice. Now, I think the media is more open to different beliefs nowadays than about 20 years ago, which is good, but I felt a strong - I dunno, "God" vibe at the end of this film. It was as if they were saying 'if you believe in God the aliens can't hurt you' or something along those lines. The second thing is the fact that they showed the actual alien. It was scarier to me not knowing what was there or what it looked like. And the computer animation was good, but not convincing enough. Some good points of the film were the suspense and the little funny things thrown in. Anyway, I don't think this is M.

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan is a story-telling genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved Sixth Sense when it came out. I was actually one of those that saw it before the hype and was amazed. I also saw Unbreakable which was good but not mind blowing. Just some fun entertainment and a reunion of one of my favorite duos Willis/Jackson. I've been waiting to see Signs for quite some time now. Shyamalan really knows how to market his movies by hiding what the reasons behind the crop signs are. I wanted to see this movie just to find out what the heck the answer was. What were the signs? Who was doing it? This was major when I watched the film because even from when the First credits were rolling I was excited and anxious. I couldn't wait to find out the answer. It was a great marketing job which affected how I saw the film. Now to the actual film. This story is probably the most wonderful work of story telling I have seen. Just how everything ties together and the dialogue of lines makes me think, "How could anyone ever think of this?" I could better explain the what I mean here but that would mean spoilers, which I want to avoid. Just go see it and you will know what I'm talking about. It's a great story because there are the obvious connections you can find and then there are those deeper more complex connections that you can only find by seeing the film twice, yes i have seen it twice. I also love the title of the movie because I went into the movie thinking the title "Signs" was about crop signs, but I came out of the movie with a different perception on the title. This is just a fantastic movie told in a fantastic way. Shyamalan is a true story-telling genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Show/Bad Faith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one I'm in the middle on. I was certainly disappointed, so I can agree with most of the negative criticisms SIGNS has gotten. I'd have to say that I found the savage invective hurled against it here far more enjoyable than the movie.On the other hand, I liked it. I expected something broader, more serious,more subtle, but in the end I at least got a pretty good old-fashioned monster movie. A few chuckles, loads of goosebumps. I'm not sure that it's fair to review movies as antitheses of expectations based on previous credits of the director, or comparisons to true classics of the genre Hitchcock etc... What's up there on the screen passes muster as good solid popcorny entertainment. Exquisitely moody cinematography, superstar charisma (but this has to be Mel's "gulpiest" performance outside of RANSOM)and a fine supporting performance by a peculiarly intriguing actor, can work magic on the drippiest of screenplays.But boy, that religious business... Almost as ridiculous and out-of-touch as all those wimples and robes in SISTER ACT which real nuns hadn't worn in 25years. A high school drop-out PLUMBER will lose faith in God over a squashed wife and express his idiosyncratic apostasy in the terms used here, not a theologically adept Reverend Father. In fact, a really up-to-date and with-it Rev would have taken a least a few pages from the God Is Dead School of Theology and not had too many "Father In Heaven, Eye on the Sparrow" notions to begin with. Also, coming face to face with Alien Beings would be a devastatingly UnBiblical experience for many believers, not an occasion to put extra oomph into the recital of Psalm 23. In any case, the "faith" which the Rev recovers is only the vaguest of intuitions, one more in line with unchurched agnosticism than with Being Saved in the John 3:16 sense. If you're basically on the same page only with Voltaire it's best not to go charging off in full clerical dress like Thomas a Becket...Someone was listing movies SIGNS cribs from. How about THE BIRDS?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some plot elements are revealed here.Do you remember the TV series Dragnet? Everybody in the show had the same taciturn demeanor; the cops, the crooks, victims, witnesses, everybody. Even the kid wacked out on drugs!Now we have a new Jack Webb. His name is M. Night Shyalaman. Everybody in all his movies have the same muffled monotonous narrow emotional range you would expect to find in a phsycho ward that depends heavily on sedatives to keep the inmates under control. Even someone who is horribly mangled &amp; about to die drones out a few sentences as if reading pages out of an insurance policy.This is not my only complaint with M. Night. I loved Sixth Sense. The way he presented the movie was fresh &amp; worked very well with the subject. But then he did Unbreakable in exactly the same way. The subdued 'don't show the action' style was totally bogus for what was essentially an action movie subject. When I 1st saw trailers for Signs I suspected he may do the same thing, but it looked good so I gave him the benefit of the doubt.But again he followed the same formula with the same style &amp; the same drole characters. The 'don't show the action' device goes way too far this time. Instead of generating suspense, it only exasperates &amp; irritates.In addition to the stylistic shortcomings, this movie has some serious technical flaws. The aliens would have to be so astoundingly stupid for the events in this movie to occur that it would strain the imagination to believe they could even find their way here, let alone create the space ships.nuf sed</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I figured-out the message in this movie within the first 10 minutes because it's the same old garbage heartstring plot Hollywood has sold in many packages over the years.I challenge ANYONE to defend the incredibly silly bits. Aliens that can fly between star systems but have to use patterns in corn crops to navigate/coordinate once they get to Earth. They can also be locked in pantries but have ways of flattening corn for miles and their only weapon is a little tube which expels poison gas about 4 inches away from their wrists. Absolutely the worst looking movie alien in years! Moved like claymation figure, always in shadows, not one "smart" sign in anything they did.The kids show about as much emotion as department store mannequins... for instance, when the family dog dies he only rates one sniff and no tears... after going under in a spine-chilling asthma attack, the kid (Culkin), wakes and immediately says "did someone save me?" I'm sure if you look in comic book stores you could find much more surprizing and intelligent dialog than the moronic exchanges between these unbelievable characters. For instance... in an Army Recruiting station we learn by the sudden recognition from the local military recruiter that Phoenix has the long-distance home-run record in local minor league baseball.. then... suddenly... a character pipes up after keeping silent throughout the whole silly monologue to say that he also holds the strike-out record. Both the recruiter and the suddenly appearing local kid look and act like characters out of cartoons.Terribly slow pace for little emotionally engaging or suspenseful dialog. Bad acting, bad casting (noone looks like family here), silly plot which puts the extraterrestrials last in line of importance... yuch. The popcorn was much better than the movie.Swing away... swing away!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Happy Surprise (Minor Plot Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of M. Night Shyamalan's. I thought "The Sixth Sense" was great and consider "Unbreakable" one of the best movies I've ever seen, so I was obviously looking forward to "Signs". I wasn't disappointed.I went into "Signs" expecting something completely different than what it was. I thought it would be more about the crop signs and aliens. Being a Shyamalan film, I expected it to be different, but I didn't expect anything like this. What surprised me was that this is not about an alien invasion or even crop circles. Yes, they are devices used to spark the story, but they could have been replaced with another setup and the film could have easily told the same story. More than aliens or crop circles, this is a film about faith, losing it and gaining it back.If I have a problem with the film, it's that I wanted to know more. More about what the aliens, more about how the rest of the world reacted. Ultimately, however, that is not what the movie is about. It is about Mel Gibson's character's search for his lost faith.I've read comments from this and other sites saying the aliens were too stupid with their strategies and they were weak and there weren't enough of them and other things the aliens should have done better if they were so advanced. The thing is, they explain that this is merely a small recon wave of them to check things out. That explains the small number of them and the lack of weapons.The movie is expertly executed, building up suspense, adding small character quirks and issues that seem insignificant- just minor character development, but in the climax come together perfectly without seeming contrived.This is a great film. Possibly Shyamalan's best ("Unbreakable" may still be better) and easily one of the best (if not THE best) of the year so far. See it without any expectation about what is going to happen and just go where it takes you, you won't be disappointed- and if you are, you're wrong.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get more than you bargained for...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most people, I went to go see Signs for the Shyamalan twist. Although I did not get that twist, I still left the theatre feeling more than satisfied with this movie. What starts out as a film similar to Independence Day, ends up being a movie with an unbelievable message that is just so hard to come across these days. Mel Gibson and Joaquin Pheonix only add to the already amazing screenplay. The little kids also add great comic relief along with bringing along great emotional moments. Unfortunately, you people that go to this and expect Independence Day in a cornfield will probably be sorely disappointed. However, I went into this film expecting a film about aliens and invasions, but I left feeling just a little better about my life. What starts out as just another end of the world alien invasion movie, ends up to be a sincere tale about faith and its importance. You want to love gibson's character the whole film, but there's just something holding you back. The deeper and deeper he resents himself, the more you feel sorry for him, but the more you want to love his character. And in a shocking conclusion, (possible ***spoiler*** ahead) Mel, a former reverand, realizes that God really never left his side, which is just the message I needed to hear on this particular night. If you're looking for an alien action movie, this has it's moments but it's not likely that you'll love this movie...But if you go in looking for a whole hearted drama about faith that just happens to be in the middle of an alien invasion, will you like this movie? Signs point to yes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heavy Stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now firstly i got stranded with a very bad print of this movie and although i am strictly against piracy, i couldn't wait 3-4 months for it to release. The movie is Shyamalan's 2nd since "sixth sense" which i regard as his masterpiece. In this movie he also makes a slight shift from the system he had succesfuly used in Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. This time there is no surprise ending; unless you call Gibson's return to faith that.So the movie instead of dealing with the supernatural deals with aliens; but not completely. The aliens are just a backdrop to the story of a man who loses his faith and events force him to regain his belief in a supreme power. Understandably, the scary moments( which were missing to an extent in Unbreakable) hold your attention to the story and meanwhile the main story is unfolded through glimpses. I felt phoenix was great here and dabs in with very subtle moments of humour. The kids are great especially culkin's delivery is breathtaking. Gibson does a good job of what could have been a disaster. He underplays the part and doesn't go over the top forming the crux of the film.Overall,good stuff. i'd recommend it to anybody.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film that the trailer portrayed was thrilling, original and yes, even scary. Unfortunately, the trailer must have been for a different movie since Signs was none of those.Shyamalan films have been known to play on the mental exploitation of the audience. I was enraptured by the spine tingling Sixth Sense and then was blown away by its ending. However, I left Signs just feeling duped. This was not the movie I came to see. The "everything happens for a reason" plotline was preachy and overdone to the point that the extra terrestrials were more realistic than the exorbinant coincidences that befall the Hess family. And there isn't enough space to describe all the plot holes.Stylistically, there were some very interesting choices made, like the blackout for a few seconds right in the crux of the film. This really heightened the suspense (the little that there was) and made for an original scene. However, it was really the only shining moment in the movie. Its sad when that occurs when the screen is totally dark.All in all, if you're looking for that summer sci-fi thriller, watch the trailer. If you're looking for a movie that tries really too hard to link all a family's contrived events into one supposedly meaningful package, then spend the ten bucks and go see it. At least you'll know what you're getting yourself into.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Strike another mark for M. Night Shyamalan on the running success board! I heard before going into this movie that it wasn't that great and that I would leave the theater disappointed with the lack of ET references and a sudden ending. Those who haven't seen, or have yet to comprehend MNS's style are like those who still don't fully understand the genius of Picasso or E. A. Poe. Before going to this film, I would highly recommend seeing Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, MNS's other works of art. Get them on DVD and listen to the director's audio commentary. It explains so much as to the voice he uses in these films. Don't go into the theater looking for an Independence Day "shoot 'em up" with space ships flying everywhere. And DEFINITELY, don't look for a Mars Attacks crapolla-fest. Instead, look for the spiritual references of a man struggling with his faith and finding it while going through a world-wide crisis. I consider myself an agnostic when it comes to alien life; I believe in the possibility, but I have yet to see any real hard evidence of that existence. On that vein, so what if the alien looks like your typical man-in-a-rubber-suit? Who's to say what aliens look like? They may even look just like us. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!

		<fullReview>I went in to this movie expecting it to fall short of its hype. But I actually found it quite good. The trailers are misleading, but deliberately so and -- if this makes sense -- "honestly" so. This is really more a movie about a widowed father struggling with his dying faith after a car accident leaves his wife dead. The crop signs and other sci fi trappings are all in service of this plot. M. Night Shyamalan takes a relatively mundane bogeyman story and turns it into a thoughtful, character-driven exploration of faith and destiny.A lot of people will be disappointed because there are no lasers, no Ramboesque heroics, and no explosions. There ARE plenty of twists and surprises and at least one jump-from-your-chair shock. The effects, like the movie, are subtle and understated ... just as in a good Hitchcock film. Gibson gives an excellent performance and the children are amazingly genuine. IMHO, _Signs_ recaptures much of the feel and skill that made _The Sixth Sense_ such an astounding film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excepting those who will go to see this movie expecting an "alien flick" with lots of guns and maybe some spaceships, metal suits, and lasers, you will leave the theater in absolute awe with a feeling of humbleness and perhaps a new perspective when you look out the window at the sky. It simply depicts the struggles of a human soul searching for the truth; aliens are just a sideshow. Its stars the brilliantly cast Mel Gibson, who gives a heartfelt performance as an ex-religious father who has lost his faith through a personal tragedy. Joaquin Pheonix shines as his helplessly lost brother and adding to the depth, humor and humanity are Rory Culkin and the adorable Abigail as his children, giving stunning performances as well. Absolutely amazing in its direction and filmography, one of the only truly terrifying movies i have ever seen, yet beautiful and emotionally satisfying. The best $5.50 i ever spent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Manoj Night Shyamalan's newest film is also one that I like more than the other two he has made. Is it a better film than Sixth Sense and Unbreakable? I think so. Where I found Sixth Sense and its ending a bit gimmicky, and Unbreakable to be slower than molasses, Signs hardly ever tries to fool the audience with some weird twist, and it moves faster than Unbreakable, though not by much. And I like it that it's a fairly straightforward film. Some people are disappointed in this film. I can see why. Many expected a sci-fi thriller, but it's only part sci-fi thriller, and more of a personal-journey for the protagonist. I think if you keep that in mind before watching the movie, it will help you appreciate the movie and it's unfairly criticized ending a lot more. This is a good movie. A very good movie, with very good performances. I have never been a fan of Mel Gibson, but here he is just terrific. If there is one thing that Shyamalan does very well, it's getting his actors to project their very emotions onto celluloid. Everyone does a terrific job. Even the score is fantastic. It is one of the most memorable, most suspenseful scores I have heard in quite a while. I would also like to add, however, that Shyamalan is a writer/director whose style is really, I believe, an acquired taste. His dialogue often just sounds like dialogue, with little realism, and delivery of it is sometimes even less realistic. And his films move at a seemingly un-naturally slow pace. But films don't have to be realistic! They have to tell a story, and tell it well! And Shyamalan tells a very good story with Signs, and tells it very well. The film has many small flaws, but overall it's a real gem. ***1/2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS ALERT I went into signs with some preconcieved notions about what to expect. The trailers had led me to believe that the movie was going to be about the mysterious crop circles and a full suspense film. I understand that comic relief is needed at times to lighten the tension of a film but it was used so frequently that no atmosphere of any kind could be created. The characters seemed to behave in a strange non human manner and never seemed phased by the events that were unfolding. There were a few things that really bothered me throughout.1. Why at no point did Graham(Mel Gibson) or anyone else in his family have a weapon for protection 2. The directors acting was poor and he seemed very out of place 3. The sheriff's choice for casting was very poor and the actress did a poor job delivering her unfunny lines.The movie is not without some saving characteristics however. There are many genuinely frightening moments, and some great moments of tension. Despite what many other people here have said the ending was one of the best parts of the film. It made you realize how much more effort had been put together in crafting the plot of the film and introduced a series of important themes to the movie. In horror films such as this, the best way to create suspense is to leave the creature up to the viewers imagination. By fully showing the creature at the conclusion, the horrible image of the aliens in my mind had been majorly downplayed thanks to fairly standerd effects. Overall i felt that the films good moments were overshadowed by too many problems and that this movie is simply a tease of what could have been one of the most frightening films of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Racing through the streets to catch the last show of opening night of Signs, I was anxious to watch the latest Shyamalan film. Night has a very unique story telling technique and this film was definitely no let down like I have heard. The film was very tense and suspenseful, and never had a dull moment. However, most ignorant and close-minded film gowers who expected to see aliens and humans have a full blow war of the worlds could not appreciate the real story Shyamalan put into this film. The best part of the film is the story of Gibson's character. The development of a character throughout a film is what keeps a movie going. As I left the theater with my heart pounding and ready to come back to the film again, I over heard remarks of the rude and unappreciative people. Bottom line. Anyone who thinks this film isn't excellent is should just stick to watching simple minded movies.Such as Austin Powers or Kung Pow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent if understated edge-of-your-seat thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went in to this movie expecting it to fall short of its hype. But I actually found it quite good. The trailers are misleading, but deliberately so and -- if this makes sense -- "honestly" so. This is really more a movie about a widowed father struggling with his dying faith after a car accident leaves his wife dead. The crop signs and other sci fi trappings are all in service of this plot. M. Night Shyamalan takes a relatively mundane bogeyman story and turns it into a thoughtful, character-driven exploration of faith and destiny.A lot of people will be disappointed because there are no lasers, no Ramboesque heroics, and no explosions. There ARE plenty of twists and surprises and at least one jump-from-your-chair shock. The effects, like the movie, are subtle and understated ... just as in a good Hitchcock film. Gibson gives an excellent performance and the children are amazingly genuine. IMHO, _Signs_ recaptures much of the feel and skill that made _The Sixth Sense_ such an astounding film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excepting those who will go to see this movie expecting an "alien flick" with lots of guns and maybe some spaceships, metal suits, and lasers, you will leave the theater in absolute awe with a feeling of humbleness and perhaps a new perspective when you look out the window at the sky. It simply depicts the struggles of a human soul searching for the truth; aliens are just a sideshow. Its stars the brilliantly cast Mel Gibson, who gives a heartfelt performance as an ex-religious father who has lost his faith through a personal tragedy. Joaquin Pheonix shines as his helplessly lost brother and adding to the depth, humor and humanity are Rory Culkin and the adorable Abigail as his children, giving stunning performances as well. Absolutely amazing in its direction and filmography, one of the only truly terrifying movies i have ever seen, yet beautiful and emotionally satisfying. The best $5.50 i ever spent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Manoj Night Shyamalan's newest film is also one that I like more than the other two he has made. Is it a better film than Sixth Sense and Unbreakable? I think so. Where I found Sixth Sense and its ending a bit gimmicky, and Unbreakable to be slower than molasses, Signs hardly ever tries to fool the audience with some weird twist, and it moves faster than Unbreakable, though not by much. And I like it that it's a fairly straightforward film. Some people are disappointed in this film. I can see why. Many expected a sci-fi thriller, but it's only part sci-fi thriller, and more of a personal-journey for the protagonist. I think if you keep that in mind before watching the movie, it will help you appreciate the movie and it's unfairly criticized ending a lot more. This is a good movie. A very good movie, with very good performances. I have never been a fan of Mel Gibson, but here he is just terrific. If there is one thing that Shyamalan does very well, it's getting his actors to project their very emotions onto celluloid. Everyone does a terrific job. Even the score is fantastic. It is one of the most memorable, most suspenseful scores I have heard in quite a while. I would also like to add, however, that Shyamalan is a writer/director whose style is really, I believe, an acquired taste. His dialogue often just sounds like dialogue, with little realism, and delivery of it is sometimes even less realistic. And his films move at a seemingly un-naturally slow pace. But films don't have to be realistic! They have to tell a story, and tell it well! And Shyamalan tells a very good story with Signs, and tells it very well. The film has many small flaws, but overall it's a real gem. ***1/2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Signs, signs everywhere there are signs throughout this moive that are bits and pieces of films that I have seen before. This is not a very original piece of work and that is sad because I really was hoping that Knight would bring back the talent he showed us in "Sixth Sense". I have closely watched thousands of films over 50 some years, studied at USC and have taught film clases for years, but this work has not done homework very well. I love to be thrilled, chilled and kept wondering what is coming up next....guess I'm too old a cinema viewer to appreciate "SIGNS"! This moive says Hitchcock but it's not how Hitch would have done it! I see the signs and I read the signs and I'm reminded to take the next EXIT SIGN! As they say "I'm SIGNING OUT!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS ALERT I went into signs with some preconcieved notions about what to expect. The trailers had led me to believe that the movie was going to be about the mysterious crop circles and a full suspense film. I understand that comic relief is needed at times to lighten the tension of a film but it was used so frequently that no atmosphere of any kind could be created. The characters seemed to behave in a strange non human manner and never seemed phased by the events that were unfolding. There were a few things that really bothered me throughout.1. Why at no point did Graham(Mel Gibson) or anyone else in his family have a weapon for protection 2. The directors acting was poor and he seemed very out of place 3. The sheriff's choice for casting was very poor and the actress did a poor job delivering her unfunny lines.The movie is not without some saving characteristics however. There are many genuinely frightening moments, and some great moments of tension. Despite what many other people here have said the ending was one of the best parts of the film. It made you realize how much more effort had been put together in crafting the plot of the film and introduced a series of important themes to the movie. In horror films such as this, the best way to create suspense is to leave the creature up to the viewers imagination. By fully showing the creature at the conclusion, the horrible image of the aliens in my mind had been majorly downplayed thanks to fairly standerd effects. Overall i felt that the films good moments were overshadowed by too many problems and that this movie is simply a tease of what could have been one of the most frightening films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By far the best Shyamalan Film so far.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Racing through the streets to catch the last show of opening night of Signs, I was anxious to watch the latest Shyamalan film. Night has a very unique story telling technique and this film was definitely no let down like I have heard. The film was very tense and suspenseful, and never had a dull moment. However, most ignorant and close-minded film gowers who expected to see aliens and humans have a full blow war of the worlds could not appreciate the real story Shyamalan put into this film. The best part of the film is the story of Gibson's character. The development of a character throughout a film is what keeps a movie going. As I left the theater with my heart pounding and ready to come back to the film again, I over heard remarks of the rude and unappreciative people. Bottom line. Anyone who thinks this film isn't excellent is should just stick to watching simple minded movies.Such as Austin Powers or Kung Pow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good movie, intellectual and thrilling..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs is a very good movie. I think it is the midpoint between Sixth Sense and Unbreakable as far as M.Night Shyamalan is concerned. In Sixth Sense.. The movie was greatly successful because of its thrilling story, while unbreakable had more of an intellectual debate that frustrated some seekers of thrill.. Signs is in between.. Signs is thrilling, but in the same time, Shyamalan proposes an intellectual dialog about faith, luck and pre-destination. Do things just happen or is there a plan? It's a respectable dialog though he obviously favors one side over the other.Signs is the story of a priest. Rev. Graham Hess who loses faith in his religion when his wife dies horribly in a freak accident. One that he failed to understand or accept and caused to completely reject the idea that there is any kind of guiding force guiding this world. Graham lives in a farm in a small town with two little kids and his brother who moved in after his failure in making a career in baseball.This small fragile family is immediately thrust into the events of an Alien invasion. Unlike war of the worlds and most other alien movies, this movie is not really about the aliens. This is why focusing on how and why the aliens came and how and why the aliens left is a waste of time. The movie is using this incredible event (an alien invasion) to show how this small broken family is dealing with a crisis. How the faith of the family is tested in this dilemma. Almost all the aspects of "sci-fi" and thrill in the movie can be found in other movies, but it's Shyamalar's ability to collect all these features in his movie and making them FIT. They fit perfectly. There isn't a scene when you laugh instead of being scared, I looked around the movie theatre as I watched the movie.. And when an anticipated scary moment was coming (someone is opening a door or looking through a hole) people stopped chewing their pop corn.. This is the sign of a true thrilling movie. When you don't feel that the scenes are standard clichs but actual parts of the story.As far as acting goes.. All the actors did a superb job led by Gibson. Phoenix is great and the four family members portray anguish, joy and fear with excellence. Shyamalan himself does a small role and he is a dreadful actor. Not only that, but I felt his appearance was a poor choice and broke the story a bit. Shyamalan looks Indian as it is his heritage. And it seemed very out of place to see a person of Indian origin in a supposedly very small town south of Philly. It's like casting a Native American actor to play a role in a movie about 15th century Scottland.. Makes no sense.The sound and music are very good, nothing original, but they do a good job of creeping you up.Finally, as far as Shyamalan's intellectual part of the movie.. It will fall to the individual's beliefs. Personally of course, I liked the ending because it chimed in with my beliefs, but I did feel that he made the ending too blunt and open.. He could have done it in more subtle ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget What You've Read</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've ever read any of my reviews, you know that I have a very eclectic taste in movies. You also know that I hate these "reviewers" who can't find anything good in a movie because it was made sometime after 1962. Not to mention those that feel the only good director has the initials Stanley Kubrick and every other director just copies his style.These people can't go to a movie like "Signs" without picking it apart because it "copied" other movies. It sure didn't stop you from liking "Gladiator". Face it, there are very few new ideas out there anymore, so just because a movie like "Signs" reminds you of "E.T." or "Star Trek" or "Killer Klowns From Outer Space" doesn't mean SQUAT!!!!!!!!I feel better now. Having said that, and putting my life in peril from Kubrick fans, let me say "Signs" is another masterpiece from M. Night Shyamalan...ranking up there with "Sixth Sense" "Unbreakable" and "Wide Awake". (I'm lying about "Wide Awake".)You know the story, so I won't go into details, but I will say the part of this movie that scares you is the unseen factor...a la "Blair Witch Project".This movie is funny, touching and intense. It messes with all of your emotions, sometimes at the same time...just like "Ernest Saves Christmas", "Poltergeist" and "Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama".In all seriousness, "Signs" is a fantastic movie. The actors were incredible...Leaf "Joaquin" Phoenix really surprised me in this movie. I was laughing pretty hard at some of his lines. I will tell you that this movie is not action packed, but then again, besides "Wide Awake", which M. Night movie has been action packed? Go see it and decide for yourself. ("Signs" not "Wide Awake".)p.s. I think Kubrick is a genius. There has never been a director, nor will there ever be a director that could rank up there with him. He's the Johnny Mathis of movie directors. Vaya Con Kubrick!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From reading many of the reviews here, I have noticed that many people want to rate this movie on the same scale as they have with movies like Predators and Close Encounters of the Third Kind.I suppose if you are looking for a shootem-up action movie, that might be a good selection. But consider the times we live in. This movie was released August 2002, post-9/11... an uprising of faith, patriotism, and family values seems to work its way into everything. People feel closer to this movie because it works around a small broken family in a rural setting. The actors are not overly attractive [I refuse to believe that Joaquin Phoenix is an attractive man - he looks like a thinner version of Jack Black.] It is the most unsophisticated kind of world. That is what makes such a movie successful. The Blair Witch Project was successful because it was not portrayed by actors and actresses like Halle Berry or Tom Cruise. Fear must be triggered by memory. How can one relate to something they feel could never happen to him/her personally? I don't know about anyone else reading these reviews, but I never thought I was a candidate to be hanging out with Alec Baldwin. Go figure.[Spoiler inclusion may begin here]Bo Hess. Yes, I believed she was an alien. I had this idea that perhaps everyone was wrong. It wasn't to annex the planet. It wasn't to simply kill the human race. I thought they had returned to collect what was rightfully theirs, the child. The water. The visions. The bizarre birth story.The comic relief was horrible. My friend and I sometimes mocked the audience laughing at things such as the tin foil hats or the lame "she was about to vomit on me" story.The philosophical/spiritual motif made the movie irritating at points in that it hardly exposed anything of intellectual value. Do you remember reading "A Piece of String" by Guy de Maupassant in your high school English class and discussing fatalism? I do. It's an idea that is run into the ground and deserves some air to breathe.But I guess that's what America wants. God. The need to feel safe in some headstrong force.And what was the deal with the end of the movie? The television report, "found an ancient technique to kill the aliens." Water? An ancient technique? Maybe I'm not as learned as most in world history? Are they talking about Chinese water torture? The great flood? When has water played a like role as a weapon in history? Is this some sort of biblical tale I slept through in Sunday School?The asthma bit was too Panic Room-esque. Like the girl with the diabetes. They are trapped inside a room.. child needs medicine... leaves room to obtain medicine... villian ends up capturing child.The movie also needed a better exposition. Graham Hess's brother is not properly introduced until 20 minutes into the movie. We don't really know who he is or why he is there. We don't really understand what happened to the mother until the director's cameo appearance.I also lost the initial feeling I had upon seeing the aliens after I discovered that they had claws. The footage at the children's birthday party also seemed odd because one child was speaking English to the camera. I clearly heard the word behind. It seems that if the footage was filmed in Brazil, the children would be speaking Portuguese. The dramatic music I still feel was played to take away from the fact that the alien's appearance was sort of laughable. Although I guess if I were there and such a thing were walking around my yard, I would feel frightened by its size.Even though I pick the movie apart, I still think it was a very good movie. Although it did not hold a candle to The Mothman Prophecies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This makes my list of worst movies of all time. Viewers comments here who gave it thumbs up, must simply be too young to have seen some of the greatest of all horror films, e.g., Dracula with Bela Lugosi, the original Frankenstein with Boris Karloff and many others that truly draw you into the film, making you feel you genuinely involved and hence a really scary experience. "Signs" was simply stupid, totally failed to create a "suspension of disbelief", and on the contrary made you skeptical of most of what you were seeing. The veterinarian (played by Shymalan himself) is sitting in his SUV, appears to have been shot in the belly, yet carries on a calm conversation with Mel Gibson, formerly the Reverend Hess, makes it clear he is driving to the lake (for self-preservation or for suicide?), yet the good Reverend says not a word to dissaude him, nor do we learn if he was shot, or injured in some other way, how, and by whom (aliens?). Perhaps the film did explain it, but I might have fallen asleep.Some gave the actors raves. Mel Gibson of course is a professional. The sweet little girl could rarely be understood, maybe one word in ten - yes I got the "I want a glass of water" line, but missed what her problem with the water was, and why only she could detect it. Probably dozed off again. Lost interest just about from the opening scene, would have walked out, but wanted very much to see what explanation the script would come up with for crop circles. These are a REAL phenomenon and have been the subject of attention by numerous respected scientists including physicists, agricultural experts, etc. No explanation has been found in the real world, and none at all is offered by the film. One of its great disapppointments. Clearly formed by aliens from space, but how or why or what they are supposed to indicate is left entirely to the imagination of the viewer (which is where I was before I entered the theater).I add my agreement to those who said the signs they were looking for were the red one saying EXIT, or the one saying "Refunds Available at the Box Office". Save your money!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing this so here are my thoughts...All in all I would have to say I enjoyed this movie, however the end did kind of leave me disappointed, I was expecting something a bit better. All the praise that critics have given this movie is well deserved, the whole movie basically leaves you riving in anticipation for 'what will happen next?', which is why I think the ending was kind of sketchy, it is like going up steps the whole movie, its good, then better, then really amazing, and then it ends, and when it ends, its like you just fell a few stories because the next step is so low, also, I believe that this isn't a movie you can watch again and again to understand everything, I usually love these movies, namely 'Fight Club', when everything is happening at the end, you can just say, "Okay, now I see", rather than, "what the hell does this mean?".The other thing I didn't like was seeing the alien, seeing the hands was nice, and even the quick video capture, but I would have rather just seen shadows or tinted reflections.If you are looking to see a movie, then I would recommend this, I'm giving it a 9 out of 10 because I am quite lenient on how I grade movies, but it does deserve a good rating and a good watch.Enjoy the show...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It wasn't a movie!!! It was a roller coaster ride. Everybody was flopping around and screaming, wanting to get out their seats even though they knew it was pure spooky fun.No PG13 movie has had its audience spooked-out like this since "Independence Day", another alien flick. M. Night Shaylaman's thrill-ride has us jumping out of our seats to laughing our heart out to damping up our tissues. Everything except finishing popcorn.This is a pure favorite of the summer that I would recommend a whole family to see. Yes, I know it's for teens and above, but deep down in the film's ghostly heart, there is a gentle sensitiveness towards the young ones. While Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix start the struggling pain, Abigail Breslin and Rory Culkin, brother of you-know-who, ease it.Every piece of dialogue is an essential character, while every fragment of cinematography is viewed as a piece of art, whether it is symmetry or a from an eagle's eye level.With an ending that's unlike Shaylaman's tales, you'll cry out joy and go back to the box office.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've waited for this movie since last year. I expected to learn more than I already know about crop circles and enjoy a fictional script besides. The script was ok; the entire story took place on the farm and a couple of shots in the small town. It was probably produced with not a lot more than $100,000; or so it would seem. What an opportunity to educate the general public about a fantastic yet unexplained phenomenon. No, crop circles are not created by Johnny Redneck and his tractor or sneaky mischievious friends. Crop circles have appeared in many parts of the globe and are intricate complex and awesome. The best minds cannot explain, although there are many theories, where they come from or who creates them or why.</fullReview>

It's rhythm went something like this: laugh, jump, cry, laugh, jump, cry.Mostly, I just scratched my head and wondered why I forked over ten bucks to see this nonsense."The Sixth Sense" is one of my favorite films of the 1990s. I own the DVD, and I watch it at least 6 or 7 times a year.The promise that Night showed with "Sixth Sense" has just about evaporated.As for the next Spielberg, I'm still waiting for the next Orson Welles.Now THAT would be awesome!</fullReview>

Viewers comments here who gave it thumbs up, must simply be too young to have seen some of the greatest of all horror films, e.g., Dracula with Bela Lugosi, the original Frankenstein with Boris Karloff and many others that truly draw you into the film, making you feel you genuinely involved and hence a really scary experience. "Signs" was simply stupid, totally failed to create a "suspension of disbelief", and on the contrary made you skeptical of most of what you were seeing. The veterinarian (played by Shymalan himself) is sitting in his SUV, appears to have been shot in the belly, yet carries on a calm conversation with Mel Gibson, formerly the Reverend Hess, makes it clear he is driving to the lake (for self-preservation or for suicide?), yet the good Reverend says not a word to dissaude him, nor do we learn if he was shot, or injured in some other way, how, and by whom (aliens?). Perhaps the film did explain it, but I might have fallen asleep.Some gave the actors raves. Mel Gibson of course is a professional. The sweet little girl could rarely be understood, maybe one word in ten - yes I got the "I want a glass of water" line, but missed what her problem with the water was, and why only she could detect it. Probably dozed off again. Lost interest just about from the opening scene, would have walked out, but wanted very much to see what explanation the script would come up with for crop circles. These are a REAL phenomenon and have been the subject of attention by numerous respected scientists including physicists, agricultural experts, etc. No explanation has been found in the real world, and none at all is offered by the film. One of its great disapppointments. Clearly formed by aliens from space, but how or why or what they are supposed to indicate is left entirely to the imagination of the viewer (which is where I was before I entered the theater).I add my agreement to those who said the signs they were looking for were the red one saying EXIT, or the one saying "Refunds Available at the Box Office".

		<fullReview>SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Signs is a good movie. It is entertaining with a good message. It makes you jump several times, always a good thing for a movie. My only problem with the movie is if I am an alien bent on a planet and 3/4 of the planet is deadly to me, then I might not want to visit that planet. Otherwise, go see this movie. It will entertain you. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing this so here are my thoughts...All in all I would have to say I enjoyed this movie, however the end did kind of leave me disappointed, I was expecting something a bit better. All the praise that critics have given this movie is well deserved, the whole movie basically leaves you riving in anticipation for 'what will happen next?', which is why I think the ending was kind of sketchy, it is like going up steps the whole movie, its good, then better, then really amazing, and then it ends, and when it ends, its like you just fell a few stories because the next step is so low, also, I believe that this isn't a movie you can watch again and again to understand everything, I usually love these movies, namely 'Fight Club', when everything is happening at the end, you can just say, "Okay, now I see", rather than, "what the hell does this mean?".The other thing I didn't like was seeing the alien, seeing the hands was nice, and even the quick video capture, but I would have rather just seen shadows or tinted reflections.If you are looking to see a movie, then I would recommend this, I'm giving it a 9 out of 10 because I am quite lenient on how I grade movies, but it does deserve a good rating and a good watch.Enjoy the show...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It wasn't a movie!!! It was a roller coaster ride. Everybody was flopping around and screaming, wanting to get out their seats even though they knew it was pure spooky fun.No PG13 movie has had its audience spooked-out like this since "Independence Day", another alien flick. M. Night Shaylaman's thrill-ride has us jumping out of our seats to laughing our heart out to damping up our tissues. Everything except finishing popcorn.This is a pure favorite of the summer that I would recommend a whole family to see. Yes, I know it's for teens and above, but deep down in the film's ghostly heart, there is a gentle sensitiveness towards the young ones. While Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix start the struggling pain, Abigail Breslin and Rory Culkin, brother of you-know-who, ease it.Every piece of dialogue is an essential character, while every fragment of cinematography is viewed as a piece of art, whether it is symmetry or a from an eagle's eye level.With an ending that's unlike Shaylaman's tales, you'll cry out joy and go back to the box office.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've waited for this movie since last year. I expected to learn more than I already know about crop circles and enjoy a fictional script besides. The script was ok; the entire story took place on the farm and a couple of shots in the small town. It was probably produced with not a lot more than $100,000; or so it would seem. What an opportunity to educate the general public about a fantastic yet unexplained phenomenon. No, crop circles are not created by Johnny Redneck and his tractor or sneaky mischievious friends. Crop circles have appeared in many parts of the globe and are intricate complex and awesome. The best minds cannot explain, although there are many theories, where they come from or who creates them or why.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The next Spielberg?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So M. Night Shyamalan is being compared to Steven Spielberg. Well, if you consider that he spends tens of millions to make mediocre garbage, then I agree."Signs" was nothing but an exercise in audience manipulation. It's rhythm went something like this: laugh, jump, cry, laugh, jump, cry.Mostly, I just scratched my head and wondered why I forked over ten bucks to see this nonsense."The Sixth Sense" is one of my favorite films of the 1990s. I own the DVD, and I watch it at least 6 or 7 times a year.The promise that Night showed with "Sixth Sense" has just about evaporated.As for the next Spielberg, I'm still waiting for the next Orson Welles.Now THAT would be awesome!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From reading many of the reviews here, I have noticed that many people want to rate this movie on the same scale as they have with movies like Predators and Close Encounters of the Third Kind.I suppose if you are looking for a shootem-up action movie, that might be a good selection. But consider the times we live in. This movie was released August 2002, post-9/11... an uprising of faith, patriotism, and family values seems to work its way into everything. People feel closer to this movie because it works around a small broken family in a rural setting. The actors are not overly attractive [I refuse to believe that Joaquin Phoenix is an attractive man - he looks like a thinner version of Jack Black.] It is the most unsophisticated kind of world. That is what makes such a movie successful. The Blair Witch Project was successful because it was not portrayed by actors and actresses like Halle Berry or Tom Cruise. Fear must be triggered by memory. How can one relate to something they feel could never happen to him/her personally? I don't know about anyone else reading these reviews, but I never thought I was a candidate to be hanging out with Alec Baldwin. Go figure.[Spoiler inclusion may begin here]Bo Hess. Yes, I believed she was an alien. I had this idea that perhaps everyone was wrong. It wasn't to annex the planet. It wasn't to simply kill the human race. I thought they had returned to collect what was rightfully theirs, the child. The water. The visions. The bizarre birth story.The comic relief was horrible. My friend and I sometimes mocked the audience laughing at things such as the tin foil hats or the lame "she was about to vomit on me" story.The philosophical/spiritual motif made the movie irritating at points in that it hardly exposed anything of intellectual value. Do you remember reading "A Piece of String" by Guy de Maupassant in your high school English class and discussing fatalism? I do. It's an idea that is run into the ground and deserves some air to breathe.But I guess that's what America wants. God. The need to feel safe in some headstrong force.And what was the deal with the end of the movie? The television report, "found an ancient technique to kill the aliens." Water? An ancient technique? Maybe I'm not as learned as most in world history? Are they talking about Chinese water torture? The great flood? When has water played a like role as a weapon in history? Is this some sort of biblical tale I slept through in Sunday School?The asthma bit was too Panic Room-esque. Like the girl with the diabetes. They are trapped inside a room.. child needs medicine... leaves room to obtain medicine... villian ends up capturing child.The movie also needed a better exposition. Graham Hess's brother is not properly introduced until 20 minutes into the movie. We don't really know who he is or why he is there. We don't really understand what happened to the mother until the director's cameo appearance.I also lost the initial feeling I had upon seeing the aliens after I discovered that they had claws. The footage at the children's birthday party also seemed odd because one child was speaking English to the camera. I clearly heard the word behind. It seems that if the footage was filmed in Brazil, the children would be speaking Portuguese. The dramatic music I still feel was played to take away from the fact that the alien's appearance was sort of laughable. Although I guess if I were there and such a thing were walking around my yard, I would feel frightened by its size.Even though I pick the movie apart, I still think it was a very good movie. Although it did not hold a candle to The Mothman Prophecies.</fullReview>

Everybody was flopping around and screaming, wanting to get out their seats even though they knew it was pure spooky fun.No PG13 movie has had its audience spooked-out like this since "Independence Day", another alien flick. M. Night Shaylaman's thrill-ride has us jumping out of our seats to laughing our heart out to damping up our tissues. Everything except finishing popcorn.This is a pure favorite of the summer that I would recommend a whole family to see. Yes, I know it's for teens and above, but deep down in the film's ghostly heart, there is a gentle sensitiveness towards the young ones. While Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix start the struggling pain, Abigail Breslin and Rory Culkin, brother of you-know-who, ease it.Every piece of dialogue is an essential character, while every fragment of cinematography is viewed as a piece of art, whether it is symmetry or a from an eagle's eye level.With an ending that's unlike Shaylaman's tales, you'll cry out joy and go back to the box office.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've waited for this movie since last year. I expected to learn more than I already know about crop circles and enjoy a fictional script besides. The script was ok; the entire story took place on the farm and a couple of shots in the small town. It was probably produced with not a lot more than $100,000; or so it would seem. What an opportunity to educate the general public about a fantastic yet unexplained phenomenon. No, crop circles are not created by Johnny Redneck and his tractor or sneaky mischievious friends. Crop circles have appeared in many parts of the globe and are intricate complex and awesome. The best minds cannot explain, although there are many theories, where they come from or who creates them or why.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The next Spielberg?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So M. Night Shyamalan is being compared to Steven Spielberg. Well, if you consider that he spends tens of millions to make mediocre garbage, then I agree."Signs" was nothing but an exercise in audience manipulation. It's rhythm went something like this: laugh, jump, cry, laugh, jump, cry.Mostly, I just scratched my head and wondered why I forked over ten bucks to see this nonsense."The Sixth Sense" is one of my favorite films of the 1990s. I own the DVD, and I watch it at least 6 or 7 times a year.The promise that Night showed with "Sixth Sense" has just about evaporated.As for the next Spielberg, I'm still waiting for the next Orson Welles.Now THAT would be awesome!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From reading many of the reviews here, I have noticed that many people want to rate this movie on the same scale as they have with movies like Predators and Close Encounters of the Third Kind.I suppose if you are looking for a shootem-up action movie, that might be a good selection. But consider the times we live in. This movie was released August 2002, post-9/11... an uprising of faith, patriotism, and family values seems to work its way into everything. People feel closer to this movie because it works around a small broken family in a rural setting. The actors are not overly attractive [I refuse to believe that Joaquin Phoenix is an attractive man - he looks like a thinner version of Jack Black.] It is the most unsophisticated kind of world. That is what makes such a movie successful. The Blair Witch Project was successful because it was not portrayed by actors and actresses like Halle Berry or Tom Cruise. Fear must be triggered by memory. How can one relate to something they feel could never happen to him/her personally? I don't know about anyone else reading these reviews, but I never thought I was a candidate to be hanging out with Alec Baldwin. Go figure.[Spoiler inclusion may begin here]Bo Hess. Yes, I believed she was an alien. I had this idea that perhaps everyone was wrong. It wasn't to annex the planet. It wasn't to simply kill the human race. I thought they had returned to collect what was rightfully theirs, the child. The water. The visions. The bizarre birth story.The comic relief was horrible. My friend and I sometimes mocked the audience laughing at things such as the tin foil hats or the lame "she was about to vomit on me" story.The philosophical/spiritual motif made the movie irritating at points in that it hardly exposed anything of intellectual value. Do you remember reading "A Piece of String" by Guy de Maupassant in your high school English class and discussing fatalism? I do. It's an idea that is run into the ground and deserves some air to breathe.But I guess that's what America wants. God. The need to feel safe in some headstrong force.And what was the deal with the end of the movie? The television report, "found an ancient technique to kill the aliens." Water? An ancient technique? Maybe I'm not as learned as most in world history? Are they talking about Chinese water torture? The great flood? When has water played a like role as a weapon in history? Is this some sort of biblical tale I slept through in Sunday School?The asthma bit was too Panic Room-esque. Like the girl with the diabetes. They are trapped inside a room.. child needs medicine... leaves room to obtain medicine... villian ends up capturing child.The movie also needed a better exposition. Graham Hess's brother is not properly introduced until 20 minutes into the movie. We don't really know who he is or why he is there. We don't really understand what happened to the mother until the director's cameo appearance.I also lost the initial feeling I had upon seeing the aliens after I discovered that they had claws. The footage at the children's birthday party also seemed odd because one child was speaking English to the camera. I clearly heard the word behind. It seems that if the footage was filmed in Brazil, the children would be speaking Portuguese. The dramatic music I still feel was played to take away from the fact that the alien's appearance was sort of laughable. Although I guess if I were there and such a thing were walking around my yard, I would feel frightened by its size.Even though I pick the movie apart, I still think it was a very good movie. Although it did not hold a candle to The Mothman Prophecies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This makes my list of worst movies of all time. Viewers comments here who gave it thumbs up, must simply be too young to have seen some of the greatest of all horror films, e.g., Dracula with Bela Lugosi, the original Frankenstein with Boris Karloff and many others that truly draw you into the film, making you feel you genuinely involved and hence a really scary experience. "Signs" was simply stupid, totally failed to create a "suspension of disbelief", and on the contrary made you skeptical of most of what you were seeing. The veterinarian (played by Shymalan himself) is sitting in his SUV, appears to have been shot in the belly, yet carries on a calm conversation with Mel Gibson, formerly the Reverend Hess, makes it clear he is driving to the lake (for self-preservation or for suicide?), yet the good Reverend says not a word to dissaude him, nor do we learn if he was shot, or injured in some other way, how, and by whom (aliens?). Perhaps the film did explain it, but I might have fallen asleep.Some gave the actors raves. Mel Gibson of course is a professional. The sweet little girl could rarely be understood, maybe one word in ten - yes I got the "I want a glass of water" line, but missed what her problem with the water was, and why only she could detect it. Probably dozed off again. Lost interest just about from the opening scene, would have walked out, but wanted very much to see what explanation the script would come up with for crop circles. These are a REAL phenomenon and have been the subject of attention by numerous respected scientists including physicists, agricultural experts, etc. No explanation has been found in the real world, and none at all is offered by the film. One of its great disapppointments. Clearly formed by aliens from space, but how or why or what they are supposed to indicate is left entirely to the imagination of the viewer (which is where I was before I entered the theater).I add my agreement to those who said the signs they were looking for were the red one saying EXIT, or the one saying "Refunds Available at the Box Office".

		<fullReview>SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Signs is a good movie. It is entertaining with a good message. It makes you jump several times, always a good thing for a movie. My only problem with the movie is if I am an alien bent on a planet and 3/4 of the planet is deadly to me, then I might not want to visit that planet. Otherwise, go see this movie.

		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing this so here are my thoughts...All in all I would have to say I enjoyed this movie, however the end did kind of leave me disappointed, I was expecting something a bit better. All the praise that critics have given this movie is well deserved, the whole movie basically leaves you riving in anticipation for 'what will happen next?', which is why I think the ending was kind of sketchy, it is like going up steps the whole movie, its good, then better, then really amazing, and then it ends, and when it ends, its like you just fell a few stories because the next step is so low, also, I believe that this isn't a movie you can watch again and again to understand everything, I usually love these movies, namely 'Fight Club', when everything is happening at the end, you can just say, "Okay, now I see", rather than, "what the hell does this mean?".The other thing I didn't like was seeing the alien, seeing the hands was nice, and even the quick video capture, but I would have rather just seen shadows or tinted reflections.If you are looking to see a movie, then I would recommend this, I'm giving it a 9 out of 10 because I am quite lenient on how I grade movies, but it does deserve a good rating and a good watch.Enjoy the show...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got back from seeing this so here are my thoughts...All in all I would have to say I enjoyed this movie, however the end did kind of leave me disappointed, I was expecting something a bit better. All the praise that critics have given this movie is well deserved, the whole movie basically leaves you riving in anticipation for 'what will happen next?', which is why I think the ending was kind of sketchy, it is like going up steps the whole movie, its good, then better, then really amazing, and then it ends, and when it ends, its like you just fell a few stories because the next step is so low, also, I believe that this isn't a movie you can watch again and again to understand everything, I usually love these movies, namely 'Fight Club', when everything is happening at the end, you can just say, "Okay, now I see", rather than, "what the hell does this mean?".The other thing I didn't like was seeing the alien, seeing the hands was nice, and even the quick video capture, but I would have rather just seen shadows or tinted reflections.If you are looking to see a movie, then I would recommend this, I'm giving it a 9 out of 10 because I am quite lenient on how I grade movies, but it does deserve a good rating and a good watch.Enjoy the show...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing - A 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate so many movies lately and haven't rated a movie a '10' since The Matrix (favorite). This movie cycled through my emotions of fear, anger, sadness, joy, and laughter. I was actually expecting a dramatic, perhaps slower paced Unbreakable type, but was pleasantly surprised at the excitement this movie delivers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It wasn't a movie!!! It was a roller coaster ride. Everybody was flopping around and screaming, wanting to get out their seats even though they knew it was pure spooky fun.No PG13 movie has had its audience spooked-out like this since "Independence Day", another alien flick. M. Night Shaylaman's thrill-ride has us jumping out of our seats to laughing our heart out to damping up our tissues. Everything except finishing popcorn.This is a pure favorite of the summer that I would recommend a whole family to see. Yes, I know it's for teens and above, but deep down in the film's ghostly heart, there is a gentle sensitiveness towards the young ones. While Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix start the struggling pain, Abigail Breslin and Rory Culkin, brother of you-know-who, ease it.Every piece of dialogue is an essential character, while every fragment of cinematography is viewed as a piece of art, whether it is symmetry or a from an eagle's eye level.With an ending that's unlike Shaylaman's tales, you'll cry out joy and go back to the box office.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've waited for this movie since last year. I expected to learn more than I already know about crop circles and enjoy a fictional script besides. The script was ok; the entire story took place on the farm and a couple of shots in the small town. It was probably produced with not a lot more than $100,000; or so it would seem. What an opportunity to educate the general public about a fantastic yet unexplained phenomenon. No, crop circles are not created by Johnny Redneck and his tractor or sneaky mischievious friends. Crop circles have appeared in many parts of the globe and are intricate complex and awesome. The best minds cannot explain, although there are many theories, where they come from or who creates them or why.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Signs" is a multi-demensional film that isn't what it first may seem. Mel Gibson is given one of his most challenging roles here and delivers quite well. What presents itself as a 25 year remake of Spielburg's "Close in counters" builds itself to be much more than just a movie about alien contact. This movie explores deep spiritual issues while providing enough sci-fi jargon for the most rabid fans of the supernatural. There are plenty of "jumps" to keep you on the edge of your seat also. Some scenes of the film at first seem a bit awkward but by movies end, all elements of previous dialogue are tied together to underline the film's main theme. This movie will be pleasing to people of many different tastes and is unique, even if Mel Gibson doesn't build a gigantic clay mountain in his living room.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another M. Night gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading through the preceding comments it strikes me that many people are evaluating this film on what it's not. It's "not as good as Sixth Sense" or it's "not really about alien invasions and crop circles" or it's "not an action film like Independence Day" (--for which we should all be thanking our preferred version of the Supreme Being, in my opinion!) And many more are missing points that are perfectly clear (ahem: the reason Gibson's character doesn't want to use cusswords is because he was a minister, not because he's incapable of rage: his outburst to his kids later on is *perfectly* believable).--I don't know what movie all these folks saw, but the one I saw was one of the best this year, and doesn't need to apologize for anything it's not.The phrase that keeps coming to my mind is Fox Mulder's "I want to believe." So much of this movie is about belief and faith, about people's willingness--and unwillingness--to believe. Graham Hess' loss of his wife has caused him to lose his faith, not only in God, but in life; he can't believe. Little Morgan unhesitatingly accepts a writer's speculations about the nature and intent of the alien invaders; he needs to believe. People around the world take shelter (as in the classic War of the Worlds, which is referenced) in places of worship. But M. Night is not leading us toward religious faith only, but toward a much wider sense that "there are no coincidences" --that there is reason to believe in fate, destiny, a vast and mysterious web that connects even the most seemingly unconnected details.There is tremendous build-up of fear and suspense, and a surprisingly large dose of humor (Gibson in particular does topnotch work in that regard: I loved his "Raar! I'm insane with rage!" routine as he tries to intimidate what he thinks are trespassers, and his speech to the pantry door). The depiction of one family's response to a worldwide crisis --barricade yourselves indoors, devour reference books and watch CNN 20 hours a day; heck, I know I would--was completely believable. But the real process of the film is Graham's slow re-examination of his wife's death, especially of her last words, and his eventual understanding that they meant much more than they seemed to mean; that there really are no coincidences, and that even this seemingly random tragedy was a sign, with great meaning and gifts to give. It's not a head-snapping twist ending like the ones in Sixth Sense and Unbreakable (OK, there, even I did it =), but just as profound and breathtaking in its implications. And that's not even mentioning the superb craft of the film itself, its sheer no-background-noise silence in which the least sound is magnified, its shadows and subtlety and use of patterns in everyday life to convey the sense of signs all around us. (--dig the curtains and the doorframe; dig the test pattern Merrill sees on the TV when all channels have ceased broadcasting; does any station in the USA still use those? but you know M. Night couldn't resist using it because of its wonderful arcane look, like a crop circle itself, or some sort of mystical sigil...)From my new favorite director, a gem that deserves your attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tense and satisfying movie-going experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The roots of Signs run deep. It's hard to shake the feeling of Howard Hawk's The Thing, the claustrophobic fear of Night of the Living Dead, or the menace of War of the Worlds. It's all there in modern, restrained style. It's a commentary on our world that most of the fear of alien encounters comes to us over TV sets in this story. The twists and surprises make this film difficult to write about, but rest assured that every second is riveting. The thrill of fifties horror and sci-fi films has faded due to current day action and demand for high-tech effects....but to Shyamalan's credit this present day genre film creates a mood and thrill not felt in many decades. Not to be overlooked, the past meets the present in a breathtaking fashion in Signs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A controversial subject to say the least. This Movie had all the right "signs" for making you want to see it. VERY Interesting trailers that did not disappoint you once you sit in front of the big screen and watch it unfold.Everyone, including the Kids, were EXCELLENT! What a different role for Mel. At first it was hard to understand why he seemed obtuse in his responses to others- the Sheriff and his Brother. Then you learn what he and his family have been going through and where he's coming from. The plot seemed slow at first then just rolled along. You ask yourself where are they going with this? Hoax, Spoof, or some new variation. M. Night did such a great job weaving this tail, doing some very convincing cameo work and what an ending. No Big Sci-Fi Effects blockbuster. A mind teaser and keep you on the edge of your seat experience. Would see it again gladly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>PLAY-LIKE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS AHEAD!!! SIGNS is like a filmed play. Basically it all takes place on one set, with four actors. Low budget for sure. Twilight Zone-budget, as in cardboard. Is it a sci-fi film? Well, there are definitely aliens in it and the suggestion of an alien invasion of the planet. There is also a knock-down, drag-out fight with a big bad alien near the end. (Anyone who tells you the director never clearly shows the aliens in this movie must have been in the bathroom during the climatic fight.) Is it a spiritual movie? That it is, as former minister Mel tries to regain his faith after his wife's death. Is it a comedy? It may well be, intentionally or otherwise. There are certainly some funny lines that suggest the director did not take his own material all that seriously. Is it a horror film? Parts of it most certainly are, especially a scene in the cellar, which plays like a poor man's BLAIR WITCH or NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Is it worth seeing? Yes, but in the comfort of your home, as a $3 or $4 rental. By the way, this Hitchcock-influenced director insists ons sticking himself in a very crucial scene, and blows it badly. And make no mistake: Gibson is not particularly effective in this. This is not an action role, and he not terribly convincing. He plays it much the way a wooden Harrison Ford stumbled through his role in WHAT LIES BENEATH. SIGNS is simply not Gibson's type of movie. Worse, he plays a father to two very young children, when he is clearly old enough to be their grandpaw.</fullReview>

All the acting is first rate - Gibson is amazing in his role as the ex-minister, and Joaquin Phoenix does a competent job. The kids are amazing - Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin rock as Gibson's children. The little girl is cute as hell! You gotta admire the way the young director interperses the tension with the humor.Certain Shyamalan trademarks: Reflection images, flashbacks, the whole noir touch... this guy is way ahead of the field. **Spoilers** First off, we only get hints of the aliens throughout the movie, we hardly see them until the end. There's suspense and excitement throughout. Night keeps the focus on the family of Fr. Hess and the way they react to the unworldly happenings around them.8/10 easy.</fullReview>

The horror of impending doom surrounded around aliens and crop circles throughout the film, all of which that is pressured on the main characters family make the watcher scared of the next scene. You may have a guess as to what will happen next, but the movie does a good job of cutting curious predictions to a minimum.The plot is not cheesy, in fact it is very believable. Phoenix, and Gibson do great jobs in their acting of two brothers fighting against fear. Overall, the best movie I have seen in a while, and I hope for more of M. Night's magic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a review intended for the people who have already seen M. Night Shaylamans's SIGNS. If you haven't seen this film, I urge you to go out and see it. And don't continue reading this review as it will ruin the movie for you starting in the third sentence, and throughout.Signs is a somewhat misleading movie, meaning I went in expecting one thing and came out still digesting something completely different.

		<fullReview>After the great movie "The 6th Sense" and an even better movie, "Unbreakable", the next movie from "the next Speilberg" (a line that Newsweek stole from me) was bound to be heavily anticipated and with "Signs" M. Night Shyamalan stumbles. "Signs" isn't a major misfire from this major talent, but it certainly misses its mark. This is the year's 2nd major dissappointment (Star Wars II ranking alongside of it). It is a beautifully mounted film with a great message that says that nothing is accidental. The shocks are "Boo!" B-movie variety, the acting is constricted by the weight gloom and doom yhat pervades the movie and I wonder if the X-Files hadn't been canceled if the aliens would have been available to work on this movie. Until the very end it never involved me emotionally the way Night's previous 2 movies had. The acting is a major problem. I felt that Mel Gibson (an excellent actor and a very powerful one) and Joaquin Phoenix were straitjacketed by their director. Their was really no catharsis. The buildup was never delivered. If this movie was "CE3K" we needed a mothership scene. If this movie was "War Of The Worlds" we needed a major destruction set piece. In "Unbreakable" Night pulled back from showing us a horrendous train crash, but he got a way with it because it almost began the movie. "Signs" doesn't give the big set piece that we so desparately awaited. A lot of things that "Unbreakable"'s detractors said were wrong that movie are evident here. I also think that we needed to see Graham's wife's death in its entirety at the start of this movie rather than in flashbacks, because too late in this movie do you really feel his pain. A few months (or years) from now I think "Signs" will be viewed like Speilberg's "1941" as not being a bad movie but also as being a not very good one either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my view the best alien movie I have ever seen, all of which flows from the suspense of the movie. M. Night does a fantastic job in creating a story and using the "sign" myth to make a good movie. The horror of impending doom surrounded around aliens and crop circles throughout the film, all of which that is pressured on the main characters family make the watcher scared of the next scene. You may have a guess as to what will happen next, but the movie does a good job of cutting curious predictions to a minimum.The plot is not cheesy, in fact it is very believable. Phoenix, and Gibson do great jobs in their acting of two brothers fighting against fear. Overall, the best movie I have seen in a while, and I hope for more of M. Night's magic.</fullReview>

This was a really great movie. The plot comes together so well at the end, the acting and directing were flawless and the movie really builds very well from a rather slow beginning to an exciting climax.

B-movie variety, the acting is constricted by the weight gloom and doom yhat pervades the movie and I wonder if the X-Files hadn't been canceled if the aliens would have been available to work on this movie. Until the very end it never involved me emotionally the way Night's previous 2 movies had. The acting is a major problem. I felt that Mel Gibson (an excellent actor and a very powerful one) and Joaquin Phoenix were straitjacketed by their director. Their was really no catharsis. The buildup was never delivered. If this movie was "CE3K" we needed a mothership scene. If this movie was "War Of The Worlds" we needed a major destruction set piece. In "Unbreakable" Night pulled back from showing us a horrendous train crash, but he got a way with it because it almost began the movie. "Signs" doesn't give the big set piece that we so desparately awaited. A lot of things that "Unbreakable"'s detractors said were wrong that movie are evident here. I also think that we needed to see Graham's wife's death in its entirety at the start of this movie rather than in flashbacks, because too late in this movie do you really feel his pain. A few months (or years) from now I think "Signs" will be viewed like Speilberg's "1941" as not being a bad movie but also as being a not very good one either.</fullReview>

The horror of impending doom surrounded around aliens and crop circles throughout the film, all of which that is pressured on the main characters family make the watcher scared of the next scene. You may have a guess as to what will happen next, but the movie does a good job of cutting curious predictions to a minimum.The plot is not cheesy, in fact it is very believable. Phoenix, and Gibson do great jobs in their acting of two brothers fighting against fear. Overall, the best movie I have seen in a while, and I hope for more of M. Night's magic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a review intended for the people who have already seen M. Night Shaylamans's SIGNS. If you haven't seen this film, I urge you to go out and see it. And don't continue reading this review as it will ruin the movie for you starting in the third sentence, and throughout.Signs is a somewhat misleading movie, meaning I went in expecting one thing and came out still digesting something completely different. At first I didn't like what I saw. I was perplexed and dissapointed in the scene in which the straggler Alien attacks the family, and I was pretty angry about the whole Christianity message that I got out the conclusion. "Did someone save me?" "Yeah, I think someone did." Retch. Vomit. Chunks. Then I looked a little harder and realized that M. Night was trying to appeal to the two different kinds of viewing audiences. The ones that he talks about in the film. Atheists and Faithfuls. Non-believers and believers in a higher power called God. However, even if the ending was a little offputting, it did not ruin the entire film for me. However, I pretty much paid 8.50 to go see a sci-fi movie with a wicked and hopefully disturbing twist at the end. There was no twist. There was only...I don't know, a cheap self realization that the movie seemed to take on at the very end that encouraged the viewer to look at it as a specimen instead of experience it as a story. I don't really feel like trekking through the entire film again just to find all the SIGNS that M. Night slipped in there for the geeks. If for any reason I was to watch the film a second time, it would be for the performances of the actors, and the quirky dark humour that makes the film so enjoyable. The movie theatre was packed when I went to see this film opening day, and I was surprised at how much laughter resonated through the dark, air conditioned temple of celluloid. No really, I mean everyone laughed real hard during the intentionally funny parts, but there was louder laughter during the unintentionally funny parts. At least I think they were unintentional. I look at reviews written by some of the SMART, SMART reviewers and cinema buffs at Ainticoolnews.com, and I hear them writing about how much the Brazillian Birthday scene shook them and frightened them. I even remember one reviewer drawing a comparison to 9\11 footage and how Phoenix's reaction reminded him of his own. However, in the theatre, when that blurry green figure lurches onto the television screen and the soundtrack drops a painfully intentional LOUD ORCHESTRA CLUSTER OF NOISE THAT IS ENGINEERED TO MAKE YOU JUMP the entire room was filled with hysterical laughter. Strange, was it really supposed to be that funny? I thought it was. Mel Gibson is good here, real good. He's funny, sad, and shows great emotions. Those ticks of sadness that burst onto his face when the bi-section of his wife really hits home (when he is talking to M. Night and the man apologizes to him, at the dinner table near the end of the film) I really felt for his character. Rory Culkin. I like him much more than young Macauly, he's much more mature, probabley because he was bred to make those parents more money and has been in acting camp since he popped out the womb. The little girl who plays Bo is horribley adorable, but not in an annoying way in the least bit she handled the subject matter amazingly and delivered her lines better than Rory. She is genuinely sweet. Phoenix blisters with talent, nearly stealing the entire show. Everyone else is pretty much cardboard, including the director who I wasn't too impressed with as an actor, but he wrote a great punchline for himself. A friend joked that M. Night had actually captured an alien in his cabinet and decided to write a movie about it. Perhaps...he's a strange guy. You can just sort of tell. So overall, even though it didn't follow the twist ending formula to a T the way Unbreakable did...it was still good. The ending was marred by the religious message that I GUESS can be interpreted as a string of coincidence(if you're going to be that NAIVE, Signs seems to scream) but the dark humour and general creepiness of most of the first half (except for the unintentionally halarious moments where Shaylaman takes himself a bit too seriously) and worth seeing in a theatre above all other places. Chirp. Whirr. Roar. Goodbye.</fullReview>

There are laughs, plenty of suspense (several times it makes you "jump"), a great cast and location . . . but if what you're wanting to see is a space-alien-invasion-type movie, you might be disappointed.

		<fullReview>This movie...oh my goodness! It was absolutely wonderful! Let's just say that I had to hunker down in my seat and put my feet up in the seat with me because I was so scared. To me, this movie contained just about every element to play with a person's fears; dark places, the unknown, sightings, children that say creepy things, and CORN FIELDS...eeeeek! I'm getting scared just recalling it. Once again, this movie is a must for any freaky movie lover.</fullReview>

I found my self glued to the movie screen, I mean this is actually a movie that is worth the $7.50 movie ticket. Mel Gibson's performance is just excellent. You never see Mel is a bad film. Well,maybe Lethal Weapon 4,but anyways. If you want to see a good suspense film, this would be the good choice. It will keep you shocked and suprised at every corner. It has to be with of the years finest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Signs" was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. There are laughs, plenty of suspense (several times it makes you "jump"), a great cast and location . . . but if what you're wanting to see is a space-alien-invasion-type movie, you might be disappointed. Of all the comments I've heard, the few that didn't like the movie missed the whole point.I'd say go see it; pay attention and it just might make your day! I know it did mine. I give "Signs" a definite 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the great movie "The 6th Sense" and an even better movie, "Unbreakable", the next movie from "the next Speilberg" (a line that Newsweek stole from me) was bound to be heavily anticipated and with "Signs" M. Night Shyamalan stumbles. "Signs" isn't a major misfire from this major talent, but it certainly misses its mark. This is the year's 2nd major dissappointment (Star Wars II ranking alongside of it). It is a beautifully mounted film with a great message that says that nothing is accidental. The shocks are "Boo!" B-movie variety, the acting is constricted by the weight gloom and doom yhat pervades the movie and I wonder if the X-Files hadn't been canceled if the aliens would have been available to work on this movie. Until the very end it never involved me emotionally the way Night's previous 2 movies had. The acting is a major problem. I felt that Mel Gibson (an excellent actor and a very powerful one) and Joaquin Phoenix were straitjacketed by their director. Their was really no catharsis. The buildup was never delivered. If this movie was "CE3K" we needed a mothership scene. If this movie was "War Of The Worlds" we needed a major destruction set piece. In "Unbreakable" Night pulled back from showing us a horrendous train crash, but he got a way with it because it almost began the movie. "Signs" doesn't give the big set piece that we so desparately awaited. A lot of things that "Unbreakable"'s detractors said were wrong that movie are evident here. I also think that we needed to see Graham's wife's death in its entirety at the start of this movie rather than in flashbacks, because too late in this movie do you really feel his pain. A few months (or years) from now I think "Signs" will be viewed like Speilberg's "1941" as not being a bad movie but also as being a not very good one either.</fullReview>

You may have a guess as to what will happen next, but the movie does a good job of cutting curious predictions to a minimum.The plot is not cheesy, in fact it is very believable.

		<fullReview>This is a review intended for the people who have already seen M. Night Shaylamans's SIGNS. If you haven't seen this film, I urge you to go out and see it. And don't continue reading this review as it will ruin the movie for you starting in the third sentence, and throughout.Signs is a somewhat misleading movie, meaning I went in expecting one thing and came out still digesting something completely different. At first I didn't like what I saw. I was perplexed and dissapointed in the scene in which the straggler Alien attacks the family, and I was pretty angry about the whole Christianity message that I got out the conclusion. "Did someone save me?" "Yeah, I think someone did." Retch. Vomit. Chunks. Then I looked a little harder and realized that M. Night was trying to appeal to the two different kinds of viewing audiences. The ones that he talks about in the film. Atheists and Faithfuls. Non-believers and believers in a higher power called God. However, even if the ending was a little offputting, it did not ruin the entire film for me. However, I pretty much paid 8.50 to go see a sci-fi movie with a wicked and hopefully disturbing twist at the end. There was no twist. There was only...I don't know, a cheap self realization that the movie seemed to take on at the very end that encouraged the viewer to look at it as a specimen instead of experience it as a story. I don't really feel like trekking through the entire film again just to find all the SIGNS that M. Night slipped in there for the geeks. If for any reason I was to watch the film a second time, it would be for the performances of the actors, and the quirky dark humour that makes the film so enjoyable. The movie theatre was packed when I went to see this film opening day, and I was surprised at how much laughter resonated through the dark, air conditioned temple of celluloid. No really, I mean everyone laughed real hard during the intentionally funny parts, but there was louder laughter during the unintentionally funny parts. At least I think they were unintentional. I look at reviews written by some of the SMART, SMART reviewers and cinema buffs at Ainticoolnews.com, and I hear them writing about how much the Brazillian Birthday scene shook them and frightened them. I even remember one reviewer drawing a comparison to 9\11 footage and how Phoenix's reaction reminded him of his own. However, in the theatre, when that blurry green figure lurches onto the television screen and the soundtrack drops a painfully intentional LOUD ORCHESTRA CLUSTER OF NOISE THAT IS ENGINEERED TO MAKE YOU JUMP the entire room was filled with hysterical laughter. Strange, was it really supposed to be that funny? I thought it was. Mel Gibson is good here, real good. He's funny, sad, and shows great emotions. Those ticks of sadness that burst onto his face when the bi-section of his wife really hits home (when he is talking to M. Night and the man apologizes to him, at the dinner table near the end of the film) I really felt for his character. Rory Culkin. I like him much more than young Macauly, he's much more mature, probabley because he was bred to make those parents more money and has been in acting camp since he popped out the womb. The little girl who plays Bo is horribley adorable, but not in an annoying way in the least bit she handled the subject matter amazingly and delivered her lines better than Rory. She is genuinely sweet. Phoenix blisters with talent, nearly stealing the entire show. Everyone else is pretty much cardboard, including the director who I wasn't too impressed with as an actor, but he wrote a great punchline for himself. A friend joked that M.

So overall, even though it didn't follow the twist ending formula to a T the way Unbreakable did...it was still good. The ending was marred by the religious message that I GUESS can be interpreted as a string of coincidence(if you're going to be that NAIVE, Signs seems to scream) but the dark humour and general creepiness of most of the first half (except for the unintentionally halarious moments where Shaylaman takes himself a bit too seriously) and worth seeing in a theatre above all other places.

		<fullReview>I simply cannot describe how amazing this movie is. I was never a big M. Night Shymalan fan, I hated the Sixth Sense, I found that to be boring and predictable. I liked Unbreakable, because of it's unusual plot line.I was however interested in Signs from the beginning, because I'm a Mel Gibson fan, and because I've always been fascinated by crop circles. Still the fact that it was Shymalan held back my enthusiasm. I'm glad to say my fears were misguided and I'm now a huge Shymalan fan.This is the first movie that I've ever seen that I personally can say was an emotional roller coaster, it's hilarious, terrifying, heartbreaking, and thought-provoking in the same instant. All the performances are top-notch, especially the little girl that plays Bo Hess, for such a young age she is a wonderful actress.This film has surpassed The Crow to become my all time favorite movie. I really can give no higher recommendation then that. Go see,now, trust me, you'll be glad you listened.</fullReview>

The only thing scary about this film was that it would go on too long. Too many things were out of sync and to many more were senseless. It seemed as though this innovative Director may have run out of ideas as there was nothing refreshing or original to be found in Signs.Possible spoilers: Aliens bright enough to construct spacecraft but needing crop circles to identify gathering points. Are you kidding? Aliens raiding a planet where water is acid to them? Huh? I mean the Triffids had no choice did they? Aliens with high technology and no small arms. Aliens 'harvesting ' vis a vis " How To Serve Man " from The Outer Limits. Mel's character called Father but not Catholic!? What planet was this taking place on? Not a gun to be found anywhere!?

Everywhere I looked, I saw that stupid alien on the roof!!!! AHHHH!!!! And the alien walking across the alley (okay i KNEW that that was going to happen, but when that thing popped out i was so F'IN SCARED!!!) and the alien reflected in the TV. I think i almost peed my pants. I didn't know what to expect at that point, and when he rolled out the TV and there was the alien, squatting down in defense mode, and then the reflection of Joaquin walking into the room and dropping the insulin thingsOkay, calming down now. It was just such a good movie and some of the reviews here are like, it was horrible. How can you think that? I don't know, maybe it's more of a movie for the imaginative, but GOD was it SCARY!!!!Joaquin Phoenix gave one of his best performances, in my opinion, and Abigail Breslin (such a cutie!), shared a partnership with him as the two comic reliefs of the movie. Abigail was more cute than funny, although she did crack me up when she said "Why can't they get boyfriends?" and "This is serious!", but Joaquin's character was just, hilarious, and fearless. I noticed that he was the one that did everything, that boarded the walls, walked up the stairs when an alien could attack him at any time, stayed back to make sure the kids were okay, hitting a hostile alien in his room with a baseball bat, and even though they made him seem like a wuss at times, he was actually pretty damn brave. But God, was he funny. I especially enjoyed the scenes where he and Mel ran around the house (i was on the floor), when Mel came in and Joaquin had his tin foil hat on, and when he was packing the salt on against the cold shute and put a can up top.M. Night Shyamalan is a genius. An absolute genius. Naturally, audiences are expecting a surprise ending from the well-known writer/director who likes to twist his stories in horrifying ways, and that's exactly what he gives them.Right from the start, I leaned over to the person sitting next to me, and whispered "Bo's the alien." It was obvious, too obvious. The dog trying to kill her, the "contaminated water" obsession while the theory behind the aliens is that they don't like water, the dreams she has. M. Night made us believe that the big "surprise ending" was gonna be that Bo, or someone in the family, was an alien. Me, I thought it was Bo, definately, just because she's just too darn cute and she wasn't afraid of what was happening up until the end. But when M. Night actually gives us a HAPPY ENDING?!?! I was shocked, absolutely shocked, but laughing my arse off. It all made sense once it was explained, and it boggled my mind. The water, the asthma, the bat mounted on the wall. All of it just, scared me more than anything.I could go on about this movie forever, but I think I'd go step by step through the whole sequence of things, and I've already given enough spoilers, so I'll just end it saying M. Night's done it again. The movie's scary, the movie's funny, the movie's definately not overrated, and the movie's just one that you have to see TONIGHT!!! SEE IT!!!!9/10 (i took off a point for some of the going-nowhere scenes)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stylish film that argues its theology poorly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains Spoilers "Signs" is a chilling, suspenseful, and thoughtful film that ultimately does not satisfy. Director Shyamalan's point is that even in the face of incomprehensibly heartbreaking tragedy, or utterly alien threat, one should not lose faith that a higher Power is at work. A higher power that is lovingly weaving all of the details of life--from small oddities to life-shattering suffering--into a plan for one's happiness and fulfillment.Theologians call this Divine Providence, which is of course a weighty subject. A film that attempts to demonstrate it in action, and show how lives are changed and bettered through it--in this case Mel Gibson's Graham Hess--needs to marshal the evidence carefully and convincingly. The elements of the film all need to be successfully constructed in order for the argument not to seem forced and heavy-handed. Shyamalan only partially succeeds at these endeavors, and as a result this stylistically excellent film falls short at the end.As viewers of the Sixth Sense knew coming in, Shyamalan can create the sense of the numinous--the idea that otherworldly powers, benevolent or threatening, infuses the daily world--extremely well. Shadows move under doors, corn stalks rustle, characters listen tensely, and the viewer is on the edge of his seat. Signs does not disappoint in this regard.The characters must also be convincing, and they are. Gibson's Hess is suitably bitter and brooding, but lovingly devoted to the family; Phoenix's Merrill is the sort of dopey yet loyal and caring brother; and Culkin's Morgan and Breslin's Bo are emotionally engaging. Others have noted Shyamalan's ability to get excellent performances out of child actors, this film is no exception.Shyamalan also creates suspense by only developing slowly what the real threat is.

		<shortDescription>Best Movie of the Year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay people. I've read some of the viewer comments here, and some people don't get it. (the movie). This is not an action movie per se, this is not a horror movie, or a sci-fi movie. This is a movie that plays on our fears and has an underlying message.Some of you say, Shayamalan uses cheap effects, or borrows from other movies. Well, I believe that is his whole point. What if all those cheezy things we see or hear about were real? The crop circles, the lights in the sky, the green men? He definitely does use inspiration from other movies, like War of the Worlds, the Blair Witch Project but he's not doing it in a cheap (i have no original ideas of my own, so i'll borrow theirs) way. He's doing it almost as an homage, and saying all those fears are now real. "They're" coming.Shayamalan brilliantly plays on our fears of loud noises, shadows, and the unknown. He uses humour to relieve some of the tension. He also brilliantly ties everything together, and leaves you thinking at the end of the movie.All the actors are wonderfully cast. Joaquin Phoenix always being a favourite with me. By the way, I'm sure Shayamalan was not trying to portray Gibson as a 'catholic' priest. He must have been episcopalian as he had children and a wife.Shayamalan is one of the best things to happen in the movie industry. And to place himself in the movie...what's wrong with that? When you're writer/director/producer...can't you take a little liberty? But to say that he sticks out like a sore thumb is a little harsh...and has an unattractive racist tone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signs of a great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last night I attended the opening of Signs, a wonderfully directed thriller from the director of Unbreakable and The Sixth Sense. This movie was BRILLIANT! Even the opening credits were well done (I dont want to spoil it for you, but lets just say that it is very reminiscent of the classic sci-fi thrillers). Some of the scenes reminded me of What Lies Beneath because the intense scenes had no "scary" music playing behind it. Instead you were hearing what was actually happening which seems to be more effective in scaring you. I thought the sub-plot was very well intertwined throughout the movie. Unlike most thrillers today, you actually care about the subplot and it doesnt seemed to be too forced. I walked out of the theatre knowing that I had just seen a beautiful movie. I will surely be seeing this movie again. I hope to see you there!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I simply cannot describe how amazing this movie is. I was never a big M. Night Shymalan fan, I hated the Sixth Sense, I found that to be boring and predictable. I liked Unbreakable, because of it's unusual plot line.I was however interested in Signs from the beginning, because I'm a Mel Gibson fan, and because I've always been fascinated by crop circles. Still the fact that it was Shymalan held back my enthusiasm. I'm glad to say my fears were misguided and I'm now a huge Shymalan fan.This is the first movie that I've ever seen that I personally can say was an emotional roller coaster, it's hilarious, terrifying, heartbreaking, and thought-provoking in the same instant. All the performances are top-notch, especially the little girl that plays Bo Hess, for such a young age she is a wonderful actress.This film has surpassed The Crow to become my all time favorite movie. I really can give no higher recommendation then that. Go see,now, trust me, you'll be glad you listened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so excited to see this movie after I saw the first trailer. The movie was even better than the trailer made it out to be. First of all, I am not scared easy during movies, but this one was quite frightening. I loved it. Also it was really funny as well. Very strong performances from Mel, Joaquin, and the kids and also two and half thumbs up for M. Night, what a director and writer. This movie made you scared and it made you think as well. Like do things really happen for a reason even if they are really bad. Overall it was a great film that I highly reccommend to anyone who likes a good scare. I give this movie 10 out of 10.P.S. Don't listen to these people who bad mouth this movie, they don't know what they are talkin about. Go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>JESUS CHRIST GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!! IT IS SOOOO F'IN SCARY!!!!!!****MAJOR SPOILERS****Seriously, last night, i had to leave my closet light on because I was so scared. Everywhere I looked, I saw that stupid alien on the roof!!!! AHHHH!!!! And the alien walking across the alley (okay i KNEW that that was going to happen, but when that thing popped out i was so F'IN SCARED!!!) and the alien reflected in the TV. I think i almost peed my pants. I didn't know what to expect at that point, and when he rolled out the TV and there was the alien, squatting down in defense mode, and then the reflection of Joaquin walking into the room and dropping the insulin thingsOkay, calming down now. It was just such a good movie and some of the reviews here are like, it was horrible. How can you think that? I don't know, maybe it's more of a movie for the imaginative, but GOD was it SCARY!!!!Joaquin Phoenix gave one of his best performances, in my opinion, and Abigail Breslin (such a cutie!), shared a partnership with him as the two comic reliefs of the movie. Abigail was more cute than funny, although she did crack me up when she said "Why can't they get boyfriends?" and "This is serious!", but Joaquin's character was just, hilarious, and fearless. I noticed that he was the one that did everything, that boarded the walls, walked up the stairs when an alien could attack him at any time, stayed back to make sure the kids were okay, hitting a hostile alien in his room with a baseball bat, and even though they made him seem like a wuss at times, he was actually pretty damn brave. But God, was he funny. I especially enjoyed the scenes where he and Mel ran around the house (i was on the floor), when Mel came in and Joaquin had his tin foil hat on, and when he was packing the salt on against the cold shute and put a can up top.M. Night Shyamalan is a genius. An absolute genius. Naturally, audiences are expecting a surprise ending from the well-known writer/director who likes to twist his stories in horrifying ways, and that's exactly what he gives them.Right from the start, I leaned over to the person sitting next to me, and whispered "Bo's the alien." It was obvious, too obvious. The dog trying to kill her, the "contaminated water" obsession while the theory behind the aliens is that they don't like water, the dreams she has. M. Night made us believe that the big "surprise ending" was gonna be that Bo, or someone in the family, was an alien. Me, I thought it was Bo, definately, just because she's just too darn cute and she wasn't afraid of what was happening up until the end. But when M. Night actually gives us a HAPPY ENDING?!?! I was shocked, absolutely shocked, but laughing my arse off. It all made sense once it was explained, and it boggled my mind. The water, the asthma, the bat mounted on the wall. All of it just, scared me more than anything.I could go on about this movie forever, but I think I'd go step by step through the whole sequence of things, and I've already given enough spoilers, so I'll just end it saying M. Night's done it again. The movie's scary, the movie's funny, the movie's definately not overrated, and the movie's just one that you have to see TONIGHT!!! SEE IT!!!!9/10 (i took off a point for some of the going-nowhere scenes)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stylish film that argues its theology poorly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains Spoilers "Signs" is a chilling, suspenseful, and thoughtful film that ultimately does not satisfy. Director Shyamalan's point is that even in the face of incomprehensibly heartbreaking tragedy, or utterly alien threat, one should not lose faith that a higher Power is at work. A higher power that is lovingly weaving all of the details of life--from small oddities to life-shattering suffering--into a plan for one's happiness and fulfillment.Theologians call this Divine Providence, which is of course a weighty subject. A film that attempts to demonstrate it in action, and show how lives are changed and bettered through it--in this case Mel Gibson's Graham Hess--needs to marshal the evidence carefully and convincingly. The elements of the film all need to be successfully constructed in order for the argument not to seem forced and heavy-handed. Shyamalan only partially succeeds at these endeavors, and as a result this stylistically excellent film falls short at the end.As viewers of the Sixth Sense knew coming in, Shyamalan can create the sense of the numinous--the idea that otherworldly powers, benevolent or threatening, infuses the daily world--extremely well. Shadows move under doors, corn stalks rustle, characters listen tensely, and the viewer is on the edge of his seat. Signs does not disappoint in this regard.The characters must also be convincing, and they are. Gibson's Hess is suitably bitter and brooding, but lovingly devoted to the family; Phoenix's Merrill is the sort of dopey yet loyal and caring brother; and Culkin's Morgan and Breslin's Bo are emotionally engaging. Others have noted Shyamalan's ability to get excellent performances out of child actors, this film is no exception.Shyamalan also creates suspense by only developing slowly what the real threat is. Are the crop-circle artists human or otherworldly? What is it lurking around the farm--something natural or supernatural? The types of fear are mingled well, and distinguished as the film progresses. The real threat is natural--hostile aliens--while the real hope of life and happiness--is divine.But the plot is weak, and the ending in particular strains credibility. Why does an alien, whose species are compared to Olympic gymnasts in their agility, stand around like a statue in the Hess' living room waiting for Merrill to bash its brains in?

But he forces them together, and thus undermines the credibility needed to demonstrate higher power at work. Those of us who already believe in higher providential power share Shyamalan's view of things, but this film may not convince many others due to the weaknesses noted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie of the Year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay people. I've read some of the viewer comments here, and some people don't get it. (the movie). This is not an action movie per se, this is not a horror movie, or a sci-fi movie. This is a movie that plays on our fears and has an underlying message.Some of you say, Shayamalan uses cheap effects, or borrows from other movies. Well, I believe that is his whole point. What if all those cheezy things we see or hear about were real? The crop circles, the lights in the sky, the green men? He definitely does use inspiration from other movies, like War of the Worlds, the Blair Witch Project but he's not doing it in a cheap (i have no original ideas of my own, so i'll borrow theirs) way. He's doing it almost as an homage, and saying all those fears are now real. "They're" coming.Shayamalan brilliantly plays on our fears of loud noises, shadows, and the unknown. He uses humour to relieve some of the tension. He also brilliantly ties everything together, and leaves you thinking at the end of the movie.All the actors are wonderfully cast. Joaquin Phoenix always being a favourite with me. By the way, I'm sure Shayamalan was not trying to portray Gibson as a 'catholic' priest. He must have been episcopalian as he had children and a wife.Shayamalan is one of the best things to happen in the movie industry. And to place himself in the movie...what's wrong with that? When you're writer/director/producer...can't you take a little liberty? But to say that he sticks out like a sore thumb is a little harsh...and has an unattractive racist tone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signs of a great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last night I attended the opening of Signs, a wonderfully directed thriller from the director of Unbreakable and The Sixth Sense. This movie was BRILLIANT! Even the opening credits were well done (I dont want to spoil it for you, but lets just say that it is very reminiscent of the classic sci-fi thrillers). Some of the scenes reminded me of What Lies Beneath because the intense scenes had no "scary" music playing behind it. Instead you were hearing what was actually happening which seems to be more effective in scaring you. I thought the sub-plot was very well intertwined throughout the movie. Unlike most thrillers today, you actually care about the subplot and it doesnt seemed to be too forced. I walked out of the theatre knowing that I had just seen a beautiful movie. I will surely be seeing this movie again. I hope to see you there!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Signs is my new favorite movie. if you haven't seen it, go to the nearest theater right now. if you liked the 6th sense you'll love this. even if you didn't like the 6th sense you'll love this. yes,its about aliens and crop circles.but its also about taking chances and the theory of everything happening for a reason. it gives you a new view on life, at least it was that way for me. the actors play there characters perfectly, the music is just as thrilling and suspenseful as the filming techniques. it touches on the "hitchcock" method-"the camera moves for a reason".it makes you think, and like the 6th sense you have to pay attention to every detail. if you go to see it in a theater, i suggest that you save your bathroom breaks and popcorn refills for after the movie gets out.you'll thank me laterp.s. pay attention to the flashbacks to the accident</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I simply cannot describe how amazing this movie is. I was never a big M. Night Shymalan fan, I hated the Sixth Sense, I found that to be boring and predictable. I liked Unbreakable, because of it's unusual plot line.I was however interested in Signs from the beginning, because I'm a Mel Gibson fan, and because I've always been fascinated by crop circles. Still the fact that it was Shymalan held back my enthusiasm. I'm glad to say my fears were misguided and I'm now a huge Shymalan fan.This is the first movie that I've ever seen that I personally can say was an emotional roller coaster, it's hilarious, terrifying, heartbreaking, and thought-provoking in the same instant. All the performances are top-notch, especially the little girl that plays Bo Hess, for such a young age she is a wonderful actress.This film has surpassed The Crow to become my all time favorite movie. I really can give no higher recommendation then that. Go see,now, trust me, you'll be glad you listened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so excited to see this movie after I saw the first trailer. The movie was even better than the trailer made it out to be. First of all, I am not scared easy during movies, but this one was quite frightening. I loved it. Also it was really funny as well. Very strong performances from Mel, Joaquin, and the kids and also two and half thumbs up for M. Night, what a director and writer. This movie made you scared and it made you think as well. Like do things really happen for a reason even if they are really bad. Overall it was a great film that I highly reccommend to anyone who likes a good scare. I give this movie 10 out of 10.P.S.

Everywhere I looked, I saw that stupid alien on the roof!!!! AHHHH!!!! And the alien walking across the alley (okay i KNEW that that was going to happen, but when that thing popped out i was so F'IN SCARED!!!) and the alien reflected in the TV. I think i almost peed my pants. I didn't know what to expect at that point, and when he rolled out the TV and there was the alien, squatting down in defense mode, and then the reflection of Joaquin walking into the room and dropping the insulin thingsOkay, calming down now. It was just such a good movie and some of the reviews here are like, it was horrible. How can you think that? I don't know, maybe it's more of a movie for the imaginative, but GOD was it SCARY!!!!Joaquin Phoenix gave one of his best performances, in my opinion, and Abigail Breslin (such a cutie!), shared a partnership with him as the two comic reliefs of the movie. Abigail was more cute than funny, although she did crack me up when she said "Why can't they get boyfriends?" and "This is serious!", but Joaquin's character was just, hilarious, and fearless. I noticed that he was the one that did everything, that boarded the walls, walked up the stairs when an alien could attack him at any time, stayed back to make sure the kids were okay, hitting a hostile alien in his room with a baseball bat, and even though they made him seem like a wuss at times, he was actually pretty damn brave. But God, was he funny. I especially enjoyed the scenes where he and Mel ran around the house (i was on the floor), when Mel came in and Joaquin had his tin foil hat on, and when he was packing the salt on against the cold shute and put a can up top.M. Night Shyamalan is a genius. An absolute genius. Naturally, audiences are expecting a surprise ending from the well-known writer/director who likes to twist his stories in horrifying ways, and that's exactly what he gives them.Right from the start, I leaned over to the person sitting next to me, and whispered "Bo's the alien." It was obvious, too obvious. The dog trying to kill her, the "contaminated water" obsession while the theory behind the aliens is that they don't like water, the dreams she has. M. Night made us believe that the big "surprise ending" was gonna be that Bo, or someone in the family, was an alien. Me, I thought it was Bo, definately, just because she's just too darn cute and she wasn't afraid of what was happening up until the end. But when M. Night actually gives us a HAPPY ENDING?!?! I was shocked, absolutely shocked, but laughing my arse off. It all made sense once it was explained, and it boggled my mind. The water, the asthma, the bat mounted on the wall. All of it just, scared me more than anything.I could go on about this movie forever, but I think I'd go step by step through the whole sequence of things, and I've already given enough spoilers, so I'll just end it saying M. Night's done it again. The movie's scary, the movie's funny, the movie's definately not overrated, and the movie's just one that you have to see TONIGHT!!! SEE IT!!!!9/10 (i took off a point for some of the going-nowhere scenes)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stylish film that argues its theology poorly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains Spoilers "Signs" is a chilling, suspenseful, and thoughtful film that ultimately does not satisfy. Director Shyamalan's point is that even in the face of incomprehensibly heartbreaking tragedy, or utterly alien threat, one should not lose faith that a higher Power is at work. A higher power that is lovingly weaving all of the details of life--from small oddities to life-shattering suffering--into a plan for one's happiness and fulfillment.Theologians call this Divine Providence, which is of course a weighty subject. A film that attempts to demonstrate it in action, and show how lives are changed and bettered through it--in this case Mel Gibson's Graham Hess--needs to marshal the evidence carefully and convincingly. The elements of the film all need to be successfully constructed in order for the argument not to seem forced and heavy-handed. Shyamalan only partially succeeds at these endeavors, and as a result this stylistically excellent film falls short at the end.As viewers of the Sixth Sense knew coming in, Shyamalan can create the sense of the numinous--the idea that otherworldly powers, benevolent or threatening, infuses the daily world--extremely well. Shadows move under doors, corn stalks rustle, characters listen tensely, and the viewer is on the edge of his seat. Signs does not disappoint in this regard.The characters must also be convincing, and they are. Gibson's Hess is suitably bitter and brooding, but lovingly devoted to the family; Phoenix's Merrill is the sort of dopey yet loyal and caring brother; and Culkin's Morgan and Breslin's Bo are emotionally engaging. Others have noted Shyamalan's ability to get excellent performances out of child actors, this film is no exception.Shyamalan also creates suspense by only developing slowly what the real threat is. Are the crop-circle artists human or otherworldly? What is it lurking around the farm--something natural or supernatural? The types of fear are mingled well, and distinguished as the film progresses. The real threat is natural--hostile aliens--while the real hope of life and happiness--is divine.But the plot is weak, and the ending in particular strains credibility. Why does an alien, whose species are compared to Olympic gymnasts in their agility, stand around like a statue in the Hess' living room waiting for Merrill to bash its brains in? As noted above, why on earth does a species vulnerable to water invade precipitation-prone earth, and in the buff at that? The similarity to the Wicked Witch of the West, also noted above, undermined some of the suspense. For crying out loud, is *that* what we were scared of? Just turn on the garden hose!A cast and a director this good needed a better ending. Shyamalan wanted to show how every detail he chose contributed to the final victory--Bo's water obsession, Merrill's baseball successes and failure, Morgan's asthma, and Colleen Hess' dying words. But he forces them together, and thus undermines the credibility needed to demonstrate higher power at work. Those of us who already believe in higher providential power share Shyamalan's view of things, but this film may not convince many others due to the weaknesses noted.</fullReview>

Everywhere I looked, I saw that stupid alien on the roof!!!! AHHHH!!!! And the alien walking across the alley (okay i KNEW that that was going to happen, but when that thing popped out i was so F'IN SCARED!!!) and the alien reflected in the TV. I think i almost peed my pants. I didn't know what to expect at that point, and when he rolled out the TV and there was the alien, squatting down in defense mode, and then the reflection of Joaquin walking into the room and dropping the insulin thingsOkay, calming down now. It was just such a good movie and some of the reviews here are like, it was horrible. How can you think that? I don't know, maybe it's more of a movie for the imaginative, but GOD was it SCARY!!!!Joaquin Phoenix gave one of his best performances, in my opinion, and Abigail Breslin (such a cutie!), shared a partnership with him as the two comic reliefs of the movie. Abigail was more cute than funny, although she did crack me up when she said "Why can't they get boyfriends?" and "This is serious!", but Joaquin's character was just, hilarious, and fearless. I noticed that he was the one that did everything, that boarded the walls, walked up the stairs when an alien could attack him at any time, stayed back to make sure the kids were okay, hitting a hostile alien in his room with a baseball bat, and even though they made him seem like a wuss at times, he was actually pretty damn brave. But God, was he funny. I especially enjoyed the scenes where he and Mel ran around the house (i was on the floor), when Mel came in and Joaquin had his tin foil hat on, and when he was packing the salt on against the cold shute and put a can up top.M. Night Shyamalan is a genius. An absolute genius. Naturally, audiences are expecting a surprise ending from the well-known writer/director who likes to twist his stories in horrifying ways, and that's exactly what he gives them.Right from the start, I leaned over to the person sitting next to me, and whispered "Bo's the alien." It was obvious, too obvious. The dog trying to kill her, the "contaminated water" obsession while the theory behind the aliens is that they don't like water, the dreams she has. M. Night made us believe that the big "surprise ending" was gonna be that Bo, or someone in the family, was an alien. Me, I thought it was Bo, definately, just because she's just too darn cute and she wasn't afraid of what was happening up until the end. But when M. Night actually gives us a HAPPY ENDING?!?! I was shocked, absolutely shocked, but laughing my arse off. It all made sense once it was explained, and it boggled my mind. The water, the asthma, the bat mounted on the wall. All of it just, scared me more than anything.I could go on about this movie forever, but I think I'd go step by step through the whole sequence of things, and I've already given enough spoilers, so I'll just end it saying M. Night's done it again. The movie's scary, the movie's funny, the movie's definately not overrated, and the movie's just one that you have to see TONIGHT!!! SEE IT!!!!9/10 (i took off a point for some of the going-nowhere scenes)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the greatest movies ever made. Shyamalan does it again. The acting is superb and I had chills throughout the movie...and I was laughing and screaming at the same time. What makes this film great is the unique mix of humor and mystery and perspective from which the director handles the subject. A must watch....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected to be scared, as the other movies 'Night' has directed have had their very scary moments...this one goes beyond all of that because of the use of light and shadow throughout the movie. Very carefuly done by the director.The children were so wonderful, and they handled the emotional moments so very well! Gibson and Phoenix were quite excellent as a reverend wrestling with God, and his brother who wants him to go back to the way he was. There were many shades to these performances, and like the scary scenes, you knew there was more to everything than what you could actually see or hear.That's what makes it so amazing...there IS violence in the picture, but most of it is only talked about as happening elsewhere. The threat that violence could happen at any moment kept me clutching my husband's shoulder and arm pretty tightly!I LIKED IT bunches!Therese Peregrine</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan - A Master Storyteller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie, which should be watched without any prenotion or expectation of any kind.. Just sit and enjoy the course of the film and you won't be disappointed for even a single minute. From Sixth Sense to Signs, Shyamalan has joined the ranks of Spielberg, Hitchcock.. in story telling and holding the audience pulse. Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Culkin, Breslin.. everyone turned in a superb performance. If u r a movie buff, watch his camera angles.. which will make u scary, even for otherwise routine scenes. Unlike his earlier movies, this movie has quite a few lighter moments too.. and too quirky.. His gentle use of humour, while maintaining the suspense, through out the movie was simply great. what the film is lacking is: It leaves the audience with nothing once they leave the theater.. U just think that the movie is worth while watching and thats it. But personally.. I would wait for his next venture.</fullReview>

It has everything you want from a movie it's thrilling, has a well devolped plot, is a hillarious film and has great prefromances by Mel Gibson and Joquain Phoenix(Excuse me if spelt wrong). This movie was definetly worth the ten bucks I payed. See this Movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film opening night in Miami, definitely looking forward to a Night film, (I use Night as reference to the director his last name is hard to repeat). No need to hype a Night film because he has proven in just 2 films he is a force to reckon with in Hollywood. Not knowing what to expect I was pleasantly surprised not having to sit through a Close Encounters of the Third kind remake. Night knows exactly how to effect us, making us think about our lives on this earth and how we effect ALL we encounter. His movies always have twists and turns and ALWAYS keeps on the edge of our seat, so I'm not going to reveal the plot of the film. All I will say is that M. Night sure does make us think , evaluate our own life, and makes us wonder whether we are alone? A must for Night fans!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To say anything about the content of this movie (perhaps even more so than with Sixth Sense), is to spoil it. But if you like M. Night's past work, you won't be disappointed here. Great attention to detail, mostly subtle performances, and of course a "where is this going" storyline. "Signs" will remind you why Shyamalan is one of the best writer/directors out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**** SPOILER ALERT ***** **** SPOILERS ALL THE WAY *****For me, the movie ?Signs' deals with at least three more subjects - apart from the crop-circle mystery. The trailers tell us this movie is about the mystery of crop-circles and who did those. By the middle of the movie, we know it is Aliens who did it. So it becomes an Alien invasion movie from then onwards. In the end it reveals another subject ? a preachers journey towards restoration of his faith.But, there is another subject that lies beneath all this. It is about exploring the role of myths and beliefs in us, and affirming their significance in of our lives. There are several myths and beliefs explored in this movie - including, belief in God, existence of Aliens, kids faith in parents as protectors, reason for the existence of flaws - especially in humans, premonition, purpose behind unexplainable events, purposes of individuals in this world.Belief 1: Some higher power guides and protects the faithful Graham's faith in God is shaken, and finally restored. His wife's death was a God's test and has a purpose. His brother's ?swinging away', his son's asthma, and his daughter's dislike for water, Ray's call, and even the threat from Aliens led to restoration of faith and revival of affectionate bonding with his family and fits neatly for him to have faith renewed.Belief 2: There is life on other planets and Aliens are coming. Morgan's belief in Aliens, and crop circles as signs for their navigation is affirmed beyond doubt. Skeptics (Graham and his brother) who did not believe him got convinced. Several beliefs about Aliens by various characters are explored, questioned, ridiculed and finally affirmed to be true: Aliens exist; they are planning to invade earth; they are using crop signs to navigate; their communication can be heard on radio signals; they don't like places near water. And so on ?Belief 3: Some flaws in people may not be what we think they are. Merrill's shaken faith in himself is regained after understanding the purpose of his flaw. Again, seemingly flawed characteristics of Morgan's Asthma and Bo's sudden aversion to water - all have some deeper meaning.Belief 4: Parents are always there to protect young children. This faith that was shaken in kids because of their mother's death and growing distance from their father, is finally restored and reaffirmed.Belief 5: Animals and kids have premonition of bad things. Bo was questioned for her sensing something in water but ultimately proved correct. Dogs were correct too.Belief 6: There is a purpose behind every event and tragedy. Death of Graham's wife, Ray hitting her, and many other events are explored for a deeper meaning.Belief 7: Every person has some purpose in life - obvious or not so obvious. By the end of the movie, each character gets something meaningful for them. Graham has not wasted his life in dedicating his life to something that he lost faith in. Merrill finds a purpose in ?swinging away'. Both kids got to know how precious they are for their mother (story of their birth) and father. Even Ray feels some purpose in why the accident happened, uses an opportunity to clear things with Graham, and plays a role in informing Graham about Alien's weaknesses.Every character brings it's own set of beliefs or myths which are explored, tested, and ultimately, all are affirmed to be true. The beliefs of some minor characters like the military person who believes in Alien invasion tactics, the bookstore owner who thinks crop-circle coverage as a scheme for advertising sodas are also affirmed at a trivial level by subsequent events. Even the pharmacy clerk has her beliefs about sinning affirmed by an authority she trusted.Am I reading too much into ?Signs' ? more than what there is? May be. Even though I don't believe in most of the stuff he asks us to believe, my faith in Shyamalan in delivering a brilliantly complex movie, which was a bit shaken after reading some reviews, is finally restored and soared to a higher level. If all this is just my own myth, so be it.On top of this, ?Signs' defies genre - mystery, suspense, horror, sci-fi, drama, and comedy ? all at the same time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real horror flicks play out in your mind, not on the movie screen. Thumbs up for Shyamalan!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have adopted the opinion that many of the people giving such scathing reviews to this movie were instead waiting to see "Independence Day 2" or some other computer effect-ridden insubstantial character drivel of the same sort.In fact, this movie is nothing like the in-your-face, look-how-many-millions-we-can-spend, typical sci-fi movie that movie-goers have been exposed to lately.This flick has style. This flick knows how to reach into your chest and twist. This movie is a roller coaster of emotions... taking you from curiosity in the premise, to compassion for the family, to concern about the building sci-fi overtones, to almost utter heartbreak at the pain this family has suffered, right up through sheer terror, and finally into a resolution that, contrary to much opinion here on IMDB, I thought was brilliantly done and had plenty of meaning for my tastes.There is a particular scene toward the end of the movie where I felt my eyes almost welling up over the sadness on-screen, and in a single instant, with nothing more than the reaching of an arm and the tugging of a shirt, was into a hilarious laugh. Two minutes later, I was about to jump out of my seat again with suspense, set off by Shyamalan's genius using a baby monitor as a suspense device.'Signs' grasped my attention and held it throughout the movie. The acting was incredible throughout. Abigail Breslin almost steals the movie away as the adorable little Bo Hess. Rory Caulkin and Joaquin Phoenix each turn in commendable performances. Even Shyamalan himself in a cameo role is believable in his plight. Gibson, of course, always hits his mark.As far as the deus ex machina ending of the movie being written about here, what people are describing as the contrived ending had nothing to do with the real action that resolved the overall sci-fi conflict in the movie. My guess is that they failed to understand the ending in their disappointment over not seeing Randy Quaid piloting an F-14 into the mothership.If what you want to see is F-14s dog-fighting with flying saucers, a minimum of $30 million spent on special effects, and scenes of millions of aliens swarming over the landscape and being blasted into orange goo -- wait for Independence Day 2.If you like movies that rely more on your own imagination to create suspense and thrill rather than having someone program your imagination for you, and would rather be treated to a thoughtful reflection on the human overtones of sci-fi stories over the pervasive special effects of 21st century movie-making... go see Signs. You'll enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Unexpected movie of the Summer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking at the other comment on this movie makes me think about how people look at all the stuff in the movies and point out the bad stuff. Granted, this movie is not totally about UFO's or aliens or even crop circles. Rather the movie title alludes to different signs, signs that there is Someone working for us, not against us. I read the reviews of this movie and had a very small inkling of what I was to expect from this movie. I read about the parts about the spookiness of the aliens, the spirituality of the good Reverend Hess and the storytelling of M. Night. When I came out of the theater, I was totally content. This movie was worth it and then some. This movie was a long step from M. Night's twist endings, but if you see it again, not really. I don't want to spoil it for anyone if they are reading this. (If you haven't seen this movie, come back and read this when you have.)SPOILERS--------------------------------------------------------------- One thing that has been a constant with M. Night's movies is his real writing that gets the humor and terror from everyday situations. When Merrill flinches at his taunter in the Army recruiting office, I can imagine my friends, who are also baseball players, do the same thing if someone was heckling them. I loved it. And when Isabelle, the dog is barking and then stops after a scuffle, that is way more terrifying than seeing the aliens come for you. In the end, this was a very uplifting movie and I'm GLAD IT ENDED THE WAY IT DID. If it went further, it would have ruined it. This was a story about a man in extrodinary circumstances wrestling with faith. Not about alien invasions. Very good performances by the kids, Mel and especially Joaquin. Even the Hitchcock cameo by M. Night was great. I'll never look at a pantry the same way again. But I will look towards the heavens and not for spacecraft, either.</fullReview>

I read about the parts about the spookiness of the aliens, the spirituality of the good Reverend Hess and the storytelling of M. Night. When I came out of the theater, I was totally content. This movie was worth it and then some. This movie was a long step from M. Night's twist endings, but if you see it again, not really. I don't want to spoil it for anyone if they are reading this. (If you haven't seen this movie, come back and read this when you have.)SPOILERS--------------------------------------------------------------- One thing that has been a constant with M. Night's movies is his real writing that gets the humor and terror from everyday situations. When Merrill flinches at his taunter in the Army recruiting office, I can imagine my friends, who are also baseball players, do the same thing if someone was heckling them. I loved it. And when Isabelle, the dog is barking and then stops after a scuffle, that is way more terrifying than seeing the aliens come for you. In the end, this was a very uplifting movie and I'm GLAD IT ENDED THE WAY IT DID. If it went further, it would have ruined it. This was a story about a man in extrodinary circumstances wrestling with faith. Not about alien invasions. Very good performances by the kids, Mel and especially Joaquin. Even the Hitchcock cameo by M. Night was great. I'll never look at a pantry the same way again. But I will look towards the heavens and not for spacecraft, either.</fullReview>

Very carefuly done by the director.The children were so wonderful, and they handled the emotional moments so very well! Gibson and Phoenix were quite excellent as a reverend wrestling with God, and his brother who wants him to go back to the way he was. There were many shades to these performances, and like the scary scenes, you knew there was more to everything than what you could actually see or hear.That's what makes it so amazing...there IS violence in the picture, but most of it is only talked about as happening elsewhere.

		<fullReview>This is a movie, which should be watched without any prenotion or expectation of any kind.. Just sit and enjoy the course of the film and you won't be disappointed for even a single minute. From Sixth Sense to Signs, Shyamalan has joined the ranks of Spielberg, Hitchcock.. in story telling and holding the audience pulse. Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Culkin, Breslin.. everyone turned in a superb performance. If u r a movie buff, watch his camera angles.. which will make u scary, even for otherwise routine scenes. Unlike his earlier movies, this movie has quite a few lighter moments too.. and too quirky.. His gentle use of humour, while maintaining the suspense, through out the movie was simply great. what the film is lacking is: It leaves the audience with nothing once they leave the theater.. U just think that the movie is worth while watching and thats it. But personally.. I would wait for his next venture.</fullReview>

No need to hype a Night film because he has proven in just 2 films he is a force to reckon with in Hollywood. Not knowing what to expect I was pleasantly surprised not having to sit through a Close Encounters of the Third kind remake. Night knows exactly how to effect us, making us think about our lives on this earth and how we effect ALL we encounter. His movies always have twists and turns and ALWAYS keeps on the edge of our seat, so I'm not going to reveal the plot of the film. All I will say is that M.

		<fullReview>To say anything about the content of this movie (perhaps even more so than with Sixth Sense), is to spoil it. But if you like M. Night's past work, you won't be disappointed here. Great attention to detail, mostly subtle performances, and of course a "where is this going" storyline. "Signs" will remind you why Shyamalan is one of the best writer/directors out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**** SPOILER ALERT ***** **** SPOILERS ALL THE WAY *****For me, the movie ?Signs' deals with at least three more subjects - apart from the crop-circle mystery. The trailers tell us this movie is about the mystery of crop-circles and who did those. By the middle of the movie, we know it is Aliens who did it. So it becomes an Alien invasion movie from then onwards. In the end it reveals another subject ? a preachers journey towards restoration of his faith.But, there is another subject that lies beneath all this. It is about exploring the role of myths and beliefs in us, and affirming their significance in of our lives. There are several myths and beliefs explored in this movie - including, belief in God, existence of Aliens, kids faith in parents as protectors, reason for the existence of flaws - especially in humans, premonition, purpose behind unexplainable events, purposes of individuals in this world.Belief 1: Some higher power guides and protects the faithful Graham's faith in God is shaken, and finally restored. His wife's death was a God's test and has a purpose. His brother's ?swinging away', his son's asthma, and his daughter's dislike for water, Ray's call, and even the threat from Aliens led to restoration of faith and revival of affectionate bonding with his family and fits neatly for him to have faith renewed.Belief 2: There is life on other planets and Aliens are coming. Morgan's belief in Aliens, and crop circles as signs for their navigation is affirmed beyond doubt. Skeptics (Graham and his brother) who did not believe him got convinced. Several beliefs about Aliens by various characters are explored, questioned, ridiculed and finally affirmed to be true: Aliens exist; they are planning to invade earth; they are using crop signs to navigate; their communication can be heard on radio signals; they don't like places near water. And so on ?Belief 3: Some flaws in people may not be what we think they are. Merrill's shaken faith in himself is regained after understanding the purpose of his flaw. Again, seemingly flawed characteristics of Morgan's Asthma and Bo's sudden aversion to water - all have some deeper meaning.Belief 4: Parents are always there to protect young children. This faith that was shaken in kids because of their mother's death and growing distance from their father, is finally restored and reaffirmed.Belief 5: Animals and kids have premonition of bad things. Bo was questioned for her sensing something in water but ultimately proved correct. Dogs were correct too.Belief 6: There is a purpose behind every event and tragedy. Death of Graham's wife, Ray hitting her, and many other events are explored for a deeper meaning.Belief 7: Every person has some purpose in life - obvious or not so obvious. By the end of the movie, each character gets something meaningful for them. Graham has not wasted his life in dedicating his life to something that he lost faith in. Merrill finds a purpose in ?swinging away'. Both kids got to know how precious they are for their mother (story of their birth) and father. Even Ray feels some purpose in why the accident happened, uses an opportunity to clear things with Graham, and plays a role in informing Graham about Alien's weaknesses.Every character brings it's own set of beliefs or myths which are explored, tested, and ultimately, all are affirmed to be true. The beliefs of some minor characters like the military person who believes in Alien invasion tactics, the bookstore owner who thinks crop-circle coverage as a scheme for advertising sodas are also affirmed at a trivial level by subsequent events. Even the pharmacy clerk has her beliefs about sinning affirmed by an authority she trusted.Am I reading too much into ?Signs' ? more than what there is? May be. Even though I don't believe in most of the stuff he asks us to believe, my faith in Shyamalan in delivering a brilliantly complex movie, which was a bit shaken after reading some reviews, is finally restored and soared to a higher level. If all this is just my own myth, so be it.On top of this, ?Signs' defies genre - mystery, suspense, horror, sci-fi, drama, and comedy ? all at the same time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real horror flicks play out in your mind, not on the movie screen. Thumbs up for Shyamalan!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have adopted the opinion that many of the people giving such scathing reviews to this movie were instead waiting to see "Independence Day 2" or some other computer effect-ridden insubstantial character drivel of the same sort.In fact, this movie is nothing like the in-your-face, look-how-many-millions-we-can-spend, typical sci-fi movie that movie-goers have been exposed to lately.This flick has style. This flick knows how to reach into your chest and twist. This movie is a roller coaster of emotions... taking you from curiosity in the premise, to compassion for the family, to concern about the building sci-fi overtones, to almost utter heartbreak at the pain this family has suffered, right up through sheer terror, and finally into a resolution that, contrary to much opinion here on IMDB, I thought was brilliantly done and had plenty of meaning for my tastes.There is a particular scene toward the end of the movie where I felt my eyes almost welling up over the sadness on-screen, and in a single instant, with nothing more than the reaching of an arm and the tugging of a shirt, was into a hilarious laugh. Two minutes later, I was about to jump out of my seat again with suspense, set off by Shyamalan's genius using a baby monitor as a suspense device.'Signs' grasped my attention and held it throughout the movie. The acting was incredible throughout. Abigail Breslin almost steals the movie away as the adorable little Bo Hess. Rory Caulkin and Joaquin Phoenix each turn in commendable performances. Even Shyamalan himself in a cameo role is believable in his plight. Gibson, of course, always hits his mark.As far as the deus ex machina ending of the movie being written about here, what people are describing as the contrived ending had nothing to do with the real action that resolved the overall sci-fi conflict in the movie. My guess is that they failed to understand the ending in their disappointment over not seeing Randy Quaid piloting an F-14 into the mothership.If what you want to see is F-14s dog-fighting with flying saucers, a minimum of $30 million spent on special effects, and scenes of millions of aliens swarming over the landscape and being blasted into orange goo -- wait for Independence Day 2.If you like movies that rely more on your own imagination to create suspense and thrill rather than having someone program your imagination for you, and would rather be treated to a thoughtful reflection on the human overtones of sci-fi stories over the pervasive special effects of 21st century movie-making... go see Signs. You'll enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan has done it again. Although this movie is quite different from his last two, his storytelling and method of terrifying an audience are still priceless. Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix give great performances, as do the two children. Shyamalan is able to depict terror not by showing you a grotesque creature, but simply the expressions on the actors' faces. Their reactions, with help from a haunting score, send shivers down your spine. The storytelling is gripping and leaves you savoring for the next scene. This movie is great, in all aspects. Shyamalan is no fluke, for those that still doubt him. See Signs and you'll see a whole lot more!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unexpected fright-fest with intelligence...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Supernatural seems to be a strongpoint for Director M. Night Shymalan. His last three films have all built themselves upon a fixation with the unexplained. In ?The Sixth Sense', he redefined the suspense genre with a perverse and surreal tale about immortality. In his second recognized venture, he returned with Bruce Willis and grappled with the concept of immortality once more. The Master Craftsman now teams with Mel Gibson as he creates his most thought provoking, frightful, suspenseful and intriguing tale yet. ?Signs' has had the marketing vehicle from Touchstone Pictures selling the image of crop circles. Yet, those who have seen the film know the double meaning of the title of this ingenious and surprisingly scary film. If one were to watch the film, the focus should not be on getting scared, but it would be to experience cinema in its' greatest form, in its' greatest genre ? through a suspense film that is actually suspenseful. While watching the film, if one were to immerse themselves in this gem, the frights will come naturally. The origin of those frights will remain undisclosed; no spoilers will be given because it would be a sin to reveal the nature of this intricate and well-engineered piece of film. What can be said is a suggestion: have none of your friends advise you what it is about, or what it contains in terms of plot spoilers, for the effect will be lost. What won't be lost is the viewer's memory of this movie, as it will be indelibly etched in the viewer's mind after experiencing this phenomenal piece. Mel Gibson stars as Reverend Graham Hess, a distraught man who begins to question his faith, even more than he already has, after unexplainable crop circles appear in his crops. Out in rural Bucks County, Pennsylvania, Gibson is the man of the house as his brother (the always astounding Joaquin Phoenix) Merrill Hess, lives with him and the Reverend's two young children. After paranoia soon turns into reality about the origin of the crop circles, the tension escalates as Shymalan brings us into an absolutely surreal journey with the supernatural (or is it?). The film opens with long lost composer James Newton Howard's instrumental and influential score as the credits appear in a simplistic yet effective manner. A subtle gray/blue tint serves as the background for credits seemingly in a rich Majestic font and as the credits progress, so does the tension. The music quickens, the credits roll at a quicker pace and the viewer is catapulted into a truly memorable film experience. A difficult challenge would be to have a social discourse on the film's flaws. This is truly an amalgamation of all elements great and results in a very satisfying film about the supernatural, and our fears. Shymalan introduces us to the supernatural in an elegant and frightful manner as he takes a page from the Hitchcock school of filmmaking in terms of the antagonistic viewpoint ? ?less is more'. The sporadic sightings of the supernatural elements in the film will make one quiver and will make one wonder if they truly are just supernatural, or something so complex in which no one has the answer to. Shymalan pulls no punches as his well-written script has our central characters all with a story to tell. These characters are flawed and are not the most functional family members, yet when the tension escalates, (as in the boarded up basement scene right before the film's climax), they watch out for one another. The emphasis of the film though, is not on family. Shymalan uses the family analogy to allude to the underpinnings of the film's nucleus, which is faith; faith in a higher deity or a higher being, whatever one's belief may be. But the film's focal point (besides producing some powerful frights) is to have the viewer grapple with faith and morality. The film does a fantastic job at providing situations in which the viewer can place himself or herself in. What would you do if you knew it was the end of the world? Or, would you let your child die simply because you were too scared to go back upstairs and retrieve the child's medicine? These debates may not be welcome by many, but these situations do allude to some of the monstrous decisions undertaken by the Reverend and his family. The emotions conveyed are a direct result of the incredible acting brought forward under Shymalan's direction. Shymalan himself takes another nod at acting in his own film as he did in ?Unbreakable' and once again follows in the steps of Master Hitchcock. He plays an integral role in the film's progression and his character is able to capture one of the unexplainable phenomena resulting for a heart-stopping scene in which the whole theatre will have their hearts in their throats at a moment. Shymalan has truly delivered a worthy piece of film and while it will be a commercial blockbuster, containing some traits of a commercial film, it really has so much more. In its' detail, Shymalan employs Cinematographer Tak Fujimoto who worked with Shymalan on ?The Sixth Sense'. Even thought the film is centrally set in rural areas, the images within the film tell so many stories. This is a trait of a great film, and once seeing the film, there will be many more stories to tell.Giancarlo's Rating: ***1/2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>God, I hope M. Night Shyamalan makes a hundred movies.I really can't believe the critisism this movie has received on this site. I walked out of the theory having been thrilled, excited, provoked to *think*, and thoroughly satisfied on every conceivable level. I laughed. I jumped. No, this movie does not have the alien ships chasing after us as ID4 did, or the grand spectacle of contact that so many other alien movies have centered on, but you'll have to forgive it for being original. Instead, the movie centers on a single family and their reactions to a potential alien invasion.*** Possible spoilers ***It's like the Sixth Sense in that, if you think about what happened in the film in a greater context than those people who were in the film, it doesn't make much sense (I mean, it's great that he tricked the audience into believe he was alive, but do you think he could go that entire length of time - I believe it was eight months - without talking to anyone, or realizing something unusual?). All of his movies are a gimmick used to bring another aspect of human nature to light. But the gimmick isn't the pay-off. I mean, if you expect some great revelation into the nature of aliens, you're not going to get it. If you want some revelation into the nature of human spirit, then pay attention.I do have a few points, just interest stuff (and one critisism):I always find it interesting when a film portrays any ambiguous spiritual pay-off as pertaining to a particular belief system. In regards to this film, there's really nothing in the Christian faith that would support the concepts of fate and signs as promoted by this film. It could just as soon promote Hinduism, Islam or Judaism. But this is a trend I've seen a lot of recently. Simon Birch, for instance. Or even The Testament, one of the latest John Grisham novels. Both have ambiguous religious ideas which the characters translate into some broader religion, which implies other beliefs. But perhaps it's just the world's latest trend to promote this sort of ambiguous spirituality, that the underlying principles of religion are worth living by, but they manifest themselves in many ways. Perhaps we're supposed to become Ba'Hai. And make no mistake, I'm not criticizing the movie - I sort of like the idea - I just find this sort of thinking interesting.However, M. Night should promptly turn on the television and see how a *real* news report is structured. I laughed every time the television was turned on. I mean, we've all seen reporters reporting during crises, like 9/11, and they do not report like that. They do not get all huffy and puffy and try to incite the viewers with slow-paced lines about how terrified everyone is (especially with a trembling voice). They give the facts, usually with a straight face. That's what they trained to do. The reports here looked like they were being narrated by the guy who does the voice-overs for The Outer Limits.Matty J</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this one was a little different from what I expected. It had some very suspenseful moments, but not as many as I would have liked. Most of the movie was spent on character development and non-spooky plot development. Turns out, there were far more humorous moments in this film than suspenseful ones. However, this doesn't really take away from the movie. It was entertaining throughout. Very well written, acted, and directed. You may be disappointed if you are expecting a pure suspense movie though. I have to admit I was. My rating: 7/10.***SPOILERS*** DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIEJust wanted to nitpick about the ending (as I'm sure half the reviewers already have). First of all, it's just not too believable that the aliens' weakness would be water, the SOURCE OF ALL LIFE!!! Secondly, if the aliens were planning on invading a planet that is covered in 2/3 of THEIR WEAKNESS, don't you think they could at least wear a watertight suit?? Well, just having one minor flaw in the plot doesn't really ruin the rest of the movie, which was quite solid, so no penalty points for the plot hole, but you have to think, did the writers truly think that no one would question how credible that plot point was?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>God, I hope M. Night Shyamalan makes a hundred movies.I really can't believe the critisism this movie has received on this site. I walked out of the theory having been thrilled, excited, provoked to *think*, and thoroughly satisfied on every conceivable level. I laughed. I jumped. No, this movie does not have the alien ships chasing after us as ID4 did, or the grand spectacle of contact that so many other alien movies have centered on, but you'll have to forgive it for being original. Instead, the movie centers on a single family and their reactions to a potential alien invasion.*** Possible spoilers ***It's like the Sixth Sense in that, if you think about what happened in the film in a greater context than those people who were in the film, it doesn't make much sense (I mean, it's great that he tricked the audience into believe he was alive, but do you think he could go that entire length of time - I believe it was eight months - without talking to anyone, or realizing something unusual?). All of his movies are a gimmick used to bring another aspect of human nature to light. But the gimmick isn't the pay-off. I mean, if you expect some great revelation into the nature of aliens, you're not going to get it.

		<shortDescription>Signs upon signs upon signs...A different SciFi Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan has definitely established a style and brand of his own(although I disagree with those who place him in the pantheon next to Spielberg, but he's getting there...)and with this film it should be noted that his name alone can open a film. This is a delightfully refreshing non-science fiction science fiction film, with a stunningly tense and tormentedly played lead by Mel Gibson, a strong and funny turn by Joaquin Phoenix, and two great kids playing kids you wish you knew,Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin.POSSIBLE SPOILERS:OK, so the trailers are misleading. But this movie starts in a sprint and gets to the action quickly and doesn't disappoint in the ET department. Hardcore Science Fiction fans may feel cheated in this department, but I am a proponent of the "less is more" philosophy.Sort of a "War of the Worlds" meets "To Kill a Mockingbird, the movie starts as a mystery saturated with sadness, turns heavily Science Fiction and the "things that go bump in the night" are a big part of that, but the tension holds up throughout, making this a film that is really about the four principle family members. Consider: very little action takes place off the family farm, leading to a sense of claustrophobia and creepiness.Fantastic in tiny but pivotal roles are Shyamalan himself and Patricia Kalember. In a film with seven speaking roles, Gibson and Phoenix included, that is saying a lot.Sure, the "Signs" referred to in the title are more spiritual than just crop circles, but you are never cheated; as in "Unbreakable" and "The Sixth Sense" if you look closely, the Signs are there in plain sight all the time. Otherwise, why would they have been written in the script?Funny, scary, touching, admirable and uplifting...all of what movies should be for...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>....you've got to have faith.Honestly, that's the most glaring thing that I remember from this movie. The last five minutes or so of the film reduce the whole thing to some kind of blatantly obvious morality play. As if one obvious statement of "moral" isn't enough, we get three of them in a row!Certainly, the film was very well done. I was definitely entertained by this thing. I don't regret spending my money on it at all. In fact, I was quite impressed by how little the movie relied on its special effects. It's nice to see a movie driven by pure acting and storytelling rather than flashy effects.The real problem that I have with this movie is that it isn't what I went to see. I went to see some kind of alien sci-fi thing...and that's not what Signs is. The whole crop circles thing is just a sub-plot. This movie is really about Father Graham's crisis of faith. It's all about learning to accept the bad as well as the good, and keeping your faith through it all. And again, if you don't pick that up during the movie itself you'll get it nailed into your skull during the last five minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie an hour ago. I was amazed at the film, and correlatively saddened to find such a bad review of it on this site. So let me tell you why I disagree with the negative review. Let me say that I think the film is brilliant. M. Night has a real gift for bringing an audience along on the same journey as the character (Mel Gibson), like we did with Bruce Willis in 6th sense (but don't be tempted to box him in as a twist-ending one-trick pony). So the film itself is gorgeous. It's beautifully shot, and there is a reason that effects were limited, it WASN"T SUPPOSED TO BE CLASSIFIED AS A SCI-FI! I think thats why the previous reviewer was so dissapointed. He was expecting Inipendence Day 2 or something. The film is really about family, set against this particular situation. If you go in looking for Star Trek or something, you might give a similar review to the preceeding, but if you go in looking for a film with solid characters, an engaging story, a provacative premise, beautiful cinematagrophy, humor, drama, all seamlessly woven by a gifted writer/director and cast, SEE THIS MOVIE! Don't think of it as a horror or a suspense or a sci-fi thriller, think of it as a film, and you will surely appreciate it's elegence. I actually think I like this one better than sixth sense (which I liked better than Unbreakable). It really is a great movie and I can understand why the previous reviewer was left wanting more (he was expecting something he had already seen) and I encourage all to go see it. That's all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan's Sign left me wondering</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people will walk away from this movie thinking about the aliens and the signs in the fields, and not the signs that tell you everything happens for a reason. There are things that are set into motion that we have no control over, and like in his previous films Shyamalan plays with that, the idea that we can't control everything that there is a higher power. I rather enjoyed Shyamalan's continual use of putting ordinary people in extra-ordinary circumstances. Mel Gibson is heartbreaking as the bereaved husband, and Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin shine as his sympathetic children. It was great to watch Joaquin Phoenix as a vulnerable jock who loves his brother and his brother's children and wants to help them anyway he can. Signs just isn't about the big bigger picture, but the smaller one. Yes, it scared me a bit and sadden me a great deal, because Shyamalan asks the question do you have hope and faith or don't you? (spoiler) That question haunts you through the entire movie as well as Mel Gibson's character.</fullReview>

I thought it was awesome! The suspense was incredible, and judging by the sold out theatre audience, they felt the same way. The tension and gasps in the theatre were amazing! There was also a lot of great humor and a nice message to the film.Go see it, with an open mind! By the way, my husband and 19 year old daughter loved it also and as people were exiting the theatre, I heard nothing but good stuff from the crowd. I think that the people who were disappointed had been given some bad info that led them to expect something else from this wonderful movie!</fullReview>

Mel Gibson is heartbreaking as the bereaved husband, and Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin shine as his sympathetic children. It was great to watch Joaquin Phoenix as a vulnerable jock who loves his brother and his brother's children and wants to help them anyway he can. Signs just isn't about the big bigger picture, but the smaller one. Yes, it scared me a bit and sadden me a great deal, because Shyamalan asks the question do you have hope and faith or don't you? (spoiler) That question haunts you through the entire movie as well as Mel Gibson's character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**** No Spoilers Here *********I just wanted to say that I read all the good/bad comments and decided to go see "Signs" with an open mind and no preconceived notions as to how the movie was going to be. I thought it was awesome! The suspense was incredible, and judging by the sold out theatre audience, they felt the same way. The tension and gasps in the theatre were amazing! There was also a lot of great humor and a nice message to the film.Go see it, with an open mind! By the way, my husband and 19 year old daughter loved it also and as people were exiting the theatre, I heard nothing but good stuff from the crowd. I think that the people who were disappointed had been given some bad info that led them to expect something else from this wonderful movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signs upon signs upon signs...A different SciFi Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan has definitely established a style and brand of his own(although I disagree with those who place him in the pantheon next to Spielberg, but he's getting there...)and with this film it should be noted that his name alone can open a film. This is a delightfully refreshing non-science fiction science fiction film, with a stunningly tense and tormentedly played lead by Mel Gibson, a strong and funny turn by Joaquin Phoenix, and two great kids playing kids you wish you knew,Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin.POSSIBLE SPOILERS:OK, so the trailers are misleading. But this movie starts in a sprint and gets to the action quickly and doesn't disappoint in the ET department. Hardcore Science Fiction fans may feel cheated in this department, but I am a proponent of the "less is more" philosophy.Sort of a "War of the Worlds" meets "To Kill a Mockingbird, the movie starts as a mystery saturated with sadness, turns heavily Science Fiction and the "things that go bump in the night" are a big part of that, but the tension holds up throughout, making this a film that is really about the four principle family members. Consider: very little action takes place off the family farm, leading to a sense of claustrophobia and creepiness.Fantastic in tiny but pivotal roles are Shyamalan himself and Patricia Kalember. In a film with seven speaking roles, Gibson and Phoenix included, that is saying a lot.Sure, the "Signs" referred to in the title are more spiritual than just crop circles, but you are never cheated; as in "Unbreakable" and "The Sixth Sense" if you look closely, the Signs are there in plain sight all the time. Otherwise, why would they have been written in the script?Funny, scary, touching, admirable and uplifting...all of what movies should be for...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And the moral of the story is....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>....you've got to have faith.Honestly, that's the most glaring thing that I remember from this movie. The last five minutes or so of the film reduce the whole thing to some kind of blatantly obvious morality play. As if one obvious statement of "moral" isn't enough, we get three of them in a row!Certainly, the film was very well done. I was definitely entertained by this thing. I don't regret spending my money on it at all. In fact, I was quite impressed by how little the movie relied on its special effects. It's nice to see a movie driven by pure acting and storytelling rather than flashy effects.The real problem that I have with this movie is that it isn't what I went to see. I went to see some kind of alien sci-fi thing...and that's not what Signs is. The whole crop circles thing is just a sub-plot. This movie is really about Father Graham's crisis of faith. It's all about learning to accept the bad as well as the good, and keeping your faith through it all. And again, if you don't pick that up during the movie itself you'll get it nailed into your skull during the last five minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie begins promisingly, has winsome performances, and admirably builds suspense for its first two acts. The ending seems rushed, is preposterous (it makes no sense on any level), and completely undermines the experience -- making you feel like you've been had and that you've just wasted your time, along with $10.Sixth Sense and Unbreakable both worked far better than this. The script needed three or four more passes.

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie an hour ago. I was amazed at the film, and correlatively saddened to find such a bad review of it on this site. So let me tell you why I disagree with the negative review. Let me say that I think the film is brilliant. M. Night has a real gift for bringing an audience along on the same journey as the character (Mel Gibson), like we did with Bruce Willis in 6th sense (but don't be tempted to box him in as a twist-ending one-trick pony). So the film itself is gorgeous. It's beautifully shot, and there is a reason that effects were limited, it WASN"T SUPPOSED TO BE CLASSIFIED AS A SCI-FI! I think thats why the previous reviewer was so dissapointed. He was expecting Inipendence Day 2 or something. The film is really about family, set against this particular situation. If you go in looking for Star Trek or something, you might give a similar review to the preceeding, but if you go in looking for a film with solid characters, an engaging story, a provacative premise, beautiful cinematagrophy, humor, drama, all seamlessly woven by a gifted writer/director and cast, SEE THIS MOVIE! Don't think of it as a horror or a suspense or a sci-fi thriller, think of it as a film, and you will surely appreciate it's elegence. I actually think I like this one better than sixth sense (which I liked better than Unbreakable). It really is a great movie and I can understand why the previous reviewer was left wanting more (he was expecting something he had already seen) and I encourage all to go see it. That's all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When my friends and I went to go see signs, I was expecting another crappy movie with small aliens, flying saucers, and stuff like that! I was dead wrong! "Signs" shows how every person (especially me) would view an alien! Tall, ugly creatures, with sharp teeth, and very, very, very hostile!

		<shortDescription>a test of faith...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>no... this movie trailers are not forthcoming as to the true nature of the subject of this film. do not go into the movies expecting "independence day" or a serious version of "MIB". the actual theme of the movie is one man's struggle to find the faith that he lost in god.i find the subject matter and the presentation of the topic wonderful and refreshing. the jist of the film is not the aliens, but the life that one family is living through the whole "alien ordeal", it's their interaction as a family and the non alien plot line that the movie is about. the movie is very suspenseful and eeerie.so... if you are expecting fireworks, alien gore and violence... go to another movie...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for fans of Men in Black</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this movie wasn't the flashiest sci-fi thriller put out by Hollywood in recent memory, it is one of the most thought out and carefully constructed movies I've seen(in fact, it shouldn't be listed in the Sci-Fi/Fantasy category at all).While it is more a film about faith and spirituality than it is little green men and crop circles, the movie still has the ingredients of a typical suspense/thriller: comedy, tension, suspense, mystery and terror. It mixes the elements of the extra-terrestrial with faith in the unknown.However, some movie-goers who are products of their generation( i.e. those who need to have every scene set-up and described; need every Boogie Man to have a personality, a cool outfit, and better weapon; and need every detail to be described again and again) will find this film not up to their liking when comparing it to such "aliens come to Earth classics" as Independence Day, Battle of the Planets and The Arrival. Rather, this is a thinking man's movie. M.Night Shyamalan has proven in his previous films the Sixth Sense and Unbreakable that old-fashion movie making is alive and well. The extent he relies on computer imagery is minimal if at all and instead uses lighting, camera angles and sound to tell the story and to relay the proper mood. For this reason, he is more in the mold of Alfred Hitchcock than Steven Speilberg and James Cameron. The movie requires the viewer to fill in some of the blanks, but the main point of the movie comes through loud and clear for those open to the message.For the MTV-Generation viewers expecting to see phasers, spaceship battles, gratuitous violence, and state-of-the-art costume designs: stay home. This merges a Hitchcock-like "The Birds" feel with an underlying theme of faith in the wake of tragedy. But if want to watch as a story unfolds and causes you to think and use your own feelings and imagination along the way to entertain you, then go spend the $9.00 and catch this at the theater. I won't hype it and say it was good or bad, but rather a simple: "go and see this movie."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the wonderful Sixth Sense and the equally beautiful (but unfortunately less successful) Unbreakable, Signs is M. Night Shyamalan's third big movie. Like in his previous two movies, Night creates a world which rules have already been set a long time ago (Ghosts, Super Heroes, Crop Circles), and places identifiable characters in it. Signs works on two levels:On the surface, Signs keeps you on the edge of your seat for the full 110 minutes. Not because of the expensive special effects, big explosions or massive fighting-scenes (don't expect Independence Day II), but because you care for the characters, and you know just as much as they do about what's going on: almost nothing.If you want to look further, the movie deals with some of the same topics Night addressed in his previous movies: characters dealing with their place in the world, and how to accept the world they're faced with. It also, through the doubts of the former reverend played by Gibson, deals with the question of how people find or lose faith. The movie, however, never gets preachy, and lets the viewer decide for himself how to interpret the events Gibson witnesses.The ending is something different for Night: not a complete surprise as in his previous two movies, but still something you will be talking about when you walk out of the theater. The music is wonderful, the cinematography is beautiful, the acting perfect: Signs is one of the best movies of this year so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sixth sense meets X-files</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really did not think Mel Gibson could handle a serious role like this, but he really did it. The title says "Signs", but its not only about the signs in the corn fields. Its more about the fact that every thing has a meaning, how ever strange the sign might be. This is a very good movie, without all the fast action special effects stuff. It's a real tribute to the old movies where you could scare, without actually showing anything, by just using lights and good acting. You can hear the scary things, you can see a clawed hand or see the blurry reflection of it on a television set. The story given to anyone else could have been a new "Independence Day", but Shyamalan has done it again. Like the sixth sense its a movie concentrated to good acting and cinematography. This is a film you can both enjoy on the big screen and on DVD or video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...a horrible embarassment of Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I have to say that I hoped that this movie would have faired better than "Unbreakable". __ POSSIBLE SPOILERS __ I came with the notion that this movie was about aliens and crop circles. However, I come to find out that the movie is hidden behind this facade to make people believe they are paying for a quality sci-fi movie. The whole alien and crop circle thing was about 15-20 minutes of the WHOLE movie. I mean, I had more fun watching the Learning Channel. Not to mention, the fact that the alien was nothing more than a horrible embarassment for Hollywood costume designers. Also, what is M.Night trying to be --- Hitchcock? I do not think so!! I gotta say that I did not think I was going to be any more disappoint with an M.Night movie as I was with "Unbreakable". I was dead wrong! M.Night needs to stick to writing Stuart Little!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HERE'S THE MOST HONEST REVIEW OF THIS FILM!! (No spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this film about an hour ago and I can tell you that this film is one worth your money definatly... When screening this film, I really payed attention to the directing and the storyline very closely. There is so many good camera angles and spooky sets that make this film very unique and "down to earth". I have to admit though that when i first saw this film that it wasn't exactly what I thought it would be like. The trailer overexaggerates the film, making the audience expect better when seeing the film.. I guarantee you'll be satisfied with the film, but don't expect tons of special fx or anything like big horror or gore... It's just a great film filled with unexpected moments and edge of your seat suspense.. I really enjoyed this film... I can't wait to see what M. Night Shyamalan comes up with next!! If you wanna know anything else about the film except spoilers, email me... AND I WILL TELL U THIS... MANY OF THE "SPOILERS" THAT HAVE BEEN POSTED ON HERE ARENT EXACTLY REAL... dont believe everything u hear about this movie as far as spoilers go.... enjoy the show!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guess what... The ending was a complete surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just returned from a preview of M.Nights 'Signs' and I am baffled. I was totally taken by the Sixth Sense, I appreciated Unbreakable a lot more than I like to admit, but I guess things changed with this movie.+++ Spoiler Alert +++I will not go into details with story and plot, only so far that i suspected a totally different ending. The plot concentrates on Gibsons character who had to endure the shock of losing his wife. This made him also lose his faith in god, and this means a lot for a preacher. I suspected that he also lost his mind to a certain degree, and when he discovered the first crop circle, his brain began playing tricks on him. I thought, the hole alien invasion was a hallucination. He subconciously was making it up, so that he could start to believe once more in divine powers. Well... I thought it might have been a cool plot twist to reveal the aliens as psychiatrist or something similar. Unfortunately M. Night decided otherwise.When the final scene faded without the expected plot twist, I was totally surprised and deeply disappointed. These aliens were so dumb, they could not have been real. The opportunity had been there, but the director had not taken it. Why?I just cannot imagine someone with M. Night's creative vision not to have seen this possibility to tie all the lose ends of his story together.+++ Spoilers End +++My conclusion of this movie: great photography and directing, but a script with major flaws... 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After Sixth Sense, I was hoping for much more than this from M. Night. Mel Gibson is usually reliable, but he let me down as well.Don't waste your money going to see this. It felt like a short story that was dragged out as much as possible, and filmed by high school students.The budget for this thing was most likely on par with Blair Witch project, and as the other person here commented, it felt like Blair Witch at times. Anyone out there could have filmed this thing with a rubber alien hand and a video camera.After watching this, you feel completely hollow inside. Don't be fooled, it's crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie! It is full of suspense and surprises and kept me on the edge of my seat until the credits rolled. The brief glimpes of "something" kept me wondering what was around the next corner. **The less you know about this movie going in the better.**This movie is nothing like Independance Day where the aliens are killing everything in sight. The snippits of information we do receive about the crop circles and the possibility of aliens are thru brief news clips on TV and rumors from town folk. Exactly like it would be if you were home alone. That kept the fear of the unknown that much higher. Not knowing what you are up against is often scarier than anything.I was also surprised how funny this movie was. The mixture of suspense and humor made it all the more fun to watch. The music was superb as well.Lastly, my only complaint of the movie was a distracting dialogue (during an extremely suspenseful scene) and the inability of the characters to stock up on weapons of some sort. This did not hurt my opinion of the movie much though.I give this movie a 9 out of 10 and declare it my favorite movie of the summer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A spellbinding, funny and tragic film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are few directors that I will go out and see a movie just because they directed it, regardless of the subject matter or who's in it. M. Night is now on my list. Movies can be picked apart on so many levels, even the greatest ones (Citizen Kane, Ben-Hur, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest etc...) I avoid second guessing anyone's work. So, dismiss the naysayers who didn't like this film. here's what I thought:Signs is in my top 5 of 2002. For a couple of hours, I visited a farm in Pennsylvania. I got to know a wonderful family. I laughed with them, got scared with them and even cried. SIGNS is indeed NOT the movie that the trailers portray. It's better. *******Possible spoilers follow********** I'll do my best not to reveal key plot points or surprises.In SIGNS, you get to know Graham hess, a former reverend who lost his faith in God after a terrible tragedy. He lives on a farm with his brother and his two children. A large crop circle is discovered on the farm's property. Confused, the police are contacted. It is deemed a prank until hundreds more are discovered all around the world. The most successful execution of the entire film is that it is told completely from the view of the family and through television and radio broadcasts, exactly the way we might all experience the same thing. I was reminded of my morning watching the September 11th attacks on the news several times during the film especially as Joaquin Phoenix sees footage from Brazil where "something" was caught on tape. His reaction of horror was astounding. IMDB doesn't allow me enough room to put all of my feelings down. I've really only just begun to touch on my review, but, let me at least get these points out: Mel Gibson is a phenominal actor with unending passion. Joaquin Phoenix has put in his best performance to date. His character is a real, living, breathing human being. Rory Culkin is destined to be the first Culkin in history to maintain a career in acting and little Abigail Breslin is a charm and beats out Drew Barrymore's E.T. performance 100 fold.M. Night, you are a fantastic storyteller. Directing a film is obviously not a job for you but a passionate means of telling great tales and drawing people into your world. Keep on making YOUR movies. If I could one day realize my dream of making movies, I'd want to make films like this.SIGNS is a PERFECT film. </fullReview>

What a disappointment.******** SPOILERS **********Major plot hole: aliens visit earth, they're intelligent enough to have mastered interstellar travel, but not smart enough to bring some raincoats. Come on... aliens you can defeat with a SuperSoaker(tm)! They came to conquer a planet and their only weapon is a tiny puff of poison gas?! These space flight capable aliens didn't bring anything with them strong enough to knock down a door?! And the final show down... what happened to the blazing speed the aliens had exhibited earlier in the movie?This should have been called "Unbelievable".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The latest from a contemporary master</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** NO SPOILERS ***With 'Signs,' M. Night Shyamalan creates his second picture since break-out 'The Sixth Sense,' and his masterful control over an intricate blend of humor, suspense, and intimate drama produce another truly great movie.Signs starts fast, moves fast, and finishes fast; but the film-making techniques give the movie a thoughtful pace. A few breaks from the main plot to explore a sub plot add to this feeling of slowness, but they are necessary as Shyamalan develops his characters. For those of you expecting a monster movie/slasher-style thriller; the movie is more about the internal of the characters and the strength of a family, but any Sci-Fi junky will tell you - that's the heart and soul of any good Sci-Fi flick. In movies, events surrounding the characters only exist to better develop personalities - making the events futuristic or scientifically epic is the only thing that separates such movies as "Sci-Fi." Bottom line on this one...if you handled the pace of Unbreakable, you've got a shot at liking Signs. If you liked Unbreakable, you should like Signs. If you got restless watching Unbreakable, Signs is probably not for you.I loved it. :) I give this one a big ****. 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan's most character-driven film to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** SPOILER FREE REVIEW ***Just saw "Signs" via a free sneak-preview. In my opinion it was Shyamalan's most character-driven film yet, and was also far more humorous than either The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable. While this made the film really enjoyable in one aspect, it also distracted me because I expected the same kind of tone and execution he utilized in previous films. That said, I still consider this movie to be worth the price of admission. I rate it about 7.5/10. It didn't excite me like his past two films did, but it was still better than most of the tepid summer fare.Thumbs up to whomever cast Joaqim Phoenix, he stole more than a few scenes in this one, and Mel Gibson proves once again that he's got a range few in his field can match.I really appreciate Shyamalan's willingness to explore imaginative and fun (but potentially disastrous) subjects like superheroes and crop circles, and I'm always intrigued by his ability to narrowly avoid falling into utter schlock. This film dances on the edge a little more than his previous two, but in many ways it succeeds in ways the others failed, namely by providing character depth and humorous interludes that break up some of the overly grave tones he's prone to.Taken on its own merits, I think the film is a worthy one, and it certainly entertained me. Unfortunately, many people expect every film the man makes to be a refilming of "The Sixth Sense", and the studios don't help matters with the ill-advised commercial themes which don't really give you a true sense of the kind of movie you're going to see. As with Unbreakable, my advice is to go into this film with no expectations, and you will probably enjoy yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that after watching a screening of this movie, I couldn't have been more disappointed. What looks like a great movie in the previews ends up playing out like it was written by a 10 year old. Obviously M. Night wanted to cash in on another blockbuster, not entertain his fans from sixth sense and unbreakable. I'd comment on the plot, but I'm not really sure there was one. Good acting is the only thing that kept me watching and not heading to the exits after the first half hour. If you watch a movie for the acting, then by all means go ahead and see this film, but if you watch a movie for the story, then this one will have you groaning with disgust long before the terribly disappointing ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signs, a realistic science fiction thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs comes as a refreshing break from the majority of recent science fiction thrillers that are too heavy on action sequences and CGI and too light on substance. M. Night Shyamalan masterfully tells the story of Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), a reverand who has abandoned his faith after the sudden death of his wife, set against the backdrop of an alien invasion of earth. The brilliance of this movie is Shyamalan's ability to keep the movie grounded within the moviegoer's reality, not the cinematic "reality" that we've come to expect from movies such as Independence Day. If an alien invasion were to happen, this is more than likely what it would look like. It is this reality that helps the film achieve the level of psychological spookiness that it does. Not since The Exorcist has a movie gotten into my head the way Signs did. That being said, those who come to the film expecting to see another Independence Day will likely be disappointed. This is not a story of an alien invasion so much as it is the story of Graham searching for his faith. Without divulging too much information about the ending, Signs climaxes in true Shyamalan style, a curveball revelation concerning an aspect of the main character (see The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable for reference). This film left me wholely satisfied and eagerly anticipation the next film from Shyamalan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was actually surprised by the movies' courage for clichs and quotations. I was expecting something new somehow but "sings" ist "just" a tribute to all those old 50s alien invasion b-movies. And it's NOT about the struggle of Hess' spiritual life. Maybe Shyamalan wanted the movie to be about that but in that point he failed. I even thought that the backflashes (*spoiler*: to his wife's accident) where useless, disturbed the rhythm and were the weakest part of the script in general.And don't expect that the secret (like the trailer promised) of the crop circles is going to revealed. The movie just gives a stupid theory (which is completely unbelievable and just a guess...). The crop-circles however aren't even the "signs" which refer to the title. That was just a fake. Shyamalan actually means "spiritual signs" (e.g. coincidences which just cannot be coincidence...) but the "sings" he uses in this movie are not convincing and therefore the (spoiler warning!!!) change from faithless ex-father to faithful Reverend isn't convincing either. I even was a little annoyed by it since I count myself to the "first kind of people" and I am not really filled with fear...Anyway. The suspense is great. Shyamalan uses his now well-known style of "simplicity". You often hear more than you see. And that works perfectly. It shows that you don't need big special effect to create suspense.The story is weak, has some really really deep plotholes but it carries the character through it. Mostly because of the actors (especially the little ones) who give a nice performance.I found "sings" entertaining and thrilling. The subplot (for me is the subplot the spiritual search of Hess and not vice versa!) was a very good idea but it would have been better to raise another question: do you fall back into praying and believing when you life gets threaten and you think the world could end? Is that true faith? But the movie avoids those question. You can see from the very beginning that Shyamalan is a person who believes in miracles.Overall: far better than most of the summer-block-busters. And even better than Panic Room (comparing the thrill-factor). And for sure the best X-Files episode ever. (:I would gave it: 7 or 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Should I Care?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I had been looking forward to seeing this movie- in my opinion, nothing has warranted much hype this year since "Spider-man". I attended a screening already disappointed by one fact I had been warned about (if your interested, I'll put it at the end with a spoiler warning), but still slightly optimistic.I left "Signs" feeling very glad that I hadn't paid the $10 for it. I have never cared before, but found myself very concerned that the character development was horrible! Why did I care about these people? Just because they lost their matriarch in a horrible (and completely non-logical) way? That just couldn't cut it for me... I was glad to see Mel Gibson playing a role where he acts his age rather than trying to act forever the "hunk", but the rest of the characters were totally shallow.***POTENTIAL SPOILERS***My original disappointment before I even came to the theater? I knew that aliens would be seen. I'm a firm believer in leaving scary things up to the imagination, and hence yielding more scared movie-goers. On the other hand, the first time you see an alien (via a children's birthday party home video on the news), it seems believable. The "home video" quality seems accurate, and the fear in the people filming seems genuine.But after the film you leave with few answers to many questions... How does Shyamalan's character figure out the water thing so easily? Why so much build-up with Bo's water obsession? What the heck did that alien do to Morgan? Perhaps the least believable: "Father, we decided since your wife is pretty much severed in half by a truck that we'd just leave her there until you got here, so you can watch her die!"

The most unbelievable part is that a former reverend who no longer believes in his God after watching his wife die, would suddenly believe again after surviving an alien invasion!***END SPOILERS***BOTTOM LINE: If you can see this for free, do it.

		<shortDescription>Awesome Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan struck gold with this movie. A movie that will certainly be around for a while and never forgot about. A movie that has all of the genres of a good movie: drama, thriller, horror, suspense, a little hint of comic relief, and many other. Everyone did such a wonderful job on this movie crew and definitely cast. Mel Gibson as Gramb Hess and Joaquin Phoenix as Gramb's younger brother. Even the kids did really well Rory Culkin as Morgan and Abigail Breslin as Bo. I so do recommend this movie to every one who wants to see a good movie like they haven't in a while then this one.GO SEE IT!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signs screener review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie to be entertaining, suspenseful, and well worth seeing. Its kind of an homage to Close Encounters and Night of the Living Dead. However, it really doesn't stack up to Sixth Sense, or even Unbreakable for that matter. You might think it unfair to compare his films this way, citing the fact that they are all about very different subjects, but I think they're going to be compared this way until Shyamalan matures as a screenwriter, and does something new. All three of his films have used a very similar formula so far, the most important element being the shocking revelation at the end. I think he really needs to stop relying so heavily on this element, because his revelations are becoming much less shocking with each successive film. There's just no way he's going to top 'Sense', and I really think he should just stop trying, and move on.Just something else I noticed, it seems to that Shyamalan really wants to act, his cameos just keep getting bigger in each of his films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spooky and heartfelt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just recently saw this movie at an early screening. I have previously seen M. Night Shyamalan's other 2 films and expected some thing very much the same. Long, drawn out scenes that are very suspenseful and close ups that are close enough to make you sick half the time. But i was surprised with what i encountered. Indeed, the movie is nothing like what you would expect after seeing the preview. Of course it does have to do with crop circles and aliens, but the core of the story is a man finding himself after being lost. Mel Gibson is an amazing actor and proved once again that he can be a vulnerable father figure. Joaquin Phoenix was also cast perfectly as Gibson's younger brother.I dont want to give away to much of the story, but Signs is well worth the time it takes to watch the film. Its rare that a film so blatantly tugs on the human heart and metaphorically shows us how the bad things in life all happen for a reason. 10/10. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised with this movie, I did not have any expectations in particular -Actually I didn't have much of a clue about the plot, I only new the cast, when I decided to see it. Perhaps that's why it was such a positive surprise to me....No hype to get my hopes up.Anyway, though I've seen better acting, the nicely paced suspense draw me into the horror of the movie and made me feel the Hess family's fear; I could place myself in their shoes.The plot is little thin and remarkably close to "War of the Worlds". But somehow it works, although it doesn't seem as original as Shyamalan's other manuscripts.Though it's not the greatest film I've ever seen, it's way above the mainstream Hollywood films -and one of the best of it's genre, I've seen in a long time.I gave this film an 8, which, by my definition, is pretty high.Go see this one -I enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamlan's Most Underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs is directed by M. Night Shyamalan, a name that used to mean that we are in for a real treat at the movies, considering he had brought us The Sixth Sense. Signs is probably, in my opinion, the second best M. Night Shyamalan movie, after The Sixth Sense.It tells the story of one family as they try to investigate and piece together what caused the huge signs left in their crop field, which eventually turns out to be the act of an alien invasion. That alone is a simple plot, nothing we haven't seen before, with aliens and all of that weird stuff. However, the film remarkably focuses on the moral dilemma of the family instead of just aliens blowing things up and whatnot. This allows for some great storytelling, as we get some great exploration of the emotional crisis the family is caught in the middle of.One thing this movie gets a lot of criticism for is the fact that the aliens' weakness is water, and that it makes no sense for them to travel to a world that is 70% water. My argument is that the aliens may not have known the Earth was covered in water, as surely there are other blue planets out there.The other major concern people have about this movie is the way that the two kids act. Unlike the water issue, this one does bother me a bit like the majority of people. The kids consistently say things that no normal child would say. Their language feels very out of place, when they remark things like, "everything they wrote in science books is about to change", or "the water has his amoebas in it". It's just not how 8 to 10-year-old kids talk. I have nothing against the actors, but this does become an issue after a while.Despite that criticism, Signs outshines that because of how extraordinarily creepy it is. It's simply a very riveting story that will leave you on the edge of your seat. The scares work the way they need to: they give the audience chills and allow them to crave more. It's some great cinematic work what they manage to pull off.All in all, Signs is a frightening, exciting thriller that will surely deliver the thrills.Rating: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A crisis of faith and an alien invasion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Protagonist Graham Hess is a former priest who lost is faith after the death of his wife; he lives in rural Pennsylvania with his brother Merrill and children Morgan and Bo. Strange things start to happen straight away; overnight a series of giant crop circles appear in his corn field and his dog suddenly becomes violent. At first he assumes the crop circles were the work of local youths but soon the TV reports that similar patterns are appearing all over the planet. It isn't long before everybody becomes certain that they are a precursor to the appearance of aliens; the question is will they be friendly or will they have sinister intentions.While this isn't writer/director M. Night Shyamalan's best film it is still entertaining. Early on there is a good sense of mystery as we wonder what is the cause of the strange events and even when the TV reports that aliens are definitely behind them it is possible to wonder how reliable these reports will be? at least to anybody looking out for Shyamalan's inevitable twist. There are plenty of other things to wonder about; why does the young girl Bo leave glasses of water around the house and do Graham's wife's enigmatic last words have any real meaning to mention just a couple. While the film isn't really scary there are plenty of tense moments as well as some pretty funny ones. The cast does a decent job and it was nice to have child characters that weren't overly precocious. Some people will have a problem with the ending but I think if it is possible to accept a plot involving invading aliens it shouldn't be impossible to accept a resolution with a religious dimension. It was interesting to see an alien invasion film from the perspective of a small family group that decides to batten down the hatches at home rather than following those involved in fighting the aliens or a family caught up in a mass exodus fleeing the aliens; this gives the film a more intimate feel as for the most part it concentrates on just four characters. Overall I'd recommend this to any fans of Shyamalan's other films.</fullReview>

So it dawned on me this was an alien invasion flick, little did I realise that NOT clearly showing the creature, until the end made it very bloody creepy. The first time it was fully viewed in a reflection on the TV screen (ie hinted at) scared the s.h.i.t out of me. Also sounds of them running around the house trying to get in were really very hair raising.Brilliant special effects, wonderful score and terror begat of the viewer's imagination.Great acting from Gibson, Phoenix and especially the two children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Signs" Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Signs" is a 2002 American science fiction thriller film written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. The story focuses on a former Episcopal priest named Graham Hess who discovers a series of crop circles in his cornfield. Hess slowly becomes convinced that the phenomena are a result of extraterrestrial life. It stars Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin.I was eager to return to "Signs" after seeing the film a good number of years back. One, because I remember liking the film for being a well made thriller with a great sense of dread. And two, because of how the film has divided people in recent years, mostly due to the film's logic at the ending. Form where I stand, "Signs" is a masterfully told thriller, that contain real human emotions that makes the film both terrifying, and heartfelt.First off, I love how the story is told from this family point of view. It makes "Signs" feel realistic, and let us see the events taking place as they are seeing it. Also making the film seem real is the buildup. Instead on using it big guns at the beginning and ruin the suspense, it shows us information slowly, and grows the sense of dread in a chilling manner. The film lack of CGI unless needed is highly appreciated. Shyamalan's direction makes the story feel small scale, which works with the events that takes place, and wonderfully maximizes the tension throughout the film. To avoid repetition in my points, "Signs" less is more approach makes the film feel fresh, and not overly relied on cheap scares. Instead, the film builds it scares through the details given, and greatly done buildup. Simply put, I'm going to have trouble sleeping tonight, and I have to applaud the movie for being to able to do that.The family themselves I found very engaging. They are going through a major conflict that is easy to relate to, and care for. I was interested to see how bad things would go for them in this rather chaotic situation. Plus they seem like real people, as while for most of the film they are completely terrified, they add a few funny lines to lighten the situation. "Signs" is not a comedy, but a nice dose of humor gives the film levity to make it feel more human. The performances are great, with Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix especially giving subtle, but emotionally powerful performances, that again, make the characters feel human.And that word is likely, among with the scares, is what I think is the best part of "Signs", form the storytelling, to the characters, and from how the film is told from a visual point of view, it all feels human, and heartfelt. It a story about faith, losing it, and regaining it. Truth to be told, I had tears. Not man-tears, just tears of joy and happiness. For a director that has not been on the top of his game of as of late, M. Night Shyamalan had a great love, and even still, for the work he does. Even with his recent films, I feel that at the very least, that he is still trying. In my opinion, I feel he should stick to making films that are on a smaller scale, as he seems more comfortable working with films that are on a small budget. If I have any complain about "Signs", it's that even though the films' themes of coincidence and faith are effectively handled overall, I felt at a few points that seem to go a little bit too beyond than where they should have stay.As for the lack of logic with the ending, I have to say that this is a story told from one's family perspective. and "Signs" is going for a less is more approach. It not aliens going to Earth, but how one family handles that aliens arriving to Earth. If you want a more in depth look at "Signs", watch YouTube movie reviewer, Chris Stuckmann fantastic analysis on the film. What I would have say, he says that in a much more detailed and organized fashion better than what I could hope to do.Link to Chris Stuckmann video on "Signs" www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3Ju05PuiyQ</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Signs is a very good sci-fi thriller! The first time I watched it I was in complete suspense through out the entire movie. The second time I viewed the movie I picked up things I missed the first time watching - which made the film even better than watching it the first time around. Strangely, I was more thrilled and scared on the second viewing! Signs has a great cast who played their roles very believably - which is one of the things I enjoyed about this film. The actors did a great job at catching my attention and pulled me deeper into the movie with them.The story is good and plausible, in my opinion, if aliens really did exist and came to earth.I think this a great prime time movie.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loved Sixth Sense like everyone else. Didn't enjoy Unbreakable at all. Hence, when Signs came along, despite it being the only film I recall the director getting positive reviews for other than "Sense", I waited for a TV showing and am glad I saved my money...It's an odd film. Really odd. It's not bad, it's not good it's just...odd. The children act like they have Asperger's syndrome they are so brittle and disconnected and odd... The father is odd and his younger brother is odd...Why do people refer to Mel as "Father" and want to "confess" to him when his character isn't Catholic? Why did the director cast himself and thereby shatter our collective suspension of disbelief? Why does the director's character head off to the lake because he's heard the aliens don't go there?...heard it from whom exactly??? How did he trap an alien in his kitchen cupboard before he went? I will let others rant about the glaring plot holes --they didn't occur to me at the time I was watching the movie. It's just not a satisfactory entertainment. Ill-thought through to the point of being delusional. And odd. Above all else, it's odd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good... but not in the way you might expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first M. Night Shyamalan picture I saw was "the sixth sense", it was excellently directed and managed to be scary using both strong visual images, psychological horror and of course, a great twist.when it came to watching this, I was hoping for more of the same, however I must say that this is a league away from the Sixth sense, but not necessarily in a bad way. The film kind of feels like a mainstream scary movie, and as a result of this isn't actually scary at all (the part with the alien holding the kid was just laughable), however Shyamalan makes the story compelling and there are several moments of tension, for example when Mel Gibson is in the crop field or when the family are arguing at dinner.It's although worth mentioning that the movie is quite funny at times, for example Joaquin Phoenix explaining (his delivery of this line is great) that "crop circles are made by a bunch of geeky guys with no girlfriends and too much spare time".Overall, it's relatively entertaining and probably worth seeing, just don't expect anything earth shattering</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I happened to be in a video store the other day, and was in line behind a couple of girls who were discussing scary movies. The movie "Signs" was mentioned, and they both chimed up about the fact that the movie did not scare them, and was a terrible horror movie. If they were to have watched it with more of an open mind, however, they would realize that the movie did not have the intention to scare viewers. As with all of M. Night's movies, they strive to draw you in, and once he has your full attention, show you something that will make you stop and realize that what you are watching is not just another movie.M. Night Shamalyn succeeds on so many levels.The movie is not about an alien invasion...it is about a family's love for one another, and the fact that those who maintain blind faith in God will shine brighter than others.Everything happens for a reason. Whether it is Graham's wife dying, Merrill holding the strikeout record, Bo's obsession for clean water, or Morgan's asthma. It will all tie in at the end and show you something so beautiful that will make you think and wonder for many days after the end credits.I give this movie a 10...simply because it is one of the best displays of talent I have ever witnessed, and only hope that M.Night Shamalyn continues to make masterpieces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beware: major pitfall ahead!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Minor spoilers below. But you probably read through 20 spoiler comments anyway to reach this one.It's surprising that the highest rated comments on this movie are all "hated it" comments. Or maybe it's not that surprising after all. As you can see, all these comments tell the same thing (which makes me wonder why even the 10th one is still rated 'useful'). The conclusion: "this is a very bad sci-fi movie about incredibly stupid aliens (and a stupid dog too)."They're right, as a sci-fi movie this is not quite it. The plot holes are bigger than the crop circles. However, all these people are somehow missing the point, but they can't be blamed. Why is this? Well, the problem with this movie is that from the time it was announced on, people thought it would be a sci-fi movie revolving about an alien invasion and nothing else. It isn't, but this is never obvious enough.Some reviewers get it right: this movie is actually about belief. The alien story is just a vehicle. This is why everyone expecting an alien movie will be heavily disappointed at the end. It's a typical Shyamalan film in that it tries to set you on the wrong track, but it's atypical in that it's poorly executed.I think Shyamalan's biggest mistake was to eventually resort to showing more of the aliens than just some shadows and indirect hints, or even making it so obvious that there were aliens after all, and what their intentions were. There's no better way to ruin a whole suspenseful build-up based on concealment, than to show the evil in all its CGI glory and having a TV set telling what its plans are. The fact that at some point in this movie an alien is shown in its entirety, has helped to feed the misunderstanding that it's just a bad alien movie. For the conclusion of the story as it is, showing the alien was almost inevitable. But the same kind of story could have been told without having to lift the veil of mystery around the aliens. All the gigantic plot holes that so many people have fallen into, would have been avoided if we never knew what -- and who -- exactly was behind those crop circles. People could have made up their own explanations, and as everyone knows, in the absence of ready-made (CGI) answers, people come up with much more captivating ideas on their own. People would have left the theater, still wondering about the mysteries. But instead, we are spoon-fed with a pretty weak sci-fi story which at some point made me remember the movie "Independence Day". That's IMHO not a bad movie, but this one being associated with it, is.My conclusion: the first part is really good. The build-up of suspense works well and there are some truly scary moments. But soon, the first holes in this build-up begin to appear, and eventually it all crumbles. The finale is embarrassing.Considering Shyamalan's track record, it probably was intentional to make people believe they're watching an alien movie, and then shatter this belief and reveal the true identity of the movie. But the belief is never shattered because it _is_ an alien movie after all, and not a good one at that. All that remains, is disbelief why it was such a bad alien movie, and the actual point of the story is forgotten. Compared to the rest of the movie, the parts about the actual story even seem (pun intended)... alien.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, suspenseful, thought-provoking film that people JUST DON'T GET!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Signs' is one of Shyamalan's best movies because it is atmospheric, suspenseful and eerie from start to finish but is also a compelling tale of fate, which many people don't seem to understand.All people seem to take away from this movie is that 'water kills the aliens?!?!?!? why invade a planet that is literally made of water?, why harvest humans who are mostly made of water?' and 'how can these aliens master space travel and not be able to break down wooden pantry doors?!?!?' etc etc when in fact this has little to do with the plot.You need to look at the bigger picture. It's about the lead characters journey in the film, from having faith, to losing it, to finding it again. It revolves around the theme that everything happens for a reason (which is PRECISELY WHY the aliens who have an aversion to water invade a planet that is mostly made out of it), looking out for the 'signs' is also why the girl conveniently leaves glasses of water all over the house and why the boy has asthma as it ends up saving his life! For all those who dislike this film, just remember that it is not about the aliens. It's so much deeper than that. Shyamalan is a master storyteller but when his stories don't seem to make sense or appear to be ridiculous, look a little deeper as his themes and morals are often disguised in his intricate and visually stunning films.Beautiful, over-looked,under-rated gem. 8/10!</fullReview>

These are just some of the feelings and memories that this movie invokes in me. Original, cheesy, frightening, awkward, with lasting appeal. Sounds weird but i use this movie to inspect people personalities. I ask them, "do you like the movie signs." If they say no, it seems I tend to dislike that person. If they say "yes", or even "it was pretty good." I tend to like that person. To me, if someone likes or dislikes this movie it says something about their personality. It's like there is a psychological profile embodied throughout the movie and when people watch it there is a varying quality of likes and dislikes inherent in the viewers. More so for this movie then any other movie I have seen. It seems extreme but there is something about this movie that sets it apart from anything I have ever seen. Absurdly enough, tell me what you think. Am i full of s**t, or is their someone else out their as weird as I am.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-composed but the sloppy ending and illogic are unforgivable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shylmalan is excellent in one, and ONLY one, area of film-making ? namely in establishing a tense mood in his films. This is done throughout Signs just like it is done in The Sixth Sense and in Unbreakable. There is a certain slow and suspenseful pace achieved through devices such as visuals and score that builds up great tension in these films and this is indeed hard to rival, and for that, Mr. Shylmalan deserves some credit. At everything else, however, he is simply not that good at.This is, you guessed it, another suspenseful mystery thriller with a twist or two ? this time with sci-fi elements. It is the story of crop circles outside a family's home in Pennsylvania and all that these bring with them. If you disregard the fact that these crop circles had in reality been exposed as a sham well before this film was made, then Signs makes them seem pretty scary. Again, the mood and build-up are paid great detail to and this will definitely keep your attention unless you have ADHD. Some visuals from Signs have remained with me, like the first time Joaquin Phoenix's character is watching the news in the closet and it shows footage of one of the aliens, captured at a birthday party in Mexico. The moment the alien walks past?and it is not even a moment?is one of the scariest visuals I can think of.My problem with Signs is that Shylmalan is convinced that any "mystic" idea that pops into his head will automatically translate into a compelling mystery story on screen. He is so convinced, in fact, that he goes to great lengths to invent his own absurd logic to facilitate his story. For example, what lead to the demise of the alien invasion: "They're allergic to water". Alright, so now we know. Except it's not POSSIBLE to inhabit earth for a minute without getting exposed to the water vapor in the air, or running through corn fields without getting the dew on the leaves of the cord. Seriously, they're allergic to WATER? This has to be one of the biggest cop-outs in film history.Because the resolution of Signs is so disappointing, it detracts from the otherwise suspenseful and well-crafted moods. No doubt the majority of the things in this film work quite well and this earns an above average rating - but the sloppy ending and its illogic are unforgivable. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film (much like Shyamalan's other films)that requires a viewers full focus, and heightened sense of awareness. Other movies of this genre tend to go too far over the top with the "creep factor" in the place of a good storyline. Because there was no dead girl slithering out of a well and "the creatures" fail to tear the Hess family limb from bloody limb. The concept of this movie can easily be lost on those of a..shall we say...simple minded nature. Shayamalan's characters (Gibson and Phoenix, mainly) each have their own separate issues coming into this story. Creating "sub-plots" here and there that cause the viewer shift his/her focus away from the aliens, to the human characters. Thus, enhancing the element of surprise when, such creatures, make an appearance. The fact that as a viewer, you are not bombarded with special effects, or CGI creatures at every turn, creates frightening circumstances, and causes the viewer to constantly expect something (anything) to happen at any given moment. The way Shyamalan limits the viewer's sightings of the "beings" is cause for praise. In the every last scene of this movie, everything, every element, every piece of dialogue fits together like a complete jigsaw puzzle. Even things that appear to be most insignificant suddenly have this profound meaning. A fact which is no cause for surprise given the writer. However for those who fail to see this fact should either re-watch this film, or watch something "a little deeper"...hmm, perhaps "Saw I&amp;II" should do the trick.No other film out there has ever evoked the feeling of shear terror in the pit of the stomach of the viewer on the level in which Signs does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost, but not quite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's quite a stigma surrounding M. Night Shyamalan's directorial style. At this point, he's made more bad movies than good, and for many people, it was Signs where he went off the rails.That is definitely true.But here's the deal, okay: for the first, say, 90 minutes of its 106 minute run time, Signs is actually a really, legitimately good movie. It very slowly builds a fantastic sense of dread. You feel intimately connected with these characters. The small, tiny glimpses you get of creatures are genuinely frightening.If all you ever saw was the first 90 minutes of Signs, you'd be convinced that M. Night is an under-appreciated genius. I unabashedly LOVE those 90 minutes.But then you get to the last 10 minutes. The movie goes to pull the brakes, and the lever snaps off. What follows, obviously, is a trainwreck. The movie gets to its "message," the trademark M. Night "big twist," and it is absurd and convenient to an almost offensive degree. Every shred of good will built up by this movie is obliterated. There are no survivors. The last 10 minutes almost feel like they fell out of a different movie.But it's not from a different movie. Signs alludes to its forthcoming narrative suicide all over the place. It might "make sense" in the context of what the movie is obviously trying to say, but that doesn't mean it is any less ridiculous.I want to love Signs. I almost kind of do, still. But it is really hard to pretend that those last 10 minutes do not exist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot understand why some people hate Signs so much. This movie is extremely well-directed, acted, and the plot is very well developed. Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phenix, Rory Culkin, and even Abigail Bresnan turn in great performances. The visuals are pretty good, and Shyamalan never fails to keep you on the edge of your seat. The suspense rarely lets down, and when it does, we are given some comic relief. The last half-hour of the movie is heart-pounding and well paced. The last 15-5 minutes, however, are heart stopping. The aliens, although they are rarely seen, add to the sense of suspense and fear. Graham's feeling of no one watching over them makes for some good moments, especially at the dinner table scene towards the end. Now, I'm not saying Signs is perfect. It tries too hard to be scary sometimes, and the *ULTIMATE SPOILER AHEAD* fact that water destroyed the aliens is lazy writing. The ending could have been better if there were more aliens at the end, instead of just one.Overall though, this is a great one by M. Night Shyamalan. Check it out.Overall rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>two stories, one conclusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Signs' is a film about a widowed father and minister from rural America. The film combines two stories: one of the father and his ability to deal with his wife's death while making sense of the alien invasion through the eyes of his religion. The other story is more science-fiction in nature with people hiding in horror as they try to overcome the aliens and protect themselves. The film has some lessons to learn and settles the story in a way that encompasses both plots together nicely. The family-life plot was a little too slow moving for me, and it felt forced and silly/patriotic/sympathetic. It humanized the main character too much, and it distracted from the science-fiction part of the film. Special effects were also done well and were believable. The aliens did look frightening, and showing less in some instances was more because it made the story seem even more frightening and realistic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hello everybody! In the sense of a thriller the film was actually good; I was shaking a lot through this movie. But I just really hated the point in it! We have to imagine that the aliens went back into outer space, cause the film only showed that the aliens were afraid of water! The actual point with this film was that the father began to believe again... So whats with the aliens!?! If they were just there to fill out some of the time, well... then I think this film could just as good have been without the aliens! Whats the point of making people believe that this film is about aliens, if it was only about the father believing again! But I think that there were a lot of very good comments in this movie! Especially from the father! And some good facts about aliens, too! Cheer up! In the big sense this movie was actually good enough! :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good beginning, then extremely disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beginning was OK - light humor, good tension, a real pleasure to watch.As the time passed, the movie gets worse and worse, forcing one nonsense after the other down the throats of the poor helpless audience.I know, that it is not necessary for a movie to be logical, but please - it does need a bare minimum at least! Here some of the most obvious goofs/annoyances:1. Aliens communicating at baby-phone frequencies, so that our heroes can listen to their communication. Even worse, the movie-makers didn't even find it necessary to come up with something that at least sounds good, they are simply playing some random noise in exceedingly long, as well as completely unnecessary scenes.2. Why the hell did they show themselves in the night (the lights floating above cities), and then decided to hide themselves during the day? Just so that the "dead pigeon" proof can be used? It was not even very original.3. They get burned by water, and yet they run around completely naked, on a planet, where water is just about *everywhere*.4. Speaking about naked - they also seem to be un-armed: an alien race, attacking earth, is effectively stopped by a rotten old basement door. Extremely convincing.5. So, they're on the raid. What the hell did they look for on a farm with 4 poor souls? Were they out for ex-reverends? Old amateur league baseball bats?6. On the one hand, they can run and jump way faster/higher than normal people can. On the other hand, they seem to be so fragile, that one weak strike with a knife can instantly cut their fingers off.7. Why did the aliens go away? No explanation. Why, exactly, did they come? No explanation.I could go on and on, but I guess you get my point.The whole flick serves only one purpose: it's a religious propaganda movie, with the ending so predictable ("the fallen reverent finds his faith again") that it makes one sick in the stomach.Rubish, rubbish, rubbish - I wasted 2 hours of my life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie in Spanish with English subtitles at an orphanage in Tijuana this past Sunday. It was pure standard formula. The kids laughed at some of the scenes that were supposed to be scary while I jumped (maybe a cultural or age thing or both - lol).The weird shapes on the DVD cover and Gibson make it seem more interesting that it really was.I looked it up on here and was shocked to see it was made in 2002. It looked so budget (partly due to the old projection TV) that I would have guessed it was made in the late 80's or early 90's.No redemption, no higher moral ground gained, Not plot twister. Endless time wasting footage. It try's to play on your fear to keep you going and count on you being a couch potato. It's main goal was to make money not entertain you. Gibson must have been like a 10000 gorilla getting a see-saw with the rest of the cast and crew and blasting over the moon... A thousand dollars for Mel, $1 for everyone and everything else.I'm Catholic like Gibson; the little bits of religion tossed in were a joke. The ending was very formula predictable, I even guessed close to what the solution was without watching (I asked someone how it finally ended). Skip-it with confidence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of M. Night Shyamalan and immensely enjoyed his other three films. However, I feel that all the things which were great about "The Sixth Sense", "The Village", and "Unbreakable" are contrasted by the disappointing and predictable "Signs". This film would be considered a dud for an ordinary director, but I am especially disappointed since it was made by a higher caliber of filmmaker in M. Night Shyamalan. Almost all of the elements that make his other films great are missing from "Signs". To me, this movie seems like a cheap imitation of Shyamalan's other three films. There is a small number of redeeming factors which I will get to first, however they are few and far between. First of, as in all of his other films Shyamalan does a great job of directing. I really enjoy the way he uses the camera and the abstract angles at which he prefers to shoot some of his scenes. The only other aspect of this movie that I liked was Mel Gibson's performance. There are only a handful of other actors that can bring so much humility and sincerity to a character. Gibson truly is a superb actor and his performance is absolutely top notch. The compliments, however, pretty much end here.One of the most disappointing things about this film is that the plot simply doesn't hold water (no pun intended for those who've seen it). You watch it for two hours and at the end you're left wondering what truly was the point. Shyamalan attempts to convey a message of belief, or the loss of, in God and in other things that human beings have been debating over for thousands of years. Yet it's hard to take away any kind of serious message when you're looking at some alien that belongs in a corny 1950's horror film. Simply put, this message along with the film both miss the mark completely. Unlike the other three Shyamalan films, "Signs" left me completely devoid of any true feelings or thoughts. I think that "Stuart Litte" (which was written by M. Night) had a more profound message than did "Signs". What is most disappointing is that like them or not, Shyamalan's other films at least made you think. "Signs", on the other hand, only made me wonder what it was that Shyamalan was thinking when he made this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate to differ with the other people commenting on this movie but I was starting to wonder if we had watched the same show. I even watched it over completely to make sure I didn't miss anything but it was just a terribly directed movie with unbelievable characters. As much as I like Mel Gibson and I believe he is an outstanding actor he could not save this one. You would think that if the world was about to go to war with a highly advanced alien race that were as horrifying as the ones they showed in the movie the children might have showed some emotion but it was so matter of fact it was hard to feel there was ever any danger. I believe it could have been a better movie with someone else at the wheel and if it weren't for the outstanding cast this would have made Ed Wood look good. I watched this film when it was released to video and everyone that I talked to about it had basically the same opinion, saying they waited thinking the story was about just about to take off and redeem it through the whole movie but it just never happened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I waited a few years to see this film. I'd heard that the director was excellent. But boy, was I in for a surprise. This is one of the biggest pieces of cinema garbage I've ever seen.Mel Gibson just can't seem to prevent himself from preaching these days. He gets his chance here, but that's about all that happens. Bad things happen, and he loses is faith. Then some coincidences happen and he regains it. Jeez, buy a lottery ticket, Mel.As for the 7.1/10 rating this film is currently sporting on this site, I'd like to know how since almost all of the reviews I read are scathingly bad. No way is this piece of sappy non-sci-fi worth anywhere near that sort of rating.I must be missing the point. However reading the scant handful of reviews that had positive things to say didn't help much. All I got was comments about the wonderful cinematography, which I honestly didn't notice. God, this film is so boringly shot that you could do it on a domestic video camera with 10 minutes training. But nobody has bothered to explain what was going on. Was there a good reason to use water as the aliens' weak spot, since it's been acknowledged by almost everyone that water is one of the most abundant chemical compounds on the planet, not to mention plenty of other planets in the solar system? Someone please explain.God, why am I wasting time even asking? This thing is a turkey, plain and simple. Religious stupidity from Mel the Saviour, cutesy child actors, and aliens that melt. It's downright painful.And that 7.1 must be from rigged voting. There's no other answer.</fullReview>

Nobody could save this pitiful script.Please stop me if anyone has an answer for these GAPING plot holes:1. A highly advanced alien species has come to Earth. They are so highly advanced that they have cloaking devices for their spaceships, rendering their city-sized ships completely invisible. Yet... they roam around the planet completely naked without any pieces of technology what-so-ever.2. Also.. these naked aliens are highly sensitive to water. So sensitive it burns them like concentrated acid. Yet they wander around NAKED on a planet covered with water (acid), with water vapor (acid) in the air, and water (acid) pouring from the sky. And they are capturing creatures (humans) that have water (acid) pouring out of faucets and hoses and sprinkler systems. The humans also can spit water (acid), bleed water (acid - blood is mostly water), and so on. Yet, these NAKED HIGHLY ADVANCED aliens aren't smart enough to even put on a Hefty bag? Or a rain coat? They run around naked? Are you @#%&amp;$#*% kidding me?3. They use corn fields for planetary navigation... Riiiiiiggghhhtttt... So we could all mow our lawns and this advanced alien race would suddenly be lost? I think any species that has mastered interplanetary travel would probably find a better navigation system than leaving symbols in grassy fields. You know.. latitude and longitude.. or maybe a computer system of some sort.. GPS, theirs or take over ours... Something. Just not corn fields. Please.4. About a dozen of these highly advance aliens try to get to Mel and family in the basement of their house.. yet a board and some nails stops them. Once again.. Interplanetary travelers with city sized ships that can be rendered invisible.. stopped by a board and some nails. Apparently they have not invented the cro-bar on their planet.5. The Nightly News actually said something like this: "A group of people have figured out how to defeat the aliens attacking our planet... more on that after these messages..." Are you kidding? Someone figure out that you can throw WATER on the aliens invading our planet and the news doesn't tell everyone IMMEDIATELY?I could go on...

		<shortDescription>Not suspenseful, not exciting, not logical...but well acted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Gibson's powerful screen presence is the only thing that saves this dismal attempt at a scifi suspense thriller. We are intended to accept Gibson as a former priest (presumably Episcopalian or Eastern Orthodox, since he has been married and has children) who renounced his faith because of a personal tragedy. Then we are to believe that he and his family being scared out of their wits by an extraterrestrial invasion will provide the impetus for him to regain his faith. Well, maybe it would, but I think finding out that we are not alone in the universe would have the opposite effect on most people.There are several unexplained and illogical elements in the plot. For example, why does his young daughter have a phobia about drinking water? We know plotwise why she does, because all the undrunk water around the house comes in handy later in a plot device I won't reveal, but why does she have such a phobia in the first place? Why does the mere unseen but suspected presence of the extraterrestrials cause a beloved family dog to become viscious enough to try to kill the little girl, forcing her young brother to stick a knife in him, and cause the other dog to be tied up, but appear to have no such effect on humans? And what is Mel going to do with all that corn? He lives on a one crop farm with acre upon acre of corn, but there don't appear to be any farm implements anywhere in sight, nor are there any hired hands. Are Mel and his brother going to pick all this corn with their bare hands?Now let's get to the extraterrestrials. They appear to be the most incompetent extraterrestrials ever to appear in a scifi film. We are to believe that they have a technology sufficiently advanced to allow them to travel from another solar system light years away, with hostile intent, yet they don't appear to have any weapons with them, no ray guns, no laser beams, not even a pitchfork. Moreover, one of them can't even get out of a locked pantry. Maybe he was the doofus of the bunch, since he was one of the ones who got left behind. The depiction of the extraterrestrials is also singularly unimaginative, since the only one we get a good look at appears to be wearing a rubber suit that looks like it's the same one worn by James Arness the "The Thing from Another World" back in 1951.But as I said, it's well acted by Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Cherry Jones, and the children. Otherwise a ludicrous mess. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had great expectations of Shyamalan's third film and for the first twenty minutes they were all met. Intriguing plot, strange household, exciting soundtrack - all going well for another suspense thriller. Then it all fell apart. The actions stopped and the talking started, and you realised that this was a household as depressing as anything by Ingmar Bergman but not nearly as interesting. Mel Gibson as a widowed ex-priest is a dull, middle-aged man, unable to articulate his loss of faith. Joaquin Phoenix as a failed baseball player (unless you know something about baseball, you don't know why he failed)is even less interesting. And the kids havn't a spark of excitement in them -even asthmatics and hypochondriacs surely could show a little childlike enthusiasm occasionally. So the action button is on pause for a dull middle part of the film, marked only by one of the silliest last suppers in movie history. It's only when the four characters end up in a darkened cellar does Shyamalan regain the spark of his earlier films - but not for long. It's hard to comment on the end without spoilers, but it's enough to say that anyone expecting the twists of Sixth Sense and Unbreakable will be sadly disappointed.</fullReview>

An eight-year-old?The screenplay is so convenient, it makes you want to scream. After giving an adequate dosage of the aliens hiding in the house bulls***, we are conveniently informed that some primitive method somewhere scared them off. You know what that was? Water, stupid! Which doesn't make the aliens very bright. See, they are more advanced than us, but they never imagined someone on Earth would throw water on them!!

Mel's played the larger than life hero so many times we've almost forgotten films like "Tim" and "Man Without A Face". So naturally he tackled this film in hopes of reminding people that there's more to him than just Mad Max, Martin Riggs and all those other tough guys.Mel plays a down and out widower reverend who's all cut off from his kids and has a live in brother played by Joaquim Phoenix. When all sorts of weird things start happening like crazy dogs and crop circles, the logical explanation is of course, aliens.It's not quite successful though. Mel's too mechanical and flat for you to really identify with him. Sometimes unintentionally funny, you keep expecting the irony to be that Mel is the alien. Mel is actually upstaged by Phoenix as his would be baseball playing star. The kids get on your nerves after a while.</fullReview>

I.E:Sixth Sense "What if someone could see and talk to ghosts?"Unbreakeable = "What if Comic book heroes were real people?"Signs = "What if Crop circles were really made by Aliens?" To be fair, there are some additional ideas in Signs, such as "What if those aliens were able to travel thousands of lightyears and had invented a cloaking device for their spaceships dissapear, but were so retarded they couldn't open an unlocked door.This is definitely his worst film yet and a waste of a couple of hours. If anyone tells you there's loads of subtle things going on in the background that makes this a great film, don't believe them, there's nothing here of interest at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan flails for another twist ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs revolves around a tragic family living an isolated life on a farm, headed by Mel Gibson's lapsed cleric. Mel plasters on his brooding face, pretty much he does in the Lethal Weapon films whenever something bad has happened, only here it's on for over an hour and a half. In tow are a slightly annoying Joaquin Phoenix as the odd younger brother, plus a brace of very annoying kids in the form of Abigail Breslin and a Culkin (it almost doesn't matter which one) who spends most of the film going out of his way to do exactly the opposite of what a normal kid would do in any given situation. Farm life plays out against the background of an 'is it/isn't it?' alien invasion scenario, cleverly played out via new reports on their TV to emphasise their isolation.Things plod on in relatively suspenseful fashion for a while; a backstory element explaining the reason for Gibson's character ditching the cloth crops up in flashback (the sections of the film which are most satisfactory), but suddenly Shyamalan does the unthinkable and repeats his error from Unbreakable in delivering a staggeringly botched ending.Wisely refraining from SFX for most of the film, heightening tension with suggested threats as opposed to onscreen violence, the aliens suddenly show themselves and the film stinks up the screen until the credits roll. All trace of claustrophobic thriller is suddenly jettisoned in favour of a final act which comes across as the unwise marriage of Day Of The Triffids and Bull Durham. The final twist in particular borrows wholesale from...Triffids and smacks of a lack of imagination to carry through what was a fairly intriguing vision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TOTALLY SUCKS!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I normally do not watch any films by Mel Gibson. People around were completely obsessed by this film. Once I saw I thought it was completely pointless and stupid. It's not even close to being a horror film. Secondly I feel so bad for "aliens". The point that they are trying to prove in this film is that "things" of somewhere other than Earth are threatening for human life, which is not true. In my opinion they put these strange creatures in a position where everybody hates them for something THEY STILL HAVEN'T DONE. Don't waste your valuable time and money on this horrible movie. Just get a manicure and a pint of ice cream and watch What not to WEAR. Probably the worst film I've seen. If you really want to see and "alien" movie just stick to ET.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average to Below Average Taken from Cliched 50's Films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one that has absolutely nothing to add to the sci-fi genre and most people have lauded it as the best thing since mustard. This is a very average film that is boring and predictable and it is absurd in its entirety, not to mention that the director (who is incredulous in the film) can not handle the basic premise of logic. The inconsistent themes which play out are laughble, considering that a whole film is wasted on the pseudo-intellectualizing of a man who has lost his faith and regained it because of an alien invasion (was the script written by a 14 year old). Most of the film takes place on some small farm in Iowa that is attacked by plastic looking aliens which are latter computerized and hillarious. Avoid after first viewing. Grade: C.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's it. It's a movie about global alien invasion told by a small farm family. The crop circles? Never explained except as navigation aides. It's hard to say why intergalactic travelers would need visual navigation aides to find their way around a small planet. Never mind, the rest of the story isn't so hot either. The farmer (Gibson) has lost his wife in a traffic accident and he takes care of his two kids with the help of a brother or something? I'm not sure, but it doesn't matter. All attempts to create some kind of dramatic foment fall short and Gibson cannot save this one all by himself. Nobody can be expected to act and write at the same time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signs is a masterpiece to those who have eyes to See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With three major movies under his belt M. Night Shyamalan has quickly made a name for himself as one of the premier directors of the budding 21st century. Not since the relatively recent works of David Fincher have I been so taken and impressed with a director's vision, his output. And Signs, a relatively small, claustrophobic flick, even more so than Shyamalan's previous two, is somehow all the more powerful, and explosive, and ultimately rewarding for this sense of isolation. It is a brilliantly structured film. Fincher and Shyamalan are called the Hitchcocks of a brave new day, and I consider that praise well deserved for both directors.But Shyamalan's works are too uniquely his own, too uniquely genre and classification defying, to be summed up with the word hitchcockian. Shyamalan tells movies, that walk the dark hinterlands of the human heart and imagination. His works are neither thrillers, nor sci-fi, nor drama, nor horror, nor strictly fantasy but are some new and strange stew of elements. His works refuse to be pigeon-holed.And that, as you can tell has made him fans, but that has also in a world that lives and dies by labels has made him detractors. People have the right to like and dislike, what they want. But in some of the negative posts here, the venom and attacks seem almost personal. Less attacks on the work, than attacks on the idea of the work. A film is fantasy people, the best film requires your willingness to be fooled, to help suspend disbelief. It just seems a lot of you go into a Shyamalan film looking for flaws, as if you're offended personaly because his movies are so well received, and are looking to tear it down, lookin to fight the movie, and I'm going to tell you right now, a movie that you want to hate, you'll hate. A movie is like a date, its better when both parties try to make it work.You go into Signs wanting to read the signposts, and you will find a delicate, beautiful, haunting and brilliantly directed film, and yes it has a message. And yes there is a wide doe-eyed, capraesque quality to the films of Shyamalan. A vein of hope and humanity, a belief in them that runs through his works. And for me that's what makes his work masterpieces. I tend to think everything, everything has a message, from the most innane slasher flick, to the stupidest comedy, everything has a message, most messages translate into follow the crowd, or be as dumb as you want to be, or shoot the other guy, but Shyamalan presents us, in the case of Signs, a much more layered message. The ending if you let it, will hit you like a truck stop, will build on you, will grow on you, and will stay with you long, long after you leave the theater. It's the work of a master craftsman, no moment wasted.And great kudos must be given to the brilliant soundtrack by James Newton Howard, track 5 "Brazil" ranks up there with Goblin's "Mad Puppet" as one of the great horror compositions.Ranks perfectly between Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. 9/10. One of my favorite films of 2002. And looking forward to his next film. M. Night keep up the great work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this movie we follow a mentally unstable family getting even more unstable when aliens decides to come for a visit. The story itself tries to be not so much about the aliens, but more about the main character's loss of faith after his wife died in an accident. This is illustrated by a lot of whispering, soul-searching and annoying one-liner slogan conversations with his family. We got the obligatory "smart kid" as in the other Shyamalan movies, being very very serious, never smiling once throughout the movie. Also, the "can't get to the medicine and will die" situation from Panic Room, Con Air and heaps of other movies was added for increased excitement. The mood music was annoying, the camera work was the typical "First film the people looking at something scary, then after too much waiting, show what they were looking at". Aargh! There's not really much more to say. This movie is stupid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts out great...fizzles in the end. Quite disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, I was all for Signs. The trailers were excellent and compelling enough for me to want to see the movie as soon as it came out. Of M. Night Shyamalan's movies, this by far, ranks at the bottom. The story starts out quite strong...slowly building the background, developing the characters, and dropping hints for the viewers along the way. All of the actors did a fantastic job (save M. Night who really was rather flat and should stick to simply directing)...even the McCauley brother - who seems to have gotten all the talent of the family. For the first 45 minutes to an hour the story is intriguing as are the characters. A sort of eerie suspense can be felt building from quite early on in the movie. Through dialogue, development, and flashbacks, you begin to learn that this is more than just an "alien story".And then it starts to fall apart.**WARNING** Spoilers!! Do not read further if you have not seen the movie!I was on the edge of my seat, sharing Mel Gibson's fear of what was in the cornfield. The newscast of the alien "crashing" the birthday party had me scream almost as loud as Jaquin Phoenix. I was prepared for the movie only to get better. Unfortunately, it simply didn't hold up to the first half the movie.The aliens attacking the houses and the suspense that built up during that time as the family was holed up in the basement was incredible. I love movies where you can be scared without having to be shown exactly what is scaring you...to me it is much more effective. For this part of the movie, it worked. Of course, this is also when the "cheesiness" comes into play. The little boy starts having an asthma attack, yet, OH NO his medicine is OUTSIDE of the room...very reminiscent of Panic Room. However, for the sake of further developing Mel Gibson's character, I cn overlook this part to a degree. Then, just as it's getting good, it all stops. Um, ok. Well, I guess it had to somehow. So basically, the aliens are defeated. How? Water. Perhaps the world was being overtaken by bad witches straight from Oz? So, I have to then ask myself...why would aliens wish to "take over" a planet that is 3/4ths water when it is water that kills them? Furthermore, what would they do if it suddenly started raining? Or what about the dew on the grass in the mornings? I mean, COME ON! This was simply a cop-out "we can't kill off the main characters" ending that did not gel with the direction the story WAS taking us. It was simply too easy.The story fantastically began drawing us in, living through the hopes, fears, regrets, sorrow, and hardships of each of the characters and yet ended so disappointingly. I wanted to like this movie...but in the end, it was just, well, stupid.For entertainment value, I give the movie a 4 1/2 out of 5. For compelling storyline, however, I can only give Signs 3 out of 5. It really could have been better...considering what M. Night has proven he can do.</fullReview>

And then when the alien nochalontly walks out of the corn. Boy that part sends shivers down my spine every time!The funniest part, is when Gram comes back to the house and he looks over at his kid and his brother sitting on the couch with tin-foil hats on their heads.

		<shortDescription>OK movie, till the ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had a good sense of creepiness to it, a good cast, and some great visuals. It was actually turning out to be a good movie until the horrendous ending, which reeks of b-Movie filler. First, this movie successfully builds suspense and fear by offering only glimpses of the creature (which has been done successfully in other movies as well, a typical technique that's used). If you decide to reveal and show your monster in full, steady, prolonged shots you take a big risk of letting the audience down. Signs took the risk and failed. The creature looked very typical of the little green men sci-fi flick mold of monster and appeared to be cartoonish in a way. This robs the the movie of alot of its steam, and that's an understatement. The second thing that just kills this movie is this, if I were trying to invade another planet, I presume I would survey the planet to find out whether or not it's covered mostly by a substance which would be highly lethal to me! The logical fallacy here is huge and thus causes the movie to end on a very sour note.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!!The Sixth Sense was very good, Unbrakeable reaked, and Signs is barely watchable. Conclusion: M. Night is a one hit wonder. He's used the same atmosphere in all three films but included some really odd ingredients in the latter two.These consist of the characters standing around gazing out into thin air and speaking... very... slowly... about... faith... God... and... other... philosophical... stuff... (exciting isn't it?). Moreover, the plot in Signs (if indeed there is such a thing) is so stupid and full of plot holes that it's ridiculous. Aliens who cannot open doors and evaporate in contact with water? Suspension of disbelief is one thing, but these creatures seem so stupid and without real motivation that it's hard to understand why they came to Earth to begin with.The story is a blend of sci-fi, drama, horror, and at times something resembling a spoof of similar movies. This is probably unintentional, but the film takes itself so seriously that it turns out silly. It doesn't help that all the actors seem drugged up on valium either.There are some good moments where the film actually is quite suspensful (the middle part of the film) but the beginning and (sort of) twist ending are downright laughable. Overall, an overrated 100 minutes where nothing really happens.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An incredibly bad movie. I was expecting science fiction, not a "family drama." Instead of an interesting story of an alien invasion, we get a tedious story of a man trying to find his faith and keep his family together, with some of the trappings of a bad 1950's sci-fi film -- M. Night Shyamalan seems to be attempting an homage of some sort here, and there are even references made to "War of the Worlds."(Possible spoilers below.)Instead of finding out what the "signs" mean, or anything about the aliens and their intention, we just know "they come down to do bad things and are beaten by an amazing low-tech solution." Nothing about this film makes any sense, or offers much entertainment. We have aliens capable of star travel, but they need to leave each other messages in corn fields? They're incapable of getting through something as simple as a locked wooden door? They can blend into the background like chameleons, shoot poison gas from their fingernails? They dissolve in water, but didn't reckon on earth being a watery planet? Instead of the suspense and terror promised by the trailers, all we're getting here is a bunch of bad, poorly organized cliches.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ending killed it! The moment they revealed the Killer Clown of another planet: the green alien, my interest died, the movie got dropped in the after-hour slot of bland films. The movie would have been really good if it didn't reveal the pathetic, ridiculous, obviously-a-man-in-green-outfit, a big joke alien. Instead, it shouldn't have revealed anything and let the viewers decide for themselves what might be the cause for all the mysterious occurances. The movie at many stages had the potential to be an excellent one. Unfortunately, it resulted in tiire eshe torite duba.For a moment, I thought that Shymalan's genius was at work again until I realized how far off I was resulting in my thorough disappointment. The glass of water, the lady on the roof, the radio- all slowly built up to the suspense leading or rather misleading to people think that since most people conjecture that crop circles are being created by aliens, the actuality is it is a way for deceased (in this case Mel's wife) to communicate with the living and thus the disappearance of water, apparition on the roof, messages in the radio. That was my expectation. But - NO! He had to kill it revealing some goofy swamp thing like green alien. Like I said before the best ending, in my opinion, would have been if Shymalan revealed nothing keeping the audience guessing what could have been the true reason.And yes, Shymalan, I am sorry, but the fact that you are just keep on showing up in films just makes it look as if you are really attention seeking and desperate to gain fame in one way or another. If you want to appeal to viewers then better be unseen again keeping them guessing who really is the man behind the great craft (in reference to 6th Sense).Speaking of which, I think he is getting lazy and bit of lee after that megahit success. If one were to pulverize him for crappy film like Unbreakable - again where the water-as-krypton- factor shows up, he would have started putting more focus and effort on the creativity.Finally, lord have mercy- but no! please not a sequel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I realized pretty soon into the first 15-20 minutes of watching this film that this is one of those ambitious movies with a main point, a message delivered to somewhat smarter viewers (not too much though). At least, I feel most of moviegoers felt smarter because they could "figure out what it is about" even though the message was concealed behind some obvious trivialities. I was annoyed by the whole "nothing happens by accident" idea rubbed in my nose all the time. I was also annoyed by X-filish background soundtrack that is supposed to mystify us. Music and sound in this kind of movies is there to uplift the suspension not to torture us with a false sense that something really important is happening all the time. ** spoilers ** I am not going to comment on painfully lame "alien attack" thing, nor on the "profound" sign to Phoenix to "swing away". ** end spoilers **. The movie just simply misfires as far as I am concerned.And what do you think about appearance of Mr. Alfred Shyamalan himself? Please...Let's start from ground zero, for it does not deserve better. For some great camera angles and a few creepy scenes towards the middle of the movie I give it +5. For being too self-important about its "message" -2.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of the movie is quite suspenseful, although some scenes you definitely get the feeling that it is trying to hard to be eerie.As for the underlying tone about 'signs' and the movie's supposed "not an alien movie" appeal,,, its crap. Efforts to tie this into the main plot line are trite, boring and uninspiring*** Mild-Spoilers Below ***The ending is ridiculously horrible and anti-climactic. There is no "twist" at all, and nothing about the end scene is even remotely surprising or believable.Its been said on here numerous times, but the fact that humidity alone would have killed these things can't be forgotten.Maybe thats why intelligent viewers dont consider the end a twist, or even believable, because they had already deduced that water couldn't have been harmful to them.The direction is still really really good, but the ending ruins what could have been a really awesome movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frail rehash of "War of the Worlds"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no doubt that M. Night Shyamalan is a gifted writer and director. "The Sixth Sense" was ample proof. Therefore it is a mystery why he bothered with "Signs". While he may be good at creating suspense and will no doubt create great movies in the future, this was nothing but a pale remake of "The War of the Worlds".Good actors and interesting cinematography did not disguise the horrid stereotypes. For example, the aliens turned out to be little green men. Gee, how imaginative. Why hasn't anyone else thought of that? At least H.G. Wells (who wrote "The War of the Worlds" in 1898, for those who haven't read many books) used some imagination in creating his aliens. Then, as the aliens were running amok and destroying all humans, it turned out they were killed by something as simple and common as water. Another bit of pale copying. Wells created aliens that also ran amok across the earth and then were wiped out by common bacteria (with no human intervention). Can anyone else see the obvious copying? Mr Shyamalan is a fine writer but he should rediscover his orginality.Some suggest that "Signs" attempts to make us think about predestination and "are we alone?". Maybe. But the attempts are farcical in this context. As soon as the movie opened with images of shapes cut into corn fields, there was a collective groan. This was a news story some years ago, and a trashy one at that. The audience knew full well that speculation about alien activity was bogus and that these cornfield "phenomena" were man-made hoaxes. Suspending one's disbelief was rather tricky after this reference to an issue that belongs on moronic, overhyped, third-rate TV shows, like "Believe It Or Not"."Signs" was entirely predictable and unimaginative, especially for a talented writer and director. He must have needed the money, as must Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix, who must cringe when looking back at what they helped create. (And let's try to forget that another damned Culkin kid appeared in this movie!)Proven actors, good photography and lots of suspense cannot disguise a frail, overused concept. No amount of glossy finishing touches can make up for a bad design.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The more I think about this movie the less I like it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, however upon my second viewing, I started thinking that it was a bit too much..For example(warning, some spoilers ahead)1.These aliens are big and look very agile. How the hell does our friend Night Shymalan wrestle this dude in the pantry. C'mon any human being would get a huge ass-whupping from these guys.2.Why the hell would Night Shymalan or Mel Gibson not call the police upon discovery of ET'S scary cousin in the house. They have just seen an alien...wouldn't you at least call 911 or the policewoman...any normal human being would.3.After learning that the UFO's are to be found a mile from the crop circles, any normal family would pack up and get the hell out of their farm. At least go in town where it's probably safer....even if you think it's the end of the world, I'd rather be with a bunch of people, then all alone with my brother and 2 kids in the middle of nowhere, fighting these aliens.4.These aliens come from god knows where, have built a technology that we probably will not see here for centuries to come..... you're going to tell me that they can't figure a way to get through a basement door...c'mooooooooooon.5. These ultra-intelligent beings have only vapors to kill us.....they haven't developed weapons.......what the hell...they build flying saucers that travel millions of miles that can render themselves invisible, but they don't have any weapons(even if it's ground war, they can use some type of weapons without provoking us to use nuclear weapons)6. Knowing (I would assume that with their intelligence they would know that earth and every living being on it is made up of 80% water) what water does to them, you would think they would have developed some kind of protection to H2O.I think the bottom line is I should have watched this movie once only.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Lame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone brought this movie to my house tonight and, recalling that I had read somewhere that it had grossed almost $300 million, thought maybe it wouldn't be too bad. The Sixth Sense was pretty original and fooled me right till the end - millions of people can't be that far off, right? Wrong.** Spoilers to follow. **The essential problem with this film is that it takes so long to figure out if the aliens are actually bad guys or not. Maybe this is my fault for thinking about it too much, but I'm convinced that the way the film is put together bears more than a little of the blame. Here's what I mean. The aliens make nice looking and weirdly beautiful crop circles and don't, initially at least, seem to be too malevolent. We catch an occasional glimpse of them but nobody is getting eaten or anything. In fact, we're not totally sure until a fair ways into the film that the signs are, indeed `signs' and the work of alien intelligence and not some hoax. Furthermore, the aliens have these funny/cute voices that sound a lot like the way dolphins speak and surely we've all seen enough movies to know by now how *very* smart dolphins are. Was this going to be like ET: a sci-fi reprimand of how our natural instinct to freak out and kill the thing we don't instantly recognize is actually a serious character flaw? Or was it going to be a re-telling of some good old-fashioned "War of the Worlds" flick. I don't think the answer to this essential question was ever especially clear in my mind or, for that matter, M. Night Shyamalan's.To be honest I was expecting the now-indispensable Shyamalan Twist Ending to lead me down the "aliens are just folks like you and me" path. By now in Hollywood movies I'm used to kids and dogs and other such unsophiticates being held up as the truest barometers of what is really real in the universe. I mentioned ET already, but the list of such movies could go on for miles and include films like Phenomenon and even The Sixth Sense. In fact, isn't that what The Sixth Sense is basically about? Ghosts who, like the vomiting girl, initially scare us adults half to death are revealed, through the eyes of a child, to actually be tragic figures trapped by their unjust or untimely deaths. Having such recent films as my context, I was wondering up to the very end of Signs if perhaps these aliens had just been misunderstood and that their motives in attacking the house were really - I don't know - misguided attempts to honour the wide-eyed little girl Bo as their queen or something similarly sappy. When Graham (Gibson) cuts off the fingers of the alien in the pantry haven't we been trained by other films to wonder if the claws reaching out wasn't some misunderstood gesture of friendship or, at worst, desperation? When Merrill Hess (Phoenix) goes up the stairs out of the cellar at the end of the film the symbols blasted through the door above seem to be very creative and beautiful - moons and stars; certainly not obviously the destructive work of some demon-spawn hell-bent on creating mayhem and destruction. But eventually we find out that, in fact, the aliens are as bad as can be. Too bad it's ten minutes from the end of the film!So, it was bad enough that the movie took so long to really engage me and have me figure out who to cheer for, but the actual punchline is even worse. It turns out that the whole crux of the story is that a message from the wife-with-one-foot-in-the-grave can be as fatuous as "Believe in Coincidences. Oh, and by the way, when you see a nasty alien in our house get your troubled/funny brother to beat the crap out of him with a baseball bat until he falls against a bureau and you suddenly discover that in fact something as simple as the water our spooky/angelic daughter always found funny tasting is as deadly as cyanide to these guys.' Give me a break!After all, this movie is lousy because it cannot make up it mind. Is it an update of the creature feature movies of a xenophobic, isolationist 1950s America or is it more in line with the `tolerance is best' emphasis of Close Encounters in the later 20th Century? Signs wants to be everything to everyone and ends up being nothing for anybody beyond a few cheap thrills from (Children of the) cornfield steadycam shots and loud telephones in quiet rooms. Ultimately too thuggish and macho to be tender, too obvious and campy to be ironic, too sentimental to be truly scary, and too shallow to be as profound as it so desperately wants to be. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, how previews are so very, very deceiving.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where do I begin? I sat down to watch 'Signs' just the other night. I had been wanting to see it ever since it was still playing at the theaters. My aunt rented it and the only thing that came out of my mouth, along with a few swear words here and there, was how I was so glad that I didn't waste my hard-earned money on such garbage. This is the kind of film that gets everyone's attention when those clever but sneaky advertising jerks decide to air the trailer picking out the ONLY half interesting scenes in the entire film. Man, I hate when they do that. However, I would do it too if I were in their position. Why wouldn't I? Anyway, the previews looked really good; little did I know that they were extremely deceiving, and the film managed to stay at the top of the box office list for a while, so I figured that it couldn't be all bad. Don't believe it!Aside from the terrible acting, lack of excitement, scares and intelligence, it moved at a pace that would irritate anybody, or so I thought, but being that a lot of people did like it for some reason, who knows anymore. 'Signs' also lacks...what's that thing called? Oh, yeah, dialogue. Was it just me or did it seem like there was absolutely no talking in this picture? It was all show, actions, and not enough speaking. It reminded me of 'Cast Away' in that sense, and I don't even want to get into that disaster. So, moving along. The acting shown here is pathetic. I know that everyone likes Mel Gibson and the guy earns up to $25 million a pic, but honestly, for what? He looked out of it for the most part; what is Shyamalan really doing behind those cameras? He didn't react to anything like he should have, his very few speaking parts were boring, drawn out, and a lot of them really had nothing to do with the plot itself. Those really long monologues were unbearable. Joaquin Phoenix was just a tad better than Gibson, but still had nothing to show for it. Another Culkin pops onto the screen and I have to say, he was probably the best actor in this film. Most people found the young Abigail Breslin to be impressive while I found her to be purely annoying. Oh, and the biggest laugh of all, you guessed it, the man behind this terrible project, M. Night Shyamalan, works his way onto the screen. That's right, he's not only the writer, director and producer, he's also an actor. Who are you kidding, M? It really bugs me to no end when those hot shot directors and all happen to make a cameo in their films just because they're their films and they can do whatever they please.I can at least see where this plot would have been a good idea, but it gets ruined. The ending was a big mistake. For some reason, I thought that it would pick up just a bit toward the end, but it didn't. It was a huge disappointment as was the entire film as I have pointed out. The script, the actual writing was so boring. I found 'Signs' to move at a slow pace, yet it seemed to me that just as I had slipped the tape into my VCR, it wasn't only but a half hour or so after that I was finishing up the film. I guess I should be thankful for that.I would not recommend 'Signs' to anyone, and I mean anyone. The writing, the acting, the directing, the beginning, middle and end were all poorly projected. Shyamalan managed to rake in the bucks (and the rave reviews) yet again, though I don't understand how. Between 'The Sixth Sense' and this trash, it's a wonder this guy can find people to back him up whenever he comes up with a new idea. 'Signs' is a horrible film that only seemed good due to its misleading previews.I would have avoided this film all together, but it's not like they warned me it would be as bad as it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful Egomaniac Trip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alfred Hitchcock knew that it was often what you didn't see that was the most frightening. M. Night Shyamalan got that part right. Unfortunately, he didn't learn much else from the master of suspense. Perhaps if he would have hired a realwriter instead of penning this boring script himself, it would have been more interesting. Somehow his press agents have got the spin going that he's afantastic director and writer. He obviously believes this and wants to make sure we know this crap is all his fault-- his name appears so many times in theopening and closing credits and in such a large typeface, the local zoning board wants me to get a sign permit before playing the DVD again. And, not todisappoint us with his bad script and repetitive camera angles, he cast himself in a pivotal role. Couldn't he afford a character actor? It's a delight to catch a glimpse of Hitch in one of his movies. The only pleasure in seeing Shyamalanon screen is that he puts a face on the guy who is making you sit through this schlock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of the three films Shyamalan has made, this is the worst. He's a little young to be throwing his name up on every movie he makes now. It's not like he's Spielburg. The Sixth Sense was a great film, but he simply doesn't have the credit to be trying to use his name to throw up on every film in order to express how good it is. Since the Sixth Sense his films have been progressively getting worse. "Unbreakable" was decent, but nowhere near as intelligent as his first film. And casting himself in the movie, albeit in a small part, was a mistake. He's acting like he's Hitchcock all of a sudden. Signs was entertaining, but not something I would have enjoyed in the theater, and not something I'd be interested in seeing again. The plot was a bit broken up, and you couldn't really understand the central theme. Was this a film about a man who loses his faith, or aliens taking over the world? I was looking forward to this film because of the director, and because of my fascination with crop circles, which didn't really have much to do with the actual movie. I suppose it's a decent film if you're bored and want to rent it one night, but don't expect any of the great plot twists like you see in The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable. Hopefully, Shyamalan will get back on track with his next project.</fullReview>

And let me pose this question to the up and coming auteur whose face recently graced the cover of Newsweek.SPOILER!!!!!!!!!What would've happened to the Aliens if it had rained?

		<shortDescription>A flawed film, but still worth a watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK. Well I'm in two minds about Signs. On the one hand, it was nice to see a semi sci-fi movie that wasn't filled with special effects and didn't suffer for the lack of them. On the other hand, the plot was about as difficult to guess from the start as the plot to Titanic. Note that there are some spoilers in the following paragraphs.I hadn't realised M Night Shyamalan directed this until afterwards, but the similarities with Unbreakable and Sixth Sense are apparent. There's the same sort of unearthly theme running throughout all the films.However, the tension built quite nicely and although I kept expecting the film to degenerate into Independance Day, it never did, to its credit.On the other hand, from the first "Father....Please don't call me Father" line that Mel delivers, it was obvious this was going to be about finding one's faith again. Frankly, I think the film would have been better if Gibson's character had gone the other way at the end, but that's just my opinion.As the tension builds and it looks increasingly like the aliens are going to finish the human race, I couldn't help but think that some kind of Deus ex Machina ending was on the cards. Sure enough, the aliens are defeated by water, of all things.This is where Signs began to loose points in my mind. I'd already been somewhat amused by the fact that the aliens could apparently be defeated by something as simple as a pantry door but later, could get into a boarded up house. But then it rains and their whole invasion is called off? Was it raining everywhere at once? For creatures that had travelled from who knows where to get to Earth and could make their ships invisible, didn't they think to bring a raincoat? If they'd visited Earth before, you'd think they'd have noticed the fact that it's a very wet planet.The ending isn't even that original. I can think of two films, War of the Worlds and Day of the Triffids, where the enemy are defeated by such simple means.It's a good concept for a film and it's sad that the aliens weren't thought out a little more beforehand. A flawed film, but still worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simplistic obvious and uninteresting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After enjoying the Sixth Sense and even though I seem to be in the minority, Unbreakable, I looked forward to latest M Night creation. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. Where as both Sixth Sense and Unbreakable were slow paced, they were at least intelligent leading to a conclusion that was in both cases was a surprise. In this I knew the ending right from the moment you knew Mel's character had lost his faith. Of course his wife's word would really mean something and everyone would live happily ever after.Further to this telegraphed, rather insultingly simplistic story was a very poorly realised Alien invasion plot. The worst being the ludicrous manner in which they could be defeated. If you could be killed by water I think you would have worn a raincoat. Strangely there is moisture in the air so presumably they would have died in the atmosphere anyway. This was even compounded further by the fact that the Aliens take Humans one at a time, all 6 billion of us. That means you would need quite a few Aliens.Anyway as others have mentioned the main plot line for the movie was the re-discovery of Mel's faith, it's such a shame that it was presented in such a dull, uninteresting and patronising way.An indication of how bad this movie is, when I watched with others we found us all groaning out loud or putting our head in our hands at the stupidity of some of the scenes. They were often so dull and just unintentionally silly, yet you knew the director was trying to get some meaning or tension out of them.1/10 ? How the mighty have fallen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT a thriller. NOT about aliens. And the trailer is a lie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the trailer, and finding out that it's a movie by the same guy that made the great "6th Sense", I expected an equally great movie, full of suspense and surprises, thrilling and scary. Hey, that's the impression the trailer left me with: people running and screaming, boarding up the house, stalked by someone, flashlights flickering and strange signs in the crops... A perfect thriller, I thought!I couldn't be more wrong, it seems. The movie is NOTHING like the thriller. In fact, the thriller covers more or less the first half of the movie... The only half that is somewhat interesting. No spoilers here, really: the trailer reveals that it is a movie about (probably) aliens making strange markings in the fields, and stalking people, who run away screaming. And yes, that's what the first half is... but then it only gets worse.All the suspense is lost, and the whole "what are the aliens, if it's aliens, up to?" affair is turned into a big pro-religious pile of moral issues. The main hero is an ex-priest, and the whole second half of the movie is about how he realizes that what happens around him cannot possibly be a pure concidence, and that perhaps he should return to the faith. AND THAT'S IT! The aliens cease to be important anymore; the mystery is gone, the suspense is gone, and the whole danger disappears within the last moments of the movie. The only thing that remains important is how the ex-priest questions his faith (or non-faith). Why put aliens in there? Why the cropsigns?? Okay, so he lost his wife in a car accident - this isn't much of a spoiler, it's shown in the first 10 minutes of the movie. So he lost his faith when she died, okay, a nice movie beginning. So something happens that makes him rethink his views... But why market it as a mystery thriller with aliens in it!?In a nutshell: - plotholes big enough for the starship Enterprise to fly through. - storyline... WHAT storyline? Summarizeable in two-three sentences. And left completely unexplained (or very badly explained, for that matter). - religious messages cheap and cheesy. Good religious doubts were in "End of Days", in "Stigmata", NOT in here at all! Here, religion=good, atheism=bad, plain and simple. - acting... not bad, but only Gibson matters, the other actors are just in the background, far far away.*** BIG SPOILER : the movie summarized! ***First, we have strange cropsigns, all over the world, and radio appliances emit strange noises. Enter the aliens: they come in ships and hover over cities. Part three, aliens come to hunt people, Gibson with his family hides in the basement. Part four, the invasion is aborted and the aliens leave, defeated with... water. So Gibson fights one horrifyingly stupid alien and returns to being a priest, deciding that it's all a sign from God, more or less. END OF MOVIE.*** Spoilers end ***I think I'm going to re-watch "The Return of the Living Dead 2" tonight, for a change. Crap, low-budget and b-class, but better effects, better acting, less plotholes. Sadly.If you want a really good and frightening movie with a message by this director, return to the "Sixth Sense".</fullReview>

I just couldn't stop laughing at his performance; he didn't make it believable, as it seems to me he overacted. I've never liked Mel Gibson very much,. He is such an arrogant person and I don't like most of his movies. The little girl made me laugh, when she said "there is a monster outside my room, can I have glass of water? " And Mel Gibson looked at her in a dramatic way that was very funny, because it was so unbelievably trite. In addition to that, the little girl just wasn't necessary in this movie, this would have been the same without her. This is a story of a priest who lost his faith because his wife died in a car accident. Then he is upset with God and doesn't let him be in his life any more. His brother, (Joaquin Phoenix) lives with him and is worried about some signs that the Aliens are making in the corn fields. The scenes with the Alien were not very impressive and the children's acting was the same! Finally Mr. Gibson recovers his faith, isn't that too predictable?I respect everybody's opinion, but I can not understand why many people liked this movie. There wasn't really a plot, it wasn't scary, but very funny. The kid's performances were as shallow as Mr. Gibson's. Overall, this movie was a disappointment. Nevertheless the lighting and cinematography were very good! Also liked the nice message that this movie sent, as it shows that God forgives and helps us even when we are going through tough moments.

The premise that these super-intelligent creatures can be defeated by wooden doors beggars belief!!As to the "reason" for their ultimate defeat, it smacks of either 8th grade wannabe writers or sheer laziness! What a con of a movie. I feel like drawing up my own plot, it couldn't be lamer than this! Are U.S. audiences really prepared to accept this kind of dross in 2002??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What if God wrote Sci-Fi books (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-- WARNING SPOILERS --I've just seen "Signs", and while I was watching it, I knew it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. M. Night Shyamalan is one of my favorite directors, I have seen his last 3 movies, and I loved every one of them. "Signs" is a very hard movie to understand. Its seems to be sci-fi, but with a little bit of horror/suspense on it. It's like "Close Encounters" meets "Sixth Sense".My favorite scene in the movie is the basement one. It was shot almost entirely in the dark, and we can only see fragments of sounds and images. And, amazingly, just like "Blair Witch Project", it works. Why? Well, because the whole suspense is in the audiences minds.I think you might find that interesting: as I was watching the movie, I kept trying to solve the movie's puzzle, the final surprise. I mean it's there, in every M. Night movie. And I thought that those were not aliens, but DEMONS or DEVILS or something. And what would make the demons go away would him getting back to his faith. I mean, watch the scene where he refuses to pray with his children when he is about to eat... And you'll see that my point of view could be right. What made the "demons" go away the first time? Mel Gibson's character, "praying" silently when his son is fighting to breath. And what made the "demons" go away the second time? Water. Why? I dunno, maybe because they live in hell or something, and just like fire would burn us, they get hurt by water...Anyway... I can only think of two persons who could try to film such a movie, Hitchcock and Kubrick. Hitchcock would probably not use some camera elements (as the "in the ground" shots), and would not use SFX as it is needed to create the mood, so it wouldn't work. Kubrick would probably use his "parallel to the wall" shots, and his face close-ups, and would NOT end the movie like that... So... maybe it wouldn't work. Maybe. Kubrick would surprise us in some other creepy way.Only M. Night could direct this movie. So... Let's just wait for his next one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible spoilers within (although that implies that there is something worth spoiling, which there isn't).There are a few films in the top 250 which I detest, but at least with those films even though I hate them I can at least appreciate their reasons behind being popular.But I am absolutely baffled beyond belief that this films has a ranking to put it anywhere near the top poll. For the life of me I cannot think of one redeeming feature of the plot that would appeal to any like minded viewer. My problems with this film went far beyond that of the unconvincing aliens or equally unconvincing sci-fi aspects of the film.Whether the film sold itself as a horror, chilling, eerie or any similar description I'm not sure, but other commenters have certainly praised it as scary, chilling, pulsating etc etc. Do me a favour! 'Signs' was about as scary or chilling as an episode of Phillip Schofields' National Lottery Jetset. If it was frightening, would it have a certificate of '12'?That was the most annoying part of the film. Given the quality of the cinematography and the expertly chosen scenery, in the opening scenes of the cornfields there was me thinking I was looking at the perfect set of surroundings for the ideal chiller or thriller. It still probably could've been, but was just let down by any sort of remotely interesting set of events.Other viewers &amp; critics seem to be able to still praise a film highly if the acting, shots, directing etc are excellent even if the plot is pretty non existent, but I can't. Granted much of the film other than the story as I said was good, the acting was equally impressive, but there was not one thing to engross the viewer at all.You more or less knew where the story (and I used the term story in the loosest possible sense) would end up from the outset. Although despite that, it still struck me as a film where much of it seemed made up as it went along and still needed to be redrafted. More like a collection of scenes than a 2 hour film.The characters, despite being played well, were all devoid of any interest whatsoever. Consequently you never felt any liking for them &amp; never really gave a toss what would happen to them. Mel's flashbacks served more as an irritation, with the boy I was never assured of his role as to whether he was your typical brainy geek or or someone a bit dim, and yet again the young girl seemed to play a role and speak in the manner of someone far older than herself. The rest of their behaviour &amp; the other characters were academic &amp; largely irrelevant. So much of the characters seemed cliched and flogged to death in previous films.Some of the time I felt like I was watching a remake of ideas and a plot that I'd seen before, but then each time it seemed like a new idea may introduce itself it came over as ridiculous. Aliens that could leap over a roof and with technology to travel the world, but not able to get out of a kitchen or through a door with a plank of wood nailed to it. And the water? what was that all about, they come to earth with nothing to defend themselves from the earths inhabitants or from the rain or water that covers 4/5 of the planet.A few commenters have claimed the film to be funny. Unless it is through laughing at ideas like those above and not with them, then I must have been watching a different film. The cinema was reasonable full but there was not a single hint of laughter from anyone from start to finish.I feel a bit sorry for the director though. His two main works prior to this have both revolved around a 'twist' to shock the viewer, so people come to expect it in this. Even those who enjoyed Signs, surely cannot claim there was any sort of twist in this. To me, it all passed without a moment of interest or shock and at no point had anything to keep the viewer guessing, asking questions to themselves or surprised, and consequently nothing really happened.2/10 (1 for the location &amp; 1 because it's better then any of the Robin Askwith films that occupy all my 1/10's)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disapointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>!!!spoilers!!! I had extremely high expectations about this movie. Shyamalan had in my opinion made two great movies before and Signs were very hyped up when it camed to Norway. "Best film of the year, see it twice". This review was used for the commercials.Then i sat down in the seat and was ready to be frightened and surprised. I was wrong. This movie was bad. It had bad actors (I hated the old Culkin and now a new one comes that I hate even more) Mel Gibson attempt to cry was pathetic. People in the hall seemed to think everything was very fun in the movie. Often people bursted out in laughter. I dont now know about you, but I dont think a stupid girl with the "metal-hat-thingy" was fun. And were is the plot? Why do the crappy aliens want to kidnap and gas us? They clearly didnt want the planet since it contains of 80% H2O? What if it rains? All the aliens would have died. This was just stupid. After 5 minutes I understood that water had something to do with the end. Why would Shyamalan use at least 20 minutes of the screentime about the girl drinking water. And we all knew that Gibsons character would become a priest again. And those 20 minutes with flashbacks had nothing to do with the rest of the film.If not this movie is all a cover for a hidden theme or plot I will rate it 4/10. Comments on this are welcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now where are Mulder and Scully?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie; I truly, honestly did. It had almost everything I could ever want in an alien-scary-horror-thriller-drama-scifi-type movie! Just except Mulder and Scully.Personally, I love the actors; Mel Gibson was wonderful in this movie and his sarcasm at times was a really good addition as well. Just like with Joaquin Phoenix; his character was sarcastic when he needed to be and that added to the whole movie. The two other main characters, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin, were excellent as well. It's nice to see some more little children as some of the main actors.(SPOILERS AHEAD)When the aliens leave, I found most people were totally confused. Some reasons they probably left was all the water; you know, the Earth IS around 70% water and only 30% land. Those aliens couldn't stand water and we sure had lots of it; it also has a part where Joaquin's character is talking to Mel's character in the basement and says something about some people found a way to stop the aliens. It was water. Okay! Okay! So yes, it was odd when they left but if you think about it just for a MOMENT, it does make sense.Now one thing that could have been done better to ME is the dream parts. I thought that at first, when Mel's character was getting out of the car dressed in his Priest suit was real! Not a dream! Well, now I don't know how it could have been done better. Maybe a flash at the bottom saying, "DREAM SEQUENCE!" or something alone those lines. Corny, yes. Pathetic, yes. Needed, not really.In all, the movie was great. I just think you need to have a kind of thing for these movies to actually appreciate them. To me, this was better than The Sixth Sense. M. Night Shyamalan is getting better!Just my two cents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There never has been, nor never will be, another film quite like it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SORT OF SPOILERS... I don't think they are, but you know, I don't want to spoil it for anyone. I've described a couple of scenes vaguely, but I'm pretty sure you won't understand until you see it. So read at your own risk, kinda. :)I don't post comments very often, but sometimes a film will push me that bit further.Signs is one of those films...The basic story of Signs is crop circles, even the ultra-mysterious trailers revealed that much. The first scene in the film leaps straight into ol' Mel (Father Graham Hess) finding the first circles in his fields, and it goes from there. Graham lives with his two kids, Bo (Breslin) and Morgan (Culkin), and his brother Merrill (Phoenix, getting worryingly sexy now). The film is basically about them being a bit confused and scared by the circles, resulting in a climax that, as in all M. Night Shyamalan films, makes you smack your head and go "ohhhh! Now it all makes sense!".Sounds a bit dull? Well, think again. Like, for example, American Beauty, Signs is one of those films that you know is very very good, you're just, erm, not sure why. (Ask anyone to answer the question "What is American Beauty about?" and watch with amusement as they go "Well, I don't know really....it's about this guy, and his daughter, and his wife, and his next door neighbour, and pot, and life, and death...") Of course, the plot of Signs is difficult to describe more because you don't want to give anything away than because you CAN'T describe it. Even tiny details and idiosynchrosies that appear to just be character development all interweave to form the aforementioned head-smacking ending.The one remarkable thing I can say about Signs is that I have never ever seen a film before that has made me repeatedly laugh til I cried (think the "helmets", especially when all three are wearing them...) with the most deadpan humour known to man; has made me cry (Graham's final flashback); and has scared the living bejesus out of me (peeking under the pantry door). It was almost Rocky Horroresque in it's audience participant factor; believe me, apart from at the end of Moulin Rouge when everyone sat still for a few seconds, I have never seen English audiences seem to get into the film so much. But tonight you heard people gasp, yell "What the hell are you doing?" and in the case of one particularly annoying woman in the row behind, scream.People believed in it. And not because run, run, the aliens are chasing Jeff and Will; or because aaah, it's the end of the world, and for some reason this means Bruce saying those immortal words "Dig dig dig, let's chew this iron bitch up!". No, it's because Night is a director who actually gets that nothing, NOTHING on screen will ever be as scary as your imagination. Except that unlike, say, Blair Witch, Night also has this little thing called a "script", which helps with the whole keeping you interested bit.Well, this review has probably read like a mindless stream of thoughts and movie disses, and if you are still reading, well done. That's because the only thing I can say about Signs boils down to four words:See it. RIGHT NOW.(and if you don't laugh, cry, and jump, come round and I'll give you a tenner.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unique film which challenges us to use our minds not just our eyes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I would like to say that I noticed that there were many people who commented that this film was not what they expected. It wasn't scary enough, there wasn't enough excitement, etc., etc. I, myself thought that this was a pleasant surprise. "Signs" was not just another sci-fi thriller with no point. It was a great tale of faith and redemption.It amazes me how many people didn't seem to get this point. The film, to me doesn't really even fit into the genre of science fiction. The aliens are simply used as a vehicle to help deliver the film's message. The aliens could just as well have been thieves or murderers who broke into the house. The movie's point would still have been made.Speaking of the film's message, I know that a lot of cynics out there think that the films message is an over used cliche. I disagree. In a world where all we see around us is pointless death and destruction I feel the themes in this film are very relevant and revealed in an original and clever fashion.As for those of you who can't get past the "gaping holes" in the plot such as a race of intelligent aliens who can't even break a wooden door to get into a cellar, can you tell me of any film that doesn't have a hole somewhere in the storyline. **SPOILER** Let's take the classic thriller "Jaws" for example. You tell me how you can blow a gigantic shark to pieces, scattering it's blood and flesh everywhere and not attract countless other sharks. Brody and Hooper would never have paddled their way to any shore without being killed by other sharks. But that's okay. I can get past all of that because there were so many other great aspects of this film. Bottom line is that you can tear apart any plot if you really want to. **END OF SPOILER**I think what happened was that some people went to this film wanting to sit back and not have to think about what they were watching and got upset when the found out they were going to have to use their brains a little. To me, the more thought that you have to put into a film usually means the more your going to get out of it."Signs" was a great film, with a great story and a great message. It is a shame that there are not more films being made like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most reviews of this have been mixed, and some seem to have missed the point. Night has developed some similarities between his films now, e.g. the use of colour (Red- 6th Sense, Purple-Unbreakable, Blue- Signs). Here he makes his debut acting role as the Vet. Some say the inclusion of an Asian man in a film at this point in history is emphasising the problems people have with people of colour, since 9/11. I don't know about that, but go see this film if you want to watch a funny, intelligent, thought provoking films. I am not a big fan of Sci-Fi's so cannot tell you if this is a good one or a bad one. (Seeing a little less of the aliens may have been better.)The relationships in the film are executed perfectly. Joaquin Phoenix is very funny, showing another dimension to his acting. Don't go expecting to see Commodus or Toby N Tucker, or any of the others he plays. The kids are good actors. You believe they all are a family.The emotional scenes are very touching without being corny. And I bet you leave the cinema arguing about the existence of aliens, and whether you believe we are on our own or not. Do you believe?</fullReview>

But then again, he apparently comes up with the surprise ending first and then writes the script backwards - with the result that things which seem to be interesting quirks (Bo's abnormal reaction to water, for instance) are all just plot devices so he can get to the tidy surprise ending. At least I didn't have to pay for the movie. If you want to see a good movie about faith, rent "eva and the priest" by jean-luc goddard.</fullReview>

He casts himself in a key role (of a man whose life has collapsed around him because of an accident) -and then blows it, almost ruining the film for me. I can't help but wonder what if Robert Duvall had played that role? Or Gene Hackman? Someone who has a lifetime of experience on their face?

		<fullReview>Signs is one of the spookiest, most frightening movies I have ever seen. Up untill now I thought The Thing and Alien would hold my scariest viewing but oh no, Signs goes well beyond the use of models, suits, or robotics to scare you. The silence alone is enough to make you wonder if they're watching you ;) M. Night Shyamalan knows what scares people and deploys that tactic well in this movie. From the very beginning we see the mysterious traces of what could be hoodlums making trouble in a small farm town but as the movie progresses things begin to change. It isnt often that you hear the rest of the movie goers in the theater gasp at a dark silhouette or scream at the sudden appearance of...well, you'll see. After seeing M. Nights first two hit films, viewers are sure to pay special attention to tiny details, watching for what could be clues to a twisted ending. This movie was incredible to say the least and you may be thinking, "scary enough that my girlfriend will hold me tight right?" well, not unless you guys dont care about looking scared white in front of the ladies :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Signs is not "Sci-fi" as most reviewers want to pigeonhole it. M night Shyamalan is resurrecting a long dead genre the Hitchcock psychological thriller. Give them what they think they want without giving them a thing. His use of: Sounds, Music, and Clues, are second only to hitchcock. Shyamalan can easily be labeled a mediocre sci-fi writer/director, but this movie is not a sci-fi movie. He only led us to believe it was a poor sci-fi film. (SPOILER)"Father" Gramm is introduced walking out of the bathroom and we see a cross shaped dust shadow on the wall. After all of the alien gobbledy goo we see Gramm leave the same bathroom now the cross is on the wall. The time line is ASSUMED to be several months when in reality it was only over night. Gramm had a horrifying dream about how humanity is threatened by aliens, which leads to his new found faith. Shyamalan gave us so many clues beginning with Bo's opening line, "Uncle Mike are you in my dream also?" Everyone is clarivoyant. The crop circles are maps. They "care" about rural Pennsylvania. The drugstore clerk's confession to a protastant priest. The aliens look like every crude drawing we've seen in the National Enquirer. Basically every "plot hole" you've seen listed was a clue it was a dream in Gramm's head. Shyamalan is a genius to have fooled almost every reviewer to date into believing this movie is a poor excuse for a sci-fi movie, when in reality it was a hitchcockian (if that is a word)psychological thriller. Definately 10 out of 10!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Signs is a sci-fi horror flick which is neither scientific nor horrific. Despite the good acting and high production value, the plot is not particularly engaging, and surprisingly, not scary either.That would be bad enough, but unfortunately, there are major problems with the aliens, who are not menacing at all. They refuse to break through closed doors. They don't even fight hand-to-hand, probably because they are computer generated. So... what about all that high technology?Lots about the film just doesn't make sense in the above manner. It's even worse than "Independence Day", and the religious overtones have been out of place in sci-films since, oh, the 1950s.Who should see this film:-- nobody, even if you think you might want toI'll give Signs a revolting 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

My sister, who seems to like virtually every movie ever made, had told me how "bad" this movie was, so I was very reluctant to see it. After all, if she thought "Dude, Where's My Car?" was groundbreaking entertainment, then this must be REALLY bad.I was pleasantly surprised, however. SIGNS turned out to be the best movie I have seen so far this year. The story itself was very compelling and thought-provoking, and the ending was cleverly executed and succeeded in bringing satisfying closure. Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, and M. Night Shyamalan (who also wrote, directed, and produced) all played their parts exceptionally well, helping to sustain the film's eerie atmosphere and ultra-thick tension.If there's one movie you see this year, make it SIGNS. You'll be on the edge of your seat, and you won't be able to sleep for at least a week.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a beautifully made movie, Shyamalan is clearly a good director as he brings out solid work from his actors, and creates a suspenseful and even somewhat insightful film from a B-movie plot. The cinematography is beautiful as well. However, the plot is weak, no matter the angle one sees it from. Is it a film about a person's quest for spirituality and meaning in life's twists and turns? Is it a film about aliens? Whichever one of the two somewhat ill-fitting plot lines is so superficially developed as to be laughable. The alien plot line is so full of holes that I found myself laughing out loud.Pity, as the director clearly has a lot of talent at creating a consistent atmosphere of tension through clever management of subtlety (which is refreshing). I see Shyamalan also wrote this film. He should stick to directing only. Not a film I would recommend to anyone. Maybe on video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I begin, some of the details of this may spoil to movie for you. So I will add a line saying to READ NO FURTHER when details may give some stuff away. You are safe until then. This is an enjoyable movie. Try not to analyse it too much. If you spend a lot of time thinking about it afterwards then you will come up with some impossibilities that will bother you. M Night Shyamalan always spends a lot of time building. That isn't necessarily a flaw, (obviously since he is being called the next Spielberg), but I don't think building and building always works for action movies. He did this in Unbreakable (which I really liked) but that movie really needed more movement and more action sequences to work better.In Signs, M Night spends a lot of time building Mel Gibsons character and showing the inner conflicts his family has suffered after a recent tragedy. Then he spends a lot of time building suspense in preparation for the climax. That just might be too much building. I read reviews and have heard DJs say this movie was so scary that people were screaming in the theatres and etc. It never affected me that way. I never felt "scared" one single time. I don't think that was what M Night was going for. There are plenty of tense filled scenes in the dark that keep you on the edge of your seat, but I didn't feel the suspense as well as I have in other movies however. You have to go see this one if you're an M Night Shyamalan fan. If you aren't a fan of his, but are just looking for a cool movie to watch then toss a coin. Every other person will like it and every other person may be slightly disappointed.----------------------------------------------------------DO NOT READ FURTHER UNTIL AFTER YOU HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE. DETAILS ARE INCLUDED HERE THAT WILL SPOIL IT FOR YOU!!----------------------------------------------------------OK. I found a couple of flaws in the movie that really bother me. First of all, Mel Gibson keeps important information about the weaknesses of the aliens from the world. He could have saved millions of people if he had just made a phone call to the authorities telling them about the alien in the pantry. It seems far fetched, but scientists could have taken him and performed tests on him and may have discovered their weakness in time to broadcast it all over the globe before communication black out. And Mel was a PRIEST? He is an ex-priest with no concern for anyone but himself. What church was he ordained in? The Church of the Selfish Mind? Also I have a problem with a priest who blames God for the death of his wife. A priest would not do this. Priests know that death is a part of life and when one dies they go to Heaven. At least according to the Catholic Church. So there is nothing to blame God for. His wife is in a better place. Also priests console grieving family members all of the time on a regular basis. After assuming the role again at the end, he would have lost all credibility as a priest. Who wants to be consoled by a priest who blamed God the first time he lost a loved one? I wouldn't! I wouldn't trust his advice at all.Also, explain to me again why the aliens can't use their superior technology to bust down a door? Because we might use nuclear weapons? A farmer doesn't have a nuke! Even a child could pick up an axe and get through a door. Not to mention a race of beings with the technology to travel between galaxies. A box of nails and a hammer rendered this superior technology powerless. I have a serious problem with that. Are you ready for the BIG ONE? Their weakness is water right? Our planet is about 75% water. Would you try to conquer a world that was 75% sulfuric acid? Would you attack a race of beings whose physical bodies were 80% sulfuric acid and who could spit it out of their mouths? And if you did attack them, then wouldn't you wear some kind of suit to protect yourself? These aliens are stupid yet they have mastered technology. This is an impossible combination. They are walking around naked and attacking people without protection or weapons when even the simplest reconnaisance would reveal that the acid that eats through their alien skin is found in abundance in every house in America. We are composed of the element that kills them and they fight us hand-to-hand without any protection at all? I enjoyed the movie, but after thinking about it now I wish I hadn't seen it. Its hard to believe that the same director wrote Sixth Sense which seemed to contain no major flaws at all. This movie is just chock full of them. Try again Shyamalan. You can do much better buddy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a fan of Shyamalan, but he was trying too hard here. This film seemed to be as contrived as "Radio Flyer". I think I even saw one in the basement. Too many plot holes, too many clichs, too many red herrings.Shyamalan is a good director, but he should use another writer's story next time. Also the cinematography was down from his past films. Where were the panoramas of crop circles? On the TV news only. Better luck next time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Contains Minor Spoilers* From the captivating television commercials for "Signs" one would think this is a movie that is mostly about crop circles and aliens, but it is actually about much more. In fact, although the aliens are of major importance throughout the movie, the crop circles play only a minor role, and are simply one reference to the title, which is more directly related to the sometimes seemingly random events in one's life. It is much too complicated to explain without giving away the plot, but this movie may not be what you are expecting. Instead, "Signs" is a rare movie that successfully blends suspense, comedy, drama, and horror, among other things, into one film, while still delivering a strong message. Despite this, I think this movie has much better entertainment value than message delivering ability. Throughout the film, I was captivated by what was happening on the screen, despite the relatively little action in the film, and was kept in suspense from the opening scenes until the finale almost two hours later. Unfortunately, I think the ending is one of the stupidest that I have ever seen, it just doesn't make any scientific sense at all!!! And the more I think about it and talk about it with other people who saw it, the more problems with this ending surface. I won't say what that ending is, but in my opinion it was enough to demote this movie from an easy 10 down to an 8, maybe a 7. However, in all other aspects, it is the best movie I have seen so far this year. The acting is very good, although I thought that Mel Gibson was a little stiff throughout the film, the direction is superb, the score is perfect, and except for a few cheesy lines, which seem mandatory in all movies these days, the writing is excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the reputation from 6th Sense and Unbreakable I saw this film. Wish I had stayed away. There is no structure to the story. No problem with the beginning its the rest of the film that bugged me. This film reminded me of the Blair Witch Project which required you to use your imagination. Well my wife knows I have a very wild imagination and guess its not what the filmmakers were counting on. A guy in a green suit pops up and a character freaks out. Felt like I was at the Drew Carey attraction at Disney-MGM studios. The ending was rediculous. For those that havent seen it I won't give it away. Mr. Shaymalan has lost a fan of his films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first hour of this movie drags on and on. It is dry, boring and almost aggravating to watch. However the plot soon picks up for the last 30 - 45 minutes, and gets rather intense at times. This would have been a 2/10 if it had not improved towards the end. 5/10 because of some very successful frights.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By the comments I've read, you either love it or it hate it. I went through the trouble of registering at IMDB just to vote. (I gave it a "2", and was being generous).I saw it based upon the reviews that it was not an alien film, but an examination of what is important in our lives - "a thinking persons' sci-fi movie". Well, I didn't think much of the film. Although about half-way through the film I was afraid, I was afraid that I wasted $14 - and I was right.The acting is poor - by everyone except maybe Graham's daughter. The characters did not react in a believable way. All of the "there are no accidents", "everything happens for a reason" and "it is almost like it was meant to be" is very contrived. This movie is about as deep as a Wal-mart wading pool.This, in conjunction with the obvious technical flaws, and "loose ends" made this a complete waste of time and money.I guess it goes to show you, if you've got a big star and director - Roper &amp; Ebert will give you a good review. It's been a long time since I didn't like a Mel Gibson movie, but the clock has been reset.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good acting, flawed execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS***This movie had a lot of promise, only some of which is fulfilled. The acting, especially by Gibson and Phoenix, is believeable if somewhat understated. However the director, who appears in a cameo role, should have put someone else in his role who could really emote, as he completely lacks this basic human ability.It almost seems as if M. Night wasn't sure about what kind of movie to make. Is it a PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER? Well it seems to be at first but the source of the crop circles is revealed far too soon. I would have preferred this to be kept a mystery until later in the movie. Once it is revealed, it pretty much limits the scope of what the movie could be about. Another problem is Gibson's son, who seems to be right about everything the aliens would try to do, which further erodes the plot's suspense.After it is revealed that the aliens are making the circles and what their intentions are, you would think it would become an ACTION MOVIE. But no action is shown, and nothing at all is shown of what is going on in the rest of the world. I was not amused with the War Of The Worlds-like solution.In short, I am tired of M. Night's manipulative movies. He puts obvious clues in his movies that apparently are not noticed by 90% of the movie-going public, which explains why this movie is undeservedly in the top 250 already. Come on, wasn't it OBVIOUS that the water would be part of the solution, or that the bat hanging on the wall would be too? It's the SAME as in Sixth Sense...or was I the only one who thought during the first ten minutes of that film, "Hey, maybe Bruce Willis is dead too."?M. Night is rapidly painting himself into a corner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just not that impressed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a decent movie. There was a feeling about the movie, though, that there is probably some technical term for. Frequently during the movie there was a pause,or pose, as if everybody was saying "make sure you see how well this is photographed", or "make sure you see the symbolism here". There was a zombie-ish slow motion quality to the acting that I could just never get. What was that with guys watching TV with their hands on their knees?I'm generally impressed with child actors. Not this time. Gibson &amp; Phoenix both seemed to be handicapped by direction that must have included a lot of "slow down, do less". In fact, the best performance in the movie was probably turned in by Shyamalan himself. Maybe he should back off on directing, and stick to acting.I'll get over it. I was so looking forward to this, and I was so disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice build-up that leads to a disappointing climax.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is much more to Signs than the previews and commercials would have you think. The creators of the film would have you believe it's this freaky movie filled with dark, tense scenes and scary encounters.Well, partly true. Signs is not a nasty movie and not overly scary. Some parts will make you jump, some parts will make you shake. But I think the thing that satisfied me most about Signs was the total unexpected humor.This movie is hilarious.Instead of a sci-fi/thriller as displayed, I found a witty, funny, excellently built-up movie. The movie has a quick pace at first, as the beginning is not only funny (Joaquin Phoenix's rude awakening) but also freaky and absorbing. I was drawn into the movie after the opening titles.Speaking of opening titles, I should get to the music. It is composed by James Newton Howard, who sets a delightfully chilling score that is not overly screechy such as Psycho's themes. Instead, it has a nice balance between overly horror and underly boring. The same theme is all throughout the movie, which can get kind of repetitive, but it's a very nice, creepy theme that suits the movie well.The actors a do a magnificent job as a family torn apart by a death and by certain encounters. They are racked by family problems when these strange signs appear everywhere, making their not-so-normal life all the more stranger.Although the movie builds up well, it has a very disappointing climax. I had an idea during the movie that it could have had a very nice plot twist (it all would turn out to be a hoax), but that didn't happen. I was fine with that, but the climax was not a very good end after all this building up. I did like how all the things came together in the end (watch the movie... no spoilers here!).For one thing, it seemed too much like Independence Day, but still maintained originality.Some things were left unexplained, like what was happening to the animals and what the aliens were really there for. Those didn't make sense.All in all, a decent movie that can put you on the edge of your seat at times or cause you to burst with laughter or brim with tears (Graham's struggle for faith is one such moment). I say this movie is almost a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Spielbergian magic, but Shyamalan spookiness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Audiences who go into this movie anticipating the kind of spellbinding magic of "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" will come away disappointed. What you WILL experience is a creepy, spooky story that mixes in nice doses of humor along the way.And those who see this film expecting surprise twists at the end will also be disappointed. Shyamalan has a long career as a filmmaker ahead of him, so let's not get on his case every time he makes a movie that doesn't give you a cheap thrill at the end.The first thing you'll notice is the music on the opening credits. Very scary, very Hitchcock. It sets the tone for what's to come. The plot will leave a number of open-ended questions for those who are really paying attention. To list them here would be to spoil too many elements of the film for those who haven't seen it. Suffice it to say that many will be scratching their heads and thinking, "But whatever happened to...?" or "Why did they...?"As for Shyamalan himself, there was probably no need to fill the screen with "A Film by M. Night Shyamalan" at the end. After all, the opening credits told us that (also filling the entire screen), and he cast himself into a key role in the movie. Add to that the fact that he's appearing on major magazine and newspaper covers worldwide, and I think we're on the verge of Shyamalan overdose. Here's the antidote: M. Night, make your next film smaller, less grandiose, less self-indulgent, and a nice, small, classy credit saying "Directed by M. Night Shyamalan." That's right, let someone else write your next movie. It'll make for a more diverse resume.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what has gotten into movie-goers lately. First off, the characters in this movie are pitifully static. This movie goes off in so many unfulfilled directions that it makes no real point. It is a cliche theme. I am not referring to the alien invasion part of the film (which was suspenseful but concluded in an awful manner that shows no originality or even imaginative writing), but instead the theme of the omnipotent power of faith. There is nothing to get in this movie - it is terrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid Ending for Marginal Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, the honeymoon for Shayamalan since "Sixth Sense" is over.Forget the boxoffice numbers -- this is a big Shayamalan buildup that leads to a moronic conclusion.The 'scary things' in this flick came off as tragic and pathetic. Teletubbies would give these creatures a run for their money. Incredibly lopsided, with nothing more than a hint of alien danger. No kidding -- by the end of the movie, I was rooting for the 'bad guys'.And you will cringe in your seat as badly as I did when you find out what the big-deal, "Swing for the fences" message was all about. The ending was so utterly idiotic that I was embarrassed to have spent money to see it.M. Night Shayamalan better watch more "Alien" and less "Crossing Over". Because a little more s*** like this, and I will be "crossing over" to watch some other director's movies.Final verdict: Marginal, occasionally suspenseful fare -- but wait for the video, or you'll be kicking yourself. (You won't see it at the Oscars unless they've been taking stupid pills - guaranteed. And considering that the epic "Road to Perdition" is lagging behind the worst movie of 2002 ("Master of Disguise"), it looks like the youth-saturated audience has already finished the bottle.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing, Derivative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a big fan of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, I had high expectations for Signs. Unfortunately, not only did Signs fail to meet these expectations; it was also a very disappointing film, not nearly up to the high standards set by Shyamalan's previous work.Perhaps the most disappointing thing about Signs is its lack of originality. The brilliance of The Sixth Sense and, to a lesser extent, Unbreakable, was the creativity and fresh vision of a new filmmaker who was unencumbered by expectations or commercial pressures.Signs is almost purely derivative. The directing devise of showing only glimpses of the invading aliens until the climatic scene is right out of Jaws (in which Stephen Spielberg delayed revealing the shark with much greater effect). The theme of a man who's lost his faith due to a personal tragedy has been dealt with many times -- and with much more subtly and emotion -- than it is here. The death of Gibson's wife (without giving away too many details) is immediately recognizable as a theft from an episode of Homicide. And the idea of alien invaders has been seen many times, most recently in Independence Day.Another problem with Signs is the premise itself. Unlike Independence Day, which had no pretensions to serious drama but developed great characters in the midst of exciting action, Signs takes itself very seriously. Yet, it's hard to take seriously a bunch of aliens who are so utterly inept that a farmer can lock them in a room and sit in his car the driveway while they try figure a way out. Despite having the technology to travel across the galaxy to kick some human butt, these aliens sure are stupid.Finally, the writing and direction are just not up to Shyamalan's past standards. I found no depth or subtly to Gibson's performance--and I am usually a defender of his. Joaquin Phoenix, who is supposed to be Gibson's dumb jock brother, plays the role with too much intelligence. One minute he's telling a story of a woman puking at a party, the next he's speaking eloquently about the need for his brother to keep his faith. Finally, Abilgail Breslin's brilliant performance as Gibson's daughter is overshadowed by a terrible performance by Rory Culkin as Gibson's son. In Culkin's defense, Shyamalan's script hands him line after line that is just not believable for a child. Nevertheless, Culkin is not convincing as a serious, sulking young boy.Despite some suspenseful scenes, I found this movie highly disappointing and, at times, almost laughable (particularly the climactic scene). I hope this is not an indication that Shyamalan may suffer much the same fate as Quentin Tarentino, being unable to live up to his brilliant early work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What A Crappity Crap movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[SPOILERS!!!!!]I didn't really like it. It was too preachy and the aliens were moronic. Here are two perfect descriptions:"Hey, look at that planet. It's 75% poison. Let's land there! Hopefully they won't have doors here."I've decided that what the aliens did would be roughly equivalent to me and my friends getting together and attacking a planet where the majority of lifeforms subsisted on lava,and were themselves 60% lava. The number one resource on the planet would be, of course, lava. Lava would fall from the sky. Lava would cover a good 75% of the planet.What a bunch of religious propaganda and a sell-out ending. So, aliens evolved beyond pants? The plot sunk in. Aliens. Defeated due to doorknobs. And wood. They travelled a countless distance to attack a farmhouse. Poorly.The Simpsons episode where the aliens are defeated with planks of wood with nails in them came to mind.If this was a "scouting" mission, they probably should have picked up on the whole "75% water" aspect. Namely, what were the directors/aliens thinking? I love how they remind us that they have scouts just so we can make fun of them for invading a planet filled with water, where it also rains water, and water is used daily by all life forms on said planet. Also, after all that talk of having to find a way to beat the aliens back, they seem susceptible to baseball bats, and therefore more susceptible to baseball bats with moist towels on them, or possibly bullets and missles.Gotta love the fact that they don't know how to open doors either. Poor Gary (which is what I deem to be the name of that alien now), getting locked in a pantry, then missing his army's retreat and running into a room filled with glasses of water and humans. To top that off, he fails at killing an asthmatic, unconcious, child. I love how the only way they can kill you is by sticking their hand in your face (or maybe that was just Gary and his Private Pyle-like antics). Failures, a race of failures. They are very good at shaking and banging on doors though, oh yes!The ships, oh the ships. Yes, they are invisble in the day, but glow brightly at night. Gooo aliens!Overall, quite a funny movie. I couldn't help but laugh at some scenes, like the one I described above, with Gary bursting into the room full of humans. The whole theater gasps, and is then interrupted by my maniacal laughter. I demand a comedy/horror sequel where we battle aliens with super soakers and water balloons.Some things I just don't understand:1. Aliens are harvesting people. So they send ships to major cities where there are LOTS of people. However, they also send a ship or two or however many to BUMSTEAD, PA to harvest the 8 people who live there? What?2. Aliens melt when water is on them, yet they're harvesting humans who possess absurd amounts of water in their bodies, can SPIT onto them as a weapon, and live on a planet consisting of 70% water. I don't know, but if I'm a human, and I want to invade a planet, I'm not choosing the one that has huge seas of hydrochloric acid, and who's inhabitants spit, and drip acid out of every pore. Not even if their bones are made from gold.3. They have the insanely powerful ship technology, but can't seem to get in or out of a wooden pantry that I could easily break through? Sure...I get it...they are so highly evolved that physical exertion is thousands of years back in their evolution. Yet they can run faster than us and jump up onto buildings. Which would explain the poison-gas wrist-thingies, right? I mean...that's logical, that makes sense.4. A farmer in the middle of PA, who farms corn, doesn't have a single firearm in the house? Or a stash? Even if he is a preacher, I find it absurd. I mean, I read Preacher. Jesse Custer carries shotguns and rifles and pistols frequently, and knows how to use them. Lame.5. M. Night Shyamalamnammanmnqyana has lost a lot of weight. He looked like your average everyday guy in this one, and in Sixth Sense, he looked all chubby and fat. But he plays a Doctor in one, and a Vet in the other...weird...some bizarre medical fetish, I suppose.Don't waste your time on this drivle and don't try to convince yourself that he's a genius. he's just playing up to America's post 9-11 "Faith is everything" crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not one of Night's better efforts.The Sixth Sense was a solid "8" out of 10.Watching the actors in this film made me feel like "I see dead people".Where there was overwhelming suspense - Mel Gibson seemed "jaded" or on dilaudid...Night made more than just a "patented" Hitchcockian appearance. (Night played a Dr. in UNBREAKABLE and this may have played well with his parents - they are both physicians.) In this film he seemed to escalate himself past the role of just an extra - like a "mystery man" or something - which is his business I guess.It did not work for me though.Other flaws (for me) were in the creature's costumes. They did not look real enough.I guess the 4 points that I gave it went to 1) Showing that 50's scifi can still work for young people and some older people 2) Urban Folklore can be used for a plot with success 3) A good Family is a good thing. Bright boys and sensitive lil girls are still amusing and cuddly. 4) Major actors can give credibility to not very good movies or scripts.iwh 4)</fullReview>

I couldn't help but laugh at some scenes, like the one I described above, with Gary bursting into the room full of humans. The whole theater gasps, and is then interrupted by my maniacal laughter. I demand a comedy/horror sequel where we battle aliens with super soakers and water balloons.Some things I just don't understand:1. Aliens are harvesting people. So they send ships to major cities where there are LOTS of people. However, they also send a ship or two or however many to BUMSTEAD, PA to harvest the 8 people who live there? What?2. Aliens melt when water is on them, yet they're harvesting humans who possess absurd amounts of water in their bodies, can SPIT onto them as a weapon, and live on a planet consisting of 70% water. I don't know, but if I'm a human, and I want to invade a planet, I'm not choosing the one that has huge seas of hydrochloric acid, and who's inhabitants spit, and drip acid out of every pore. Not even if their bones are made from gold.3. They have the insanely powerful ship technology, but can't seem to get in or out of a wooden pantry that I could easily break through? Sure...I get it...they are so highly evolved that physical exertion is thousands of years back in their evolution. Yet they can run faster than us and jump up onto buildings. Which would explain the poison-gas wrist-thingies, right? I mean...that's logical, that makes sense.4. A farmer in the middle of PA, who farms corn, doesn't have a single firearm in the house? Or a stash? Even if he is a preacher, I find it absurd. I mean, I read Preacher. Jesse Custer carries shotguns and rifles and pistols frequently, and knows how to use them. Lame.5. M. Night Shyamalamnammanmnqyana has lost a lot of weight. He looked like your average everyday guy in this one, and in Sixth Sense, he looked all chubby and fat. But he plays a Doctor in one, and a Vet in the other...weird...some bizarre medical fetish, I suppose.Don't waste your time on this drivle and don't try to convince yourself that he's a genius. he's just playing up to America's post 9-11 "Faith is everything" crap.</fullReview>

After viewing the first half of this movie I felt as if I had been watching a film on how slow corn grows. To pass the time I tried finding Hitchcockian hidden 'signs' by looking at details in the background for clues and there were almost N O N E ! ! ! I understand what the movie is about and its inclusion of several so-called Hitchcockian tricks and references like the McGuffin but it's not even worth mentioning them.

		<fullReview>Not one of Night's better efforts.The Sixth Sense was a solid "8" out of 10.Watching the actors in this film made me feel like "I see dead people".Where there was overwhelming suspense - Mel Gibson seemed "jaded" or on dilaudid...Night made more than just a "patented" Hitchcockian appearance. (Night played a Dr. in UNBREAKABLE and this may have played well with his parents - they are both physicians.) In this film he seemed to escalate himself past the role of just an extra - like a "mystery man" or something - which is his business I guess.It did not work for me though.Other flaws (for me) were in the creature's costumes. They did not look real enough.I guess the 4 points that I gave it went to 1) Showing that 50's scifi can still work for young people and some older people 2) Urban Folklore can be used for a plot with success 3) A good Family is a good thing. Bright boys and sensitive lil girls are still amusing and cuddly. 4) Major actors can give credibility to not very good movies or scripts.iwh 4)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signs of intellectual weakness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Researchers who have spent decades studying the worldwide, mysterious phenomena of crop circles and land glyphs that are sometimes larger than several football fields side by side and yet form in minutes have postulated that the event is also ancient. Evidences of this global mystery are age old.  The attempt in this film of Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan to suddenly tie the historic phenomena to a wafer-thin, comic book contrivance of hostile alien incursion certainly does not wash. At the level of the story we find in its text constant broadcast media reports of the aliens with no absolutely detail on their method or behavior. We see items such as the hero confronting an alien locked in a pantry, the alien apparently weak as a kitten then later escapes, again giving no detail as to his escape but then having gained supernatural power. Our hero cuts off some of its fingers afterward not seeking help from the police, nor mentioning the traumatic confrontation to no one. He just goes about expressing fright. In the subtext we find the hero, a minister, giving up his life commitment to God and humanity, in childish fashion, somehow forgetting all of his theological studies and comprehension of the complex universal workings of a supreme intelligence after the untimely death of his wife. Some minister. The entire mishmash of a production is given a bit of value only by the extraordinary performance of Mel Gibson who must have suffered working with the terrible script. If you want to see a truly scary, brilliantly written and produced film about some comic book extraterrestrial alien threat check out THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD, the Howard Hawks 1951 classic usually credited to Christian Nyby. Any number of extraterrestrial threat films of this genre with stories going back as far as a century ago with H. G. Wells' WAR OF THE WORLDS is superior. We expected much more from this writer director after his solid showing in THE SIXTH SENSE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first nine tenths of this movie were brilliant. It had a few religious themes, but also a few scientific themes as well, making it a film that both atheist and religious people could enjoy and relate too. But then came the conclusion. By the times the credits rolled the movie basically stated that religious people are full of hope and atheist people are full of fear. Such a generalization of any group of people is unexceptable to me. I have known many religious people full of fear while I, an athiest, am often hopeful when confronted with a situation that could go either way. Many of my favorite science fictions have used religious themes, such as the matrix and event horizon, but what i don't like about 'Signs' religious theme is it states that religion is right and beeing atheist is wrong. That to me makes a bad movie. Rating - First nine tenths, 10/10 - Last nine tenth, 0/10 Final rating - 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** 1/2Starring: Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, and Abigail Breslin."There's a monster outside my room, can I have a glass of water?" says little Bo Hess in the most frightening movie of the year. The movie is about Mel Gibson and his family uncover crop circles that may lead to the unthinkable. The movie has quite some frightening moments in it. Such as something involving a television screen. I have never heard an audience scream so loud to jump scenes. The movie starts a little slow but then gets quickly to the point after the word above. The film has quite some hilarious moments to it, such as when Gibson and Phoenix are trying to find a "culprit" and the words they are saying are so funny. The ending is a different ballgame. It's smart and intelligent, yet it is rather stupid. As for the Oscar nominations, expect a Best Director and Best Music. Overall if you don't see this movie this summer, you better hide.</fullReview>

That is, the movie is not what it appears to be in the Trailers. This statement is true and it is the ONLY real thing that is wrong with the movie. Otherwise it is a good movie to watch. In fact I urge you to forget you even saw the trailer. If you haven't seen the trailer, you have the best chance in enjoying this movie.When you watch the movie, you quickly realize that it's not much about the Aliens, per say, but more about Mel Gibsons character (Graham Hess) coming to terms with his faith after losing it along with his wife in a truly horrible accident. In fact, I would argue that the "Signs" that are refered to in the title have nothing to do with the crop circles but more of subtle hints that Graham's faith will return.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On one level, Signs is about those weird crop circles that appeared in various places in the 1970s. On another level, it's about faith and how people can find their own faith severely tested.But first, the crop circles. Who made them? Aliens, or humans playing a prank? In the present, the same mysterious circles are appearing throughout the world, including on a farm outside Philadelphia. The owner of this farm is Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), a former priest who renounced his faith when his wife was struck and killed by a driver who fell asleep at the wheel. Graham lives on his farm with his two kids Morgan (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin) and his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), and they all get along right fine until one weird morning when the kids discover that part of their corn crop has been flattened - in a perfect circle.What could this mean? Well, it's not giving anything away to explain that the film goes the aliens-are-communicating-with-us route; but as the second layer of the film might indicate, this isn't just about humans versus aliens, it's about having faith that one can weather a storm.Older son Morgan immediately jumps on the it-must-be-aliens bandwagon, and he obtains a book on UFOs at a local bookstore. Soon, wouldn't you know it, he's got his sister and his uncle believing aliens are here, and they're up to no good. Morgan explains that the circles are the aliens' way of making a map, and in due time he and his family are wearing those dopey tin-foil hats that crazy people put on to keep aliens from reading their minds.Now, I want you to stop and reread that last part: They put on tin-foil hats so the aliens can't read their minds. Sure, I know what you're probably thinking - this movie's done in a campy, 50's sci-fi kind of way, where nothing seems terribly real, but it's still entertaining. That would have been fine, but that's not how this movie was presented. Every nuance, every step, everything in the movie is presented as deadly serious - even the stupid tin-foil-hat thing. People in the theater laughed when things seemed amusing, but the laughter was misplaced; there wasn't anything terribly humorous in the entire movie.First, let's look at the characters. Graham is a strong, stoic type, but he dearly misses his wife (her death is needlessly recreated - sure, it had a lot to do with the issue of Graham's faith, but it was still pointless) and probably isn't as good of a parent as he'd like to be. His brother Merrill is a former minor-league baseball player who's a few sandwiches short of a picnic lunch. Much is made out of Merrill's dopiness (including a scene in which it's revealed why Merrill is not playing major league baseball), but I'm not sure why.Morgan and Bo are relatively interchangeable with other child characters. Morgan's a know-it-all, pushy and obnoxious. Oh, but we're supposed to think that has to do with his dad's lack of faith. Or am I looking too much into it? And Bo is just the sort of cutie-pie you'd expect, complete with those gosh-aren't-I-adorable facial and verbal expressions (you've no doubt seen the promos for the movie: "There's a monster outside my bed, can I have a glass of water?).The characters are poorly developed, and they're not played very appealingly. Yes, I realize Graham is supposed to be a sort of hero with some notable flaws, and these flaws will be exploited at some point during the movie. And perhaps this is a movie about redemption, sure. But was it necessarily good writing to have Graham do bold, heroic things in one moment, and then be utterly clueless and indecisive in the next? And if so much was made of Merrill's slow-wittedness, why wasn't it capitalized on? How come he didn't figure into the overall theme of faith more than he did?And the kids! In one scene, they're scared; in another, they're almost authoritative. Both characters have less depth than an Etch-a-Sketch doodle. I kept expecting Graham to yell at them - just once - or discipline them in some way, at some point. Nope, never happened. Both actors playing the kids were a bit wooden, too - they couldn't decide whether to deliver their lines in a flat robotic monotone or to overemphasize every other syllable.The pacing was pretty inconsistent, too. There were scenes in the cornfield that were excellently done, typical of an M. Night Shymalan movie (he did The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, too); these scenes evoked real terror and suspense. But there were many scenes that just plain didn't make a whole lot of sense, at least in terms of the rest of the movie. At one point, the family goes into town; almost nothing that happens there is terribly important, and what is important should have taken just a few minutes. Not so. Those scenes dragged on and on and on.I haven't even touched on the whole aliens aspect of the plot. Yes, there are aliens, and yes you do see them. Let me introduce Mr. Shymalan to a new concept called special effects. Since you undoubtedly had a budget, perhaps you could have given us more than some dude in a wetsuit. I realize that the alien appearance was secondary to the real theme of the movie, but please - none of that aspect was even remotely believable.As in the worst movies, this film had a high quotient of "Oh, come on!" moments. You know, when you're watching a scene and can't help but think, "Oh, come on!" These are scenes that test one's credibility, much as Graham's faith was tested. There were contrivances, there were red herrings, and there were serious screenwriting missteps. I lost count at how many times I said, "Oh, come on!" during the movie.This must go down as the worst M. Night Shymalan movie, and it also has to be one of the worst that Gibson's done in a long time. He wasn't right for the role, and even he couldn't make much sense of an implausible plot surrounded by nonsequiturs and terrible pacing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing about Signs is that it's not JUST a scary movie. Sure, it was scary as hell, it had the audience screaming and jumping out of their seats. But there was a deep, moving story beneath it that keeps us thinking long after we've seen it. This movie is funny... but not a forced funny, just subtle humor that breaks the tension between all the really suspenseful parts. This movie is also sad, but happy-sad sometimes. At some points I wasn't sure if I was crying because it was sad or because the movie was just so GOOD. I am in awe of the genius of M. Night Shyamalan-I've been a fan of his since before The Sixth Sense. He has this talent that lets him get below the surface of his viewers. My friends and I could do nothing but discuss the movie for a long time afterwards. I'm still thinking about it, so much that I had to see it twice during its opening weekend. Good job once again, M. Night. Now I just can't wait for his next one.</fullReview>

Yes, it had shades of "Blair Witch," but so what. What other movie has used silence and darkness to such effect? No, you don't see Mel or Joaquin tilling the land. So what? I laughed, I cried, sometimes in the same instant, and I definitely jumped in my seat a few times.I wasn't totally sure about the meaning behind Mel's telling his children about their mother at their births, or if it was just his way of reconnecting with them.M. Night's role in the film didn't seem self-indulgent to me. If I made a film, I'd want to be in it, too. No, he didn't make eye contact with Mel's character, and yes, he was a little monotone; he was totally freaked out.True, the ending sort of just ended, and I was hoping for more "twist," but I think that was just my expectations. I had the ending figured out early on and would have enjoyed it more had I not been trying so hard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NOTE: Bear in mind that I sat down in the theater to watch this movie with *very* high expectations; ready to suspend my critical facilities a bit and let the director work some magic on me. I did my part.That's it. I'm giving up on this director. It's not that I expect every one of his movies to deliver the same payload that "The Sixth Sense" did; but I expect him to deliver *something*.This movie was a....well, I was about to say "a mess", but that's not it. It was just plain insipid. A stupid failure on many fronts.*** spoilers ***I was very curious about and full of anticipation for the resolution on the early characterization of the emotionally closed family. I guess the dinner table crying scene was supposed to be that resolution. Or something. But it didn't get resolved in a satisfactory manner.The aliens were stupid. The film was like a couple of neighborhood kids making an alien movie during their summer break, except their neighborhood is Palos Verdes, and they have millions in their budget. "OK, let's make 'em *reeeeel* creepy, y'know! Like, with big; I mean really *BIG* gross fingernails! Yeah! And they have to have reeeeeally scary teeth! Yeah, like, and like, they don't have toothpaste on the planet they come from!" In the larger view, the aliens were like a weird carbuncle on the hiney of this movie. I did not see the point of even having aliens in this movie, except it was not impossible to dovetail them into the clumsy skeinwork of the plot.The dialog gives new depth and meaning to the term "wooden." And I do mean that; it's not wooden in the normal sense. Maybe the correct descriptor is "waxy;" like dialog that wax museum dummies might exchange. It's unremittingly and interminably clever, seeking to find it's trenchancy within seconds of expression, vs. laying back a bit and contributing to the building up of a powerful scenario or storyline. The few places where cross references happen (e.g., Mel's wife's last dying words and the alien confrontation scene) are so contrived and cheap you can see the duct tape holding the plot together.The sad thing about a movie like this is that its failure is obvious. You could plainly see that the director was trying to say something about the power of the spiritual; and he failed. He tried to say something about providential reasons for accepting individual quirks and seeming flaws in the people around us; and maybe only delivered on a dimly intellectual level. He tried to say something about the positive impact of adversity on our deeper selves; and dropped the ball. When, at the end, I saw Gibson dressing up in his collar to do his priestly rounds again, I could see why this was supposed to make sense from the standpoint of the director's good intentions, but shook my head that this movie simply failed to bring so many of us along for that ride.I guess I've said enough. Someone pull the plug on the Shyamalan juggernaut, please.Thanks for reading. I'll go now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Signs is a unique film and characteristic of M. Night Shymalan's usual style of filmmaking. But it is not by any means a great film. It can't even be described as entertaining. Sixth Sense was a scary and thought-provoking movie that kept me up many nights. Signs is trying to be a suspenseful film with some substance.(Substance as in the lost faith of the reverend.) But the substance was ridiculous and the suspense was unrewarding. Is this film supposed to be a drama about a man who doubts the existence of a caring God, or is this a film about the invasion of aliens? Either way, Signs falls short. The scene when Mel Gibson tells Joaquin Phoenix about the two kinds of people in the world was perhaps the most superficial and idiotic scene in film history. Save your dollars, go see runteldat, a hilarious film that IS what it's supposed to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious Garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I felt when I walked out of Unbreakable, I want to find M. Night Shaymalan, and hurt him. We're talking baseball-bat-to-the-knees hurt. This is because I: 1) wasted ANOTHER 2 good hours of my life under the false feeling that this one would be good, 2) the film is long and boring, and the pay-off is non-existent, unless you buy into the director's empty pretensions, and 3) the suspense is very cheaply manipulated and manufactured. The only small consolation is that he seems to only have 2 more films in him before he's run out of his bag of tricks. This one already show serious "signs" of creative fatigue.This film is unbearably pretentious, though not quite as bad as Unbreakable. I was surprised for the first hour that things actually HAPPEN at a quick clip, unlike in Unbreakable, but he makes up for it by slowing the pace in the second hour. Is there an alien clawing at the door? What better time for a 45-second shot of a stationary flashlight! Are spaceships landing outside? Then how about showing a blank wall for a full minute? Is your house being invaded by aliens? That's the right time for a long, lugubrious flashback, or a Hallmark-level family reminescence! That'd be GREAT! It is a CHEAP suspense tactic to simply NOT SHOW something that is happening, or have your actors take 10 times longer to react to something. That's not skill, it's pretentious manipulation, it's the main reason Shymalan better stay away from me when I've got a weapon in my hand. This film would be 1/2 hour shorter if we didn't have to endure such maddeningly long takes. They may generate suspense, but not honorably. Compared to Hitchcock my ass. Most reviews say "Shymalan knows that what's not shown is scarier than what is." Well, in this case, that's because, shown or not shown, NOTHING IS HAPPENING.The entire story is truly non-existent. Basically, something is ABOUT to happen, ABOUT to happen, ABOUT to happen (this is the "suspense" part), then, oops, it doesn't happen. The end. The entire story utterly flies apart at the end, makes ZERO sense, and is VERY unsatisfying. What we get instead is a extremely flimsy, sub-Oprah-level meditation of "faith." Well guess what, M. Night? When you tie your "message" into a story that ultimately turns out to be a big flat deflated balloon, your "message" is invalidated as well. There was an article in the 8/4/2002 NYTimes about "nonmovies." Movies that SEEM to have emotion, style, and substance, but it's all recycled, and only REFERS to emotion and substance. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to "Signs."I do think Shymalan can be compared to George Lucas... a filmmaker who thinks that everyone should spend great amounts of attention and thought to his work, but doesn't think you should have any incentive to do so, and doesn't think they should be rewarded for their effort, because the SIMPLE JOY OF WATCHING A FILM BY M. NIGHT SHYMALAN SHOULD BE REWARD ENOUGH!!!! This is called "Narcissim."The increasingly hysterical opening credits offer a clue of what is to come. There IS one effective moment, later, the newscast of the birthday party. But, let me ask you, how many newscasts will include the preceeding 45-seconds of birthday party video footage before the thing we're waiting for happens? Only M. Night Shymalan's newscast. I can see a parody of him on Saturday Night Live: as Mel Gibson is grappling with an alien, Shymalan points his camera at a stationary paper cup. "Okay," he says, "the alien breaks in--cut to the cup! The cup is NOT MOVING!! The cup is ABSOLUTELY STILL! There is NO MOVEMENT from the cup!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NOTE: Bear in mind that I sat down in the theater to watch this movie with *very* high expectations; ready to suspend my critical facilities a bit and let the director work some magic on me. I did my part.That's it. I'm giving up on this director. It's not that I expect every one of his movies to deliver the same payload that "The Sixth Sense" did; but I expect him to deliver *something*.This movie was a....well, I was about to say "a mess", but that's not it. It was just plain insipid. A stupid failure on many fronts.*** spoilers ***I was very curious about and full of anticipation for the resolution on the early characterization of the emotionally closed family. I guess the dinner table crying scene was supposed to be that resolution. Or something. But it didn't get resolved in a satisfactory manner.The aliens were stupid. The film was like a couple of neighborhood kids making an alien movie during their summer break, except their neighborhood is Palos Verdes, and they have millions in their budget. "OK, let's make 'em *reeeeel* creepy, y'know! Like, with big; I mean really *BIG* gross fingernails! Yeah! And they have to have reeeeeally scary teeth! Yeah, like, and like, they don't have toothpaste on the planet they come from!" In the larger view, the aliens were like a weird carbuncle on the hiney of this movie. I did not see the point of even having aliens in this movie, except it was not impossible to dovetail them into the clumsy skeinwork of the plot.The dialog gives new depth and meaning to the term "wooden." And I do mean that; it's not wooden in the normal sense. Maybe the correct descriptor is "waxy;" like dialog that wax museum dummies might exchange. It's unremittingly and interminably clever, seeking to find it's trenchancy within seconds of expression, vs. laying back a bit and contributing to the building up of a powerful scenario or storyline. The few places where cross references happen (e.g., Mel's wife's last dying words and the alien confrontation scene) are so contrived and cheap you can see the duct tape holding the plot together.The sad thing about a movie like this is that its failure is obvious. You could plainly see that the director was trying to say something about the power of the spiritual; and he failed. He tried to say something about providential reasons for accepting individual quirks and seeming flaws in the people around us; and maybe only delivered on a dimly intellectual level. He tried to say something about the positive impact of adversity on our deeper selves; and dropped the ball. When, at the end, I saw Gibson dressing up in his collar to do his priestly rounds again, I could see why this was supposed to make sense from the standpoint of the director's good intentions, but shook my head that this movie simply failed to bring so many of us along for that ride.I guess I've said enough. Someone pull the plug on the Shyamalan juggernaut, please.Thanks for reading. I'll go now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't Meet High Expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While "Signs" is a good effort, it doesn't really get close to the high expectations built up by the proceeding publicity. Interestingly, "Signs" begins almost like an independent movie, even a David Lynch movie, with strange expressions, silent moments, disconnected and disjointed scenes and dialogue - spooky - sort of, but slow. There are a number of clever movie techniques attempted, with Mel Gibson being seen with only half a face in the light, a number of great bumps in the night moments, yet the movie didn't seem to have a rational, reasonable experience true to life feel. Moving back and forth from present to past, the ultimate connections did not prove nearly as satisfying as "The Sixth Sense." Actually, the director as actor proved to be one of the better parts of the movie.The police are no where to be seen later in the movie. Mel Gibson's brother seems wasted because unlike "The Others" with Nicole Kidman, we have a less spooky confrontation because now there are more people to support each other unlike Nicole and her two children. The humor was cute and helped the movie move along, but it seemed "only" cute, not naturally a part of normal life that we, as the audience can identify with.The movie tried to be an individual family's confrontation with the unknown, but it was intruded upon by the outside, television world. The unknown forces didn't seem real either - unlike - "The Blair Witch Project." How come there was even television communication to begin with. There was too much attempted here, expectations were set too high. The focus was distracted by too many threads going on. The end result is a slow going, unreal, disconnected movie that can't overcome had moments of good movie making and experimental cinematic attempts. But be sure better things will come from this director no doubt.</fullReview>

The other half was better; at least it had a little action. I find pretty stupid that no one discovered the way to kill the aliens before the very end when there is always a certain amount of rain around the world.

The writer has some weak dialogs (ie the army guy) but the majority of the script is strong. What works in this film results from the lack of special effects; not seeing the aliens, things that run around in the night, moving door knobs, noises, etc. The locked in the basement scene made my heart race, what tension, but the ending is anti climatic after the basement scene.

		<shortDescription>MANIPULATIVE, EMPTY, PRETENTIOUS. In otherwords, IT STINKS.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I for one am very tired of being manipulated by M. Night Shyamalan, and offered movies with pretentious messages and warped little twists. "Signs" is similar to "Unbreakable" in that style, and this is a real disappointment.In the trailers and ads we are shamelessly deceived into thinking this is about aliens and will be real scary. It is really about some corny internal spiritual journey the main character (Gibson) takes after his wife's death in a car crash. What the message is remains unclear; supposedly it is about "faith", those who have it and those who don't. But the dopey end seems to mock Christian beliefs, leaving us with an entirely empty message with no point or reolution.Shyamalan uses film school tricks and ideas lifted from various other movies to build the tension, while trying to get us to emotionally "bond" with the farm family being visited by aliens. This direction is so obvious I sat there analyzing it more than feeling it. At the end what have we? A dead alien who is more than a mere alien, a baseball bat, water phobia, and no discernible resolution on the matter of faith and The Great Beyond. What the alien really is up to struck me as ridiculous for various reasons. WAIT FOR THE DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the unraveling of a story, people expect a payoff. With Signs, the payoff is the unraveling. We pick up on strange frequencies given by the somber tone of the film. We tell ourselves that nothing is there, our senses desperately scream at us otherwise, and the film builds and builds and builds.The mastery of Signs isn't in its concept, but rather in the way it manages to sustain a certain tone of trepidation, and deliver upon it in progressively suspenseful ways to the very end. Movies like Shyamalan's "The Sixth Sense" and "Unbreakable" have been wise in the ways they've concealed a crucial element to understanding the true nature of themselves right in plain sight-- the telling felt off, right up until their realities were overturned while leaving audiences frantically working out the logistics of the newly defined truth in their heads. Signs has honed this skill, and uses it to suspend our need for explanation while all around, things have never felt more wrong. The unease inherent in fearing something just beyond our ability to see and hear is something we are more receptive to than any other type of fear; command over this instinct is what separates bad horror movies from good ones, then good ones from great ones.From the opening credits, we are granted insight into how the movie works. At first, the words are introduced with slow fade-ins and the aid of subdued violins. Low-key, before a Hitchcockian score cuts through the repose and the title is introduced like a jump cut to something unfriendly. The title cards are now shown in regular cuts, but then- whoosh!- now they're zooming onto the screen with the score now in full Psycho-mode. This is escalation, and it reflects perfectly the aim of this film and the way it chooses to go about it. The opening shot is just as disseminating: a normal backyard in all respects, and yet... Something is Wrong.The backyard belongs to a farm in rural Pennsylvania, under the ownership of Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) and his family of two kids, Bo (Abigail Breslin) and Morgan (Rory Culkin). Graham is a former priest who seems to have lost his faith ever since an incident that left his family a little emptier. Bo, his daughter, cannot ever seem to finish a glass of water but has discomforting dreams that seem to mean something for the family; the dreams are never brought into the spotlight, cannily remaining in the fringes of the movie's focus for us to interpret. Morgan is the son who suffers from asthma and maintains his faith despite his father. They are accompanied by Hess' brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix). They are already a broken family before the crop circles form in their field, and we start seeing things, signs. Of?Terror is quiet. We stare for longer than we should because we think we saw something. We listen intently, and hear nothing, and we listen harder. Skillfully done horror doesn't manifest in the form of tangible scares, but in their absence. You remember the saying by Hitchcock: "There's two people having breakfast and there's a bomb under the table. If it explodes, that's a surprise. But if it doesn't..." Dogs bark at nothing, the wind blows strangely, and it's as if what's hidden is right in the characters' faces. Right in the air they breathe. In a scene that has the characters parsing a book on the possibility of extraterrestrials, I thought back to Jaws.Whatever they are, the things we can't see, we perceive them through secondhand means. We see shadows, we hear noises, silhouettes in the night slink in and out of view. When footage of them is captured, the image quality is low and grainy; we see just enough. Fewer things are more disturbing than catching a glimpse of someone's, or something's, head dart behind a wall. Because our terror is inflamed by what we can't sense and justified by the few times we can, their presence extends far past what we can physically make of them and locks the whole movie in a state of omnipresent dread.Our knowledge of the aliens is as sparse as it is beside the point. News reports aren't that informative or knowledgeable-- realistically, they know as little as we do. Although we know the spaceships are there, we can't see them. We know there must be panic brewing down there, but we never see any rioting or commotion; by diverting the focus away from scenes of pandemonium in the streets and in homes, we aren't given a means of climactic catharsis standard to the aftermaths of alien invasion movies. The crop circles explain pretty much nothing and everything. We don't have to know where they come from, just that it's obviously unnatural. Our imaginations take care of the rest. Quite a bit is left up to the viewer's imagination, but Shyamalan gives us the tools to start out. When crickets suddenly stop chirping, he gives us room to consider why.The story is all the more real for keeping its scope limited to the experiences of a few. They live ordinary lives, are surrounded by ordinary things. That these events are transpiring is all the more unnerving because whatever normal is, this isn't. Signs gets under your skin, inside your mind, takes your most primal fears and plays hide-and-seek with them. Don't look in the pantry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a passionate cinephile I get intensely annoyed when modern directors steal the ideas, situations etc., from great, and even not so great films from the past. 'Signs' is, in effect, little more than 'War of the Worlds' re-couched in a family environment that is reminiscent of 'The Birds' with a splash of 'The Wizard of Oz' thrown in. One has the idea that M Night Shymalan might claim that is film is some kind of homage to these films, but that is nonsense. It is a load of tosh (English slang for rubbish), that is interesting, up to a point, all the time it is 'about' crop circles, and disintegrates into ridicule when it becomes an apocalyptic vision. 'The Sixth Sense' was clever, well-constructed and thoughtful. This film is none of those.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Symbolism in Signs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>|Contains Spoilers|I need to share this particular theory that appeals to me more than any other popular critique of the movie and of the director, or even any misjudged 'praise' based on a naive surface reading, in place of a deeper visceral analysis of symbolism in Signs. The issue with the water killing aliens and the viewer's prideful assumption that this particular "plot hole" is beneath them because of its seemingly simplistic nature, watch the movie again and think of the water as "holy water", and keep in mind that the little girl was called an "Angel" upon her birth. She is the bearer of the holy water, scattering water glasses around the house.Think beyond the idea of "aliens." Things that are "alienated" to the mind, are perceived as dangerous, frightful and even demonic. Think about demons in mythology and religious texts. Note when the radio announced that they came up with a way to "fight them back" in the Middle East, the provenance of the Abrahamic religions. This is the demon that the priest has to face. He is being examined for the deep- seated organic nature of his faith that still resides within him, rethinking meaning behind seemingly unnecessary events that happened in his life. The idea of a substance such as water that was sufficient in demolishing aliens NEEDED to be simplistic. It is a notion within not only Christianity but most spiritual traditions that water is the source of purity, washing away dirt and basically anything and everything that comes in its way. Be it man's sins, or obstacles to salvation. All the while being something so ordinary and within reach.And lastly, the title "Signs", I think is a reminder of the "Signs and Wonders" school of thought. The idea that the teachings of Christianity and the Gospel can be communicated more effectively when associated with phenomenons of a metaphysical essence, or of the "unknown."Fear of the unknown is a truly powerful thing! There is so much to explore in Signs, including the many uses of reflections and iconography but I leave that to others.Lastly, I am clueless as to what Shyamalan himself believes in. I know that he went to a Christian school while being Hindu. He sure as heck insists on advocating religion. Nonetheless, he had a vision and I hope he comes back strong!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are tons of horror movies and not all of them can make you this much scary. This movie is a great suspense. I love the script... Especially when I saw the new horror movies that came in this year, I really can understand the value of this movie much more. Signs is one of the best of its kind. I really can not understand that how this magnificent story doesn't deserve better. I think Signs must have been earned at least 7,5 points. 6,7 is too low for this piece of art. I really liked the alien concept but not all of the alien movies can make you this much scary. Signs is scary, and suspenseful at the same time. And how many movies you know that M. Gibson and J. Phoenix are both playing at the same project. They both are a legend! And you can see why when you are watching the movie. Signs is a classic, this movie is one of the few of its kind. They don't make horror movies like this anymore. M. Night Shyamalan was a genius director back in those days, but it is sad that he is not making horror movies like this anymore. But Signs will be a classic forever. And we will understand the quality of this movie much more when we will see the upcoming new generation horror movies. Making a classic horror movie is a hard thing. But Mr. Shyamalan achieve that by making Signs and The Sixth Sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im sure everyone has read the terrible writers plothole, and yes thats exactly what it is, about how a small glass of water can melt the aliens like the wicked witch in The Wizard of Oz. But this doesn't make sense considering the creature has to have some intelligence. I mean they conquered space travel, so they cant be completely dumb. And any intelligent creature will first test the environment of a new planet by taking air samples, observing the weather etc and then act accordingly. But not these aliens. They just hop in and hope for the best. Ugh... If they had done some tests, they would find that even our AIR has water, and so breathing would be impossible. They would see it rains a deadly liquid and would equip themselves properly. But what we got were stark naked alien dummies with no protective clothing. So if it rains out, they're all doomed. A kid with a toy water pistol is a deadly weapon. Not to mention a couple firetrucks or a garden hose. Completely unbelievable. And now for the biggest plothole involving water. The aliens were running through cornfields at night. AT NIGHT! I don't care if you live in the dry Sahara desert, you run through a cornfield at night and you'll be soaked from head to foot in dew. Mistakes like this are unacceptable. And for the last stupid alien idea, like this movie needs another, is their weapon. Its the weakest thing I've ever seen. Its suppose to be a poison gas but they gave a sick child a direct hit and it did nothing. It trickles out of their wrist so slowly that in a slight breeze it would blow back in their face lol. Ridiculous. This movie does have some good parts though. The alien scenes were creepy, ill give them that, and Gramns struggle with religion was nicely done. But jees, put a little thought into what would happen in a real invasion. The aliens would not be that stupid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT Many reviewers here complained about the ridiculous plot holes and I agree. It's full of holes.I see a lot of movies and I will walk if it looks lousy. There's 20+ movies to choose from, why waste time on a lousy one? If I hear lame dialog, a trite or clich script, if I roll my eyes more than twice, I'm outta there. If the writer and director are lousy, they're not going to get any better. An exception to this is when they hire another writer or director after firing the lame one. An example of this is "The Muppets Take Manhattan," where the first half is lousy, but the second half is good and even great in some parts.I walked on "Signs" after about 40 minutes and didn't look back. However, a family member insisted that it was good and all came together in the end, so I went back and watched the entire movie, start to end. Boy was I sorry, I should have stayed away.The movie is ridiculous on various levels, but besides that, it has nothing worthwhile to offer.As soon as the aliens came into the story, I was able to accurately predict the entire story: Aliens may or may not be here. As the movie progresses, the evidence of the aliens becomes more pronounced until we begin to see glimpses of them. From there we will go into the climax where we have a showdown with the aliens and win. That's a synopsis of the plot and who, I mean who, is going to say there is anything at all original about that? No one over the age of 13.The movie plays out just as I predicted. But there's some quasi-religious mumbo-jumbo thrown in there that's really the point of the story. Fine, the only problem is that the mumbo-jumbo is so utterly ridiculous that it's laughable.Unless I'm missing something (unlikely), the plot is this: God causes Gibson's wife to get horribly injured in an accident where she suffers in agony until Gibson can get there, whereupon she delivers a coded message from God to Gibson, without Gibson realizing it, and then she dies. This accident causes Gibson to lose his faith in God. Meanwhile, God has caused another family member that is a budding baseball star to suffer an injury and his career and life are ruined. Then, God causes the kid to have an irrational preoccupation with water, resulting in half glasses of water being left all over the house. Then, God causes all these circumstances to work together during an alien invasion of earth such that the coded message, the water, and the sports career work together to defeat the aliens in the house and save lives. Gibson sees how God has wrought all of this and regains his faith. If that's it, that's the most utterly ridiculous, blasphemous, lame, contrived, etc story I've ever heard of.So I'm wondering two things: 1: Is my understanding of the story complete and my laughter is justified, or did I miss something? And 2: How on earth did the guy that wrote the brilliant "The 6th Sense" write this load of tripe? It would seem that his contract with the movie studio includes a "right of subcontract" and he subcontracted his swimming pool cleaning guy to write this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculous plot and excellent director &lt;&gt; good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Production values aside, this move was awful. Yes it is atmospheric, so if you can check your brain at the door it may be worth watching. If you expect anything remotely logical, look elsewhere. (8 for atmosphere, -2 for plot = average of 3) Brilliant aliens can cross interstellar space, but can't open doors. Brilliant aliens afraid of water can build either generation ships or ships capable of FTL travel, but come to a planet covered with water.This film is among the least believable cinema efforts since Ed Wood - and at least he was funny (if unintentionally so). Shyamalan did a great job with The Sixth Sense, but the script for this one is utter garbage. Save some time and have a better experience by holding a puppet show based on your 7 year old's script - it'll hold together better and cost less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I woke up in the middle of the night and saw "Signs" all the way through the first time, guided by these reviews. As I read these reviews it seemed we have people from show business and others in related fields. I thank you for giving some very insightful reviews and synopsis. I still like Mel Gibson even after his recent transgressions. His Road Warrior films were instant cult favorites. I just hoped this movie would put me back to sleep, but these reviews had me thinking.Only 10 films in 16 yrs. 'listed here at IMDb' and M. Night Shyamalan is declared the next Hitchcock. It is an insult to a great mans legacy. Look up Alfred Hitchcock here at IMDb, check out his stats. He was relevant to his generation, as reflected by his popularity and prodigious body of work. Maybe there are some stylistic similarities to Alfred, but M. Night is missing some crucial elements that made Alfred Hitchcock household words. M. Night Shyamalan is more an Alfred Hitchcock imitator than the implied replacement. I think for the most part M. Night Shyamalan makes movies only film students can appreciate. We common viewers just want something that grabs our attention and holds it. It is also nice when a think piece (as the pacing of this movie suggests) makes sense. "Spoiler Alert" No one emotes the fear of having a regular intruder, let alone one of such unusual and dangerous a nature. So the bulb getting busted should have been a much bigger deal. Another problem was creature design. If you are going to show a creature of this nature, design it so it is well suited to its implied capabilities. Of course warriors can be a different species than the tool makers. M. Nights vision of the Alien Menace, is a naked, slow moving, underpowered creature with claws unsuitable for tool skills. That thing would never have survived natural selection on our brutal planet. No space ships, space guns, suits or accessories. No expensive locations, nor unique scenery, nor difficult stunts. Nothing complex or painstaking. Few extras, few vehicles, no great logistics duties. At $72,000,000 for production costs "Signs" must have been a good payday for someone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's nothing amazing, but it's better than a lot of what is out there on a technical level.There were heartwarming moments and tense moments, but it never got too boring. It understood entertainment, and that's really all it was. Some people could be put off by the ending, but that ending has been done so many times I'm not sure why people even care.The only thing about the movie that really bugs me was the alien. At that point, the movie completely ruined any and all suspense and atmosphere it worked so hard to build. As if we haven't seen enough humanoid aliens in the past, whereas superior alien films, like Alien, work to go against what we already think we know and redesign it. The fact this film was so essentially safe really annoyed me.Can't really say much because there isn't really a plot other than what the title implies. Nothing even remotely original or scary, but it was fun to watch.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a check well done besides all film - art criteria when ?Signs" is put on the test. And that is not a surprising fact, as we well know that its creator is a man with natural talent in this respect. However "Signs" lacks on the imagination side, imagination was focused on delivering brilliant visual scenery rather than intrigue. The plot was too closed in itself, the "topography" of suspense did not manage to tingle the viewer. Action built up then suddenly faded into dramatic moments that left suspense aside. This usually would not be a big deal but when one goes to see a movie with the thematic nature of "Signs" he not only wants to see good acting, camera work and brilliant images but also wants to leave the theater in owe, shocked and by that satisfied. That is what the movie lacks.Apart from that this is a very decent film.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two parts wonderful, one part misleading</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definitely one to see. The best element is the humor, mostly unspoken, done so well with facial expressions. Wonderful acting by all, including both children. At the first glimpse of an "alien," I was almost too scared to watch the rest of the movie alone. That said, one large element of the film, the THEME, really disappointed me. I have no problem with this being about a man who lost his faith due to tragedy. I think Mel handled his character's descent into despair very well. BUT, the religious theme overshadowed other, better parts of the movie. I wanted to be scared and instead I was distracted by inaccurate religious presumptions. Movies like this are misleading in that they assume people only choose to not be religious because of some personal tragedy; that they've been "betrayed" by God. (It's too much to grasp that most atheists don't believe in a god in the first place, so can hardly be betrayed by something we consider nonexistent.) This is almost impossible for most religious people to understand, but many atheists are very comfortable with that choice, and though we realize religion offers many people comfort, it's not a comfort we need.The myths and generalities about extraterrestrials disappointed me. The crop circle hoaxes were solved years ago. The film even mentions that. But the aliens' appearance (hard to describe, almost featureless but basically human in shape) reminded me of something from Carl Sagan's "The Demon Haunted World." I recommend that book to EVERYONE, religious or not. Someone once told me he would never read Sagan because Sagan didn't believe in God. That made me question that man's faith. If you truly have faith, can't you open your eyes and ears to learn about other people's points of view without worrying your own might be shaken? But I suppose it's natural to prefer being surrounded by POVs matching your own. Which is probably why I was disappointed in MNS's apparent message in this movie.Despite the distractions, I liked this movie enough to buy it, because the characters are so great. Joaquin has grown into a fine-looking man, and he and Mel work wonderfully together. The kids are great.Extra, nit-picky thoughts after seeing the DVD special features. The most interesting was "Night's First Alien Film" which gives hope to nerdy teens everywhere that they too can become a famous director! But that little segment pointed something out that had been bugging me.MNS is very talented, as "The Sixth Sense" makes obvious. It's great that he's had the opportunity to bring his childhood interests in the paranormal to the big screen. But his fault lies in a leftover childish approach, in which he apparently does little real research into his subjects. He doesn't bother to double check for flaws. For instance, many complaints on this movie centered around the aliens. Their appearance, their easy defeat...they should have had the foresight to protect themselves (with the religious theme, was it supposed to be "holy water"?) Traipsing around Mel's cornfield on a foggy night, the corn had to be dewy. It's as if MNS had the plot laid down first, but when holes appeared, he used quick, easy fixes to patch them.The result is that these aliens were unbelievably inept. For creatures advanced enough to develop space travel and chameleon-like camouflage, it's hard to reconcile their shortcomings. Besides their easy defeat, there are also a lot of problems with their strategy. The recruiter tells Merrill the aliens are "probing," performing covert espionage to make sure things are "all clear...for the rest of them." So, why in the world would they create these giant, obvious crop circles, putting all humans on the alert? A real "covert" team would use existing landmarks, navigating via the earth's natural or man-made features instead of making giant "Hi, We're HERE" signs. Second, if they and their ships could be invisible, why would the ships "appear" over major cities 24 hours before the attack, putting humans on alert and defense, especially if they're here to "harvest" us? That's like going deer hunting and blowing a foghorn every minute as you walk through the woods.Other problems were the humans' approach to the situation. Graham was quick to call the cops twice at the beginning...why, after actually finding an alien (at Ray Reddy's) did he not alert any authorities? You could argue that by then, he was already too "descended into despair," but if so, why bother wanting to leave, or if staying, why bother to board the place up? (Same with Reddy -- why didn't HE call any authorities?) For a man who had been a reverend, a central figure in his community, even in his despair you'd think he'd be concerned about his former parishioners (or they'd be concerned about him). Instead, his family remained completely isolated (which MNS wanted, a la Hitchcock's "The Birds," but it doesn't make complete sense here). And the family had a lackluster approach to defense. Again, despair or no, even Merrill took his sweet time in fortifying the house, and when they finally went into the basement, no one bothered to grab any food, tools, weapons, or Morgan's medicine.The movie had wonderful potential. MNS also has great potential. His directional style, eye for camera work, and sense of subtle humor are great. Hopefully his attention to detail and problem-solving abilities will grow and mature as well. Unfortunately,his career currently seems to be going in the opposite direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Preacher loses his faith in God, gets it back by whacking an Alien.What is wrong with this picture? There it is... poor craftsmanship due to Superfluous Novelty. Shyamalan's "style" seems to just that... all style, no substance. Maybe he is trying to use the William Burroughs method of "cut-up" storytelling - you write something - chop it into snippets - and then reassemble it randomly. I believe that Anime is written this way. Put a lot of unrelated ideas on little slips of paper, mix them in a bowl, and then pull out a few to create characters and plot. Like: Samurai/Robot/Bus driver - good protagonist! Amphibious/Demon/Wombats - what a villain! Moon Landing/Nuclear/Earthquake - sets the stage! All this makes you SEEM to be creative and innovative. But it all falls flat without some thread of continuity to it. Some people can do it (i.e., "The Birds") and others can't (i.e., "Signs").This movie tries to do 2 things simultaneously and succeeds at neither. As a morality fable of 'lost faith', it's main character is not believable to me - he's just a plot device. As some sort of Science Fiction 'thriller', it was not suspenseful and relied on pointless and overused 'boogeyman' thrills - I suppose it looks good in the trailers to get the crowds in. I liked "The Sixth Sense" , it was OK. I watched "Unbreakable" and found it pointlessly arbitrary and confusing; like a jigsaw puzzle made from several different boxes. I have not seen "The Village" or "Lady in the Water", but they both sound like a further deterioration in his film-making career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alien invasion movie with great style and no common sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An invasion by an an advanced alien race who come in an invisible spacecraft - Earth is in big trouble, right? Wrong! Luckily, these are the dumbest aliens in the history of cinema. First of all, they leave huge location markers known as crop signs from which the movie gets its name. These aliens, despite superior technology, don't seem to know they could stop at a store and get a GPS locater for a few hundred bucks that conveniently tracks anywhere on the planet down to the square yard. Next, they are allergic to water. Good old H2O reacts on their bodies much as hydrochloric acid would. Add to that, they come down naked with no protective devices and choose to invade Pennsylvania where it rains a lot. I gather they didn't happen to notice on their approach from space that earth is covered with 80% water. So that gives humans a big advantage, right? Well, yes. But unfortunately, the aliens invade the only known section of rural Pennsylvania where nobody owns any guns. Anywhere else in America, every farmhouse has at least a rifle or a shotgun but these residents defend themselves with aluminum foil helmets, knives, and baseball bats. Luckily, this is offset by the fact that the aliens' only weapon is a poison sprayer that travels about a foot and a half. That seems oddly primitive for a race capable of interstellar travel and invisibility. Despite an inane plot, a lack of explosions, and no sexual content, this movie is worth seeing. It has alternately surprising chills, suspense, laughs, and tenderness. The redeeming qualities come from superior direction, great acting, and a strong theme (faith), proving once again that people will buy absolutely anything if it's packaged right.</fullReview>

A family is doing the best they can to stay together while the world is invaded by aliens. But the greatest part is the message about faith lost and regained in the face of tragedy. M. Night knows how to bring you right into the movie and keep you there until the end. Well cast, well acted, especially Phoenix, and a heaping does of heart stopping suspense. Gibson does an awesome job of playing the father who is trying to keep his head on straight. Phoenix delivers, as usual, with his good uncle character. Like most of M.

		<fullReview>"Signs" is undoubtedly the stupidest, most vacuous, inane, pathetic movie that I have ever seen in my 74 years. How any actor would be hard up enough to accept a role in this stinker is beyond me. I really disciplined myself to watch this excruciating effort to its conclusion. I didn't think that I was capable of watching such tripe to its conclusion. The directing, dialog, story, and everything else associated with this fiasco takes the cake in the production of a deplorable asinine movie.Another loser movie which to me is quite similar to the "Signs" is "Close Encounters of the Third Kind." I can't wait to see "Gigli." After how badly it has been panned I can't imagine how it could be any worse than the aforementioned.Give me the movies that were really movies.

Rory Kulkin still continues to astonish. SIGNS was truly silly...all style and no sense after the lights came up. It looks good, well photographed and good art direction on the farm and the local village. But once you see that alien..... well we now have a drive in movie pretending to be a Spielberg movie. and once that baseball bat was reached for, well, I'm sure all hooted and hollered and dropped popcorn in the cine hyper mega plex because once 'the usual American violence' took over the movie showed no sign of recovery.

		<fullReview>I think that editors are a good thing. When writers and directors are new and lacking in success, a good editor can build on great inspiration and make a story something truly special. The problems start when a writer or director becomes famous. Either they become too powerful to allow those necessary little tweaks, or no one has the guts to even suggest them anymore. Well, I'm no writer! That much is plain to anyone reading this. However, I also have no reason to fear M. Night Shyamalan. He could probably take me in a street fight, but the chances of that ever happening are pretty slim. I run too fast! So here goes... I thought Signs was a good movie. I thought it could have been a great movie. The build up of suspense was there. The story kept viewers interested. We liked and cared about the characters. But the cheesy aliens buried it. Was this movie actually made in the 70's and left in the can for 30 years? I felt that the build up was leaving the audience guessing if there really was an invasion at all. Was it all just a hoax, or some unexplainable phenomenon? That uncertainty was the best part of the movie and if we had been left with that, I'm sure some would have cried "Rip Off!", but I also believe that this film would have been hailed rather than panned..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In The Pivotal Final Scene, Our Hero's brother splashes water on the alien, killing it. The aliens have an Achilles Heel: water is like acid to them.Take a look at a map of the Earth. What do you see? Water! 75% or so of our planet is covered in water. It's in our air, in the rocks, in all the plant life. Would you consider invading an alien planet that was mostly, say, sulphuric acid? I think you'd either find a protective suit or check your starmap for the nearest other invadable planet. It's just plain silly to think that aliens who die when contacted by water would invade us.Worse, and I mean really worse, they invade because they are harvesting us, presumably to eat us. We are actually over 80% water! One bite and it's bye-bye alien.This bit ruined the movie for me. It's such a glaring plot hole that, in my opinion, it just negated anything else that might have been positive in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan seems to be like a train. While he does move on in a steady pace, he doesn't leave the track. Prestenly he has directed four films that are very similar in style, the last of these "The Village".Graham Hess is a farmer who suddenly discovers huge crop circles in his corn fields. What do these mean? Signs from above? But from who and why? Graham is about to find out along with the rest of humanity.My summary above was "roller-coaster". And why? Because "Signs" is like a roller-coaster ride? Not really, what i meant was rather that this movie displays an astonishing spectrum of quality. From very good and solid scenes to some elements that are pure garbage. It's very "up and down" you might say. There are two things that i found very disturbing about this movie. First of all the ending (or rather the resolution), which i won't discuss in detail since it would mean spoilers. But one thing to think about is this: if you were an omnipotent being, how hard would it be for you to force your way through a wooden door?! The second thing is Mel Gibson. I don't know what it is about that man. Sometimes he can be great, and sometimes he degrades his acting talent to the level of Christopher Lambert! His attempts at emotional displays here are pathetic to say the least.With that said this movie has a few strong points that makes it worth watching nevertheless. First of all the almost patented atmosphere of suspense that Shyamalan always manages to create. The effective mood of something bad about to happen. Also the story works pretty well despite some flaws. What i also appreciate is the rather quirky sense of humor that Shyamalan displays in this movie. Some people have interpreted this as the director making fun of his own movie. But rather i see it as his way of not making the movie grave and serious to the point where everything becomes silly.So, i recommend this to fans of Shyamalan and fans of suspenseful thrillers. But i also raise a flag of warning about Mel Gibson. If you didn't like Mel Gibson to begin with, you will loathe him here. I rate it 5/10.</fullReview>

Hard Core Science Fiction fans have certain expectations and demands regarding their preferred genre. It would be a mistake to view this movie as science fiction when in fact it is a supernatural drama, similar to Shylaman's other work.Traditionalists will find technical difficulties in signs, action fans may not find the movie nearly menacing enough, and Hollywood movie fans may just not "get it".This film is a commentary on bad things happening to good people and how that affects personal beliefs and ideals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievably far-fetched "drama" - Gibson's worst!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Using the long exposed crop circles hoax as a back drop, this story offers signs of alien visitors simultaneously terrorising various parts of the world. Focusing on unusual (if not completely incredible) circumstances of one family, we learn of a chain of events culminating in the acceptance of "everything happens for a reason". Aside from the extremely slow movement (several scenes are needlessly drawn out, as though to "stretch" the plot) and the shoe string budget (Mel Gibson is the only major expenditure, as all 6 or 7 others appearing are unknowns), the "coincidences" presented are just a bit much to swallow. Each of at least 5 major story elements have odds of 10,000 to 1. Add them up, and every family member should have been struck by lightning AND won the State lottery! The "aliens" are less imaginative than anything ever shown on Star Trek. A skinny person in a green rubber suit, that's how far 21st century sci-fi has come? Embarrassing! The unsatisfactory conclusion leaves only one though: Was this film necessary? What a waste of everyone's time. Do yourselves a favor and find something better to do with an hour and a half of life. Mel Gibson has definitely picked the wrong script this time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>absolutely awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just want to say that "Signs" is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I hated Mel Gibsons performance in it. In fact, everyones' performances' sucked. The only reason I didn't barf while watching this movie, is because of Joaquin Pheonix, whose was some what good, with the little that they gave him. Every part of this movie, from the acting, to the directing/producing, to the bad story line, sucked!! This movie was predictable, and boring, the scary parts weren't even that scary, just really stupid. For the love of god, don't watch this movie!!!!! absolutely awful movie, wasted 2 hours of my life, that I'll never get back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So many different styles have been applied to making CRT reflections. The most intelligent form I've seen is in 'WarGames': Broderick is reflected on his computer, which is later reflected on its creator. Every other film uses it in the simple "reflected on face" technique.This is your only spoiler warning...Here the director tries the opposite method, reflecting our alien enemy on the TV. The juxtaposition couldn't be any more obvious. Our new Spielberg does the 'Poltergeist' thing.There are other frames, psychological and physical. The story is a frame passed down from the 'Living Dead' and 'Halloween' movies. Communication is framed by the TV screen (again with the 'Poltergeist'). Even the initial footage of the invaders is based on TV/video legend.If Shyamalan continued to make this point, we would've had something interesting. Unfortunately, he's trying the "Spielberg emotion" context. That's bad for our culture. Third times not a charm for him and I doubt the promise of 'The Village'.When we get some better understanding of Americana, then we'll have something interesting to watch. David Lynch caught on to that and he isn't concerned about amazement.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an offensively shallow and stupid movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****Minor Spoilers!****Yes, I WISH that I could pretend that everything that occurred in this movie was actually the daughter's dream, but circumstances lead me to believe otherwise.I have seen movies that demonstrate a director's religious/philosophical beliefs, but I really hope that Shyamalan thinks at a slightly more profound level than this film suggests.This film is shallow, naive, theologically inconsistent, and stupid beyond belief. The dialogue and action are completely ridiculous and unbelievable. There is no point in recapping what some other reviewers have said, so let's just say that I worry that there might actually be some people who believe this kind of junk and ACTUALLY VOTE IN ELECTIONS!!!There is no doubt in my mind about what this pretentious movie is saying, since it is completely unsubtle, but this film offers no arguments as to the validity or benefit of such beliefs.Fortunately, the director has couched his suggestions and statements in a genuine mess of a movie, with physical inconsistencies, gargantuan jumps in logic, and completely unbelievable characterizations. This means that you simply can't take them seriously. In spite of that, I found this movie far more offensive than some slasher movies. At least they make no pretense in their efforts to shock and titillate. They have no ulterior motives.I think that you should see this movie just as an exercise in learning about other people's muddled thought processes. In this respect, it evokes tremendous depression, so you will at least have SOME reaction to his work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>(THE SIXTH SENSE + UNBREAKABLE)/2 = SIGNS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SIGNS is yet another strong movie from M. Night Shyamalan that follows the formulas he has presented in THE SIXTH SENSE and UNBREAKABLE. This time a Pennsylvania farmhouse provides the setting and a widowed reverend (Mel Gibson), his two kids (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin), and his less conservative brother (Joaquin Phoenix) are the main characters. The ordinary people find themselves in extraordinary circumstances after some crop circles appear in their fields. Strange occurrences follow and numerous contradictory speculations within the family are inevitable. Soon the situation turns far more serious with an appearance of several UFOs around the world, including near the family's house. Are these really aliens and are they friendly or hostile?Like the other two Shyamalan films, SIGNS becomes a character study. We learn of the preacher's struggle with his faith and Phoenix's character becomes a tough guy gone scared. Both men reveal important elements from their past as the movie progresses and they become fully developed characters rather than horror film victims running around screaming. The two kids embrace the arrival of the aliens in a hopeful and innocently childlike way. The acting by all is very good and the kids are an improvement over the boy from UNBREAKABLE. The story unfolds patiently and builds up in suspense. Shyamalan again shows great control over pacing. He combines Spielberg's early sci-fi storytelling techniques with Hitchcock-like direction, understanding that less is more. SIGNS utilizes the sound of the wind, the movement in the fields, the distant dog barks, the creepy shadows, the eerie music, and the characters' scared reactions all at once effortlessly. The cinematography, lighting, and use of color are all superb again like in the previous two Shyamalan films. As I was watching the movie I realized how much I was enjoying everything that was up on the screen. I could see the effort and the careful attention to detail. This is no INDEPENDENCE DAY or GODZILLA as there is no numbing explosions and corny dialogue. With SIGNS you get a true build up of suspense and uncertainty before Shyamalan wraps it all up in his typically exciting fashion.I do have one problem with the film. It is a major problem and a minor one at the same time. The entire film is constructed in such a familiar fashion that some of the surprises and developments feel a little predictable. The following can all be found in THE SIXTH SENSE, UNBREAKABLE, and SIGNS: the immature (ghosts, super heroes, and now aliens) story directed in a very mature manner, similar uses of color and shadow, similar pacing and character development, similar relationships between adults and kids (the kids usually guide the less open minded adults toward the correct state of mind), the sub-par appearance of the director, the really toned down acting (no real objection here, but one scream once in a may actually be a little more realistic), the Pennsylvania settings, and the big revelations in the climax (small one in SIGNS). I know that some of those are trivial. More can probably be found, but that is not important. What I am trying to say is that I am disappointed that Shyamalan has not grown much as a director since THE SIXTH SENSE. All the things I have listed above are positives (except for Shyamalan's cameos), but I'm not being surprised by anything new. The stories are all different, but the framework is just the same. I still did not see some of the ideas or twists coming during SIGNS, but I was expecting them to show up. I wasn't too shocked to see them appear like clockwork. Everything felt so calculated. I liked UNBREAKABLE the most and now I find SIGNS to be the weakest of the three. If SIGNS came out before the other two movies and UNBREAKABLE were released third, possibly I would have found UNBREAKABLE to be the weakest. And maybe SIGNS would have taken the country by storm the way THE SIXTH SENSE did if it were released earlier. I don't know. As long as Shyamalan will follow these structures, he will not grow as a director. On the other hand, if he continues to follow these formulas in all of his films then probably every single one of them will be good. I'm already waiting with curiosity for his next one. For now, SIGNS gets an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie's premise more than it's director is what lured me to the theater since I had only seen his last film "Unbreakable", which was not that good. I was totally blown away by this movie, so much so I would have to categorize it as one of the best films this summer. The creation of an atmosphere of creepiness and suspense kept me on the edge of my seat throughout and had me reacting to what was happening on-screen. Scaring the pants off you in a thriller/scifi such as this, without hardly showing the aliens, helped build the climax to one of true suspense rather than shooting for overkill, the route chosen by many a director. Mel Gibson is also in top form as the tortured ex-minister seeking answers and questioning his faith. Definitely a five star film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>M. Night Shamalyan needs a sympathetic and antagonistic editor. He constructs luminous and beautiful shots, creates wonderful multi-dimensional characters, but Signs for all its atmosphere lacks harried impulse, the rhythmic character of genuine suspense. To make a careful distinction, terror pins you in place with fear. Suspense reduces all reason to instinct. Terror has little place in film except in small snips, for as defined here terror means zero motion ? simply a close-up and a scream and then?CUT!!! To define suspense think of a fly writhing in a spider's web. Movement jerks, writhes, relies on survival instinct.SPOILERS... The cutting in `Halloween' lacked Godfatherly elegance and cadence, but it sure felt natural for the rhythm of a film about people being chased by an immortal knife wielding maniac wearing a spray-painted Captain Kirk mask. In Signs, aliens may be jumping on top of rooftops, banging through cellar doors, desperate to kill each and every last one of us, but not a one's gonna get through until all so-called subtleties come to full circle fruition and every character utters every word Shamalyan wants them toAs everyone who hasn't dug themselves into an Afghani cave by now knows, `Signs' deals with the possibility that a recent resurgence in crop circle appearances might mean a possible extraterrestrial invasion. Shamalyan refrains admirably from ID4 jingoism ? for the most part anyway until the bullocks ending. The idea he employs, in fact, of wanting to go the complete opposite way and focus intimately on the reactions of one family in a closed setting intrigues. It intrigues still because curiosity remains far from satisfied. No father ? or mother ? in the entire planet will ever be holding their kids close and telling them about what they saw and felt when they were first born while scads of goombahs/aliens are trying to break in and kill everyone. My thoughts, at age 8 or 9 would be `uhh, dad, can we share this AFTER you've fought your best against the aliens?'The film takes place in a small town in Pennsylvania where Mel Gibson, due to a series of unfortunate events, has resigned his calling as a trusted and beloved and believed Methodist minister. As any small-town minister suffering from lapsed faith might tell you, people touched by your service still believe. They still ask you questions, still ask you to absolve them knowing you've lapsed, despite your protests. This powerful idea gets merely a joking treatment in one single scene. Okay, so there are really two scenes dealing with the nature of faith and belief. Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix do ask one another about the nature of miracles, faith, and cold science in one scene filmed with Bergman-like solemnity (even Bergman, to his unrecognized credit, knew when to open up some whoopie , as in the last 20 minutes of The Virgin Spring). But the stilted clanky dialogue (this is not what people talk about when we're being invaded) ruins everything. Shamalyan's major problem: he has forgotten motion. He knows picture very well. Tak Fujimoto does his usual A+ photography/cinematography job. The scenes in the cornfields and in the basement near the coal chute rank among his best (this guy needs to direct his own film). Shamalyan is far too in love with the beauty of his words, all the hugs his characters give, to let dirtier, meaner, natural instincts take over. Signs's closest, far stronger kin, `The Others,' always dropped the theme and fancy words when threat came to threat ? Kidman did wield a shotgun. Shamalyan established with the Sixth Sense that he knew when to linger on the moody image. Three films in he has yet to show he has learned the second rule of suspense: when to cut and run.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am baffled at the high rating of this film. Yes, I agree, M. Night Shyamalan is an extraordinarily talented director, the cinemetography and performances in this film were excellent. MNS creates some genuinely creepy sequences. But, please!!! The surprise ending to which this film builds is so hoaky, contrived, and inane that I felt my intelligence had been insulted. I have never seen so much talent (not only that of MNS, but also of Gibson, Phoenix, and the kids) thrown at such a lousy script. I admire MNS's efforts to create ambience and I appreciate a *good* surprise ending as much as anyone, but this was simply too forced and sophomoric to be swallowed. Any "surprise" ending which hinges on so many contingencies &amp; coincidences and requires SO MANY expository asides and monologues to be established really should be scrapped. People seem to really enjoy this turkey, and in all fairness it is artfully done and worth a view, but I would definitely rate it a rental or wait to catch it on cable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I heard two stories...some said they loved it, others absolutely hated it...so I was confused but figured since I liked "The Sixth Sense", M. Night Shyamalan would please me yet again with cinematic excellence...and let me just say this...HE DID IT AGAIN! I really loved this film; because as the director M. Night said in an interview...and i'm para-phrasing...it is truely one of the most original films this summer has to offer...I mean it had some big names to contend with, MIB 2, Austin Powers, however they cannot compete...they can't...some of you may think they were great, but they were not completely new ideas...they were building off of the first, or the sequel...this however..."Signs", was something that looked ok, seemed different, but turned out to be great.I love the way the story evolves, and how it has a meaning to it, you really gain an understanding for the characters in it and it's not just a horror film. It has the feel of a kind of anxieity, you want to see what's going to happen next, it keeps leading you...and when you finally understand what it's all about it has a depth that most horror/sci-fi films don't.So, It's good to finally get out of the muck of stupid, mindless, films that leave you feeling nothing...and hit the jackpot with a movie that has heart, humor, and horror! The cast was great, the setting, everything, just great...and it is the kind of movie that I go home thinking about. I'm going to see it again tonight, which I hardly ever do...but I think I might like it even more than the first time. :)So...if you haven't allready seen this movie, go out tonight...and see it...you'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a great film. I saw it on Aug. 6, and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was entertaining, it was scary, it was funny, and excellent the whole way through. It was a good story with some good performances from Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix. I must say (concidering I love Joaquin Phoenix), that I liked Merill's character the best. He was extremely funny and plays a very real and well defined character, and you just love him in this movie. A good example of him being funny is watching the news going "Move children!" (If you see the film you'll get it).The comedic lines and the suspense of the film are balanced so well, the movie just flows. I got scared in this film (at some parts the whole audience jumped), I laughed, and I cried. The whole emotional thing going on in the family really added a lot to the story. It showed how it really would be, and how the fear was getting to them. The kid actors were awesome. I loved both Morgan and Bo, and their closeness to both their father and their uncle really added to the reality of the movie. I agree that the few that didn't like the movie missed the whole point. It was a family movie. It was about a family. (I bawled during the dinner scene). Being a Christian, I also enjoyed the spiritual part of the movie, showing that everything happens for a reason. It show's God's hand in everything.This is the scariest movie I ever saw in theatres. I saw it yesterday and was scared last night and this morning. I recommend you see it. You'll be glad you did!!Jan B. 10/10P.S. I don't believe in aliens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a film that has re-invented suspence. A Triumph!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an independent film maker M. Night Shyamalan has raised the bar for excellence with Signs. He did it with a script that can only be described as a flawless piece of written art, his direction can only be put into words with 'genius', and the performances from the actors is nothing short than frightfully close to real. The profound use of symbolisms is a God-sent to those of us who ACTUALLY enjoy thinking, for those of us who go to the theatre to view a film, not just see a movie. In fact I say that the only way anyone can even begin to call this film anything short of amazing is by using the excuse that it's symbolisms and excellence flew directly over their heads. This film was never a sci-fi knock off of Alien or any other sci-fi movie, it is completely unique, and by all rights should be given it's own genre - my girl friend said it best by pointing out that Shyamalan put every single emotion into this film. It can grip you in a hundred ways and take you from emotion to emotion in a matter of a scene change.There is no comparing Shyamalan to Hitchcock or anyone else for that matter. While I'm sure Night looks at Hitchcock as master of suspense in no way is this a rip off of one of his films like other users had said. M. Night Shyamalan is the Renaissance Man of the film world, he flies well beyond ordinary standards of 'good'. With The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and now with Signs he has made three marks in history and will most likely never be over passed.And furthermore none of us have any right to judge his thoughts or visions, for they are his and when all of you users out there who write things like "for shame" and use words that are demeaning, I don't think any of you have a right to unless you have even come close to doing what he has.-My congradulations to M. Night Shyamalan for doing what most could not. -Colin</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie about finding one's way back to faith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not that into science fiction - or fantasy for that matter - because I always want to LEARN something as well, when I watch a movie or read a novel. Something about the real world. It feels like a waste of time to learn about creatures that do not exist, worlds that do not exist etc.. But occasionally I make an exception, if a movie has received good reviews or if there are actors that I like in it. As is the case with "Signs".I think the most important issue was the former clergyman's return to faith. This could have been brought about by any external forces or events - the aliens were not really the important thing here. I think Mel Gibson portrayed this process very believably.If I look upon the movie as as science fiction-movie, I think it was also quite good in this respect. I liked the way they found an explanation for the strange concentric circles, that have appeared all over the world IN REALITY. The explanation was not too far-fetched, either - it fit in with the rest of the events. I do not think this movie is for real hard-core sf-enthusiasts though, because they usually want more scientific, astronomical, and technical details and facts. In this movie the human aspect was more important than science.One thought though: it is, if you think about it, quite odd to have God and aliens in the same movie. Because if both exist, God most have created the aliens as well. In his image..??? And if this is so, why is this not mentioned anywhere in the Bibel..?</fullReview>

There are several plot holes and several stupid plot points that make this an awful movie.One major problem that this film has is the plot point that says the Aliens have mastered space travel, but can't get through a door. What sense does that make? None.The design of the Aliens is also unoriginal and bad looking. I was expecting something better. I was genuinely shocked when, while listening to reviews of the movie on YouTube, that people actually jumped out of their seats in the theater when the alien was revealed.As a closing statement, I am shocked that Signs got 3 stars. Why? Because of how ridiculous and clich the plot and acting is. All in all, Signs is a horrible movie and should not be watched.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a movie I wanted to like, with its cast and great idea, and also that I loved The Sixth Sense and liked Unbreakable very much. Shyamalan has definitely done worse than this though with The Happening, Lady in the Water and The Last Airbender(I'm watching The Village as we speak and presently it is difficult to judge whether I dislike it or not), but this was a disappointment. Signs does have some good values, such as a genuinely tense first fifty minutes or so, very good cinematography and score and credible turns from Joaquin Pheonix, Abigail Breslin and Rory Culkin.However, what promise Signs did have is almost completely squandered around the halfway mark. Shyamalan's direction is uneven here, first it's alert and tense and then it became lazy and lethargic. The script has an uneasy mix of cheesy and maudlin, the characters generally are underdeveloped and the story either suffers in the second half from also being underdeveloped or even worse not making much sense.Although Mel Gibson has done worse performances than this I found his performance rather laboured here, doesn't help that his character doesn't engage or that some of the worst dialogue is with him.What disappointed me most about Signs was that after such a good start, it is spoilt by scenes that come across as too mawkish and over-sentimental than genuinely poignant, creaky flashbacks that severely undermine the suspense and the truly ludicrously melodramatic ending. Not to mention some glaring and even in some cases unforgivable plot holes, particularly the aliens being killed by water.All in all, disappointing. I liked the performances, visuals and especially the tense, spooky atmosphere created at the start, but it just got lazy. 4/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

This was one of the scariest movie moments in my opinion. Personally, i thought that it was better than even The Sixth Sense. I would recommend this to any sci-fi or horror fans, or to any fans of M. Night Shymalan. It is generally appropriate for those age ten and up. Anyone younger than ten will likely be terrified by this film.

		<shortDescription>Its different to all other alien movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i heard of this new movie from Shyamalan about something with crop circles i was really excited to watch it.And i didn't got disappointed. I really liked the film. It's more about the family Hess as of the "Invasion" from the aliens. Nice way to distract the audience from the main topic. Nearly everything was a little clue to something everything can refer to:Bo with her water-tick Merril with his Baseball stick Morgan with his Asthma Attacks and Graham with his lost faith into God...at the end everything will be fine. I expected a little different ending, but still a good ending.All in one: Its really good and defines modern Alien Thrillers.Absolutely worthy to watch on DVD/BD now...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most UNDERRATED movie of all times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has got to be it. Every time I ask someone if they've seen it, they tell me how much they hate it, and how much "it sucks", and I seem to be the only one who likes it. It's such a beautifully written, directed and produced movie that it's even hard to find words to describe it. OK, yes, it's a movie about aliens, but I think most people fail to see what's really behind it... it's so much more deeper than that. I think people who dislike this movie are too nihilistic and narrow-minded to see what's really behind it. They go in thinking "Ok, another alien movie", without paying attention to the story behind it, or, on the contrary, they go in having great expectations and minding every single little detail and going crazy about plot holes, and stupid details that prevents that from seeing what this movie is REALLY about.Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is an ex-reverend with two kids, who lost his wife Colleen in a car accident provoked by Ray Reddy (small appearance by M. Night Shyamalan himself). Graham is devastated and seems unable to get over the accident, blaming God for letting it happen and hence losing his faith in Him and religion, which notably affects his relationship with kids and brother Merril (Joaquin Phoenix). The whole movie deals about Graham's conflict dealing with this sudden and drastic change in his life, and the alien situation is just brought in to test Graham's faith again.The movie has an amazing cast, amazing performances by all of the people that's in it and it keeps you hooked for as long as it lasts. There's absolutely no reason why you shouldn't like it unless you watch it thinking it's just another alien movie, in which case, such prejudices will surely make you miss the deeper insight and meaning of the story. This movie is more than a movie about aliens. It's really a wonderful story about how a man who has lost his faith in life, in love and everything else gains it back, and anyone who doesn't like it, it's because they failed to understand the concept behind it. I believe this movie is a masterpiece I strongly recommend, and I suggest to all of those who have seen it and didn't like it that they watch it again, but this time paying attention to the details and not being shallow enough that they are blinded by the "crappy alien concept" without grasping the lesson behind it, so they understand the real meaning of one of the most beautiful, well-written but sadly underrated movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alien invasion yarn told from a personal perspective, with a subtext about keeping one's faith (for those who want it).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There can't be many films which divide the audience more than "Signs". Even a cursory glance at the user comments here on the IMDb shows some people rating it highly and singing its praises, while others give it the dreaded 1-out-of-10 verdict. Similarly, many professional critics have been split over this film with Jonathan Ross stating that it left him "terrifically let down", while Cosmo Landesman hailed it "a wonderful sustained slice of American Gothic". I have a theory about why there are such polar opinions of the film. I believe that many people read the plot summary on the back of the video case, notice that the film features big stars like Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix, and start expecting something along the lines of "Independence Day" or "The War Of The Worlds". But "Signs" is not that kind of film - it is not concerned with laser gun battles and aliens having their guts splattered all over the place, nor is it concerned with the spectacle of entire cities being decimated by gigantic alien spaceships. For that reason, many people who were hoping for explosions and destruction on a grand scale come away feeling cheated.Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is a former priest living on a very remote farm in Pennsylvania. He lost his faith following the tragic death of his wife in a car accident. Also living on the farm are Graham's children Bo (Abigail Breslin) and Morgan (Rory Culkin), and Graham's younger brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix). Merrill was once a minor league baseball player, famous for hitting the longest ever shot but, paradoxically, famous for suffering the most strike-outs in the history of the sport. One morning, the Hess family discover a huge crop circle in their field. Their initial bewilderment gradually gives way to paranoia and fear as they learn from the TV news that such crop circles have been appearing all over the world. Before long, UFOs are sighted above cities and scaly alien creatures are filmed sneaking around on Earth. The Hess family fear that an invasion is imminent, with the crop circles like the one in the field adjacent to their house used as landing points. They board up their farmhouse and take refuge inside, hoping to survive the night against whatever it is that is trying to get in.All the way through the film, Shyamalan refuses to get carried away with the bigger picture of the alien invasion. We only see and hear of the destruction caused by the invaders via the Hess's TV and radio set. Instead, the story is approached directly from the perspective of the Hess family, making it much more intimate and personal than the usual alien invasion entries. Shyamalan uses seemingly insignificant little details and overlapping flashbacks to build up his story, and makes his main themes those of the power of fate and the need for faith. In fact, the whole alien-invasion aspect of the plot is relegated in terms of significance and used merely as a backcloth for the story of Graham's regaining of faith. We are being told here that EVERYTHING happens for a reason and that even the most innocuous of events or conversations has a bearing on the future. This preachy approach - almost religious, in a discreet kind of way - is likely to irritate some viewers, though the more spiritual among us might find it absorbing and affirming. "Signs" is very slow-paced and intricate, certainly not the kind of film that encourages repeat viewings, but in the end I think it delivers. I certainly didn't come away feeling "terrifically let down", as Mr Ross complained. I've seen many better films, but I've seen a heck of a lot worse too. "Signs" is good, suspenseful stuff, with thought-provoking themes for those who can be bothered to pursue them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't expect a lot from this film, but I kind of liked 'Sixth sense' and 'Unbreakable', so I thought it might be worth the time. Big mistake. Minute by minute this movie just sank deeper and by the end I was just aghast and insulted.Shyamalan is not a bad director, he is just an awful screenwriter and also completely blind. Any director worth his merit would have thrown this horrendous script away with disgust. The screenplay is utter crap no matter from which angle you try to look at it. It's like polishing a dog-rocket in the hope people would by chance mistake it for a diamond; the smell will reveal the truth...I won't reiterate the gaping holes in the logic of this film so often mentioned on this forum. Cinematography is quite good, acting and dialog laughable. Glad I didn't pay any money to endure these 106 minutes !</fullReview>

As for the aliens to come, all they know is that a baby phone registers the presence of aliens. These aliens are supposed to be violent by nature, so figure: we're gonna barricade the windows and doors and hope nothing bad'll happen ... :| Well, why the hell didn't the aliens just kill them ?

		<shortDescription>Primitive acting, complete failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Signs" is a helpless attempt to make a movie, that could have had an atmosphere of excitement and mystery over it. Instead Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix look like they are half asleep all through this movie. Extremely disappointing to see this movie signed (heh) by the director of "The Sixth Sense". I am surprised to see so many votes, it is a bore. The so-called alien seems to be involuntarily funny, and the facial expression on the actors seem to be "I am surprised, I am surprised, Now I am an itsy-bitsy more surprised". The plot line is laughable, especially when you consider, that the aliens worst enemy is water and they then decide to go to our planet Earth which is not exactly the driest of spots. Re-visit your cd-collection or do the dishes instead of letting this movie take your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a sci-fi fan, I looked forward to this film, although being slightly uneasy about the director's previous project 'Unbreakable'.Signs is overall a thinking film, but to get through it, you will need lots of caffine. The dialogue is so slowly whispered throughout and the scenes played even slower. If I had a penny for saying 'get on with it' throughout the film, I'd have ?1.68.Mel Gibson hardly moves and basically keeps the same dour expression throughout. The kids are robotically weird and the minor characters lifeless.Not once did I see these characters as believeable.As with Unbreakable, the director, M Night Shyamalan, has given a thoroughly boring movie experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Crop circles appear in a farmers field, but are they the work of aliens or practical jokers?The very mention of crop circles as a plot device sends shivers down my spine. Everyone knows they are made by sad people with planks of wood working in the middle of the night. That is apart from the simple circles that are caused by freak mini whirlwinds. Here we are expected to throw away such knowledge and start down the route of "maybe, just maybe."Mel Gibson plays an ex-priest turned farmer who has lost his faith after the tragic death of his wife (oh flashing lights and heavenly choruses - will this come in to play later in the film!?). He lives on his semi-isolated farm with his two children and his brother and seems to have an ideal rural life before he becomes bothered by night time invaders who don't seem to be able to be caught.At several points this film fails to make any sense. This is America and better still an American farm and yet no guns are available. Equally this is a story where the real story is elsewhere, broadcast on TV and only partly explained. While not wanting to take on any film that goes down any route in telling a story - if you want to tell a story about "overcoming" then there are many routes. Why this one?What can you say without being a spoiler? Very little. If you have seen Close Encounters, War of the Worlds and The Birds then you will get the general idea of what the film is about. Although all the above films are good, I don't rate any of them as being classic because they are such simple plot devices that only work by expensive special effects.Here we have cheap special effects of the "rattling doorknob" variety that almost bring to mind a cheap Hammer horror film. There is, sadly, nothing new to offer just a lot of something-is-about-to-happen that, bizarrely, even the actors don't seem to be taking seriously!(Although how people act under real stress might well seem silly - so maybe I have to qualify that.)There is nothing really wrong with the film in terms of acting or production, but we have been here before. The director (Shyamalan) needs a bit of help - he is taking on too much himself. Taking an acting role in this film is by far the biggest mistake. He created a modern classic in the Sixth Sense, but - on the evidence here - he is running out of ideas fast and merely forming greatest hits tapes from other people's movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good grief what a groaner! Aliens smart enough to travel across space all the way to earth need to communicate using crop circles. Uhh, yeah right.A few suspenseful moments cannot begin to make up for the incredibly inane resolution. Aliens who die when they get wet don't bother to wear a raincoat and galoshes to say nothing of a space suit. And you would think that since they communicate with crop circles they might have run into some irrigation lines and realized their plight. Alas no.And the subplot involving the restoration of Gibson's faith is so incredibly ham handed and ludicrous that it drains all the spirit out of the movie - no pun intended. I mean if god really wanted little Morgan to live why would he let the alien get a hold of him in the first place? So Mel would come back into the fold of course - give me a break!I cannot fathom why so many people thought this movie was good. 5 out of 10 only for the birthday party video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't understand why people like this movie so much. I can only imagine the masses have bought into the hype and are not thinking clearly. A lot of people who didn't like this movie express themselves in, shall we say, a rather classless manner ("it's sucks ----"). The people who do like the movie do so because the "found something deeper" and therefore feel a little superior to those who missed the point. I can only guess that the rest of the people who claim to like this movie are only doing so to appear like they are smart and didn't miss the deeper meaning. Well, I just want to say "There is no real deeper meaning. This is just a bad movie. Period." The emperor has no clothes.*spoilers*I think that everyone agrees that the alien plot is stupid, but the people who like this movie seem to forgive that aspect of it in favor of the "deep" spiritual message. Well, lame aliens and plot holes aside, the spiritual message didn't work for me either. The movie's big point, either you believe in God's plan, or you don't, is a cop out. It looks like something at first, but it's really not. In truth, God's biggest gift to mankind is supposed to be Free Will. However, this is contradictory to the notion that God has a plan for us. You cannot have free will if God has a plan for you.And what kind of plan is it for someone to have to die a horrible death, so she can deliver a cryptic message to save the world that only works because of bad plot holes? Please.The last thing that bugs be about this movie is that people claim that it is scary. Huh? How? When? Even if you buy into the spirituality, then how can you consider the aliens scary? You'd need to accept the stupid plot to be scared of the aliens. I mean, how can you be scared of an alien that can't get out of a pantry? If people are as smart as they say they are, then they shouldn't be scared by this movie.Finally, some of the reviews here say that there is yet another deeper level to this movie, that the whole thing is Mel Gibson's dream. Well, that is interesting, and may even be true, but it doesn't make this a better movie. It explains away the plot holes somewhat, but then it loses whatever spiritual message that it had. God didn't have a master plan for everyone and his wife's death was a senseless as ever. Why would that dream restore his faith?So, on the whole, not a good movie. It had good music, okay acting and a good production quality, but for what? 2/10 rating. Basically, disappointing.</fullReview>

I don't want to sound like one of those people who pick apart everything in a film but there is just SO MUCH WRONG with this movie. How could it possably be that these alians have the technology to come to Earth with the purpose of taking over but did not bring along the technology requred to break in to a farm house, or break out of a pantry? Where are there weapons? We have the technology to put a 2000 pound smart bomb on a target the size of a window from 30,000 feet using electronic guidence but these invaders must rely on crop circles to guide them in? Even if the aliens were just a backdrop to the rest of the story, it was done so poorly one must ask, who cares about the rest?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SIGNS was about a ball of other things than crop circles or aliens which were really a vehicle for the movie's message about family and coping with your situation. All the characters were genuine with imaginable dialogue. The best thing about it is the things it didn't have. There is no stupid secondary love story added, no portrayal of bratty mouthy disrepectful children, no blood or gore, no techno overload, and no helpless women. Location, sets, script, filming and casting were superb. From the interesting method of credits at the beginning, the special effects were exactly right and in the right quantity to help pull you in without typical overload of most movies. The use of sound and the unseen were most effective. There were plenty of places this movie could have gone, but the package presented was perfect. Of particular note, the movie theater crowd itself seemed very diverse and older with very little audience chatter. Later, I thought this had similarities to Alfred Hitchcock's "The Birds".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signs is the most entertaining movie ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie will simply leave you breathless. As an avid fan of movies, and someone who watches reviews and award ceremonies very closely, I can honestly say this is the most entertaining movie ever made. The camera work forces you to follow every detail on the edge of your seat. The movie keeps you on edge from the first scene to the last. As a reviewer from the show Access Hollywood put it, if Alfred Hitchcock made a movie relating to extra terrestrials, this would be it. It is so intense that the viewer is eyes wide open during every scene. Mel Gibson gives a extremely compelling performance as a former reverend, and Joaquin Phoenix shows his versatility by playing a former baseball player who moves in with his older brother, Gibson, after a tragic accident. Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin are simply amazing. Their performances are heartfelt and cheery at the same time. Cherry Jones provides comfort as a realistic local law enforcement officer. One can only see Signs to understand its deep nature. But this movie is not about aliens, it is about a man finding himself. Everyone thought it was impossible that M. Night Shyamalan could top himself, but he has done it with Signs, a movie which is even more entertaining, compelling and deep than the Sixth Sense. Go see the Signs, and have the rug pulled out from under you during the ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>********** SPOILERS ***********I read a couple of bad reviews of this movie and decided to see it without any expectations. I was amazed at how much I ended up enjoying it. I was impressed by The Sixth Sense but didn't really enjoy it that much.I saw this movie on opening night, along with the rest of a sold-out audience. It elicited laughs and screams and sighs. The air was really thick with tension in the suspenseful moments and not a sound could be heard. I was sitting at the edge of my seat.The Acting: Absolutely top notch. Mel Gibson moved me to tears in the scenes outside the vet's house, and at the dinner table. I hated Joaquin Phoenix in The Gladiator, but loved him in this movie. Both the kids are terrific. Abigail Breslin steals every scene she is in (she is so cute, and when she was crying I wanted to go and hold her and console her), but Rory Culkin's performance gives an extremely sensitive, nuanced performance {the anti McCaulay Culkin performance}.Sound and sound editing: Perfect. The Brazilian birthday scene is made more frightening by the perfect use of sound.Visual effects: Minimal and Perfectly used. This movie is not visual eye candy like Attack of the Clones. This allows you to be absorbed in the *story*.Direction and Cinematography were excellent, especially in heightening the suspense. The scary scenes work so well because of the brilliant camera angles.The Ending: Some of the audience members were clapping with delight in the final scenes, while others were disappointed. Personally, the ending worked for me in the context of the movie, especially in the way it tied up all the ends together (yes, the water does not make much sense scientifically but I will not let that get in the way of enjoying this movie).It has also been a long while since a movie has absorbed me so much. Because this is a quiet, minimalist movie, I emerged from the theatre without a headache (as in Pearl Harbor) and without my eyes watering.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "Signs" on Saturday and I was absolutely amazed! It was BETTER than"Unbreakable", and I thought that was going to be hard to beat. Previouscomments have said that it's not laden with special effects and that would be correct, but that is what makes the movie so suspenseful and slightly disturbing. This is a thinking person's movie, and shouldn't be seen by people who want to be fed every important detail. M. Night Shamaylan is absolutely brilliant, and following in his previous movies, he casts himself, only this time, he has a MUCH bigger role than he had in either of his two previous movies. His acting is impressive as is his directing. The rest of the cast is brilliant, except for maybe Rory Culkin, who I thought played a pretty two-dimensional character, who at times was two melodramatic andruined some scenes. Abigail Breslin is so cute and the turmoil that she feels doesn't feel fake. Joaquin Phoenix is wonderful and brought a great sense of youth to the movie, a factor that "The Sixth Sense" and "Unbreakable" werelacking. And Mel Gibson as a former pastor is incredible. Perhaps the best part about this film is that the director keep building andbuilding the suspense, so you expect a big-fallout-finale, and instead heexposes something quiet and subdued, and yet it moved me much more thanany bunch of special effects could, because it isn't until the end that youunderstand the whole movie.Go see "Signs" if you're a fan of M. Night Shamaylan and/or if you willing to expand you're mind and see the greater meaning behind the film. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>quite possible the worst movie I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was so bad I cant even comment on it. The fact that this movie is getting positive reviews shows just how bad movies have become in the past 3 or 4 years. The only redeeming feature this movie had, was that I was curious to see just how moronic the ending would be. And it certainly did not let me down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Criticisms Unwarranted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I personally disagree with many of the posts made by previous reviewers about how the plot holes ruined the movie entirely for them. First of all, this movie is fully enjoyable on a scale outside of the plot. One has to realize that the movie is not focused on the invading aliens, but the life of a father/pastor turned upside down after the death of his wife. This is an experience from his point of view, and his revelations and understanding of himself after another traumatic event equal to that of the death of his life. If you have not realized this already, the scenes do not focus on the aliens themselves, but the family, and Graham. Secondly, the critics of this film call it stupid because the aliens get killed by water, and that they are dumb because they invade the only planet with surface water in the entire solar system. There are several problems with this: as humans, you can't judge the intelligence of other species. If you really want to get sci-fi and all speculative, maybe they never knew about water as an element before, and therefore was not aware of its affects on them and maybe even not aware of its existence in the first place. Their technological advances, some claim, are absurd, because they can't be picked up on radar but can be heard on a baby monitor. The same thing applies-we don't know anything about the aliens, so it's completely ignorant to assume them to be dumb using human standards. And, really, would the movie have satisfied your sci-fi fetishes if they were killed by large nuclear missiles? Would more explosions in the film have made your experience better? The film is an exploration of human nature, NOT a lavish, ultra-Hollywood-style shoot-em-up like independence day. If you go to the movies for the explosions, and inception-ist plot, then you will miss a lot of great movies out there like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It takes the word 'terrifying' to a whole new level.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*INCLUDES SPOILERS*It was a dark evening in 2002, I was 12 years old and wasn't expecting a great deal of horror, seeing as it was rated a very lousy 12 certificate by the BBFC.I inserted the VHS tape, found a comfortable position on the couch and started to watch. Never before in my life had I been so immensely terrified by a movie. I took a peek at my mother who was sat next to me during the scene in the basement; her face explained what I was feeling. M. Night's ability to create so much chilling, hair-raising tension is monumental. The music is something I had never heard before, it's such an incredible contribution to the theme and mood of the film and defiantly in my opinion, a soundtrack deserving of an academy award. The story sees a family of four in rural Pennsylvania facing their greatest fears. Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), a former reverend, is deeply saddened after the death of his wife in a road traffic accident. His brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) has moved in to help him get back on his feet and return to normal life. Graham's children Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin) have also been enduring deeply depressing times after the loss of their mother and have both lost faith in their father as it seems he has lost his. Many surreal events begin to occur, initially ignored by the family as they try to recover from their bereavement. As the events begin to snowball into a worldwide panic the family are forced to act, uniting and attempting to survive.The most terrifying part for me was the Brazilian home video scene. As the reporter informs the audience that "What you're about to see may disturb you" and the music begins, you can feel the suspense building. You're watching the video for around 40 seconds and nothing is happening, until the music builds to a climax and all is revealed. Phoenix's acting right here was fantastic, as he witnesses the video the immediate shock he shows is out of this world. This is the moment when he realises what to expect.The acting is superb, it really is. Gibson leads well and acts just as man would in his character's situation. He shows very low charisma, but still a doting side for his family. Joaquin Phoenix's performance was also a joy to watch especially during the Brazilian video scene, along with Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin who both contribute greatly.M. Night Shyamalan's screenplay writing for this film is very smart indeed; he is able to make a film feel so chilling, it's possible to feel your heart jumping from your chest. Even whilst watching the opening titles you can sense that you're in for a roller-coaster of a ride.The core subject of this movie is faith. How Graham had questioned his after his wife's death, how his children are losing theirs in their father, and how Merrill has lost his in himself.For me, this has everything; great acting, astounding suspense, recognisable characters and of course, aliens! Most defiantly the most frightening film a 12-year-old can watch.********** 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Promising suspense undermined by weak pay-off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you watch a lot of films...maybe if you fancy yourself as screenwriter material...you probably already know how fun and somewhat easy it is to come up with the idea for a "great film". Everyone/anyone can come up with the hook, but the key is being able to sustain interest right up to the end and deliver a satisfying pay-off. A good example of a successful pay-off is a film like "Shawshank Redemption" or, on the action side, "Raiders of the Lost Ark".Night manages the events in this story almost like a bomb squad diffusing an explosive device. He's careful and meticulous. There's no doubt a lot of hard work and careful consideration went into the design of this story -- up to a point.***EXTREME SPOILER ALERT*** It almost would have been better for the film if there were no aliens. And these particular aliens are amazingly stupid. Water kills them so they decide to try and conquer a planet that is 7/10 comprised of water. And they're here to harvest humans, a species that is also 70% water. The logic here escapes me. When you consider the fact that they have some kind of natural poison vapor secretion ability it looks like fire fighters have the least to fear from these naked green invaders. If you can't put 'em down with the fire hose, at least you can have your oxygen mask on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The water plot is from the Bible. Matthew 12:43 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none. In other word unclean spirits (demons) can't be near water. When Jesus makes the demons in the man in the tombs go into a herd of swine and they rush over a cliff into a lake and drown. The movie is saying we are in the end days. The "signs" also come from the Bible. 2 Thes 2:9 Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan withall power and signs and lying wonders, And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie. The delusion is that people will think they are aliens, they are not, they are demons in the movie.

		<shortDescription>A unique movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan is one of my favourite directors. That because he makes his movies in an unique style. Signs is his first film after the smash-hits The sixth sense and Unbreakable. Evey movie he makes is good, and this is not a exception. The movie is about a preacher named Graham Hess who has lost his wife. He live on a farm with his two kids and his brother Meryll (Joaquin Phoenix).One morning Graham finds a massive crop circle in his back yard. Graham thinks it's jokers fooling around, but when they begin to occur all around the world, he soon finds out that the planet are been invaded by aliens. Night focus more on the scares and suspense rather on the action. And thats not a bad thing. Everything in this movie is perfect. The soundtrack is beautifully composed by James Newton Howard (King Kong, The village). M. Night Shyamalan produced, directed, starred and wrote this peace of art. Signs is truly a work of art, and i recommend it for those who are a big Shyamalan fan or just love good movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect blend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night definitely knows how to scare us. In the film we see non traditional camera angles and a whole slew of eerie sounds. He manages to get the feeling of complete alien invasion without the overuse of special effects which sometimes ruin movies. On the surface this looks like a scary sci fi alien movie, but after watching it is much much more. I went in to the movie expecting nothing more than the average. A little bit scary with a typical plot. This was far from it. The story is a perfect blend of classic sci-fi elements, religious messages and appropriate comic relief. In the same movie I laughed, cried and froze with fear. The religious message was pretty powerful in the film, but I feel it wasn't too much to handle. The acting was far better than i expected. Gibson stepped away from a typical role and delivered a convincing performance. Joaquin Pheonix was cast in a role perfect for him and did a great job to keep the movie from getting too serious or too comical at any time. He is quickly becoming one of my favorites. The musical score my James Newton Howard was the icing on the cake in my opinion. The unique score presents itself in the opening credits and is found throughout the whole film, giving it a sense of unity. Without the music, the movie would not have the same potent effect.Even though I am not very religious myself, i felt very comfortable with the theme that was presented. We are not alone. We may not know who or what, but there is something else out there. There are no coincidences and even though things may seem bad with a little bit of faith and courage things will be alright. Believe in yourself, trust your family and keep your faith. As I said, it's a powerful message, but trust yourself you can handle it. THis movie come highly recommended by me and i feel almost anyone would enjoy it. Powerful, exciting, scary and completely captivating, there is no reason to not see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hopeful 'Signs' of a long career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan has once again created a sense of tension that is rarely equalled. Mel Gibson is a great actor and with support from Joaquin Pheonix in a film written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, i couldn't wait to see this film.I saw it during its week of release, and didn't expect the kind of frights and tension that we saw in the Sixth Sense, given its (12) Rating, but by the end of the movie, a group of young teenagers sat a few rows in front of me, were genuinely terrified and had spent much of the movie crying. It's not because the film was horrific, it's entirely due to the masterful creation of suspense and frights that Shyamalan has. He seems to be able to bring out the best in his cast, whatever their age, and he can retain the tension of a moment with ease.Believe me, to get the best from this film, turn out the lights, turn up the surround sound system and watch it alone, and if your can't feel the spine tingling terror, than i pity you, because your missing psychological effects of the this fine film.I hope Mr. Shyamalan has a long and successful career, and with films like Signs and Sixth Sense already under his belt, i'm sure he will.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes writers have only one good story to tell like the Wachowski Brothers who did Matrix and the God-awful double dose of sequences. That seems to be the case with M. Night Shyamalan. The Sixth Sense was a masterpiece. Everything came together. One could identify with the characters. Then came Unbreakable, a ridiculous comic book creation with cardboard characters at best. Then came Signs, which I think should have been titled Unwatchable. This wasn't a movie, it was a slide show, though I admire Shyamalan for being able to cram a 20 minute script into nearly two hours. Watch the touching moments when characters search for an intelligent line and fail. Wait for that heartfelt moment when Mel walks in on Joaquin and the kids to find them all wearing hats made of aluminum foil. Sit pinned to the edge of your seat for the stupidest ending ever filmed. And bring a book and a flashlight to pass the time during all the pregnant pauses. You'll need it to keep from falling asleep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really nice DVD, but only an average movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I enjoyed "Signs" but when it was over we both said, "That's a pretty average movie." We couldn't understand all the fuss and high user ratings. I liked "Unbreakable" much more, and even "The Sixth Sense." For me, the extras on the "Signs" DVD are much more interesting than the film itself, a fairly simple alien story that moves along very deliberately. But the extras give a superb glimpse into Night's film-making process, how he writes, how he directs, the building of the farm set in an experimental corn field, and how the CGI alien was done. However, there's a bit much "mutual admiration" comments at times by the actors and crew. And Night's comment, regarding design of various trailers to advertise "Signs", "We're going to show you one of the best movies ever seen", gives us an insight into the perhaps inflated view Night has of his own work.some SPOILERS follow - don't read further if you haven't seen "Signs" yet, unless you don't mind spoiling some of the surprise.A key theme running through "Signs" and uttered more than once is, "Is it possible that there are no coincidences?" It is said at the end, by Gibson's character, when the young boy is spared the alien's poisonous gas because his lungs are temporarily incapacitated from his asthma. We are shown a drawing in a book of aliens where the house looks exactly like the one in this movie. The film gets its title from crop signs, made by alien beings as directions for other aliens to follow them, but also has the meaning of Gibson's character, an Episcopal priest, to get a sign from God regarding his faith, lost when his wife was killed by a car. It turns out that the aliens here are not kind aliens, they want something which is never directly revealed.What did I not like about this movie? I find the dialog unbelievable much of the time. Also, Night wanted to inject humor into the script, which he did, but for me it did ring true in relation to what was happening on-screen. For example, near the end when the alien was in the attic, his brother got on a chair and was holding the attic door shut by extending his arms to the door, as the alien tried to push it open. He says, "This is only a temporary solution." Gibson asks, "How temporary" and the answer is "About 22 more seconds." I don't really believe this is the dialog two adult brothers would have during a life-threatening situation, unles you are simply making a broad comedy. "Signs" is not a broad comedy, it examines what could happen if crop signs really were made by dangerous aliens, and also how a fallen away priest might regain his love for God. I believe Night tried too hard in filming "Signs" to come up with some "grand moments." There is no doubt he is strongly influenced by great directors like Hitchcock, and artists like Norman Rockwell, because he mentions these in the DVD extras. However it seems that he tries too hard to "make" emotional things happen instead of letting them simply be a result of really good directing and acting of a really good script. I believe he failed for the most part in "Signs" when he tried to create these grand moments. And for me, the film failed to create the mood of terror at any time.Night takes much care to set up the premise of crop signs made by aliens, and the idea that they are dangerous, maybe even threatening the very existence of life as we know it on Earth. But he gets rid of that threat with one simple statement over the news, "In the middle east using an ancient method the aliens have been chased away. No other details are available." As I watched the film I thought, "What the heck is that? Sure seems like a giant cop-out in the story line." It was as if he didn't know how to handle this grand premise he had created, so he just invented some quick resolution.In summary, I like Night and his method of making films. I especially like "Unbreakable" with its good vs evil theme residing in the two main characters. I own the DVD and watch it periodically, I admire how well it was done. While I enjoyed "Signs" I don't think it rises above "average", and certainly not in the category of the better films I have seen over the past few years. Night is still a very young film maker and I look forward to what he may offer in the future. However, for him to continue his success I believe he needs to move away from his boyish fascination with himself, which I think dilutes his ideas, and re-focus on what he does best, create fascinating new themes for films. He is no Hitchcock, and I doubt he ever will be.</fullReview>

It's because it portrays its story and characters in a way that won't let me forget them. This particular film has all of the essential elements: humor, adventure, suspense and most of all, soul. The family element (as in all three of the above mentioned films) is so strong it made me want to hug my kids and get on my knees and talk to God.

		<fullReview>We watched this movie Saturday night. While the pace is much like watching grass, or corn, grow, you eventually get sucked into the whole, silly plot which is about aliens landing in a corn field in Kansas and, instead of taking over the state capitol, or a 7-11, they concentrate all their energy on taking over a farm house where 4 people live. I have some questions! Why is it that aliens, who have the technology that allows them to travel 100's of thousand's of light years, can't open a door? Maybe the aliens aren't from "out there." Maybe they are by products of genetically altered corn. Maybe water makes them swell up and pop. And, why is corn a symbol of evil, or creepiness? I realize that it is a recyclable food, but evil? I just don't get it. Also, what does Mel Gibson do for a living now that he is unfathered; what does his brother do besides smoke and watch television in a closet? Why don't the kids go to school? Why is no one bothered when the boy murders his dog with a serving fork? What happened to the meat on the barbecue? Where's PETA in all this? Why are there 1252 half empty water glasses all over the farm house. I realize the daughter has a problem with water (hmm, maybe she's part alien), but doesn't any one ever clean a glass? Don't they ever run out of water glasses? Do you have 1252 water glasses in your house? Why does the younger brother hit the water glasses with his baseball bat? Wouldn't it have been easier, and more accurate, just to throw water on the alien? How can you break a bat on a water glass? How come the alien can't get through the wood slats nailed to the windows, but can carve strange patterns in the same wood. It seems to me that he (it?) would just make one of those patterns bigger, and he's (it's) in. Why does Mel Gibson, who is the father who was a Father, lose his faith when his wife is killed, but get it back when an alien is watered to death in his house? Why didn't the aliens bring raincoats, and umbrellas? Why does the boy who has asthma and sucks on his inhaler every 30 seconds throughout the entire movie not have the inhaler when he is in the basement? Why is the boy dead and then not dead? Is it a miracle, or is it Hollywood? Why was this movie made? Did anyone actually read this script before the movie was made? Why did we watch it? Will all these questions be answered in the Director's Cut? Or, will it only get sillier?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Or so it seems.How Mr Night Shyamalan got away with insulting our intelligence in this way is beyond me. But he did, and he is handsomely rewarded with a rating of seven, four points more than this film deserves.Signs attempts to mix science fiction with religious motifs, and fails miserably. The first half hour of the film is bearable as you can still maintain the illusion that it will actually lead somewhere. After that it rapidly goes downhill and becomes unwatchable for anyone with even a remote understanding of either physics, biology, combat or navigation. I've watched many bad films, but this one made me feel so violated that I had to write my very first review.To be fair, this film isn't a total loss. It is worth watching if you are very religious, preferably the Gibson variety, and neither logic nor common sense interest you.For all others: stay clear of this film or you will feel cheated afterward.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shyamalan likes the kind of surprise that makes us reinterpret what we've just seen, but he does so in a different way here: he makes us re-evaluate what the film's fundamentally about.Spoilers follow, throughout my review:It's not about the crop circles, and it's not about aliens. It's about God. We think we'll be offered clues throughout, and we are; but they're not clues about what causes the crop circles (Shyamalan simply TELLS us what causes them, as soon as he can), nor are they clues about what the aliens are like, what their plan is, or anything like that (again, what Shyamalan thinks we need to know on this topic, which isn't much, he simply TELLS us, without bothering to drop hints first). They're clues which allow us to deduce (a) that there is a god, and (b) ITS plans and intentions. The twist at the end is that Graham's take on Christianity was right all along.Some people gagged at this point, as though theism was being forced down their throats. I don't think it was. Throughout his last three films Shyamalan has asked us to make-believe in ghosts, superheroes, and hostile aliens that prepare for their assault with crop circles; why can't gods simply be more of the same? The correct way to view "Signs" is as an apparent work of science fiction that turns out to be supernatural fantasy.You'll note, by the way, that the God in this film is not so nice as all that. He looks out for this family, but in sly ways: he prevents the boy from inhaling poison gas, but by giving him asthma; he secures a supply of ready water all over the house, but by giving the girl a neurosis. And he looks out for THIS family. Why do they in particular get let off? I think it's because the father is a priest - a special servant. If he'd been a Hindu, or an atheist, or even (I suspect) a mere rank-and-file Judeo-Christian, that would have simply been tough luck.Anyway, I think it's a splendid idea. (And you must admit the title is a clever one.) So why doesn't it work?I hate to say it, but while Shyamalan's earnest approach to ghosts and superheroes enabled him to make these things plausible, he manifestly fails... not with God, but with the aliens; indeed, with everything preceding the final scene. But the aliens and crop circles were just red herrings, right? Yes, but for a red herring to divert our attention properly it must be diverting. I think most of us sensed, with the crop circles and aliens and impending invasion, that Shyamalan's heart wasn't in it; the bulk of the film was simply dull, and the alien story all too obviously wasn't going anywhere.The science fiction bit has to work AS SCIENCE FICTION; the rug has to be firmly woven beneath our feet before it can be pulled out from under us. Unfortunately the rug is threadbare. Nobody could watch "Signs" without choking on the implausibility. The aliens dissolve when they come into contact with water. A single glass of the stuff can be deadly. This is silly enough, but then they come HERE, of all places. Forget the oceans, forget streams, forget little puddles in the ground (I'm sure at least one of their scouts must have stepped in one of these, or at the very least brushed against a plant covered with dew), forget the fact that they are visiting CROPS, which are irrigated; haven't they noticed that, on Earth, it RAINS? They must have been sitting in the sky (in the CLOUDY sky, as we see) plotting their invasion for the one three-day period in the entire history of humanity in which it didn't rain anywhere. And for what? To harvest animals that are primarily MADE of water.These aliens don't bring weapons, they do nothing to disrupt our electricity or communications; in fact, everything about them is laughable.And the humans aren't that much better. Maybe I'm over-estimating the English-speaking world's mass media, but surely a group of crop circles would not be treated as the kind of huge story that disrupts programs on all channels simultaneously, and even if it would be, how could the sight of bent stalks of corn possibly create mass panic? And even if this is what WOULD happen, it's not what I want to see. I want to see at least one of the main characters behaving intelligently. Is this too much to ask?Shyamalan is a first-rate director and the script must have looked good on paper. It must have seemed not to matter that so much of it was half-baked. It matters a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was another movie about a religious man who lost his faith because of something that happened to his family. The tragedy is slowly and excruciatingly revealed, even though it was easy to guess. Writers who dont know anything about sports should not try to include them in their movies. Homerun records are not measured in distance, there arent five homerun records to be set in a season. The way this was revealed was unbelievable by some guy in the army office that we never see again but seems to hate joaquin phoenix because he struck out a lot. They hit you over the head with the metaphor of striking out being related to his life as a loser, mentioning it a few more times in case you dont get it at first. Mel Gibson is an ex-religious man who they call father and dresses like a priest, yet he is married with kids, I guess the writer didn't research religion either. The aliens are such a small part of this brutal story that they aren't worth mentioning, except the way they are defeated is very easy. Although CNN couldn't figure it out even after they had been defeated all over the world. If this were written by anyone other than the writer of the Sixth Sense it would be dismissed as a hackneyed thrown together redone story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who does this Shymalyan guy know in hollywood that he can still get people to call him brilliant. This movie is so bad it goes past funny and just consistently sucks. The story is so stupid that they dont even try and they just get hokey and sappy and hope that moves you. My 7 year old niece could write a story about aliens that try too take over earth but are defeated by WATER, but she is already too smart to see that would make a terrible movie even if you got the actors too talk real slow and stare at stuff. There needs to be a rule made in the movies. If you are going to involve sports in your movie you need to have seen that sport played or have some concept of that sport. Shymalyan uses baseball as a metaphor for life, yet it is very clear he has never seen a baseball game or been told what happens in one. FYI M Knight homerun records are not based on distance. That is just 1 of a 1000 things that dont make sense in this mess of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seeing The Small Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the course of the film Joaquin Phoenix's character remarks that the situation they're in seems like The War Of The Worlds. It certainly is, but the small picture of it.Whereas H.G. Wells wrote on the grand scale about what nations and governments were doing to fight an alien invasion, M. Night Shyamalan's Signs concerns itself with the small picture, what is happening in one tiny corner of the world, to be precise Bucks County, Pennsylvania and very specifically Mel Gibson and his family.One day farmer Gibson who used to be a minister woke up and found that his cornfield had been systematically decimated and a precise geographical pattern was laid out that could be seen from the air. He concluded it was some kind of prank which would have been the normal reaction of anyone. But when reports of the world wide similar crop defilings and then sitings of shadowy alien figures than the world is in a crisis mode.But the world is on the back-burner for Gibson. He was a clergyman but gave it up after the death of his wife who was hit by a drunk driver. He's got his own issues to deal with if he can get himself, his children Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin and brother Joaquin Phoenix through the ordeal. All this without knowing how the world in general is coping. Gibson and the family can only speculate and that's where imaginations run wild.I have to say that Mel Gibson does a thoroughly good job as an everyman caught up in a global crisis. When War Of The Words was made by George Pal in the Fifties, the leads Gene Barry and Ann Robinson were scientists who had vital information for the survival of the world. The globe is still at risk in Signs, but Mel and his family can't worry about that, just in keeping themselves alive.Signs is thinking science fiction ranking up there with the best work of Ray Bradbury and John Heinlein. It's both entertaining and engrossing, you can't ask for more from a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the abysmal and overrated Sixth Sense and the even worse Unbreakable I wasn't expecting much of this movie, but it seems I was too quick to judge. Signs is a movie which I found actually scary. From the first moment in the crop fields right to the end when Gibson's character 'sees the sign' provided by his wife it had me glued to my seat. The actors were very good as well, and Night (saves me the typo's :)) shows he does know how to build a scene. In short: a very well done film. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One wishes Signs to have lived to the potential it shows in the first part, where we are engrossed in what's going on, scared at times and amused by this mysterious film.M. Night Shyamalan has been very successful in his previous features. This, unfortunately, falls flat just when a very strong ending is needed. Like many other fans, I felt manipulated and let down by this movie.It's very easy to see what's going on in the Mel Gibson's character. His loss of faith, his grief for a lost wife, his fears of confronting reality and moving on with his life. Those things are deeper than what we are let to know, because on the surface it is one thing, but deep down it has nothing to do with the obvious 'signs' of the title. The fact that he's a religious figure is even more confusing. Obviously, he must be a protestant minister, what with the family and all, but there are moments that are puzzling because of this ambiguity. Had this script been brought to the screen with a lesser known director, it probably would have had a more satisfactory resolution, because the ending, with Joaquin at the bat, is very hard to swallow.Let's hope Mr. Night Shyamalan finds his way for the next time out. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a lot of unanswered questions afterwords. M. Night Shyamalan is a great visual director...there are some beautiful shots here. But with plots...Farmer Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) finds gigantic, interconnected circles in his cornfield. His brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) and Graham's two children (Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin) think there's something supernatural going on. Graham disagrees...until things start getting real scary. Also Graham keeps having nightmares about his dead wife who died in a car accident and made him give up being a pastor...SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!The film is very creepy and eerie in the first half (the first full view of the aliens made me jump and the pantry sequence!) but drops the ball in the second half. For one thing, you think it's an alien invasion story but it turns into a story about faith. The aliens are just there as a plot device!Also giving us long shots of the aliens was not a good idea--it's very clear that they're guys in rubber suits. Still, it did scare me occasionally.MORE SPOILERS!!!! But, afterwords, I had a lot of questions. Why do the aliens (who can be killed by water) attack a planet that is 3/4 water? Why do they attack in the first place (there's something about harvesting people...what does that mean?)? One alien is locked inside a pantry and can't get out???? Also how exactly are they defeated at the end (we're not told)? These are nagging questions that I couldn't shake off.And the film is quiet...way too quiet at times. And the faith story is awkwardly handled.The acting doesn't help. Gibson is blank-faced the entire time and Culkin and Breslin are terrible. Phoenix tries but the slow pace and insistence on quiet drags him down. So, it's worth seeing...if you don't think about it afterwords.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big commercial package, engrossing and sometimes hugely entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A widowed ex-minister in Pennsylvania, living on a farm with his kids and his ex-ball player brother, believes the crop circles on his land (as well as the ones profiled on the news) may be indicative of something other-worldly. Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan, who understands commercial movie-making these days as well as any other filmmaker, tends to get bogged down in pretensions, but where his dialogue is sometimes gummy, his characters are complicated and relatable. Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix are wonderfully convincing as the brothers unexpectedly caught up in the supernatural, never letting their lived-in relationship hit a false note. Shyamalan is terrific at staging a big scary moment, and any of the sequences involving Gibson and his family are enjoyable, but the more intimate, two-character scenes stall the momentum (particularly one involving Shyamalan himself as a co-star). Still, with all its faults--and a too-literal final act--"Signs" knows how to get reactions from its audience, and it is clever and canny if not quite hair-raising. ***1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining But Flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs is watchable and entertaining, but has quite a few plot holes to the point of being cheesy. If the intent of the movie was to simply be a fun "popcorn movie" diversion, it succeeds on that level. It appears, though, the intent was to approach philosophical insights, or to convince the audience of the authenticity of crop circles as alien-authored. On such issues, it self-destructs.The main problem with the film seems to be this schizophrenic confusion about which direction it wants to go, thus dooming it to fail on the serious side of the ledger. There's plenty of involving action with "things that go bump in the night," but the story forgets to pursue the deep issues it brought up. The story careens madly back and forth between serious overtones and sublimely ridiculous nonsense.For example, there is a scene of an auto accident victim talking to someone: A dying person who has been chopped in half does not wax prophetic--they scream in pain, or lose consciousness. Due to the odd premise of a mutilated person standing there to give a message, this scene, which apparently seeks extreme pathos, simply ends up looking like cheap, contrived exploitation. The scene with the baby-monitor intercepting transmissions from beyond Earth? Must be a joke, right? But if this was supposed to be a joke, it was played too straight to be recognizable as one. In places, therefore, the movie takes itself way too seriously.More inanities: The stupidity of the aliens, who have mastered interplanetary travel, but are ignorant to a toxic aspect of our environment? Plot holes this preposterous should not be escaping the eyes of directors of big budget flicks. Also, why are they leaving messages in cornfields for everyone to see, if they're plotting a raid on the planet? Why don't they just radio each other as they coordinate their attack? Oops, forgot: We have baby-monitors to spy on them with; consequently, they are limited to hacking up cornfields in order to communicate. The baseball bat silliness was almost too foolish to endure.Still, the movie has its moments. I particularly love the scene with the aluminum foil hats. The plot, albeit silly, moves along. Plenty of stuff happens up there on the screen, and you can suspend disbelief enough to have a good time. The acting is actually quite good, especially Mel Gibson, who breaks from his "Mad Max" persona. Here he plays a despondent man struggling through an emotional crisis, and he plays this vulnerable character with sincerity. For some mindless fun, this film provides with gusto. Just don't expect this movie to be a convincing argument about the supernatural. It has far too many obvious goofs in its execution to accomplish that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dumbest Movies Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Signs' is one of the dumbest movies ever. Let's start with the title. Crop circles are signs that Flying Saucer pilots use to direct them where to go when they get to Earth. Now in order to get to Earth their pilots have to navigate from half a galaxy away. They would have to be pretty damn good at find there way around if they could find Earth. So now they need a big arrow carved out corn to find their way to Philadelphia? Or take the aliens on weakness water. Earth is called the water planet because it has so much water. I can imagine a presentation given to the committee that decides what planet to invade. OK here is the choice we can invade Dune that has no water or Earth that is mostly waters. Now remember before you decide our only weakness is water. Dune has no water Earth is mostly water. The committee for invasions says to a man er ah, alien Monster, Earth of course.I can just hear the presenter Earth you are going to chose Earth? Earth is mostly water. The head of the committee says to the presenter you are a moron that's why you aren't on the committee. Yes water will kill us but worms are icky. I hate worms. Nothing in the movie makes any sense. Even the premise that a man would find his way because to God because of an alien invasion is too stupid for words.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a huge disappointment! The trailers for this film make it appear as though it will be a psychological drama, an examination of the effect of a "possible" alien presence on the population in general and one family in particular.Instead, we get a schlocky X-Files ripoff with green monsters that go bump in the night and a typical cheesy Hollywood script with religious messages hitting you over the head like a giant flying saucer, plus the worst case of asthma management you could ever hope to see.The only thing keeping this from being a B-movie along the lines of "Plan 9 From Outer Space" was the presence of Mel Gibson. Mel, has your career really fallen *that* far?And speaking of falling careers, what happened to M. Night Shyamalan since "Sixth Sense"? I thought "Unbreakable" was bad, but "Signs" has dropped this once-promising young director's career another notch.I gave this movie a 1/10 in the voting section, but only because ZERO wasn't a choice!</fullReview>

Check out any number of 3D sites like www.3dtotal.com and see some REAL pros. Don't even get me started on the script. When I see this film as a rental I have to fight back the urge to throw it on the ground and stomp it to pieces. Personally I think Mr. Gibson has gone over the deep end with his film that contain very OBVIOUS religious overtones. I mean come on, does he think he has to repent for his Mad Max films?

		<fullReview>Mel Gibson plays a rural Pennsilvaniya farmer. A rural Pennsilvaniya farmer who doesn't do a single second of farming during the entire movie.It gets worse.Mel's mundane celibate existence is rudely interrupted when 7 foot furry green aliens, who fart at the wrists, decide to invade the planet...but more specifically, have set their nefarious EXTRA TERRESTRIAL sights on seeking "THAT" global strategic position that every nation on Earth is vying for...yup, that's right...RURAL "P-e-n-n-s-i-l-v-a-n-i-y-a". (sarcasm laden heavy sigh~~~~~~) However these are no ordinary aliens. No sir! They've managed to travel billions of light-years through space, only to be stymied by the uber-complex technology of boards and nails that Mel has erected around his home.Yes, a race of beings for whom water is as caustic as INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH ACID select as the target of their invasion a planet whose surface is no less than 70% covered by water, inhabited by beings whose bodies contain more than 90% water.(Just how did they traverse through Mel's dew laden cornfields at night without being burned to a f**king crisp?!?!?) The humans are no Einsteins either, the radio communications used by the aliens, easily picked up by a common baby monitor, somehow escape the higher tech scrutiny that you'd expect from the scientific community or the military. And where is the military? At no time are there big explosions from the usual response to a threat, oh, say invisible hostile alien spaceships hovering over major cities all around the world.Nope, it's a "wait and see" approach here (maybe they were praying for rain). And what were the aliens going to do with the planet or us after we'd been conquered? A planet covered mostly by water,which is hardly an ideal vacation paradise for them is it? Perhaps they were going to tow it away and Ebay it. I dunno....and neither does M. Night Shymalan I bet.Furthermore, keep in mind that human beings are made of mostly water, so these invaders can't exactly devour us, nor can they enjoy the pleasures of sex with us. So maybe they'll burn us as fuel. Or Ebay us. Given these aliens observed level of technical sophistication, you could suppose their spaceships might have been of the steam powered variety.Of course, the Shymalan-fans-deep-in-denial are going to come back with howls of outrage that I "DON'T GET IT!". I can hear them now... "Dumbass! It's not about sci-fi or horror, it's about family, faith and spirituality!".Nah....It's a pathetically crap drawn-out hack written / directed drama pretending to be Sci-Fi. Both this movies alien attack plot and themes of faith and religion fall apart under the slightest bit of scrutiny (and I ain't even trying). SIGNS is another overly self important film by the most overrated HACKS of his time. Shyamalan fanatics and apologists will eat it up like excrement, while normal folks will retch violently and then upchuck.Oh, did I happen to mention that the aliens fart at the wrists?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Is it possible there are no coincidences?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are plenty of movies that use the idea of aliens invading and attacking earth. Some are good, some are incredibly bad. Signs uses that concept but follows through on it in a way I've never seen before. Instead of showing a bunch of stories like what the president is doing about this, the army fighting the aliens, and showing hundreds of people running and screaming, this movie shows how most people would probably be experiencing this: at home, anxiously watching the news for information. There are plenty of suspenseful scenes that are scary not because of what you see, but because of what you don't see, and what you are afraid to see.Many people love this movie for doing this, others hate it for it. If you're a fan of movies full of alien carnage with creatures biting the heads off people and blowing up cities, Signs may not be for you. But like all of M. Night's films, it still makes a pretty good movie without the main concept. It's actually a pretty touching story about family, faith, and the possibility that there are no coincidences and there is a reason behind everything. That's what makes this movie worth watching over.My rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not much awe or mystery here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The man who invented the telescope found out more about heaven than the closed eyes of prayer ever discovered." -- Robert G. Ingersoll.This film reminded me of late 1999, when all the lunatic fringe fundamentalists were preparing for the End of Days. Would a God really schedule Doomsday using something as human and arbitrary as the Gregorian calendar? I wondered what all those boneheads would do when January 1, 2000 rolled around and ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAPPENED except one more rotation of the Earth. They seem to have crawled back into the woodwork where they belong. That's what this film does: Starts out not with a bang but with a loud whisper and then ends with a pathetic whimper. Roger Ebert gave this film four stars, but he has never been too reliable about films dealing with Christianity, medicine or sci-fi. Never mind starting with a bang and ending with a whimper: Signs starts out small and then fizzles entirely. You think that it is leading up to some truly great ending, but then the film takes refuge in cozy, bland, reassuring religious platitudes that contend that there is a Purpose To It All.The story of extraterrestrial contact has taken many forms: Orgies of outrageous xenophobia like The Invaders from Mars or Independence Day. Cautionary tales such as The Day the Earth Stood Still (philosophically interesting but scientifically awful). Voyages of transcendental wonder like 2001, Contact and Close Encounters. And on and on. Signs tries to take a different approach, but suffers from a massive failure of imagination.Some things about this film I like. For once, a sci-fi film isn't a wretched excess of techno-violence. It takes place on a farm in Pennsylvania. There isn't a computer in sight. You see and hear a lot of wood: Boots and shoes clomping on wooden floors and verandas. Nature is never far away. The house looks like it's really lived in, by people of modest means. There are no damsels in distress or tough-talking Amazon weapons experts. The actors, as in all of Shyamalan's films, try hard for non-acting. Compare Mel Gibson's performance in this film and the Lethal Weapon films and you'll see what I mean.But wait: Was Graham (the Gibson character) both a farmer AND a minister before he lost his faith? His cornfields look awfully lush for being those of a former non-farmer. Not that he seems to take much interest in his fields. Also, where is the barn? Where is the heavy equipment? Where are his workers, if he has any? When the crop circles appear in his fields, no one shows up from the government or the media. Maybe that's not too far-fetched, but after it becomes clear that the crop circles may well be harbingers of an invasion from space, wouldn't you have troops with weapons and federal agents all over your farm? And these aliens: Would an alien who could easily get onto your roof and nimbly elude capture by two men in good physical condition really get caught in a bathroom, unable to get out? Would aliens who can cross space be so baffled by ORDINARY WOODEN DOORS? Why would an alien in your living room just stand there, not trying to get away or strike back, while you swung a baseball bat at him? Would an alien with evil designs on humans, e.g., to kill and eat them or drug and enslave them, really venture out onto an alien planet alone, unarmed, and WITHOUT A SPACE SUIT? Wouldn't they move in groups and carry weapons? Would an alien hungry for human flesh, and able to assimilate terrestrial protein, really find plain old tap water so toxic? Would aliens who found tap water so toxic really have designs on our planet, which is, after all, kind of a wet place? If aliens really wanted to abduct people for their evil purposes, why would any be out in the middle of nowhere in sparsely populated rural Pennsylvania instead of zinging a transporter beam onto a street in Bombay or Bangkok and netting a couple of thousand beggars? Maybe he was an E.T., a lone alien accidentally left behind, but this film neither answers that question nor even asks it. There are probably those who would reply that that isn't the point, that the real story is about the human characters in the film, but as I see it, if the whole plot is absurd, from beginning to end, how can the character studies make any sense?I can imagine how much this film appealed to Mel Gibson because he has extremely primitive religious views. He is a member of a small Catholic sect that rejects the liberalization of the Catholic Church that began with Pope John XXIII and Vatican II. Maybe that explains his massive victim complex. Look at his films: With some exceptions (e.g., What Women Want), he tends to play deeply wronged men who are taking revenge, to wit: the Mad Max films, Payback (!), Conspiracy Theory, The River, Braveheart, Ransom, The Bounty, etc. Few recent films have been better than "Signs" at taking the awe, mystery and grandeur of the universe and trying to squeeze it into a little religious box created by superstitious primitives who lived a couple of thousand years ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the advantage of hearing nothing but bad things about this film before I saw it, so my expectations were low. Often times, I am pleasantly surprised after hearing all those negative remarks. I'd include this as another film "better than I expected, "but not good enough to watch a second time. The second half of the film, I was told, was extremely hokey but I found it okay, although I could see where people would say that. However, I just watched it as a piece of entertainment, nothing else, and appreciated the sharp photography, too. In other words, I didn't read into anything with the story which so many others have seemed to do. Mel Gibson plays Hollywood's favorite type of clergyman: the kind who has lost his faith. That is, until, the strange turn of events at the end of the movie.Hey, it's an entertaining movie, with good suspense and very little offensive material. This is the typical M. Night Shyamaian movie, which means it does a good job of hooking you into the story but doesn't always give you a satisfying ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamlan's Most Underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs is directed by M. Night Shyamalan, a name that used to mean that we are in for a real treat at the movies, considering he had brought us The Sixth Sense. Signs is probably, in my opinion, the second best M. Night Shyamalan movie, after The Sixth Sense.It tells the story of one family as they try to investigate and piece together what caused the huge signs left in their crop field, which eventually turns out to be the act of an alien invasion. That alone is a simple plot, nothing we haven't seen before, with aliens and all of that weird stuff. However, the film remarkably focuses on the moral dilemma of the family instead of just aliens blowing things up and whatnot. This allows for some great storytelling, as we get some great exploration of the emotional crisis the family is caught in the middle of.One thing this movie gets a lot of criticism for is the fact that the aliens' weakness is water, and that it makes no sense for them to travel to a world that is 70% water. My argument is that the aliens may not have known the Earth was covered in water, as surely there are other blue planets out there.The other major concern people have about this movie is the way that the two kids act. Unlike the water issue, this one does bother me a bit like the majority of people. The kids consistently say things that no normal child would say. Their language feels very out of place, when they remark things like, "everything they wrote in science books is about to change", or "the water has his amoebas in it". It's just not how 8 to 10-year-old kids talk. I have nothing against the actors, but this does become an issue after a while.Despite that criticism, Signs outshines that because of how extraordinarily creepy it is. It's simply a very riveting story that will leave you on the edge of your seat. The scares work the way they need to: they give the audience chills and allow them to crave more. It's some great cinematic work what they manage to pull off.All in all, Signs is a frightening, exciting thriller that will surely deliver the thrills.Rating: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Faith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan directed this understated thriller that stars Mel Gibson as Reverend Graham Hess, who has moved into a country farmhouse with his brother Merrill(played by Joaquin Phoenix), and two children Morgan(played by Rory Calhoun) and Bo(played by Abigail Breslin)after his wife was killed in a car accident, a personal loss that has made him lose his faith. One day, they notice crop circles in their field, which they initially pass off as kid vandalism, but it turns out to be a prelude to alien invasion, that will hit close to their home, and making Graham rethink his anger with God. Well-intentioned film is not as well structured as the directors' first two pictures, with some awkward writing and plot holes, yet the ending is deceptively underwhelming, for it's because of its subtlety(and the sudden realization by Graham about God's reasons) that it retains itself in viewers' memory. Despite the numerous flaws, this is still worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is It Possible That There Are No Coincidences ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Graham Hess is a recently widowed farmer. One night, strange patterns appear in his corn crops, the family dogs start acting weird, there are odd noises at night and the water tastes funny. What is going on, and will Graham be able to protect his family from it ?Shyamalan is a great director with many strengths, but for me two things distinguish him from his contemporaries. Firstly, he has a very old-fashioned film sensibility; he goes for low-key effects and overall mood rather than big showstopping scenes, and secondly, he has a classical sense of film grammar, with long, simple, direct shots that tell his stories with grace, simplicity and charm. He's almost like Jacques Tourneur or Sam Fuller in the modern age of cinema. From literally the first shot, he starts to build tension and suspense with carefully constructed characters we come to believe in and care about, despite all the craziness to follow. The story might have familiar elements (some scenes are reminiscent of the stunning child abduction sequence in Close Encounters Of The Third Kind) but the picture keeps us off guard all the time, never knowing quite what to believe. Is there really an alien invasion taking place ? If so, what do they want ? Is Mel Gibson really playing a wimp ? Shyamalan weaves in his fate versus circumstances versus freewill theme with a deft touch; Merrill's batting style and Morgan's asthma may have spoiled their pasts but end up saving their lives. It's a very positive message within a juicily scary and disturbing film. James Newton Howard's music is terrific, eerily setting the scene and as unsettling in its absence as when it's tingling our spines and pulling our heartstrings. The two kids are terrific, Phoenix is solid support and Gibson does very well in the risky part of a man crushed by tragedy, fear and incomprehension. The sequence in the basement where he holds and talks his son through life-threatening breathing convulsions is bravura acting. Shyamlan also appears in his customary small role, here as a drunk driver. This is a great cryptic horror/suspense film, oozing atmosphere and drama in equal parts, made by a guy who doesn't pull his punches and never kowtows to Hollywood expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Signs Of Life"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Signs"Rating: PG-13 | for some frightening moments | Theatrical Release: 2002 | Runtime: 106 min.Critique: "Signs" relies heavily on symbolism and a belief that there are no coincidences. The film seems to be a montage of documentary, sci-fi, thriller, and even comedy since it has a bigger meaning than just sci-fi. It doesn't waste time to lose your interest; rather it immediately cuts to the chase when crop circles are discovered on the family farm. Don't you hate those movies that just drag along? I'm afraid this isn't a huge thriller. There are very few times that this movie actually scares you. There are some, don't get me wrong. M. Night Shyamalan mainly relies on mystery and suspense instead of actually facing fear up close and personal. Shyamalan is the kind of guy who doesn't want to use CGI if at all possible, and frankly I don't blame him. The aliens that are used are CGI, and they're pretty good, but that's not good enough. Even though Shyamalan decided to use CGI, I honestly don't think he should have. CGI hasn't managed to maintain a perfect form and at times it doesn't look real. Even though "Signs'" CGI is top grade, it's not perfect and it tends to deteriorate the movie slightly. Don't expect to see a lot of communication between outsiders and the family. They do manage to go into town, but Shyamalan wants us to focus on the family's characteristics and their problems of crop circles. We are thrown into their own fears while the majority of outside communication is beamed through the family television. "Signs" displays some values of faith in God and it uses that concept along with symbolism to clean house at the end of the movie. Overall if you have a taste for sci-fi and the art of symbolism, this movie's for you. *Audio 8/10: The audio is available in English and French Dolby Digital 5.1 surround. English subtitles for the hearing impaired are also presented. "Signs" has a nice little score that will keep you on your toes with the discomfort of a possible invasion. In many moments of the film you can hear a pen drop, a nice addition to bring the fear into your hearing senses.*Video 9/10: The video is presented in widescreen (1.85:1) for 16x9 televisions. Scene access and interactive menus are also available. The video is presented quite well, while beautiful farmland is shown in the filming locations of Pennsylvania. The colors are presented in a traditional and realistic way with dark colors, to show the mysterious terror of the family's problems. *Extras 9/10: We get more and then some. This film is packed with extras however no trailer or audio commentaries are provided. Deleted scenes, Night's first alien film and storyboards are available. His first alien film is quite dull and corny, but it gives us an excellent example of his determination to become a filmmaker. The most impressive extra is the six-part documentary by M. Night Shyamalan, exploring various concepts including the ideas that made it, to the marketing of the film. *Since studios release a variety of DVD editions: the audio, video, and extra reviews may be directed at one specific version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie the DAY it came out on DVD because I was angry over the fact that I did not see it in the theaters like I had promised. I was disappointed then for some reason unknown to me and I said I wouldn't watch this movie again.I recently picked it up and re-watched it and I was surprised that I didn't like this movie before. Shyamalan pulled the movie off well. Some things could have been fixed like the odds that Graham found his daughter that quickly in such a massive and dense crop field at the movies beginning. And some of the acting by the children seemed at some times like the acting you would expect in a Kraft Macaroni and Cheese commercial.Besides that the movie was pulled of excellently with some very interesting moments as well as some sudden movements and scares. All in all I believe this movie is for anyone who likes a good thrill as well as a good chill.I give this movie an A-.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed it.I enjoyed it because I'm blessed with the ability to hang my understanding and knowledge on the peg outside the room and just slump into the plot, with no care for how and why...Most people are, it seems. Look at the reviews for One Million Years B.C. Now there's not a person alive who's had any rudimentary education who can accept the co-existence of dinosaurs and humans, and yet here, no-one seems to give a damn. Protesters are labelled as anal-retentive pedants who don't know how to enjoy themselves. personally I have a lot of trouble with the dinosaurs/humans issue - it's a lot easier to accept aliens, dragons, breathing in outer space with the aid of "oxygen pills' (good grief!!) but the dinosaur thing is just not viable no matter how you try and rationalize it. I still managed to enjoy the film for its other charming strengths, though.Signs is O.K. if you suspend your natural objection to daftness for the duration of the experience. It's cute, with a hint of terror. Nice little subplot..Unfortunately the nice little subplot is wrapped up in Gibson's peculiar need to abase and mortify himself publicly to pay for whatever guilt he imagines he has, and this continuing thread is what's giving most of us trouble in accepting all the unexplained stuff.I think we can accept outrageous premises in films quite easily. Cartoon characters are immortal, etc... What gives us real trouble is when we are asked to accept a belief system that extends beyond the film itself and has maybe demonstrated itself to cause problems in the real world. If a film were made that biographed Hitler and which showed Nazism in an apparently positive light, how many people could enjoy it? I believe I could, because I don't have to subscribe to the idealism of the protagonist. I also believe I'm in a minority because most people seem unable to divorce an argument from its presentation, as witnessed by the number of times I've attempted to prosecute an argument by examining an antithetic argument in order to test the rhetoric and have been attacked for my views, even though I was clearly presenting the argument as a contrary one.Hang it on the door and enjoy the yarn for what it is, like listening to an Old Time Radio Play. You don't have to buy into Gibson's superstition or get bricked in by the logical flaws.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched The Sixth Sense and also Unbreakable. I cannot believe the same director wrote and made Signs. The Sixth Sense was a masterpiece VERY NEAT, and I really loved Unbreakable but in comparison Signs is crap.I am really sad saying this but I have to admit it. The movie had potential but unfortunately it has a ton of plot holes. Why I cannot believe M. Night Shyamalan made this movie? Because the other two mentioned are extremely well done.I enjoyed the first 30 min. of the movie, then everything turned predictable, boring, nonsense. I liked the suspense moments and I think the movie is saved by the actors who played the family. I know it was not the best thing Mel Gibson did but it was OK, and I really liked the children. The problem in this movie is not the actors, but the plot holes.How can I child kill a furious dog and do not get injured one bit? How can that happen in total silence without screams? The father and the uncle did not hear anything? How can aliens come to a planet where the main element everywhere is the very thing that destroy them? How can a baby monitor receive signals from the aliens but the military radars are unable to do that? How can a family has a little girl suffering a mental disorder about water for years and take it as a normal thing without a treatment?OK... OK... I saw comments saying that this is not a sci-fi movie but a movie about faith. Anyway, a plot cannot have all those holes! I have tried to think of this movie in a metaphor way. I think that was the director's intention, but even in that case there is a non-sense thing everywhere, because in that case the movie should not be realistic in some scenes but it is.I give 4 stars to this movie, but it is only because I loved the actors performance, not all the actors, just the family... And talking about actors why the hell M. Night Shyamalan appears in his movies as an actor??? Come on! To be an actor is not for everyone! As an actor he is utterly pathetic, but well, he may think he is Martin Scorsese.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Alien Invasion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) has made an astounding discovery: giant crop circles have mysteriously appeared in his cornfields overnight, and all the evidence suggests that they are extra-terrestrial or aliens in nature. Without warning, these unexplainable signs begin to pop up all over the globe, and the entire human race is suddenly faced with a unique event: aliens from another world may be coming, and no one knows their intentions. Hess is an ex-reverend who experiences a huge crisis of faith after the horrific and untimely death of his wife. Living with Hess are three members of his broken family: his younger brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), a failed baseball player who lacks of discipline kept him out of the major league; his son Morgan (Rory Culkin), a young boy afflicted with health problems; and his daughter Bo (Abigail Breslin), a little girl who is curiously paranoid. When Hess and his kin are confronted with the threat of an alien invasion, the failures and heartbreak of the family come to the surface in a volatile mixture of blame, guilt, and anger. Questions of faith,belief, and hope are all raised and explored in what is a thrillingly terrifying and satisfying film. This movie is about aliens, and it's intense, scary, and all the other great things you may expect out of this type of film. Nevertheless, it's also about faith and family. It's about finding meaning and hope whatever we might face in life. Director M. Night Shyamalan does the unthinkable, and we can never expect a conventional film out of him. In any film he directs he tends to pull the twist and turn technique. Either you like his movie or you do not. That right there should tell you that he is by far out of the ordinary when it comes to directing a movie. You can predict all you want through his films, but it will never come out the way you thought it would.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I get aggravated at people who automatically bash Night's movies. Granted, Signs wasn't his BEST work but it was good. One thing I love about Night that you can ALWAYS count on with him is that he puts so much thought into his films. Your never gonna sit down to a Night movie and predict everything that will happen after the first 10 minutes. He will always keep you guessing and you will NEVER guess right. I give complete props to a writer/director who is not afraid to do something different.I didn't catch on to him until after I saw the Sixth Sense, then I went back and watched Unbreakable. I loved them both. Later when The Village came out I was surprised by how much bashing it took. I loved it. I love it because it was original and it made you think. Signs does the same thing. It's not just a alien movie. It has a huge story other then the aliens. You are brought into the lives of the father and his family and you understand them and why they feel they way they do. As always Nights movies stay with you long after you first see them!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan broke out with his first film, The Sixth Sense, a movie that may very well prove to be both his best and most popular. There are worse fates that creating a cultural touchstone in film your first time out. He followed this with what some thought of as the disappointing Unbreakable. In that line of thought, I must agree that his movie about comic book superheroes looked anything but super. But most of that can be attributed to the cinematographer. In its defense, part of the point was to have the film look mundane. It was about a person who discovers that he's a superhero. It's only a surprise to him if his life looks plain and ordinary, like everyone else's.SIGNS cinematography is much better, more in line with Shyamalan's first film, but in all other ways, plot, pacing, characters, it's a weaker film.Many reviewers have complained about the emotionless nature of M. Night's characters, and he fairs no better here. There are no characters in this film, just caricatures. There is "the brainy kid" who is also "the kid who won't forgive one parent for the other parent's death." Not that the child's a bad actor, not at all, but he's a Culkin. And let's face it, all the little Culkin Clones make you think about beating the crap out of Joe Pesci on Christmas Eve, not their character.Then there's "the cute kid' who is also "the kinda creepy kid." Unfortunately, Kinda Creepy Kid was already done, and much better, by Haley Joel Osment, in Shyamalan's own The Sixth Sense.Next, we have Gladiator's ever-creepy Juaquim Phoenix, not as Mel Gibson's son, but as his brother. Now, I'm not saying it's impossible, but it is distracting. I'm sure there's at least 20 years difference in age between Gibson and Phoenix, and on screen it looks more like 30. Brothers? The theater-of-reality is blown in the first scene.Phoenix's character is an ex-minor league baseball player, for no apparent reason except that it's a convenient plot device when it comes time to beat the bad guy in the last reel. He doesn't play baseball anymore, despite the fact that he holds the minor league record for the longest hit, at 507 feet. With an arm like that, why isn't he playing ball in the big leagues, much less not playing at all? The only reason given is that he also holds the record for the most strike-outs. Sounds like a man who's played in the majors in Cleveland for a decade, called Jim Thome. Someone should have told M. Night that the top 8 hitters in major league baseball all had more than 100 strike-outs each their last two seasons each. And that even back when Babe Ruth was the home run leader, he was also the holder of the record for the most strike-outs. So it just doesn't add up.And don't forget the town sheriff who's a woman and may be a love interest for the male lead. The only problem with her is that we just had a town sheriff who's a woman and may be a love interest for the male lead last year, in The Mothman Prophecies. And Laura Linney actually had the opportunity to add a little thing called DEPTH to the character. The actress here is just another cardboard cut-out, that ultimately could've been cut completely from the film without anyone noticing.But the award for cardboard cut-out character and winner of the prestigious Kevin Costner Wooden Indian Actor Award goes to Mel Gibson. For the first time in film, the man is emotionless, joyless, and humorless. He plays a reverend who's lost his faith because his wife died in a car accident. One problem with this is that we saw this character ALSO, just a few years ago when we watched Harvey Keitel play a reverend who's lost his faith because his wife died in a car accident. Again, with the unfortunate result that the THEFT of this tired, Stock Character was also bad choice, as that even in that "We-Know-We're-Making-a-B Movie" film (From Dusk Till Dawn), Keitel was much much better.We never believe that Mel Gibson has lost his faith. We don't believe it when his faith is restored (like we don't see that coming), and I don't believe he's a reverend in the first place. At all. Ever. Instead, he walks through the film like the ghost of an actor who used to be allowed to act, or in lieu of that, to at least play the part of Mel Gibson, Superstar. There's nothing to care about in this character, nothing to root for, and nothing heroic. Welcome to the City of Dullsville, Population: Mel.And let's not forget plot points that make no sense. 'You've locked what you think might be an alien in the pantry.' Do you A) Peek inside to see if you're right; B) Call a neighbor or friend to check with you; C) Go get a weapon, then check; or D) Call in the police ? Why, it's none of the above. It's obviously E) Just go home and forget about it.While the cinematography and music are both good, gone is the sense of doom around the corner. There are no plot twists, or what-ifs. What starts off as "What if crop circles were made by aliens" ends with "crop circles were made by aliens." Mel's faith is restored, but with no real reason, nor does he seem glad that it is.Not a bad movie by any means, Signs is still the lesser brother of Unbreakable, as Unbreakable was to the Sixth Sense.* * * * * * * * * * Rating: C -</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK movie...good for a lazy Sunday afternoon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this movie a few weeks ago and I thought it was quite good. OK, so it was not the best of horror movies, I've seen much better, but it was still a good attempt.The suspense really builds up a lot towards the end while the aliens are getting closer, but one thing that was not so good about the movie was the ending. It was not quite so satisfactory as I had expected it to be. The only thing that happened was the father trying to save the boy who had asthma, and I don't think that was really enough. It was just sort of trying to show that God saved him or something like that, but the movie did not manage that very well, because technically it was not really God that saved him, and it just showed the family doing things to try and save him. That's what I think. Anyway, it was an OK movie because at least it has an ending! I think Signs is trying to ask you what kind of person we are, if you are a person who believes in God and miracles and things like that, or if you're the kind of person who believes that people just get lucky. I think the movie gives out that message in a pretty good way, and I congratulate Mr Shyamalan for that.Overall, it was an "average" movie that is worth watching and quite enjoyable.5/10</fullReview>

M Night Shamylan weaved a great tale of alien invasion like no other I can remember. The focus is not on the aliens, the horror, the death, the battle, the big wigs trying to stop it...it's on every day people and it shows how something like this brings out the humanity in all of us. The back story...which really when you think about it can be considered as the front story...is one that so many can relate to...a tragedy eats away at a man and his family...causing him to lose faith...but then the aliens come!! and the family comes together to find out there are no coincidences...and faith is regained!! sound corny or clich?...maybe...but M Night Shamylan presents this tale in such a way that it's hard not to be moved...and to cry along with Mel Gibson who really makes it all too real...what a great performance...so...if you are expecting an alien invasion thriller...skip it...the sci-fi logic and smarts is not all there...but look past that to the real story of humanity within this film...and you will be very pleased!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie does make me think about such a question----why we are always not aware of the important signs that others had sent to us. I mean sometimes i think about the basic senses of human beings. We are not that sensitive to some natural signals such as earthquake or flood, while cats and dogs may be much more aware. To those everyday signs that our lovers our friends try to send us, we seem to be less and less sensitive either. We turn a blind eye on most of the details that do count. What hints does she want to give me in that deep look at me before i go to work this morning? We seldom ask ourselves these questions which may bring us closer. In this point of view this is an excellent movie and an excellent sign as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Which Type Are You?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Signs," directed by M. Night Shyamalan, is an intense science fiction thriller. This film has two central themes: one being the impending invasion of aliens on Earth, the second is the story of the main characters' personal lives and traumas. The basic storyline is of a farmer, his two children, and his brother who awaken one morning to discover mysterious crop circles in their cornfield. Throughout the movie, the audience is given glimpses into the characters lives and begins to relate the history to the present day situation. The film soon shows its true colors as the man and his brother face their frightening situation at home. Faith becomes a very real part of the movie as the aliens make their approach.Reverend Hess Graham (Mel Gibson) is our central character, although Merrill Graham (Joaquin Phoenix), the younger brother of Hess, puts in an astounding performance. We learn through these two characters conversations and flashbacks, the personal grief and struggle they have already seen. The Reverend is referred to as father and through a sequence of events we learn that he is not only the children's father, but also a former leader of a church. The question of faith is touched upon in a conversation between the two men: "Which type are you? do you believe everything is for a reason or do you believe in signs?" Hess Graham asks his young brother while they anxiously await the arrival of the visitors from another world. M. Night Shayamalan cleverly invents a small, but important, role in the film for himself. The children are brilliant as they deal with the horror of an alien invasion."Signs" has a profound effect on the audience. The plot is frightening in ways that many movies fail to be. The aliens are not huge graphics which overrule the theme. Instead we are given just enough to make it feel real and become afraid for the world and its characters. The overall feeling of the movie is excellent with two amazing themes running into each other at just the right moments. The visuals are good, the acting is superb and the movie shines. M. Night Shayamalan has taken us to a critical place in movie-making--there is humor,drama,intensity and fear among the characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A viewed-from-the-basement alien movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M Night Shyamalan is used to take usual and known subjects to make the screenplays of his movies. Sixth sense was a ghosts love story. Unbreakable was a super-hero movie. This is an alien movie. And, unlike any other alien movie, we never see the menace. But this is not quite the fear that the actual War of the worlds gives to us. Signs is REALLY SCARY. It makes you jump of your seat, or maybe fall of it because you are always at the edge. When you are not screaming or bumping, you are laughing, so the few and really funny humor touches are that funny because of the fear around the whole action. Without fear, that humor is just silly. And the players are just another nail in the filmography of Night. Mel Gibson gives a lot sense of sutile performance, just because he moves no muscle of his face. Joaquin Phoenix is a solid brave little bro for Mel, like the protector of the family in the physical sense. And the kids are both enormous, so good that the adults are dwarfs compared to them, specially the little girl, Abigail, who's character became important in the last five minutes of the movie. They said there is no surprise at the end. I say there is, and a big one, one of those surprises that make you want to see this movie again as it's finishing. And it defends one of the basics pillars of Night's movies, the family. Until he did The Village and he killed everybody. Ha ha ha!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>-&gt;SIGN&lt;- of a talented director! So clever...Eh?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs does not have much originality in its plot, (aliens attempt to invade earth and wipe out the human race!) but what it does have is a director who is a master at creating moments of unbearable tension, with the comparisons to Spielberg being very much vindicated by this film. Shyamalam has taken a fresh spin on the alien invasion story by focusing the entire action with one family, ironically in a way that was imitated to an extent by Spielberg himself with "War Of The Worlds". The fact that the characters are given room to display a certain amount of depth and humour (particularly in the discussion early on between Graham, Merrill and Officer Paski) make them likable and empathetic which is key to the success of the tension in the set-pieces later in the film and that Shyamalam keeps the aliens hidden until the final act suggests he is a director who is clearly aware of what true film fans appreciate in modern cinematic storytelling and that does not necessarily involve a huge overdose of CGI. Admittedly the alien in the climatic scene does look a tad unconvincing but it is the testament to the films' overall strengths that this barley affects its impact. Strong performances from its two young actors, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin, as well as the ever reliable Gibson and Phoenix on top form make this film an excellent piece of entertainment which arguably improves upon repeat viewings. Pity about "The Village" though Shyamalam!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went to the cinema to watch Signs in the summer of 2002 I went there with high expectations of an intense, claustrophobic horror and in every way, it delivered. Finally, someone has decided to create an extra-terrestrial invasion movie that doesn't rely on special effects, galactic spaceships that can level cities and fancy hi-tech weaponry but on the reactions of one family. This movie had everything that I could've hoped for, the discreet appearance of the creatures, the claustrophobia it projected, the intense and moving memories of Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) and the determination. This movie never set out to become a blockbuster because in many ways it didn't have to. M. Night Shyamalan delivers to us every time a disturbing look at what could happen; watching Independence Day (1996) I soon realised that about twenty minutes into the movie that this was highly unfeasible (despite loving the movie) and the same for War Of The Worlds (1953/2005) but with Signs it uses accounts that we are familiar with, strange lights in the sky, crop-circles, worldwide confusion, these attributes are perfect and we know them! This is a scary look at perhaps feasible possibilities and has certainly made me think twice about what eyes could be watching us.As for the performances, Mel Ginson delivers the best performance of his acting career since Braveheart (1995) with the powerful emotion he uses to deflect the death of his wife and the survival of his isomorphic son. Joaquin Phoenix completely alters his character from Gladiator (2000) from a tyrant to a loving uncle who will strive to keep his family from collapsing from panic. All in all, this movie is brilliant and those expecting a bloodbath are going to be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyalaman's best film yet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen all of Shyalaman's films, including the newer "The Village", but Signs takes home the gold. The film has some truly terrifying moments and you never know what will happen next or where, which always keeps you on your toes, trying to look out for little details to help you figure out some kind of indication to a future scary moment. I believe Shyalaman was aware of that so he very carefully situated the setting and the script. The cast is good which includes Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix. The movie uses their relationship along with the kids to help move along the movie. It works well because the movie focuses s lot around family. The movie also shares the center point with faith.During a midnight conversation between Gibson and Phoenix, Gibson makes us ask ourself if we believe in coincidence or faith. He explains that we either think everything happens for a reason, or that its all chance. We never know what the right answer is or what Gibson thinks at the end of the film which keeps us guessing. And that's always nice.But what truly makes this a Shyalaman classic is the suspense and the horror. And that's saying something because the only other recently modern movie that had us this scared was The Ring. Some scenes are so scary that I actually saw people walk out of the theater. Not just kids either. One specific scene shows Phoenix watching TV and suddenly we see an alien run through someones drive-way in Brazil. It's really sudden and very scary. But I didn't like what Shyalaman shows us in the end of the film, which I won't give away.Overall, the movie has a nice take on the whole crop circle idea and has a nice ending. The movie works for all genres really; drama, family, horror, suspense, and a little comedy. This is really Shyalaman's best film yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mel Gibsons worst film by far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is with out a doubt Mel Gibson's worst movie.It is a one hundred times worse than the Patriot and 50 times worse than any of his other movies.This movie had poor acting and poor special effects. It made Jaws and Secret Window look like a #$@$*&amp; masterpiece. "They are talking to each other" was the corniest phrase any one has ever said when holding up a baby monitor. This movie was a pretty freaky film as well,and it wasn't even a horror movie. Well sure it is nightmarish, but that feeling will soon go away. Jaquan Phoenix was the only decent actor in the cast.I don't recommend this particular film to anybody, even if you do like scary movies.Overall a corny flick 1/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as I'm concerned, this is m night shyamalans best work .Huge plot inconsistencies aside (which i cant reveal without giving a lot of the movie away), Its a scary, suspenseful and gripping sci fi that keeps you guessing until the nerve jangling climax.The performances particularly from Gibson and pheonix are excellent and even shyamalan who directs with his usual mysterious flair puts in a strong cameo appearance .There's even a subtle moral message about having faith and how it can help you in the worst circumstances.Signs is a superior ,well acted ,edge of your seat thriller full of excellently orchestrated nail biting moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An invasion backdrop for an excellent faith story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS AHEAD!Some people believe that this film falls apart towards the end. I don't believe that. In fact, I think the ending is its strongest point, but you have to be tracking with Shayamalan the whole time. The movie isn't about aliens. Not really, at least. It's about faith. It's about family.Mel Gibson's character, Graham, has lost his faith. And it is that part of his character around which the entire movie revolves. We are constantly reminded that he was once a minister, and he constantly reminds us that he doesn't want to be associated with it anymore. We learn about his wife's death and how that has changed his life and his family dynamic. He's very angry with God.Once one understands that, the rest of the movie is quite excellent and falls right into place. By the end, Graham is confronted with the complex ways that God has been guiding his life. The ending doesn't fall apart. It draws everything together at the central point of the real story of the movie: a man who is angry with God about how his life has played out.As a Christian, I readily admit my slight bias towards stories like this. However, if you strip my faith out of my view of the film it still completely works and is still a well crafted story and film on both technical levels, and storytelling levels. Whether or not you agree with the story or its possible message, that doesn't change the fact that it is a story that hits its marks and is told well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not M. Night Shyamalan's finest, but good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the surface, Signs is an alien movie where the human race comes to contact with a foreign life form. Signs might have had a rather large budget, but it doesn't make it a big Hollywood spectacle. This means that there isn't a lot of scenes with the aliens nor does the scenery change much from the farmhouse that the family of Mel Gibson's character Graham Hess lives in. This is intentional.The reason for this is simple: Signs is really about family, faith and coincidence. It is clear that M. Night Shyamalan is a man of vision and good taste. As scenes with aliens are scarce, every glimpse of the invaders has a bigger impact. Signs isn't about cheap shots with well placed stingers or visual horror, but relies on its haunting atmosphere that is created by the uncertainty regarding the aliens. Not until the very end does the viewer begin to learn the first things about the invaders. For me, this worked very well and kept me interested throughout the film. However, some viewers will find Signs boring for this very reason.If the film hadn't been directed by M. Night Shyamalan, I doubt that Sign's would have turned out as good as it did. As the film contains a few dramatic scenes, it comes very close to being corny or cheesy, but Shyamalan manages to pull it off.So why only 7 points? Well, to tell you the truth I can't think of a reason why I didn't like it more. Sixth Sense totally blew me away, so expectations were naturally high on this one. 7 points is definitely not bad and there certainly isn't anything wrong with the film. Signs is just one of those movies that are "OK" and you can't really explain it. I found a lot of good in it, but maybe that just wasn't good enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More thrills from Shyamalan...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One day I would love to work with M. Night Shyamalan for two reasons: 1) he generally films in Pennsylvania, my home state, and 2) I am quickly becoming a fan of his movies. I loved "The Sixth Sense" and "The Village" was decent, but "Signs" is my favorite of his movies. The entire movie, start to finish, has a tense, creepy atmosphere (partially due to James Newton Howard's score)."Signs" is about the Hess family living on a farm in rural Pennsylvania. Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is a former Reverend who lost his faith in religion after the loss of his wife. Joaquin Phoenix plays his brother, Merrill. Mysterious crop circles appear overnight in the Hess' corn field, and soon begin sprouting up in locations all over the world. Tensions soon rise both in the Hess home and worldwide as the meaning of these symbols is gradually made clear. This movie touches on the topics of faith and the belief that everything happens for a reason.I wouldn't say this movie is very deep, despite its thought-provoking conversations, but it is definitely fun to watch. I love how Shyamalan's movie once again proves that showing less can be scarier than showing everything. The suspense builds as you are right there with the Hess family as they are terrorized by an unseen enemy.The acting in this movie has a coldness to it, every line delivered with seriousness. Even by the children. While I thought it awkward at first, I soon overlooked it as it added to the mood. For fans of Shyamalan, this movie is a must.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even when you aren't very interested in UFO's and aliens, this movie is worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Manoj Night Shyamalan seems to have a special bond with all that is mystical and mysterious. Almost all his movies have something special. Think of "The Sixth Sense", "Unbreakable" and the "The Village". You can never really call them a normal drama or thriller. And it's exactly the same with "Signs", which is about the Hess family who seems to live a normal live in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. After the death of his wife in an awful accident, Reverend Graham Hess questioned his faith and even left the church. All seems to be normal now, but when he finds a giant crop circle in the middle of his corn fields and several similar events happen all over the world, he really doesn't know what to think anymore. His children believe it is the work of extra-terrestrials, but his brother Merill is convinced that some local pranksters did it. But soon they realize that this is a lot bigger than they could ever imagine and all that is really sure is that something bad is about to happen...Some people pointed out that the end of the movie was so bad that it spoiled all the rest. Well, I can't really find myself in that opinion. It's true that the end could have been better, but in my opinion it still contributes to the whole of the movie. Still, it was one of the weakest parts of the entire movie, which most of the time offered plenty of suspense and thrills and some decent acting. Certainly worth noticing is the young Abigail Breslin who is nice to watch and who did a terrific job despite her young age. All the others like Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix and Rory Culkin did a pretty good job as well, but she was the one that I really noticed.Overall this is a decent movie that will please all people who are interested in phenomenons like aliens and UFO's, but even when you aren't a big fan of such stories (I'm one of them), this movie is worth a watch because it is a lot better than the average Sci-Fi film. Mr. Shyamalan proves with this movie that perhaps he isn't a master in writing dialogs, but that he sure knows the techniques to make a movie suspenseful and interesting to watch. I give it a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan's third movie is an alien movie that takes us in a totally different direction than we would normally expect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring: Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix Shyamalan's third movie, Signs, is probably my favorite of the three that I have seen. I like them all a lot, but this one is just a cut above the rest in my opinion. In the same way that Sixth Sense is the horror movie that isn't and Unbreakable is the super hero movie that isn't, Signs is the alien movie that isn't.Early in the movie, Graham Hess (Gibson) find something unusual in his fields. Crop circles. Is it a hoax? Is it a practical joke by somebody in the town? What made the circles? Graham's children, Bo and Morgan both believe right away that they were made by something not human, but Graham and his brother Merrill (Phoenix) have their doubts. Crop circles? It has to be a hoax, right? Then other things start happening. The dogs start acting strangely. Bo comes to Graham in the middle of the night and claims that there is a monster outside of her room. Graham and Merrill go outside to scare the intruder off. They chase him around the house, but when they meet on the other side, the intruder is on the roof. How? Then more odd things happen. Graham finds someone, or something, walking around in his cornfield. Alien signals get picked up through baby monitors. Lights are floating in the sky all across the world. Eventually Graham and Merrill drop their doubt and admit that there are aliens out there.The movie has a very claustrophobic atmosphere. Most of the movie takes place on the Hess farm. But it works. In the cramped atmosphere, we feel just as trapped as the Hess family. Shrouded in confusion and fear, unsure of what exactly is going to happen.I won't tell you how they get rid of the aliens, but it is hardly in a conventional manner. This movie sharply contrasts movies like Independence Day where aliens come in big spaceships with big guns to blow up the world. Instead they come with ground troops and strategy.This movie is well acted and cleverly written, and it is one of my favorite movies.Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (own this movie)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the SignS of masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a psychological thriller set in the modern day, a family find that mysterious crop circles begin appearing in their fields and as we will soon find out, not just the work of simple boards and ropes...As expected of any Shyamalan film the less you know before hand the better, so I'll be brief. From the intriguing start to the compelling climax Signs contains the makings of an all time great. The dialogue is exquisite, the characters charming and their connections intimate. Signs is Independence Day for a more sophisticated era, with the strong bonds of family uniting against frightening events and dark shadows that haunt their door. Whats impressive with this film is that it never loses its way. Its focus is on a single family and there it stays. Even when events involved become global, it remains at its roots and provides us with a perspective we ourselves may understand and believe as one we would ourselves experience were that family our own. Mel Gibson is at his usual best and Pheonix turns out perhaps his best performance since Gladiator. Even the kids (played by Abigail Breslin and Rory Culkin) are equally impressive.By focusing on the unseen as opposed to the seen Shyamalan has brought his audience intense atmospheres and nail biting suspense worthy of Hitchcock himself. Recommended to all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved The Sixth Sense as much as anyone and Unbreakable is one of my favorite movies (yes, Unbreakable, and I'll defend it to no end) so I was highly disappointed by this one. Let's just say I have a whole bunch of issues with this movie.1)The entire thing was an overlong second rate version of Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds.2)Those were real birds and they're still terrifying, which is a lot more than I can say for some idiot in a bright green Halloween costume.3)Why would the aliens, with all their brilliance that enables them to travel galaxies, try to conquer a planet that's 65% covered by the substance that kills them! Some people have tried using the defense that it's holy water, but that doesn't explain why Dr. Reddy thought they were afraid of the lake. This is just a huge plot hole. What's with Shyamalan's water phobia? I thought that was OK as David Dunne's weak point, but why would he use the same thing twice? It didn't make sense here.4) That whole "swing away" twist. I'm sorry, I have nothing to say about that other than I thought it was COMPLETELY RETARDED! 5)The ending was much too heavy handed. Shayamalan may as well have had God personally come down and tell the aliens "Leave the Hess family alone!" No one hits a home run every time, and I was willing to overlook this misstep by Night and still be excited about his next film. After seeing The Village, however...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It really shows intelligence on the viewers part,considering the fact that this absolute muck-fest actually managed to get no less than 7.1!! And such a big surprise that most of those who dared raise their thumbs up were Americans. Yep,the surprise was so immense that it blew my mind! Dead honest,it really did. Anyway,if you read this review,and you still want to feel the pleasurable feeling of extreme nausea,then be prepared to meet the family Retardo; Mel Gibson as the pathetic ex-priest completely helpless(But he's a priest, tell me that can't be?!!),his equally retarded brother, and here comes the "jolly" part; two kids,one of which is a vomit inducing piece of **** because of his extreme willingness to be the one to hold the family together, and of course this entails the fact that he is a f****** know-it-all!!BAAAAAAAAAARPH!! There are only two positive episodes in this "film" that comes to mind; namely the one in which you see his wife talking to holier than thou(Gibson)but missing her lower half(Sorry folks you don't get to see any juicy bits I'm afraid,but anyway...).and the one in which he get some of his fingers chopped off. Won't bother giving any summary for this worthless plot,unless to say that it is a favourite contender for the throne of crap: Boring,ridiculous,pathetic!! I bet you a monkey that old Mel really enjoyed his role,the catholic goody that he unfortunately is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>God awful. This is truly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The plot is lame, boring and just stupid. Aliens coming to earth, wow, how original... It has just been done too many times. Don't get me wrong, I love alien-invading movies, but this is just not any good. I really cant believe Phoenix and Gibson would agree to do such a movie. Well actually, Mel I can, but not Phoenix. What gives?! The last scene where Phoenix is duking it out with the green-(I can't believe it's supposed to be an alien)-thing, is just...,I have no words for how stupid that is. Of course that is not only obscure scene, but it will take to long to mention all. And why are the aliens killing the humans anyway?? Did I miss something? I might have fallen to sleep, but I can't remember anything about why. I watched the whole movie, just to get an confusing ending, and without even getting to know why they did that?? Two hours of my life, I am never getting back. Da*n you Shymalan!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stop Signs?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Shyamalan's excellent work on "Sixth Sense," I was really looking forward to Signs. Unfortunately, Signs never lived up to its hype and, certainly, not to its heritage.This movie was the worst of Independence Day, (the way the aliens communicated), Night of the Living Dead, (boarding themselves up in to the basement), and The Wizard of Oz, (kill the aliens by throwing water on them? "Help me, I'm melting...), all rolled into one. The plot was completely predictable. The characters were not to be believed. The movie was made up of pieces of other, better films, assembled in a haphazard manner. The subplot concerning Hess' dead wife was pointless, what did his wife's death have to do with aliens from outer space? It amounted to 106 minutes of spooky sounding music that was supposed to increase the tension for the climax. Unfortunately, what was going to happen in the end was so predictable right from the start, it just ended up being 90 minutes of boring and 16 minutes of bad special effects. The tag line, "It's not like they didn't warn us," says it all. Anyone who didn't get that the aliens were coming would have to have been deaf and blind. The constant references to water gave away the climax long before the aliens got there. The movie was set in Pennsylvania, not Siberia, was it really necessary to hide in the basement? Why didn't they just call someone, it's not like they were all alone. The problem is, I wish someone had warned me about how bad this movie really was, so I could have saved my $7.00.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Movie Experience with a Difference</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie in a pirated CD and later on TV channels. I have to warn you, on each viewing this film will make everyone to "FALL in LOVE" with the Story!Signs(Spoilers******) Indian born director M. Night Shyamalan takes his next boogie venture this time his story revolves round the strange circles appears on the corn fields. Ex-Rev. Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is now interested on agriculture after his wife died on a car accident. Giving up his belief on God, Graham is living a new life with his two children and his brother (Joaquin Phoenix). One day he finds some strange circles on his crop fields, soon realizing that it's some kind of Alien signs. Why such signs appear on his field, does it have any thing to do with his past days? Scripted by M. Night Shyamalan himself tells the thrilling story of Aliens intrusion with a backdrop of strange crop signs. As always Shyamalan movies have something to say, it also gives messages like all Things Happens For Good, Believe in God. Mel Gibson was tremendous in portraying the torched family man. Gladiator-Joaquin Phoenix did an outstanding performance as Gibson's younger brother, whenever he was on screen the viewers get some relief, he was best in creating a pleasant atmosphere in an art movie. Plus the other person who steal the show was little girl Abigail Breslin, she was a an angel in the movie, but the boy Rory Culkin sucked his part by portraying a Too serious 10 year old.The camera works were good also the masterful editing. Credit goes to works of Tak Fujimoto and Barbara Tuliver. Last but not least the soul for Signs created by James Newton Howard makes this movie a cult classical one. Such a thrilling hunting Disturbing score that pushes Suspense and Pace in a well balanced way is totally unique.Watch this movie for a peaceful time of Horror. It's not disturbing, it's just feels good if you have enough sense to think." I give this movie 8 out of 10 "Signs = Simply An Intelligent Movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As with all his previous films (and The Village after it) Night has the ability to keep an audience initially intrigued ,there's no doubt about that - but the pay-off, the climax, the BIG TWIST (T.M) turns out to be pretty obvious from the first five minutes. If only there were such a BIG TWIST (T.M) to partially save this film. Have to agree with most of the other anti-Signs comments here...major plot faults, limp acting and just the occasional interesting direction.I guess, for me at least, he always promises much more than he delivers. I've nothing against him personally...just feel the words "over-rated" and "Emperor's new clothes" come to mind while watching any of his films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hold on to your seat, this is going to be quite a ride.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Signs" is an intense film that grabs you at the very beginning with an insight into a world beyond what any audience believes is the only possible world. M. Knight Shyamalan has set out to intrigue the viewer with his display of alien crop circles and their possible use for navigational purposes. This idea seems to be based solely on Shyamalan's perceived knowledge of life beyond this realm. Shyamalan sets the mood of the film during the opening credits with the type of eerie music that you might find in an Alfred Hitchcock movie. The music is continued throughout the film and lets the audience know to hold on to their seats, this is going to be quite a ride.The movie "Signs" stars Mel Gibson as Father Graham Hess who lives with his family on a remote farm in Bucks County, PA. This closely-knit family consists of two children Morgan and Bo (Rory Culkin, and Abigail Breslin) and Father Hess's brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix). The children's mother died six months earlier in a car accident and Merrill moved to the farm shortly after her death to help his grieving brother and his family. "Signs" shows that even a religious person can suffer the loss of faith when life's direction is challenged by a higher power.The first half of the film focuses on the children who seem to have more insight into things beyond what the adults can comprehend or will even allow themselves to believe. Short of a miracle, the world seems doomed. News reports from all of the news agencies were appearing on the Hess family's television. The reports were plastered with the same images from around the world. When asked what was on television, Breslin answers in an eerie monotone voice, "it's the same on every station". Eventually the television was hidden from the children in a closet and only Phoenix was viewing these reports. Shyamalan uses these newscasts as their only link to the outside world. The everyday life on the farm is filled with signs. The half-filled water glasses that Breslin leaves around the house even has a purpose in this film. We can see daily how the family grows closer. Shyamalan accomplishes this in the film as the family gathers around the television to watch these reports. The family who started out on opposite ends of the farm at the beginning of the film are now huddling together in fear of the signs around them.Gibson's character struggles with his need to regain his faith in God and his own ability to help his family to get through this terrible situation. Something appears to be watching them. Is it God or something else? The signs are all there. Shyamalan allows us to catch glimpses of the aliens in the fields and on the roof top. The film seems to carry out its sign motif even further with delightful ornate woodcarvings and images in every scene in the film.The entire film seems to come together because everyone all over the world is seeking answers to God's purpose for this alien invasion. The conclusion is that they will have to seek out God themselves for the answers. The family that has been isolated from the outside world draws strength from the Gibson character. In the end of the film, Gibson's faith returns and the overall knowledge that the world as well as their home is once again saved by God's endearing love.The work of Shyamalan in a more recent film shows a group of citizens of a small town in "The Village" who are struggling with their own beliefs of the outside world and what is happening beyond the walls that were protecting them. Both "Signs" and "The Village" explore the possibility of the world having forgotten them and how the characters in both are left to fend for themselves.The fact that "Signs" is an awesome thriller is well known to those of us who viewed the film at its opening in 2002 and are still on the edge of our seats as we watch it again today on DVD. This is truly a film that will open your eyes to the possibilities of another realm and what might be possible beyond this world. The questioning of anyone's faith will certainly be a hot topic of discussion after viewing Signs. Watch this film with someone who appreciates a good thriller, it will be a fun and fantastic film to talk about long after the film ends and the popcorn has disappeared.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although some people complaint that the film is not too scary, I think it is a really great picture. To me, Signs WAS scary. The suspense is delivered at the exact dose each moment. There are not empty spaces lack of thrill and suspense. Your tension is kept at the right level.There are some top moments in the film that deserve to be pointed out, for example, the scene with the baby-watch radio; or the scene when " the same show's on every channel". To me, the screenplay is just a masterpiece.And what about the actors? It is a dream team. The casting is great, and the performances are excellent. We have to point out, of course, the astonishing work of Abigail Breslin (Bo Hess). This (then) barely six year-old little girl does just an overwhelming job, with a script that I'd say is too hard for any kid, not to mention the age. It's really astonishing.A turn-off of the film is the final outcome of the fight between a human and an alien. That makes the scene look somewhat like many low-category films.Another thing I dislike is the quality of special effects: I actually didn't see those smooth enough to be as excellent as the rest of the features in this film.As you watch the film you notice many other virtues: good direction, good dialogs, good photography... One thing about the dialogs is that they are real: you never find someone saying things that a normal person wouldn't.Everything in this film is perfectly balanced and flawlessly made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signs!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that this movie was so great . M. Night Shymalayan is such a neat looking guy , and Joaquin Pheonix is such a good looking guy. It is such a thriller and suspenseful movie. There are so many funny parts in it like when Merrill has on a foil hat and is sitting there with his hands on his knees. It is hilarious! I really really enjoyed this movie. Merrill was so funny with the way he would get so into the stuff with the kids when-when he is a grown man. I hope that m. night shymalayan uses Joaquin Phoenix in the rest of the movies he makes. i hope that m. night shymalayan makes many many more movies. he makes such good movies. They are just so interesting all of them have been, the sixth sense, unbreakable, signs, and the village. I think that m.night shymalan is such a good actor in the part he has in signs. it is so funny when he said "father, don't open my pantry door, i found one and i locked him in there."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Would You Stand Up to Aliens?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies are seen as one type, when it really is another. Signs is one of them. Most moviegoers thought they were going in to see an alien invasion movie, when in fact Signs is a study of what would one family do if there was a terrible threat from above. The ultimate ending of the planet Earth is not hanging in the balance through the action we see, rather, just the fate of one family. M. Night Shyamalan's third feature film chronicles a rural family living outside of Philadelphia where crop circles begin to appear in the corn fields. The setup is there, and Shyamalan uses the expectation of aliens going "bump" in the night to play on the audience's fears and create a tense mood of what could be. Mel Gibson plays the father who was once an Episcopilian priest who left the flock after the death of his wife. He lives with his two young children, well acted by Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin, and his brother, played by Joaquin Phoenix on a farm in the middle of acres of corn. The focus of the movie is entirely on the family, with the only outside contact coming through their television, as they watch newscaster trying to figure out what is going on in the world. Here, the talking heads on TV are not plot-movers, they are experiencing the same doubt and fear that the families watching at home are going through. My favorite scene in the film is that of when a Brazilian family catch a glimpse of an alien. It has a certain realness to it, as if we were going to catch home video of an alien, it would look just like it does in the movie. The ultimate resolution of the movie has been a source of consternation among moviegoers, if you think really hard about it, on the surface it may not make sense, but you do not know how desperate the invaders are and what kind of risks they will take, even if that means invading a planet that is 80% harmful. The important thing is that it does not matter how it ends, the important part of Signs is how the family deals with the invasion, not how it ends. We can identify with the family, we can put ourselves in their shoes. What would we do? No phasers here, just trying to survive. I appreciated the change, not all alien movies have to end with hi-tech, Buck Rogers weapons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great science fiction movie, although it is basically a movie about faith and meaning.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Signs' is the movie you'll either love or hate. I loved it. To describe it in a nutshell: Close Encounters of the Third Kind meets Hitchcocks 'The birds'. It's a Sci-Fi movie showing a widower (a former preacher) who finds mysterious circles in his crops and the way he deals with this problem. And again, I really, really loved this movie. Sure, it has flaws, but name one movie that doesn't. But for the sake of objectivity I'll sum up some of these imperfections. For example, the introduction of the 'menacing elements' (I call it like this to avoid spoilers) has been done much too sudden and much too overt. As a result the fear-provoking factor is slightly reduced. Still, there's a scene where a home made video reveals those so-called 'threatening elements' very explicitly and I must say, it is one of the scariest moments in the movie. Anyhow, maybe this film lacks the power of suggestion, all the more when compared to Shyamalans other movies. But come on, let's not split hairs. Another 'flaw' is the obligatory end twist. It is after all a movie from the creator of 'The sixth sense', so you can expect a huge eye-opening surprise at the end of the film. I admit, when you have just seen the movie, and you analise the story and all the plot elements, this end twist makes the whole movie seem a bit artificial because every little element in the movie has been introduced for the sake of making this twist plausible. But on the other hand, when you're actually watching the movie, the twist really does work. And I guess that's the most important thing, how you feel while watching it. Any post-movie gibberish is trivial.But like I said before, I loved this movie. First of all the acting is marvelous. One particular emotional scene comes to mind: 'the last supper'-scene. In this scene former preacher Graham Hess (played by Mel Gibson), his brother Merril (played by Joaquin Phoenix) and his children (some will perhaps recognize Macauly Culkins younger brother) are trying to have dinner, but the emotions of fear are just too overwhelming, so they break out in tears. This is really a tear jerking scene. But even in less dramatic scenes the acting is above standard.Another positive element in 'Signs' is the subtle humor, which is rather unseen in the work of Shyamalan. It certainly relieves the constant tension of the story, and therefore it is appropriate within the movie as a whole. What was Shyamalan to do anyway? After all, he hired Mel 'funniest man alive' Gibson. Rest my case.The camera-work in this movie is very artistic and calculated, but I didn't expect any less from this director. So, I won't go into this any further.Some find it a bit restrictive that the movie takes place for almost 95% in the farm-area where the family lives. But to me the limitations of space added to the genuine feeling of imprisonment the family must have had being threatened by unknown forces, and tied to the memory of their departed wife/mother/sister-in-law. This claustrophobic feeling works, just like it did in Shyamalans 'The Village'. What strikes me about Shyamalans movies 'The Village' and 'Signs' is that each of these films is cemented with an universal message. There's always a moral to be found. While the search for pure, unconditional love was the main topic of 'The Village', 'Signs' focuses on the loss of faith and the search for meaning in misery. Okay, being a Shyamalan fan I'm biased, but what the heck: 9,5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M. Night's finest hour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film left me wanting more, and more, and more of M. Night Shyamalan's films. It truly is his finest hour in film-making, with his suspense-thriller 'The Sixth Sense' coming in a close second.The film surrounds the plight of the Hess family, that is, Graham (Mel Gibson) the father, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) the brother of Graham, and the two children Morgan and Bo. They discover a series of crop signs in their corn fields, and as the movie unfolds the Hess family and the entire world is faced with a potential invasion from extra-terrestrials.Shyamalan truly is a brilliant storyteller. He uses brilliant setting, camera angles and lighting to leave you breathless. The casting is also brilliant, with Gibson doing a fine job as Graham Hess, Phoenix enchanting as Merrill, and the two children do a thoroughly capable job of portraying Graham's sometimes quirky children. Another fine feature of Signs is the musical score. Perfectly timed, the music is haunting and windy, helping the watcher's imagination to follow its path.This movie is worth a watch. Then another. And another. I've seen it 5 times, and it gets better every time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A genuine masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible spoilers! Although I believe nothing can spoil the joy of something so great!First, to all of you screaming: HOW COULD ALIENS BE STOPPED BY A SIMPLE WOODEN DOOR?!!!, WHAT ABOUT THE AIR HUMIDITY?!!, ETC.... - People, what's wrong with you, do you really accept this movie as an ALIENS-INVASION-SCI-FI crap. This movie's got nothing to do with aliens. What is more it is amazing how a movie can be based on the ALIENS-ARE-COMING-TO-KILL-US-ALL-AND-EVERYTHING'S-GOING-TO-HELL clich and still be a real masterpiece. 'cos nowadays what else do we have got left to use but clichs. But only a genius can arrange the old clichs and recycle the past in order to produce something interesting. The aliens are simply a symbol of what exceeds human capacity for understanding, a symbol of anything supernatural or beyond. Anything else could be used successfully instead of aliens as long as it was supernatural enough. THE ALIENS is fine by me. It's absolutely unimportant. Have you heard the saying (a Chinese one, I believe): "I was pointing at the stars but they were looking at my finger." - interesting one, don't you find? You're missing the point guys.And now, on the comment (you distracted me, you) I'm a bit late I guess. Anyway this one will turn into a classic and it's never late to write about classics.I missed it when it was on at the theaters. When I came across this title a few months ago I was drawn by the Indian (I'm always fascinated by anything Indian) name of the director/writer but when I read the review on the back cover some doubts occurred due to the sci-fi hint as I'm not that much into the genre in general; I consider it neither science nor fiction. However the very first scene captured me and it was clear there was something about that movie; and when it was over I merely stood there in awe and I still do.Since I'm too hard to please (huge fan of such films as Terry Gilliam's, Antonioni's "Blow-up" - one of my all-time favorites and obviously one that "Signs" can be related to in a way, and a few more) I haven't seen a great (nor even a decent) movie for many years (except for some sparks like "American Beauty", "Lost in Translation" and stuff); and then it came.As I understand it (I've seen it twice) this is a work about truth being revealed step by step through "signs of things and signs of signs" as Umberto Eco put it in "The Name of the Rose". And one more quotation: "A great work of art always reveals more than its author consciously intended to say. (Albert Camus, "The Myth of Sisyphus"). So in my opinion what we deal with is an existential or metaphysical (why not call it) work about people seeking clearness about what they are surrounded with. Since humans tend to let themselves be carried by inertia one starts "reading" the signs mostly when they are forced to. Only under extreme circumstances one finds it necessary to think about "important" stuff. Ultimate situations require ultimate measures but ultimate measures definitely take ultimate thinking. But I believe works like this movie make us think from time to time even in the stream of everyday things. Last quotation (I promise): "Wherever you look there is something to see." (A Hebrew saying, from the Talmud I believe.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Few thoughts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I sat watching signs, I couldn't help but think of Steven Spielberg's "Close Encounters of the third kind" If you were to sit through this movie, not knowing what to expect, you'd find Signs, at first glance, to basically be the same film, just with evil aliens, instead of good ones. To wit: In both movies, they find mysterious .. well... signs. IN CEot3K, its tones. In signs, crop circles.Both movies point to the discovered elements as "navigation systems" (The tones in CE3K turn out to be latitudes and longitudes, in Signs, a system that points to major cities) The basement sequence in Signs has the same feel as the kidnapping sequence in CEot3K Both have a sequence in India in which the locals discover the signals.I was thinking these were similar movies, about making contact with aliens. One film they are good, in this one evil.Until the end of Signs threw a curveball at me. Let's just say that in Signs, the title Isn't referring to the crop circles. It was a very clever (IMHO) ending. This movie is a must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a strange premise... It tries to be a tense and suspenseful horror, while trying to maintain a spoof-like attitude towards 50s B-movies... and for the large part it succeeds.Though this film was advertised and branded as a horror you have to appreciate it as comedy if you want to enjoy it... Certain characters and actions as laugh out loud funny, and i think this is very intentional. The weird army man. The way uncle Meryl acts in places, and the tin foil on the head thing... (something which Scary Movie 3 missed the mark spoofing... because it was a joke in the first place) However in places the film seems stuck between the horror and comedy genres ad doesn't know where it wants to be, and you'll notice this scenes because they seem very awkward My suggestion is you enjoy this as a film that takes the mick out of old sci-fis but is also suspenseful in its own right. I think this is a fine film despite the ending, which doesn't fit the rest of the film... Or maybe it does because I haven't seen any 50s Sci-Fis.</fullReview>

It's hard to watch in parts,and can be very brutal.But it stuck with me, and I'm not sure why.Spoilers ahead!There are plot holes in it.

		<fullReview>This movie was excellent in every way. Awesome acting, Mel Gibson of course, awesome cinematography (has one of my favorite camera shots ever), fairly good plot, at least more believable than most alien movies, and the main thing i enjoyed was that everything that happened in this movie was for a reason.the only thing that had almost no reason was when he finds the alien in the pantry. but it actually could have a reason if you expand your imagination. I figure it was to create an opportunity for it to come back at the end for revenge. All in all MNS did a good job at keeping you guessing, keeping you on the edge of your seat, and adding comedy into it as well. The thing that is still keeping me watching it is that everytime i do, i notice something new. He puts a lot of detail into his movies. good good good.

		<shortDescription>A real look at the inner person</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prior to finally watching this film, I had heard very little about it. I had seen the trailers, seen the box office records, but other than my sister telling me it had creeped her out, had heard no comments on how other people felt about the film or what the film was about. The trailers led me to believe that the film was about Aliens and would be scary, and while it is indeed about Aliens, the film touches on so much more than that. The film, while a little jumpy and perhaps a bit of a "horror" flick for its suspense, was not a mindless film. It was one where you needed to pay attention. All of this director's films are that way. Hidden messages that you must remember later on in the film. I find that to be positively stimulating. I was in no way bored, as other reviewers have stated.The film centers around a man, Graham Hess (Gibson), and his struggle with god. His personal faith lost after his wives death, he gave up on his church and is trying to live a normal, albeit sad, existence with his children and his brother (Pheonix). Each of the characters has their own "quirks". You can see that each of them has anger at life. In this film, the aliens are used to symbolize Grahams fight with god. Instead of god, it is the aliens. It almost seems as though god has sent the aliens to remind Graham of his presence. While Graham is trying to make sense of what is going on once the strange "goings on" begin, it is very much like Graham's struggle with his wives death. There is shock, denial, acceptance, fear and anger. He battles to save the family that remains as well as himself. When Graham realize's, at the end, how to kill the alien that has entered his home, it's amazing. It shows that there are no coincidences. His wife, with her dying words, showed part of how to overcome. Hinting that perhaps she knew what would happen. That god had given her the words to show Graham the way. And the fact that the person who killed his wife, Reedy, also in a statement to Graham, gave Graham the final piece of information needed to save his family. Reedy stated that it was like he was meant to fall asleep at the wheel at exactly that moment, when she would be there. Like he was meant to kill her. And the wife said the same. That it was meant to be. And it was. So that both people could, in the end, show Graham the way. Each had information. Had Reedy never hit Graham's wife, I don't believe Graham and he would have ever had the conversation they had. It was very complex, a true look at the struggles of a family, of a man, when faced with unbearable loss. But instead of a dramatic, sad film to show these struggles, the director used a fear that everyone has. The fear of Aliens. This allowed everyone viewing the film to have a fear already, better equipping them to feel what Graham felt and follow along in his journey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Casual online movie reviewers keep missing the true message of films and pan them because they expected something more pedestrian. What high standards we've set for ourselves!To anyone with a little depth, "Signs" was clearly not meant to be a disaster flick or special effects showcase. The movie is more about a Man losing and regaining his faith in life, God or whatever. In many ways, the alien plot serves as a backdrop to the plight of the characters, though it's center stage all the while. I don't think the movie was meant to be scary in the usual sense. The uplifting soundtrack balances a sense of doom with a promise of hope.Almost the whole film is seen from the angle of an isolated farmhouse and its inhabitants, freeing us from the usual hype of command centers, bickering authorities and views of mass suffering. That's how any average person would witness an alien invasion; from their own porch. And that's what made this movie different for me. I hope that most viewers at least understood why it's called "Signs" and what those signs meant in the context of a suffering family. I won't call it a completely profound or flawless film but it's certainly compelling and above average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, i will admit than when i first watched Signs I found it a tiny bit dissapointing. How can it just end? WE dont know where the aliens come from or what there purpose is but when you go underneath the surface of this film you really begin to appreciate the thought that M.Night has put into this film.This film is so much more than the stereotypical sci - fi movie. M.Night has combined sci - fi with horror and aspects of thriller, almost creating a whole new genre. The aliens is just one small part of this film, M.Night has dealt with so many issues, death, faith, dreams, all of which create there own meaning and importance to the film.M.Nights techniques are almost individual to him, his way of keeping the audience in suspense is simply amazing. Notice the "signs" that are always appearing, red, white and blue on the house, a cross on the wall representing faith, how the alien only ever appears on a television screen.Before you write a bad review on this film, study it in the depth that i have, and you will see all the "signs" are combined together brilliantly by M.Night. This film is one of the best films of 2002 simply because it has been thought out so well. I eagerly await M.Nights next film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan is Getting Closer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading reviews on this site and the Signs message board can be a bit confounding. It would seem a lot of people either are getting caught up in the "plausibility" aspect of the ending, which Hitchcock remarked to Truffuat about, or they were disappointed the final scenes didn't end in some type of cataclysmic battle. I think both criticisms miss the point. What Shyamalan is trying to do here ( for the most part he succeeds) is both awe us, and make us consider more than just what the plot says is happening. After making the disappointing Sixth Sense which slowly made its way to an obvious "twist" ending, and the much better but still lacking Unbreakable, Shyamalan comes closer to realizing the potential that his talent makes so evident. This is the closest he has yet come to a masterpiece. The premature Hitchcock comparisons are fitting in some ways, the director knows how to utilize mis-en-scene for maximum impact and he does a very good job with the suspense scenes( I was on the edge of my seat two times on the second viewing of the movie, and many more the first time). Shyamalan is not there yet, but perhaps given a few more films and a perfect script he is closer to being thought of as one of the greats. This is no complaint though, I enjoyed this movie more than I have most so called big budget movies getting similar critical praise. 4.5/5</fullReview>

The 'boo' frights were terrific and many of them made me jump out of my skin. The scares work best when they are psychological and silent, or all in your head. Just imagine what this family goes through, particularly in the brilliant finale. M Night Shyamalan puts you right in their shoes and doesn't let up with the terror until the very last frame.--Is "Signs" a horror movie? Yes. Is it a sci-fi movie? Yes. But when it all comes down to it, what is this movie genre-wise? This movie, to me at least, was all about the tale of this family, and the strife they're going through after losing someone close to them. The father is a priest who has lost all faith and the kids prefer their father's brother. "Signs" is about aliens, but it's about how the alien attack affects the family and makes them bring out the love and trust they all must have in each other to survive such a horrifying ordeal. This was shown amazingly in the wonderful and tragic final dinner scene.--Mel Gibson gives one of his finest performances to date. He is a tour-de-force as Graham Hess; he sold me completely in his role. The inner turmoil the character was experiencing was so brilliantly portrayed by Gibson, during quiet, lonely moments or through big, dramatic scenes such as the aforementioned final dinner scene. Joaquin Phoenix was very strong and always believable in his supporting performance as Graham's brother Merrill. The adorable Abigail Breslin and another one of the Culkin clan, Rory Culkin, are terrific rising stars with a lot of talent at such young ages.--M Night Shyamalan continues his run of terrific writing/directing efforts, he brings across the suspense of the situations in the film seamlessly, and injects a lot of emotion into the film. The strange and subtle camera movements and angles were also much appreciated. THE BAD:--I must warn that this section of my review has nothing more, nothing less than THE BIGGEST SPOILERS FOR "SIGNS". DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WISHED TO BE SPOILED! Like many others, I found the way the extra-terrestrials were defeated at the end of the film a little ludicrous and too convenient. This has all been said before - but why the goddamn hell would the aliens invade a planet that is 75% water and they're allergic to the stuff? END SPOILERS!RATING:9/10 - Another moving film experience from the one and only M Night Shyamalan, also his most terrifying motion picture to date.IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE I RECOMMEND:Poltergeist (8/10) The Ring (8/10) Scary Movie 3 (3/10) The Sixth Sense (9/10) Unbreakable (9/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What to say about a movie that changed my life? And to lean on Travolta's character from Swordfish - "I'm not some grungy wannabe filmmaker searching for existentialism through a haze of bong smoke or something." But realizing the message of this movie was profoundly enlightening! "Signs" is a most felicitous mixture of hidden symbols and meanings. It goes way past other such movies because mr. Shyamalan has the utmost sense of perfection in his editing, musical score, scenery, photography, dialogues and especially actors and actresses. His movies are constantly feeding the viewer, but not stuffing them, he knows very well when to let the viewer figure and realize things out for himself. As characteristic for both "The Sixth Sense" and "Unbreakable" he provides an amazing revelation at the very end, and it left me with goose bumps till the closing credits. When I put the puzzle together it was simply magical, as if the world was an enormous map, I just had to look around and read it. The execution was yet again flawless and faultless but I do think that the initial idea of signs should have been realized in a non alien manner, which would probably make it as timeless as "The Sixth Sense". But I do find it most entertaining and annoying when I read comments about the movie and see that half the people didn't even get it, they just didn't like the alien CG and get all mad because they think the movie sucked. Well, in my mind the aliens were so crudely made because they were not even the main part of the story, they just began turning the wheels of the movie. As for the message the movie gives, well, I guess it just isn't for everybody. Just for those of us who can read Signs. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie for the sci fi fan who also likes Mel Gibson! Dealing with crop circles, former priest (but still farmer) Gibson also deals with the recent loss of his wife and raising his two children.I didn't know what to expect from this film, I really didn't. I only paid half attention to it when the trailers advertised it in theaters and I gave it no thought at all when it came out on video. My significant other is a HUGE Mel Gibson fan, so I settled down to watch it the other night with her.When the movie opens up we find Gibson dealing with quitting the church, the loss of his life and his dogs going nuts out in the corn field. Although we never saw anything out of the ordinary (in the beginning), I found myself hoping that this was, like most of the other crop circle formations, that it was all a hoax. So much for that idea! When we finally did see what was going on, I was definitely on the edge of my seat the rest of the film! When Gibson's brother almost fell out of his chair, I was right there with him, holding my breath, waiting for the next thing to happen!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I dont know who came up with the ' bright idea' of advertising the movie as a ' extra-terrestrial' thriller but this is one movie that the big bosses at the studios in Hollywood could have advertised better. Independence Day kind of film.I beg to differ.It seems to me that the two most important things in life are FAITH and FAMILY and not in that order and this film explores them both beautifully.Faith is important in anything one does,in life ,in work,in god ,in the one you love,in your books ..and need I say about ones Family(sure we might not totally 'love' some of them).ONE THING YOU SHOULDNT DO:please dont take this movie at face value...that is dont expect a movie about aliens and please dont expect a lesson in science from the movie.what the films about?the film center around one family(meaning :no SUBPLOTS )whose head is A MINISTER (played brilliantly by Mel Gibson),he loses his wife in a horrible car accident and also as a result loses his trust and belief in god.His family includes his brother(Joaquin Phoenix...emperor in GLADIATOR),his daughter and son(two of the cutest kids you can hope to find) all characters portrayed with a great deal of emotion.The family is taken through a emotional roller coaster as a result of the crop circles and the notion of aliens invading the planet.THE most amazing part of the movie????In such a situation the entire family normally looks up to the head (in this case MEL GIBSON),instead they find that he is cracking under pressure and the thought that he could lose his entire family.the ENDING?some of the people I know didnt enjoy the ending too much as they felt it was too superficial and not too dramatic,again I beg to differ.I am not gonna give it away But if you are gonna watch the film,my advice purely is,do not take it as it comes,think about it.If the movie does not make you ask yourself some basic questions about god or faith ;then it does mean that the desired effect which shyamalan had hoped to bring through hasnt worked.As for the coincidences part,it is left to each one of us to take in our own way</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Not Like They Didn't Warn Us. This film is up there with Shyamalan's other masterpiece - ?The Sixth Sense'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan's ?Signs', is a brilliantly crafted movie, showing just why he is a successful director in Hollywood today. All of Shyamalan's movies have evoked a lot of discussion as to whether they are good or bad for the public that see them, with that decision up for you to decide. In this great thriller of 2002, something is not quite right in the world, signs that something might change our world for ever. Aliens have always been in our thoughts for many years now, but do they really exist?The Hess family live in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. One morning they wake to find a 500 foot crop circle in their backyard. Graham Hess and his family are told extra-terrestrials are responsible for the sign in their field. They watch, with growing dread, at the news of crop circles being found all over the world. Signs is the emotional story of one family on one farm as they encounter the terrifying last moments of life as the world is being invaded. Get ready for a close encounter of the scared kind...What do you immediately think of when you hear such phrases as ?crop circles', ?little green men' or ?beings from another planet'?. All of these could be construed as ?signs' that something is out there. That was the feeling I got from watching this film. ?Signs' was written, produced and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, who is brilliant at making one new movie experience after another. He puts all the pieces together quite deliberately, but so carefully at the same time, that I feel it is difficult not appreciate each movie experience we get with him. The film's story has many elements that make it great. Its emotion is so clear that you have to be affected by it, as does the tension, which is as thrilling as I have seen in a movie in a long time. The other clever tools used in this movie, include the way Shyamalan shows us these scary looking aliens, with the confrontations between Graham and the alien at the vet's house and between Merrill and the alien in the Hess living room, unforgettable to say the least. Furthermore, the use of news broadcasts is another clever device, which gives the movie even more tension, especially the broadcast showing a sighting at a children's birthday party. Shyamalan also created some great characters for the movie. Sure, there might not be many people in the film, but the people that you meet are quite remarkable. The main character in ?Signs' is Father Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), a priest that has lost his faith, for reasons that I will let the movie explain. For me, it seems ironic that the main character in the movie is a priest, as they, like all believers of God, are continuing to look for signs that show us why we believe in God in the first place. Graham even admits that these events ?might be the end of the world'. Gibson shows himself to be a character full of emotion, sorrow and anger. We discover that local vet, Ray Reddy (M. Night. Shyamalan), has caused a lot of the problems for the town's priest. Living with Graham are his two kids, Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin) and his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix). Morgan is smart kid, knowing a lot of the ideas surrounding ?other life-forms', while Bo is constantly paranoid by the drinking of water. In fact Bo is a character that shows signs are appearing that things are not quite right in the world. They all live on a corn and wheat farm where they have discovered the possibility of extra-terrestrials having visited them at their part of the earth.All these actors have to be commended for their performances, as they continue on the feeling that Shyamalan wanted us to feel, a very eerie, depressive and sometimes scary experience. The performances by Culkin and Breslin are truly great. Both show that they can handle themselves in a complex story, only enhancing what sort of movie that we have. Credit in this area also has to go to Shyamalan, as his choices for these roles were crucial to the final make-up of the movie. Also, the way this man can direct young actors is an outstanding talent that I hope continues.A lot of the film is very silent, another deliberate ploy by the director to set his audience up in different way. Roger Ebert said in his review of Signs - ?I cannot think of a movie where silence is scarier and inaction is more disturbing'. Many movies that we see, feel they need heaps of noise and action going on, but not here. The sounds (or lack of them), makes ?Signs' an even better movie experience. But the times that the movie does require noise, we get it through its powerful soundtrack, the perfect feeling. The score for ?Signs' was composed by John Newton Howard. I first watched ?Signs' with a friend who was quite adamant about his opinion of the movie. His words were ?I did not like ?Signs', it is a film that builds-up to nothing'. Now while my friend is entitled to his opinion, I have to say I disagree wholeheartedly with him about that. What he has described is essentially what ?Signs' is all about. The true revelation of the film for me is not only how it ends, but what it shows and what we experience through out. Shyamalan has made a film that only he could, because he can. In a time where Hollywood is quite predictable with its movie-making, along comes a guy that breaks all the rules, for all the right reasons. ?Signs' is a movie that I can only describe as ?one in a million', a film where its build-up is the pay off. For that strange reason, I am a big fan. CMRS gives ?Signs': 5 (Brilliant Film)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As close to Hitchcock as this generation of directors will get</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the current generation of directors relying on mindless plots and CGI to the hilt to make a statement, it's really refreshing to see a director unafraid of risk-taking.M. Night Shyamalan's "Signs" embodies everything that a movie-going experience should be about. The emotion that this director draws from his performers is incredible. He leaves you on the edge of your seat when it's all said and done.I've read several negative reviews through these comments, and I can understand. For the last 25 years we've been blasted with cheap, thrill-a-minute, high-budget action flicks that are all flash and no substance; and as such, we've been seasoned to believe that a good movie MUST have some sort of resolution at the end of it. The bad guy must die, the good guy must get the girl, so on and so forth. But Night refuses to get bitten by that bug.This is a psychological thriller, the kind that makes you want to gnaw on your fingernails for 105 minutes until you know the main characters are safe. The kind that makes you feel like even though you've only watched the movie for 45 minutes, you know the characters like they were your best friends..all the little quirks.I heard a rumor in the beginning, Touchstone didn't want Mel Gibson cast as the lead in this movie, that they wanted Bruce Willis. While Bruce Willis is a superb actor, I just don't believe he has the range of emotion that Mel Gibson displays in this film. Very strong performances from Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin make this movie shine.Whether or not this movie is about aliens is secondary; it's more about the triumph of the spirit over adversity. Shyamalan's choice of James Newton Howard to once again score one of his films proves to be a work of absolute genius, as his score sets the tone from the opening credits to the incredible climax of the film.I'm sure Hitchcock and Hermann are smiling devilishly at the advent of this young, fresh director, and thinking quietly to themselves "The MacGuffin lives"....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Improvement Over Unbreakable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Rating: ***1/4 out of ****. In 1999, M. Night Shyamalan made a movie called the Sixth Sense, In My Opinion it was a near-masterpiece. The Next Year, he made his follow up film Unbreakable, while the film was good it was also a bit of a disappointment. In 2002, Shyamalan has made Signs, it is a good movie, one of the best movies of the summer of 2002, but not quite as good as The Sixth Sense.The acting is pretty good. Mel Gibson is quite good here. Joaquin Phoenix delievers a great and funny performance. The two kids also deliver good performances. Shyamalan has a role in his movie, but he is actually the weak point in the acting. Signs is a well-written and well planned thriller. The movie jumped me a few times and gave me the creeps. The film also has a very good and effective Music Score. The only problem with this movie is the ending, I didnt figure it out but the thrills werent up as high as the endings of Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. But Signs remains entertaing and is a well-made film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new CLASSIC from a new MASTER...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading the negative comments on this movie confirm what I'd long believed: most people need to be spoon-fed their entertainment. It has to be black-and-white, spelled out right in front of them, or they just don't get it."Signs" is not a movie that spells it out for you. You have to use that most neglected of all human organs: The brain.But if you do divert a little energy to your gray matter, you are in for a fantastic emotional journey that's as engrossing and masterful as they come. Shyamalan deserves to be mentioned in the same sentences as Spielberg, Hitchcock, and Kubrick.I was enchanted, I was challenged, I was enlightened. I literally laughed, cried, and nearly wet my pants with fear.If you're looking for Independence Day, the X-Files, or War of the Worlds, (which many people clearly are) look somewhere else. This is not that type of film! But it *is* the most engaging, thoughtful, and purely frightening alien-genre movie since Close Encounters of the Third Kind.5 out of 5. 10 out of 10. Go see it. Bring your brain, and pay attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Signs (2002) Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin, Cherry Jones, M. Night Shyamalan, Patricia Kalember, D: M. Night Shyamalan.A widowed minister (Gibson) raises his two children with his former baseball-player brother (Phoenix) in the Pennsylvania farmlands while mourning his wife's tragic death. One morning, he wakes up to find huge mysterious crop circles in their cornfields, which puts the family into a fearful invasion. Director Shyamalan has a special gift for subtlety like Hitchcock, and approaches his storytelling with fear and anxiety. Not a special effects movie at all, which it easily could've been, but a drama about faith and miracles. The set piece of a cornfield is perfect for some real scary stuff just waiting to jump out at you (and with a evocative score by James Newton Howard). Running Time: 105 minutes and rated PG-13 for frightening moments.RATING: *** (out of ****)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a BRILLIANT movie with a bad ending...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M Night does quite a good job building suspense and a genuine fear in his audience. Perhaps he even over does it with the tension in Signs. The characters always are acting strangely, there is always something disturbing in every scene such that there are very few relaxing moments for you to breath again to contrast that tension. The problem is two things...first, the girl has a magical premonition and there is this whole "prophesy" thing going on which is NEVER done well in any movie let alone this one and second, the movie's central message is to have a certain amount of faith and believe in hope and humanity...but then they just have this goofy resolution to the alien invasion that fails to live up to the message.HOWEVER, the idea of showing a worldwide horror from the perspective of an individual family was absolutely BRILLIANT and truly terrifying in many ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Interesting Combination of Horror Movie And Faith Journey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much as he did in "The Sixth Sense," producer/director/writer M. Night Shyamalan offers us an appropriately eerie story - about an alien invasion of earth and the effect that it has on the principal character Graham Hess (Mel Gibson.) Gibson plays an ex-priest (I assume Episcopalian since he was married and had children) whose faith had been destroyed when his wife was killed in a car accident. One morning, he discovers crop circles in his field. More than that, he learns on TV that crop circles have been found all over the world. It turns out that aliens use them for navigational purposes, and that they are the prelude to an invasion.The opening and closing scenes of the story are, in my view, the weakest which hurts an otherwise excellent film. I felt we jumped too quickly into the whole crop circle angle without any real development of the story and without knowing anything about any of the characters. The end left me rather cold, and although it was predictable enough there was really nothing in the story that had suggested it should happen (I noted, for instance, that in the immediately preceding scene Hess had still refused to pray even after his son was saved.) Instead, he focused on the idea that "there are no coincidences." He came to believe in his personal spiritual journey that everything has a reason; everything is part of a plan. Words his wife (Patricia Kalember) had spoken while she was dying (and even, then, her death) had a relevance to the trial the family was undergoing in the present. His faith was shattered by a crisis (his wife's death) and ultimately it's restored by a crisis (the alien invasion.) The spiritual journey is an important motif to this movie, as you can see.The movie is frightening enough in places, although certainly not the scariest movie I've ever seen. I didn't care for Joaquin Phoenix as Graham's brother Merrill. Something about him didn't work in that role. The kids (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin) didn't really do anything for me, and there were also some inconsistencies in logic. (Potential spoiler here.) If water was so toxic to these aliens, it's a mystery to me why they would choose to conquer a planet that's covered in the stuff? Sure, they could choose to stay away from lakes and rivers and oceans, but what if it rained? That seemed strange and unexplained to me.Having mentioned those couple of negatives, though, I can say that I very much enjoyed the movie. I've had mixed reactions to Mel Gibson in the past. Some of his work I've really enjoyed; some I've thought was terrible. This one was near the top of the list as far as I'm concerned.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan Needs to Learn that He Just Can't Please Everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Final Score: 9.3 (out of 10)- Warning: Spoilers -The best movies are ones that feel genuine and tell a story personal to it's creator - as opposed to the thousands of hollow constructed Hollywood products. In one of it's multiple dichotomies, `Signs' successfully manages to be both. Shyamalan is clearly telling a story with beliefs close to his heart but he also uses traditional genera bits as sucker bait to rope in the masses and slipping his larger messages under the radar. His themes of faith, spirituality and saving one's soul are wrapped in a sci-fi horror movie with just enough familiarity to make the trailer and just enough real thrills to pull the audience to the edge of their seat. Those crowd-pleasing moments came as a huge surprise to me because Shyamalan (doing his Hitchcock impression more then ever here) is a director of who often confuses restraint for profundity. Both `The Sixth Sense' and `Unbreakable' ended just when it seemed to be revving up. I had those same fears that `Signs' would be a movie of all build-up and no pay-off. So, for me most of the joy was just how fully realized the movie becomes. Shyamalan takes the spring board of a movie about crop circles and really delivers - stretching it farther then I thought he had the guts to.In fusing the sci-fi popcorn flick with the spirituality angle Shyamalan has created a bi-polar movie that, I think, makes statements that are intelligent and thought-provoking and does more then he probably even intend it to. It presents us with a movie that affirms faith and collides it with aliens (whose existence would prove the bible completely wrong). It shows someone asking advice of a Reverend and then rejecting the answer when he tells the truth because it `wasn't what he wanted to here'. Under the surface it isn't quite as sugar-coated as it may seem at first glance. The movie poses these ideas and lets the audience interpret it. One a simplistic level the story is like `Independence Day' flipped on it's ear. Shyamalan sets the movie neck-deep in a place that Hollywood is usually frightened to go: flyover country. Shyamalan admits that where an alien invasion to occur most of us would not be in the White House strategizing or in the fighter jets bringing them down. We would probably be huddled in our homes waiting for it to pass; doing our own little part to merely survive. Sure the story is one that has been done (at one point Joaquin Phoenix says `It's like War of the World') but it's that down-to-Earth way the movie is executed that carves out `Signs' a spot among the pack. Shyamalan keeps the action out of the skies and the battlefields and keeps it almost entirely centered on the 4 members of the Hess family in their farm house. They often find themselves confined in cars and basements and everyday props such as baby monitors are twisted into creepy instruments of horror. His most effective tool is the TV: the Hess' link to the world outside. Shyamalan shows a socially conscious, almost satirical, attitude toward the media. He knows that nothing can spread fear quicker then media hysteria. It is in no time that that hysteria infects the home. In all the talk of having faith and the end of the world, I should not give the impression that the movie is something serious. I would go as far as to rank it as a very good, very slick B-movie. When we do see the aliens they look like the aliens from the `Oddworld' video games.Shyamalan jumps right into the story and builds the characters through their actions. Mel Gibson leads the cast. One could say that he is wooden and lifeless, but that would be denying that his character is numb due to the recent death of his wife and in a constant state of shock and bewilderment - appropriately real considering he is seeing comic book stories of alien invasion come to life before his eyes. Phoenix comes off the best as Merrill is the most elastic character in the cast. At times funny and at times the vulnerable little brother, Phoenix's reaction to a shocking piece of news footage while alone and crammed in a closet is absolutely priceless. Shyamalan sticks with his tradition of having the kids in the movies be somewhat disturbed and not do `cute kid' things - but that doesn't stop little Abagail Breslin from stealing most of the scenes. It's in those rare moments that we get outside of the family that we run into the film's biggest problem. No one in the supporting cast seems to be able to act and I will point the finger right at Cherry Jones as the town sheriff who barely seems to be remembering her lines. The military commander Merrill runs into is also creepy to the point of cartoonish absurdity. It is obvious in these moments Shyamalan is trying to populate the movie with memorable background characters (who all talk in goofy sing-songy fashion) the way that Steven Speilburg does. In many other technical aspects the movie overtly recalls Speilburg and Hitchcock to the point where it's hard to tell if the movie is an homage or that Shyamalan just doesn't know any other way to present this material. I would lean toward the latter. In typical Speilburg style, Shyamalan has his characters stare at something for a long time before showing us what they are looking at. One of these homages is evident in James Newton Howard's very Bernard Hermann score. The music in this flick knocked my socks off from the opening credits and Shyamalan knows how to use it. He starts out meticulously slow and builds the movie expertly to a sweat-soaked crescendo of a 3rd act.Shyamalan didn't impress me with the hockey and now overrated `The Sixth Sense'. `Unbreakable' proved he had an incredible visual eye but the movie still lacked at the scripting stage. Here, it all comes together and he seems more comfortable and more refined in his techniques then before. Still, Shyamalan needs to develop his own style instead of falling back on the masters if he ever wants to push beyond popcorn filmmaking into greatness. But that is a hind-sight observation that doesn't affect `Signs' as a freestanding product. As popcorn B-movies go, `Signs' is top-of-the-line, pure entertainment done in an good old fashioned style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Signs" is M. Night Shyamalan's most entertaining movie yet. It stars Mel Gibson (apparently Bruce Willis wasn't available) as an ex-revrend/farmer who is finding strange patterns mowed into his lawn. At first he thinks it's a prank, but they start appearing all over the world and soon he believes he and his family are in the middle of an alien invasion.Gibson plays his part very well, ranking up with "Braveheart" and "Conspiracy Theory" for great Gibson performances. Jaquin Phoenix plays Gibson's brother, and though his performance would be more comedic than dramatic, it was still very good. Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin play Gibson's kids, pretty well for a fourteen and eight year old."Signs", being a Shyamalan movie, was also very suspenseful. Especially the climax, in which the family is trapped inside their basement - and, well, I wont spoil anything else.Good sci-fi, great movie, 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very suspenseful, actually rather scary, always interesting and never boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are always people out there complaining about faults in good and entertaining movies, faults that they are so clever to pinpoint. Do not listen to them.Signs is actually almost a horror masterpiece. I'm not a Mel Gibson fanatic. For instance, I hated The Patriot with Gibson and I thought Shyamalan's previous movie Unbreakable was rather bad. On the other hand I loved The Sixth Sense from the same director. If you agree with me on those I'm sure you will agree that Signs is very good.Signs has many strong points, The story is captivating from the beginning, the pacing is high and there is not a boring moment in the entire movie. The acting is also very good. Last but not least: Signs is actually a scary movie and that is not very common.The weak points are few and minor: The unneccessary comic relief with the aluminium foil protection, the boy's a little to clever lines and perhaps a little too much sentimentality.Rating 9/10. According to the IMDb rating system of course.Finally a few words to all you fault-finders and joykillers out there:SPOILER WARNINGYou think you are so clever. But with sarcastic summarys like "They forgot their raincoates" and remarks about the effect of water you show that you are actually not very clever at all, not understanding that you are giving away important parts of the plot and thus ruining the movie experience for others.One reviwer for instance makes a big deal out of the fact that it is not likely that aliens, who are intelligent enough to travel to earth, would need crop signs as guidance. Of course not. Our cities are not hard to find, glowing like giant lightbulbs, sending out lots of heat and signals etc. And of course the aliens would have some coordinate system to find their way without crop signs. But how do you know the purpose of the crop signs? I don't know. All I know is that I heard a theory in the movie that it was for coordination. But did an alien explain the purpose of the crop signs? No, thought not. Maybe you are not that clever after all? Maybe the real purpose of the crop signs have to do with the aliens culture, maybe it is their warpaintings? Or maybe it is psychological warfare? Who knows?The same reviewer thought the ending was far fetched. But like Gibson said in the movie; there are two types of people. You are free to believe the ending was an act of god or that it was coincidence and only act of man. I thought the ending was very clever and I'm sure it is a lot more clever than something you can come up with.Last: Is it so hard to think that an alien species who has never had any contact with water could be surprised of the effect of water on themselves?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just wanted to say this is by far the best alienish movie I have seen in a very long time. I own it on DVD but when it was in theaters I saw it about 4 times. Two of the times I saw it in Digital Projection. It was really cool. It's a basic M. Night movie except for Unbreakable. It made you jump a few times, but made you wonder as well. Of course he threw in a little comedy for some relief. It didn't have to much in CGI or really good special effects but when you see the end it's really cool to see the Alien. I would say if you haven't seen this movie yet, it should be high on you list. I think everyone just about enjoys this movie. It's spectacular in the writing, directing, and camera movements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the most disappointing film I've seen since Mission to Mars (2000).Just like M2M, Signs had a few pretty good actors and a proved director (Brian DePalma also directed the Untouchables). Both were films riddled with plot holes that finished with cheesy endings and were supposed to have some sort of "deeper meaning." And by the end of both films, I was glad I had only spent less than $5 each on renting them.Signs had all sorts of problems - so many that I won't list all but one - the biggest problem of them all. But this is a major spoiler, so stop here if you don't want to be spoiled.BEGIN SPOILER AND PLOT HOLEWater is poisonous to the aliens. So why would they invade Earth (which is at least 2/3 made of water), run around in crop circles (plants on Earth are full of water), and harvest humans for their meals (humans are at least 3/4 made of water). Duh.END SPOILERThat pretty much sums it up for me. It's this kind of attention to detail that makes this film deserve just 1 star out of 10. It's better than Teenagers from Outer Space, but not by much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Not What You Think It Is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading the mixed reviews and hearing comments from family and friends about this movie, I decided to save my money, and see the movie on whichever premium movie channel bought first rights. After all, it's hard for a director to top a movie like Shyamalan's *The Sixth Sense*, and I hate being disappointed in a movie I paid extra money to see. But I think those folk were expecting either a horror movie or an apocolyptic movie (neither of which interest me in any event), and were disappointed. Too bad for them. All the better for me, because I went into this without any expectations.And having a lack of expectations can pay off in amazing ways. First, for me, as a lover of deeply textured suspense films, such as Hitchcock's, it is pure delight to see a director make such playful reference to some of the great suspense films, as well as a few of the so-bad-they've-become-myth types (there's even a rather amusing moment of *Blair Witch* thrown in). And all the while unravelling a fascinating symbolic portrait of a man coming to terms with his faith and his grief.And make no mistake, this movie is an unravelling. It is not one of those movies that ties everything up in a neat little bow. You actually are left wanting more, but in a good way, like after reading a good novel that gets your imagination fired up about what might've happened next to each character. What you do get will keep you talking with your movie-loving friends for years to come. Some of the reviewers will try to tell you that it falls back on pop spirituality, but I think in 25 years, those reviewers will find themselves feeling pretty silly. As a very spiritual person, I was moved profoundly by the movie's spirituality. (I venture that any of the reviewers who panned the movie - Village Voice take note - will find themselves feeling pretty silly in 25 years.)What these unenlightened reviewers are confusing for pop spirituality is actually fundamental spirituality, that of the home as the symbol of the psyche. And Shyamalan is proving deft at using homes to such strong psychological effect. That is a trait this movie shares with *The Sixth Sense*, both of which take place throughout the physical and psychic home. And, in my opinion, all the great suspense thrillers ultimately involved the home as the symbol of the psyche, from Hitch to Romero to Stephen King. A more recent (and well-done) entry to the oeuvre is *The Others*. Even the good rip-offs had the sense to recognize this fundamental essence of human nature, hence we have *Nightmare on Elm Street* and *Poltergeist.* But this is not another *Sixth Sense*, so don't expect that. But who wants that anyway? That movie rejuvenated a genre that had all but died, and in a way so clever that few will be able to ever top it. It stands on its own. This movie follows in that genre very nicely, however, and, like *The Sixth Sense* will leave you quietly affected for hours or even days. It has a few dialogue and pacing issues and at least one throw-away scene, but, on balance, it has some amazing cinematography, and from the moment you hear the opening strains of the James Newton Howard score (which is also an homage to Hitch), uses sound (or, sometimes, lack thereof) to brilliant effect. Even its occasional comic touches are well-placed, like the comic relief in one of Shakespeare's tragedies. And I will leave my comments there because this is not a movie one can review in a straightforward way, or in a way that would avoid spoilers. The whole movie is potentially spoiled when too many plot points are revealed, because like a dream (or a nightmare), everyone will interpret the symbols of this story in a way that makes the most sense for them in their own lives. That, to me, is its ultimate brilliance.Let me just say that I am inclined to agree with Roger Ebert's four-star review, which was written in a way that allows each viewer to discover the delight and/or discomfort of the movie for him or herself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry to say but I see only the young talent wasted here. "Unbreakable" left me thinking that Shyamalan used the same formula known from his intense and amazing "The Sixth Sense" but,despite that, had some good scenes (like Bruce touching people and getting to know their deeds)."The Signs" recreates the same intimate atmosphere but all the elements that S. skillfully uses to create the suspence vanish when we reach to the idiotic finale.It was like the massive orchestra with the skillful conductor after building the theme suddenly started to play Britney Spears song. All those delicate elements, development of the plot WASTED!!!!!!!!!!! I wanted to scream in the cinema (not necessarily because I was scared) and certainly I moaned when all turned out to be horrible a rip-off from a class-B horror from the 50's. It was so idiotic that I was hardly able to believe what I saw. Expecting to get to know that there were no aliens (the form of the film and the "abilities" of aliens seemed to reinforce my opinion)I saw Mr. Phoenix hitting the alien (who looked like a total cliche)with a bat!!!!! All the magic vanished -only disgust remained. It's one of those movies in which the ending is paramount and decides about the quality and coherence of the film. Here we have - an intelligent suspence thriller preparing the viewers for horrible catastrophe that is the finale. That is why for me it's only 1 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Got Faith?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*Mel Gibson has a farm, two dogs, two kids and some funky alien crop circles. Gibson doesn't know what to make of it. Soon it becomes apparent that aliens are checking out the Earth. Why? What does it all mean? Can you see the signs for what they are or are you a heathen non-believer? Ever since his wife died, Gibson has lost his faith in God. Perhaps an alien invasion can help him get it back.The most amazing thing about "Signs" is how tightly directed it is. There is nothing spontaneous about this flick. Every scene is directed by a guy who knew exactly what he wanted to see. Everything must have been planned a long time beforehand: Where he wanted the camera, what he wanted the actors to do and say, the facial expression they should portray and how long they should keep it. Everything was exactly where it should be. This is definitely Shyamalan's film. Every other person involved in this flick was there to do his bidding. He deserves the praise or the blame.Which to give him? "Signs" is a very well made, suspenseful flick. Top notch direction. I praise him for that. But "Signs" begs a lot of questions. Is the movie saying that every little thing that happens to us is a sign? Does God always have benevolent designs for us? Do people die so that others may live through an alien invasion? "Signs" is making a loud argument for faith in God. It's an old tale in which we are supposed to draw comfort from our sorrow because God let it happen and knows what's best for us. Everything happened "for a reason". Have faith in God because He is watching over you and throwing signs in your face. Are you paying attention or are you a deaf, dumb and blind heathen? Got Faith?More questions than answers or just a simple alien invasion flick? I suppose you could take it either way. Overall, I enjoyed it. I just don't know if I can believe in the message of "Signs". It's preaching in its own low tech, sci-fi way. I believe in God but I don't think every little thing that happens to me is a sign from above or even meant to be a part in God's cosmic plan. When I stub my toe, God isn't telling me to watch out for a wall six months down the road. Sometimes we humans do stupid things. I'm sure God's got a handle on the big picture and leaves the details to us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This guy is the most over-rated director around. The film is nothing special, it could have just been a 30 minutes tv film. There is no story really, just one plot and some attempt to create characters, but it's too superficial. Nothing to compare to any other film of the same kind. A copy of many other pictures, in the features he mention to have been inspired by three very famous classics but I don't think so, I guess he has copied something else. Is an amateur movie. Any film student could have done it better, but the question is: who made this guy an A-list director? This is (if it didn't have Mel Gibson and Joaquim Phoenix in it) nothing more that a b-movie or direct to video. Roger Corman himself I don't think would have produced it the way it was. The script needed a revision, rewriting, the dialogues are silly and predictable, the sub-story is silly. And on top of that the director shouldn't try acting. He is patetique, to begin with is not even cast right. He doesn't match with the film, that goes for any of the ones he made.Also, a movie like this does not really cost that much money to make. Very little set (you don't need to build a house for that or grow a field of corn), very few scenes (with good actors you can film the whole in a week), as for the special effects, why making a CG character when a man with a costume would have been enough? &gt;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Close to the magic of old b/w sci-fi movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie I enjoyed a lot. For a long time, we've missed the style of b/w sci-fi classic oldies, where claustrophobia, suspense, and thrilling sightings were basic ingredients. Signs recovers all this stuff. It's a new movie which recovers the classic magic of the oldies.It also provides an "update" to the genre: The characters watch the TV-news 24hrs/day, just like all of us did when recent terrorist and/or war acts happened. In fact, one of the brightest moments in the movie is indeed a TV news flash showing a home video.The plot has a strong structure. If you watch the movie several times, you'll realize all scenes come at the right time. Every scene is necessary (except for some too much scary moments, maybe).On the other hand, Signs has three things I didn't like:First of all, crop circles seem unnecessary in the movie. They're not really exploited in the plot (except for the title, maybe). I believe the movie would have been a lot better if it was based in, for example, mysterious UFO photographs rather than crop circles.Second, I think it's too scary in some moments, more than needed. I really loved the many thrilling sightings, but... most of them come after very frightening scenes, and it seems there's no need to scare the audience so much. You can show the same things and at the same time be suitable for a broader audience. It's not incompatible.Third, I believe the F/X art direction was not adequate. Technically it was very good, but the art/concept was not (ie: the things you see in the F/X lack the sci-fi atmosphere you'd expect, although they're technically very well done). This doesn't affect non-FX art direction: I believe art direction is satisfactory in non-FX scenes.Despite these three things, I really loved the movie. It's a movie I can watch again and again without getting bored. Is so exciting to re-discover the classic sci-fi magic!!I voted it as 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent acting, interesting plot, a good amount of suspense, a little bit of humor, and for an added bonus....it drives atheists nuts! Plenty of people who lack a belief in God have trashed this film because it causes the viewer to consider what they think about faith. I find their reaction to this theme rather sad. I think that the fact that the film makes a statement about faith and asks you to decide where you stand on it is one of its strong points.The film basically has four main characters, a family which comes under an extreme amount of stress during an alien invasion. The acting and chemistry between them was top notch. I was especially impressed by the children. The supporting cast was also very good. I though that the use of the television news reports to advance the plot made the story seem real and made it very interesting. When you consider all of the reporting that went into covering the military campaign in Iraq you have to wonder how the news media would cover an alien invasion.Note in defense of the aliens:You will enjoy this film more if you are capable of remembering it is a film and not a representation of what an alien invasion would be like. You will enjoy it if you accept the aliens the way that they are instead of holding them up to your preconceived notions of what a good invader should be like. They are what they are in order to contribute to the main plot -- no spoiler.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always read the IMDb's reviews because I've found them interesting and helpful when it comes to pick a movie to rent. But I've never posted a comment until now, since I feel I must say something in defense of this genuine gem.*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS *** What is it with moviegoers that the minute they hear the word `Aliens' they immediately expect to see something like `Invasion of the Body Snatchers', `Alien', or `Independence Day' if you're the Bad Aliens type, or `E.T', &amp; `The Abyss' if you like good aliens, or even `Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and `Contact' if you like the whole intrigue and suspense about finally contacting intelligent extraterrestrial life? People, please, this movie isn't about aliens. They're totally incidental to the story. It could have been the hysteria about the cold war and the fear of a TWW, or a plague that would kill mankind. Whatever the case, the point of the story it's how an average farmer's family react to these situations, and how a retired reverend finds his faith again, simple as that. M Night went with Aliens just to give an original twist to the story, which by the way, you got to admit it was pretty shrewd. I've always thought that `Sixth Sense' would have had a greater impact on viewers, if the ghost factor hadn't been known until it was told in the story. Think about it, the movie could have pass as a schizophrenic story, up to the moment when the secret of the kid was revealed. Unfortunately, the title of the movie reveals a lot, and the very same thing happened with `Signs'. Everybody were expecting a `Bad aliens' or a `Good Aliens' or a `Contacting the Aliens' movie, but it turned out to be a more depth, smart and human story than your average alien film. If you didn't like the movie, see it again trying not to find answers to questions like how is it possible that the aliens didn't use their advanced technology?, or how they didn't notice they were invading a planet constituted 75% on water?. See the movie as it is, and don't look for alien signs, look for the divine ones, and that's it.</fullReview>

It seems to do it's best to be "trendy" and "modern" while at the same time totally failing to be anything origional let alone groundbreaking.The one good moment in this film is where you catch first glimpse of one of the aliens walking past an alley. The low points are during the "blair witch" scene in the basement, and the "day of the triffids" ending. The aliens themselves are not remotely believable. Not due to special effects, but due to their incredible stupidity and their lack of both judgement and planning. Not even George Bush Junior could mess up that bad, and this is meant to be an advanced race. I could list all the floors, but I'm sure others have done that already.

		<fullReview>WARNING: SPOILERS THROUGHOUTAn ambitious attempt to rework the traditional scifi theme of alien invasion into something more cerebral comes a cropper amidst the crop circles of a movie as over stylised as it is over wrought. The plot, centering upon a man of God who has lost his faith and must now regain it on a long night's journey of the soul, isn't new: Hollywood has essayed it in every imaginable genre, whilst Spielberg was at his eloquent best in the examinations of faith and obsession that underpinned ?Close Encounters'.?Signs' is in similar territory, and has an equally talented creative force behind it in the person of M. Night Shyamalan, the conjurer whose ?Sixth Sense' remains one of cinema's finest party pieces: daring in its contrivance, accomplished in its execution. After that though, ?Unbreakable' broke into a million pieces of disbelief, and now ?Signs' fails in every area where ?Sixth Sense' so brilliantly triumphed.Artifice and contrivance, so cunningly masked in ?Sixth Sense', are here all too embarrassingly obvious, helped in no way by the script's blatant defensiveness ?Gibson's remark about aliens unable to get out from behind pantry doors reeks less of humor as a narrative awareness that somehow, in some way, this script has to be rescued, and fast. The line is used to shore up the absurd proposition that a family living next to an alien landing site will therefore decide to remain in their house / basement rather than head for the hills ? or, in this case, the safety of water, an element apparently injurious to aliens yet the presence of which upon our Earth is so visible as to make it appear blue from outer space. But perhaps in addition to a propensity for incarceration in cupboards, these aliens are myopic as well.In a role which requires him to be more alienated than any alien, Gibson displays a gamut of emotions that span the gap from A to B but leave the remainder of the alphabet untouched. This is not entirely his fault, as under-playing is here a case of permanent diminuendo: the central characters verge on near total eclipse from the very first scene, and do nothing to light up the screen thereafter. Embarrassment for all concerned turns to excruciation in the revelatory sequence explaining why Gibson has lost his faith: the dying wife scene mixes implausibility with risibility in so inept a fashion it's astonishing it was never left behind in the editing suite.Devoid of the visual flourishes that hallmarked ?Sixth Sense', and saddled with characters amongst the most unsympathetic ever to have been menaced by anyone/anything ? ye Gods, they even leave their pet dog outside to be eaten by aliens, and then never remark on it --`Signs' is 100% clunker from beginning to end. That it comes from a 100% unique talent is all the more tragic. Mr Shyamalan has already shown himself to be one of the cinema's finest illusionists; here's hoping he can rid himself of the compunction to embrace ?big themes' (and a tonnage of sentiment) and get back to what he obviously does best: technical tour de forces of brilliant misdirection. Hitchcock's crown still awaits. . . Rating: 2/10. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I get into movies. I love the stories that suck you in and keep you in until the end. I felt completely taken in by this movie. I even turned off the laptop to watch it. I thought it was one of Gibson's best and have a new respect for Phoenix. Nice to see there is at least one of the Caulkin kids who can act. The little girl of the movie (Bo) is also endearing. I enjoyed that all of the details came together in the end without being too obvious, imho. I have talked to many people who didn't like this movie at all, but I was literally on the edge of my seat. I was right a long with Pheonix, with his reactions to what he was seeing. Many of those I've talked to didn't like it because he was in it, and they aren't able to get past the character he played in Gladiator. I was impressed that he was able to give a completely different performance. I loved this one. Obviously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen SIGNS last night and taking a look at what all the others think about it, I'm so surprised that I need to say in some words why this is, for me, a very very bad movie. The visual look of Signs is O.K., beautifully shot and good acting........BUT, the story ladies and gentleman! The earth is taken by aliens and they are not very friendly. The American way of scaring people: unknown intruders can be very dangerous..... I wondered the whole time through 'where' this story was going to, what is the "shocking turnaroud" as I've read everywhere. Oooooh, that everything is pre-programmed and co?ncidence does not exist, so GOD exists.......Pfffffft. It's an interesting point to make a movie about but please please not with a sci-fi story like this. Sorry for the vagueness of this commentary, i'm not native English speaken but wanted to warn you for this movie. If you wanna see a good movie about time, destiny, co?ncidence and the impossibility of changing (chasing) time, watch DONNIE DARKO......10/10and a debut-film !!!

		<fullReview>I found this movie to be suspenseful and creative. You don't see too many movies that have the world going to end by an attack by aliens and the Americans not doing any thing about it. They should have called up Will Smith to go jump in a space ship and blow the mother ship up. That seems realistic enough. That was the best when they had some country, other than the U.S figure out a way of killing the aliens. I also thought it was a good idea not to show the aliens that much. (This isn't an action/horror movie!) We don't need to see all the guts and blood of the aliens, if they show too much of them it takes away the suspense of the whole movie, and wondering if they are actually for real or a big Hoax. And another thing is the aliens were not all that impressive in the first place; I don't think you needed to see much more of them. At least you know where they spent their budget on (Mel Gibson), and not on special effects. Over all I rate this movie an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this movie last night and watched it for the first time. (I know it came out a while ago, but oh well.)Anyway, I thought this was a great film. It wasn't a full-fledged sci-fi movie which was good. It had it's great parts, and freaky ones too. Those ET's really freaked me out when they were breaking into the house. Also, the coolest part about this movie is that I am from BUCKS COUNTY, PA. I live in Southampton, which is a township in Bucks County, and I was over in Newtown where they were filming parts of the movie. I think they picked Bucks County because M. Night Shyamalan was either from here or had relatives or something. But if you havn't seen this movie yet, i would definitely recomend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies of all-time! What you don't understand about this movie is that this movie is not about aliens! It is about faith! For example... Merill Hess always thought it was wrong not to swing that bat and Bo was able to see things into the future like her mother and Morgan had asthma. At the end they all connect! Merill's purpose was to swing that bat so he could kill the alien! Bo had dreamt all this and Morgan was supposed to have asthma so he wouldn't breathe the poison! Graham's faith was being tested so at the end of the movie he saw everything. His wife dying was meant to be! That is what the signs where, not he crop circles! The alien part was just to move the story along. M. Night Shyamalan is a great storyteller! This is not a bad script, no bad acting, and also who cares about the special effects! They didn't look that bad! This movie has chills, laughter, and emotion! GREAT FILMMAKING!</fullReview>

A former reverend who lost his faith in god after his wife died in an accident, lives in a small house beside a corn field, with his son, daughter and brother. Meanwhile, something strange is happening in the world around them. something makes crop circles at their field. something makes noises at night. are they aliens? are they lionel and the wolfington brothers? is this going to make sense in the end? An absolutley brilliant film, directed with marvelous style and confidence, with fantastic cinematography, amazing and powerful Hitchckocian score (The climax is breathtaking), great acting by all.

		<shortDescription>Excellent spiritual brother to "Independence Day"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan's films always impress me and have gotten better as time goes on. "The Sixth Sense" was good, but relied heavily on the ending to raise it above the normal supernatural thriller. "Unbreakable" was superb with an ending that justifies the events of the movie. "Signs" follows this trend, this time using space aliens and UFOs as the vehicle to deliver the film's message.*Some spoilers below*As with all Shyamalan's films, in order to accept the film the audience must accept the world view (typically a supernatural theme in a real world environment) that the narrative is putting across. Don't believe in ghosts? "The Sixth Sense" was probably a waste of time for you. Think comic books are stupid? "Unbreakable" probably won't rock your world. If you can't accept the concept of aliens arriving on Earth and making crop circles, then you probably won't enjoy "Signs"."Signs" really reminded me of "Independence Day", shrunk to the personal level. For the ordinary man, taking on the alien hordes in a Raptor while building a computer virus on an Apple computer is inconceivable. Hiding in your basement isn't. The Hess family react in an understandable fashion when confronted with the unknown - they hide in their house. Everything is kept on the small and personal level, which makes the audience become so much more involved. Forget saving the world - Mel Gibson's character is just trying to save his family."Signs" also contains an atmosphere of creepy tension that is uncommon and hugely effective. Shyamalan obeys the golden rule of creature suspense - don't let the audience see the creature until the last moment. The unknown is much more fear-inducing than anything that CGI can cook up, with "Signs"' use of the unknown and half-seen being among the best I have seen on film. Revealing the alien at the end is a bit of a let down, but does give the film it's climax.At it's heart "Signs" does contain a message about faith that is delivered in a reasonably un-preachy way. I hate having feel-good messages rammed down my throat, but "Signs" doesn't do that; the faith message is important to the characters' motivations in the film rather than a message for all of us to live by. The audience can take away what it wants.As can be seen by other comments, "Signs" has a lot of detractors. Personally it was great to see an alien film where the US doesn't have all the answers and kicks the aliens off the planet just in time for the romantic leads to get together. Imagine - a film where some other country other than the US finds a way to repel the aliens first.In regards to what the aliens can and can't do, or what they should or shouldn't have thought - we don't know. That's a huge part of the film - the aliens remain alien, unknown and inhuman. Who knows why they did what they did or what they could do?"Signs" is a worthy film to the Shyamalan film catalogue - I can't wait to see what his next release is, supernatural thriller or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie was really great. I couldn't help but think of Hitchcock movies when I first saw it. The way the camera moves and sustains long, steady, unmoving shots really creates suspense that can't be matched with computer generated aliens. Hitchcock was the master of this type of suspense, and Shamylan can't quite be compared with Hitchcock, but their styles are similar, and I think that's refreshing. (The cameos that Hitchcock was famous for are even being reincarnated by Shamylan.) Instead of trying to scare us with gore and disturbing images, we have to deal with constant tension and fear of the unknown. Shamylan lets us use our imaginations, which is scarier than throwing aliens in our faces and showing us what we are supposed to be scared of. Other than just being suspenseful, the humor that is intertwined to lighten the mood really makes it enjoyable. The cursing scene and the comment about the female Scandinavian Olympian were especially amusing. But even more than the suspense and humor, the deeper questions that the story bring up really make the movie great. Good movies are meant to entertain you, but great movies make you think, and this movie made me think. The whole "is it possible that there are no coincidences" got my mind going. Contrary to what other people have been saying in their comments, I think M. Night Shamylan is a promising director who has a fulfilling career ahead of him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>M. Night Shamalon has given us the Sixth Sense, and then followed that up with Unbreakable. And now he presents us with this entertaining thriller about possible UFO's finally comming to Earth. Mel Gibson plays the father of a small family living on a farm. he wakes one morning to find there are crops flatened into geometrical designs. The crop circles seem too perfect for humans to create. But after these unique circles begin to show up all over the world, the family is almost convinced there may be another form of life coming for them, and the rest of the world. Boasting smart suspense, chilling moments, and ocasional humor Signs turns out to be a first to second class thriller that is quite provocative. One of the only flaws here is that the viewer may experience confusion during the main thick, plotty moments. Otherwise people will find this a fun two hours or so. 7.7/10</fullReview>

I loved out the build up to the alien arrival was played out, how we saw all the coincidences coming together at the end of the movie, and the general feeling you got from the movie knowing there was little hope.There were however 2 things that I didn't like very much. I didn't like how the Aliens looked, they looked like cheap computer graphics and didn't scare me in the least bit. They came down with a wrath and basically got bitched out by a young teenager and his bat. One more fault I didn't like was the excuse of why the aliens ran away. "Using Mid-Eastern rituals" doesn't really cut it very much and it seems like it was very rushed. I don't blame them though because instead of having a couple aliens invade earth, they had millions of aliens invade and it would have been both stupid and impossible for the main cast to defeat them.Anyway, it was a good movie and I give it a solid B or B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy, but way too coincidence-based--and with a hidden agenda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSFirst of all, Shyamalan shows that he still knows how to set up and shoot skin-crawlingly creepy set pieces. The best ones are reminiscent of early John Carpenter, and that's pretty good. The script borrows liberally from H. P. Lovecraft, 'Night of the Living Dead,' 'The Exorcist,' and '50s-era alien paranoia movies, but you could have worse inspiration than that. The performances are uniformly fine, and if you don't think about it too much, you might enjoy the movie purely for its harmonious aesthetic elements--its assured camera-work, stylish art direction, wry script, etc.Unfortunately, if you do give the movie more than 30 seconds' thought after the credits roll, it'll pretty much fall apart. The ending, not unlike that of 'Unbreakable,' depends on the audience swallowing some truly ludicrous coincidences, and leaves us with about seventeen unanswered questions. What did the aliens want in the first place? Why do they leave so suddenly? Where do they go? If they can be destroyed by water, why on earth do they want to invade a planet where it falls from the sky every half hour? Did Joaquin Phoenix really require such an involved backstory just to set up his beating the crap out of the alien with a baseball bat? And how the hell did Mel Gibson's dying wife know about it all?Well, that's the big question, of course. At one point, Gibson's fallen preacher tells his brother that there's no such thing as coincidence, and, yes, Virginia, there really is a cornball, miracles-are-REAL! message hidden none-too-subtly here. Well, I hate to break this to Mr. Shyamalan, but 'Miracles are REAL!' is a very convenient, very lazy way to rationalize away all those coincidences, and inserting a pretentious speech about coincidence-vs.-divine-design doesn't change that fact; no sir, not one bit.In the end, your enjoyment of this film will depend on how much you're willing to suspend disbelief, and how well you stomach the idea that God would use an alien invasion as a tool to restore one preacher's faith. Doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. 5.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps it's because "Taken" presented an alien-theme story that kept you on the edge of your seat for most of 20 hours that this film seemed so staggeringly slow and tedious. "Taken" didn't drown in so many cliches, either. This was "Night of the Living Dead" meets "Field of Dreams."The story had nothing unique or particularly interesting about it, and I didn't feel the actors were ever in character, not even the kids. I never felt they were uneasy or scared, and thus, neither was I. After about 35 endless minutes, I watched most of the movie at double speed with subtitles, didn't miss a thing, and even then, it seemed slow. I think the day is over when anyone can be spooked by someone taking 5 minutes to walk down a corridor with thumping sounds off screen. Can this have been made by the same director as "The Sixth Sense"? It doesn't seem possible. The deleted scenes on the DVD were more interesting than the film itself and they added needed character background. I can't believe they were cut for time when the movie had so many scenes that contained endless minutes of nothing. Others have mentioned the plot holes, and I totally agree. The entire concept of a race which can be destroyed by water coming to earth is plain silly. And why, when the TV reports that people in other areas have found "ancient" ways of defeating the aliens, do they not report what that method is? "I'mmmm melllltinnnggggg..."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>with a title like 'Signs' and provocative trailer, we easily can dub this new film feature of M. Night Shyamalan, as an edge-of-your-seat-thriller. Well, it's a gripping thriller certainly, but just was not as we used to think of.Set in a rural area of Buck County, Pennsylvania, U.S., 'Signs' tells us about Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) that find a mysterious appearance of a five-hundred-foot design of circles and lines carved into his family's crops. His children, Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin) thinks it was an alien works. Evidently, Graham doesn't consider it. He easily thinks it's a prank from the locales. The only person that aware about what happening is his younger sibling, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix). However, when the crops around the globe showing the same phenomena, his faith is being tested once again and when the fate of his family as the stake, he must reveal what lies beneath the Signs.Sometimes, we have a certain difficulty whether we have watched a good or bad movie. The same wonder struck me when the first time I watched 'Signs'. I felt deceived by the trailer and promos (I even have an interactive CD-ROM). I thought I would encounter that another Hollywood summer blockbuster, but I was wrong, because it seems I have watched a lame and boring little thriller whatsoever. Moreover, because I was not satisfying enough, than I decide to give it a second chance. From my second encounter, than I realized what 'Signs' is really about. 'Signs' is about a man's journey of faith, presented in an enchanting suspense-drama. Mr. Shayamalan succeeds to build the tension that it needs. It is raising our emotion from the low to the high by step by step, until on the climax our emotion erupts to the expectation. The drama penned by Mr. Shyamalan given beautiful and moving touch. The suspense is very griping. The performance of Mel Gibson, Rory Culkin and even Abigail Breslin are superb and giving a huge contribution to the film's structure. Only Joaquin Phoenix hardly serve his role decently, because it seems he play it with an over acting way. Overall, 'Signs' is a beautiful drama portraying an ordinary people in an extraordinary situation. 'Signs' is a what-if, so don't bother to push your logical sense on it and you will get an enjoyable cinematic adventure.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are lots of good reasons why you should watch Signs. The main one being that it is a bloody good and entertaining movie that always has you on the edge of the seat without showing loads of gore and guts. As usual it's what you dont see that makes this movie scary. I love the parts where we see the family watching the News and the progress of the alien invasion. This adds to the tension and quite cleverly tells the story of what is happening outside the house. The acting is not brilliant and Mel Gibson struggles to decide if he is going put on a serious face or a comical face. Sometimes in movies he plays his parts as if he is always in a Leathal Weapon film. But all in all this is a very good film. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Note- reading this before seeing the film could take away from your viewing pleasure! One day the tortoise and the hair prepared themselves for a race. Knowing he had the advantage over the tortoise and sure of his ability to win, the hair flew right by the tortoise leaving him to choke on the dust. Realizing his lengthy lead in time, the hair sat down for a quick nap. Upon returning to humanity from his state of slumber the hair noticed that the tortoise was about to defeat him and ruin his pride. With all his might the hair charged for the finish line with all his strength but his speed was not able to overcome the tortoise's brawn. The moral of the story is `slow and steady wins the race.' Director M Night Shyamalan must have been paying close attention in kindergarten because he makes prolific use of this moral. The hair represents Modern horror films. They try to squeeze too much out of to little. The possibility of victory is present, but the follow-through is rarely executed. Everything seems to be crammed into the first half an hour (if that) and then everything is put on snooze. When finally waking up, the story must charge full-speed-ahead to catch up with itself because closing. Rarely does this happen resulting in contrived endings and illogical situations. Then, from the heavens, a savoir was sent to thwart the sins of these painful horror flicks and make a film that a tortoise could be proud of. A film that is just as edgy as it smart. That man was M. Night Shyamalan and that film was The Sixth Sense. The film moved at the pace of a tortoise (maybe slower) and because of this allowed for strong characterization, deep thinking and to be dramatic as hell. It turned out to be a huge summer hit that thrilled and baffled audiences alike. Not since Psycho was a film so respected that the ending was not given away. Working with the theory of `if it isn't broke don't fix it', Shyamalan returned with Unbreakable. Maybe the film was a disappointment because of the high standards placed upon it from The Sixth Sense, or maybe because it seemed to be nothing more than a retread through old water. Either way Shyamalan tried so hard to make a film that would live up to The Sixth Sense he failed. Now Shyamalan is not a stupid man. He saw a change in the cards for his next feature, Signs. To make another Sixth Sense would have been a bad career move; some maybe even expected that to happen. So he decided to take on an entirely different angle in the storytelling department without sacrificing any of his trademark style. This is the simple story, of a simple man, with a simple life who receives a complex lesson. Graham is an ex-reverend who lives on a quiet piece of farmland with his two unique children and his ex-baseball-playing brother. Graham had a lapse in faith when his wife was killed and now he can't understand why God would do such a thing to him. He bears her burden everyday of his life, often calling out to her in his sleep to receive only silence. `She doesn't answer?' Asks his daughter. But this once simple man is given a rude awakening when unexplainable occurrences start happening around town. Events that see huge circles appear in corn fields, sees mysterious strangers exhibit unusual behaviour around town, sees once peaceful pets turn ravenous in the blink of an eye and sees the world go into a mass media frenzy when these crop circles and unexplained lights start showing up all over the planet. Everything then comes down to, not a war or worlds, or even a war at all, but rather a struggle of belief. As started in the English dictionary, belief is said to be a feeling that something is true, but to believe one must first get inside the unknown and sink beneath the surface, not everything is gained at face value. In religion the argument of `experience' states `some people talk about God in terms of personal experience. They believe that they can know God personally by prayer. Within religion believers sometimes talk about 'encountering God' through prayer and worship. Within the world of religion, some people believe that miracles are events which because of our faith, demonstrate that God is alive and active. That is then countered with the `An unfair God' statement which reads as such ` Some psychologists claim that religious 'experiences' are tricks of the mind, that if we want to really believe in something than we will. Within regard to miracles, even if some were 'true' then what kind of God is it that allows some people to be healed but not others? This hardly seems a God that is fair and just.' The basis of this film is woven around both of those issues. Yet this is not a religious film with a sci-fi twist, nor is it trying to preach to anyone. This film is a deep study of how the mind functions between what is considered reality and what is considered faith. At first glace this appeared as nothing more than an abstract, Saturday mourning creature feature. Such is not the case. Earlier I stated that not everything is gained at face value. This is why it is imperative to look beneath the surface. The aliens here are not aliens at all. There is very little development given to the visitors. We don't know where them came from, why they are here, or what their intentions are. When authors leave characters in their stories nameless it is because they want you to relate to that character on a personal level. In not giving any information about the aliens Shyamalan is allowing the audience to relate to them whichever way the viewer pleases. Leaving this open inevitably lets the audience determine what the film is about and what they will take away from it. Although instruments of fear, the aliens aren't used to toy with characters emotions. They are rather, beacons of faith. There are two types of people in the world tells Graham. There are those who believe in miracles and signs and there are those who think there is no one looking out for them. Since Graham thinks there is no one looking out for him, he is placed into the second type of person. His faith is flailing in the wind, ready to detach itself from the body and soul at any minute, Yet Graham still has the power to grab it if he wishes, but usually it isn't just that easy. With the coming of the aliens Graham is sent on his own personal vision quest. Are they someone's idea of a joke? Did God send them? Did his wife send them? He doesn't know but he is going to find out one way or another. In order to understand a situation you must understand the answers, and to understand the answers you must first search for them. It is the aliens who propel Graham to find those answers to the unexplained things in his life, often without even knowing he is doing it. Shyamalan writes another electrifying script that unlike the Sixth Sense, presents the viewer with the situations and only loosely ties them together in the end. This leaves the viewers on just as much of a search for answers as our main character and allows for more critical thinking than required by The Sixth Sense. Although this method of scripting proved just as effective as The Sixth Sense the ending did seem rather uncalled for. Even though it did its job in bringing everything together, there was nothing interesting about, even ruining some of the dramatic build-up. Also without the `surprise' ending some people will not be able to pick up on what this film is trying to get across. Nevertheless it makes up for that with Shyamalan's highly symbolic storytelling. Have you ever had a puzzle that once completed you glued to a piece of cardboards so that it would never fall apart on you? Shyamalan's direction acts as that glue. His ultra-slow pacing allows for mass character development and allows for greater tension between every connecting joint. He is also able to manipulate the camera in such a way that you are given just enough effect that determining what is important and what isn't is an impossibility. People keep coming back to Shyamalan's films because he requires a great deal of audience participation. You are the ones digging to find the clues; he is only providing the interrogation so that you can be granted access to the characters mind and soul. With a new actor comes a new set of expectations. Bruce Willis would be a hard act to follow if the casting for this film wasn't perfect. Shyamalan knew he has to bring in an actor who could match Willis' dramatic capability. Mel Gibson was the choice and a right choice he was. Gibson gives his best performance since Braveheart. He acts every emotion down to its last haunting detail. We have no trouble feeling that he is going through a time of struggle but he never lets us forget that he is also a loving parents and an everyday human being. Shyamalan has a knack for brining emotions out of his characters that are disturbing and unexplainable but at the same time uncharacteristically human. For a film that had to compete against The Sixth Sense this one was able to hold its ground fine, it's thinking mans version of tell-me-a-scary-story fun. Although it didn't surpass The Sixth Sense its yearning to trying something new was welcomed with open arms making it (alongside Frailty) one of the best thrillers, if not films, that last year had to offer.</fullReview>

Those simple-minded folk whowant to watch little green men come down to earth on their flyingsaucers to blow up buildings and incinerate people. And thesecond group, those who can appreciate intense, brilliant,powerful theatrical events with more substance than your typicalspecial effects blockbuster! I am in the second group and I LOVEDTHIS MOVIE!!! I really had no expectations that this would be ablockbuster action packed shoot-em-up flick like IndependenceDay. With M. Night Shyamalan (The Six Sense) writing/directingand starring Mel Gibson, I expected a taught, entertainingmind-blowing thriller, and this film delivers all that and more.Signs also had some very funny moments, a change from The SixSense. It also contained many very moving dramatic scenes withfocus on Mel Gibson's character and his family. But mostly, it wasa movie enriched with very subtle hints and clues that unlock thereal meaning of the story. Sure, any untalented hollywood directorcan blow up buildings these days. But very few have the genius topull off a very meaningful, engaging, suspenseful, mind-blowingfilm that leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat. I amdefinitely a M. Night Shyamalan fan, and I can't wait to see his nextmovie. Swing away!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Signs" may not have all the greatest effects, but it had the suspense! I've been looking for a movie to scare me, and I finally got one. (ok, warning, SPOILER COMING!) At a few points in the movie, the aliens all with their hand reach out to grab someone, and that got to me. But what really did it for me was when you see the reflection of one in the tv! (Ok, end of SPOILER) And I believe that the music really added to the suspense. Every once and awhile it was so good, I could feel my heart racing. Also, I don't really like science fiction, but I liked this one. It's almost like the real world meets science fiction, and it was enough of a balance to keep me interested. It also has a really good message at the end. But I wont spoil that so you can find out for yourself what it is!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I find very few films amazing, so I'm not using this term lightly. Since the film was advertised as a sci-fi thriller from the maker of Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, I was expecting a film of that caliber. Mind you, I liked those movies a lot, so I was very hopeful. What I found, though, is that the spiritual aspects of the movie actually made it moving. That's what I found so amazing about this. Ask yourself when was the last time you found yourself even a little bit emotionally moved by a sci-fi film. I've seen several other users comment on this being the downfall of this movie, but it was undoubtedly its strongest point, the one that makes it stand out above and beyond the other two films. Night's ability to merge these two genres together seamlessly was incredible, and the fact that you didn't quite get it until the last five minutes was nothing short of brilliant. Quite simply, this is one of the smartest films I've seen in a long time. I actually feel a little bad for the reviewers who just didn't get it. If you haven't seen this film yet, it's a must-rent that will not disappoint as long as you remember that its objective is above and beyond your average sci-fi thriller.</fullReview>

Scarry movies recently have been mired in B grade productions. But every now and again you get a movie that just deals out the creeps. Signs is definately one of those movies.Night is an phenominal director who takes old beat up genres and makes something refreshing. The concept of endless cornfields and isolated locations makes Signs generates overwhelming suspence. You just dont know what is going on.Highly recommended for those of you who need a break from the same ol' stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest thrillers ever made...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan broke through in one of the biggest ways with 'The Sixth Sense', a cleverly scripted, chillingly shot, superbly paced horror/thriller that, had it been the only film he ever made, would have assured the director a place in film history. His next film, the well-directed, but less engaging 'Unbreakable', was not quite what its predecessor was. And even though Shyamalan wrote a twist ending for 'Unbreakable', it lacked the punch of 'Sense.''Signs', on the other hand, is one of those rare things: a film that is practically flawless. Whether the film has a twist ending or not I will not reveal, but an unexpected denoument is not necessary for a film like this - a film that grips the audience in unrelenting dread without apology. It is rare indeed for a film-maker to succesfully manipulate a post-postmodern audience. Rarer still is a director who can do it so consistently, without cheating, without resorting to shock tactics. Also very worthy of mention is James Newton Howard's equally flawless score. Equal parts 'Psycho' and 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind', Howard's main theme is played over the style of opening credits rarely seen nowadays. Shyamalan has been compared to Spielberg, but 'Signs' is closer to Hitchcock than anything else, and Howard is Shyamalan's Bernard Herrmann.Shyamalan has woven tales from remnants of pop culture - ghosts, comic books, crop circles. One can only wonder what poison tale he will tell next.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing you need to know about "Signs" is that this is probably the first alien invasion movie in a long time that isn't any fun at all. Also, you need to watch it twice.See, the first time you watch it, you end up disappointed. It takes a good ninety minutes or so to get scary. And it's a more sublime kind of scary than the "Anything can happen, oh, %&amp;$@!" kind of scary you might be expecting.So watch it again, later on, now that you understand the tone of the movie. See, it's less "Oh, no, the aliens are coming!!!" than "Independence Day" as a clumsy (but effective) 9/11 allegory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signs Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A little history first. Saw the 6th Sense in the theaters and was absolutely knocked flat. With bated breath, I wait for Unbreakable and like so many others, came out of there disappointed. Signs is released and I miss it in the theaters, dismissing M. Night Shyamalan as a one-trick pony, even though the movie itself makes serious moolah. I ask around and received some generally positive reviews, with the ending polarizing just about everyone. The dvd is released and I pick it up, watching it about a week and a half later. I absolutely loved this movie. First off, Shyamalan is an actor's director. There is not one bad performance in this film and it's apparent early on that the actors themselves are being guided by a sure hand. I was especially impressed by the performances by the children. That little girl is absolutely adorable and gets my pick for cutest movie kid yet! Second, the mood of this film is eerie as all hell. The sound in this movie is awesome. All the major scenes in this movie use sound as its main force, creating a tense environment. I have a 5.1 surround setup at home and the cornfield scenes had me shivering with anticipation! Scenes in the house were well done in the sound department as well. The cinematography is great and it definitely has that look that his other two films share. Another thing that adds to the overall effect is the great score music by James Newton Howard. I kept commenting to myself while watching the movie about how great the music was. Great stuff! My personal favorite scene in this flick was the newscast of the birthday party video. You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it but it was one of the moments where my jaw hit the floor. Now for my last comment and it's gonna be a spoiler-free riff on the ending so read on with no fear: Some people complained about the ending and personally it didn't bother me too much. I can see why people would feel it was a bit anti-climactic and in some ways, yes, it was. However, I think it was just right. After watching the movie, keep in mind what it was about. Was it really about the spooky, frightening realities within or was it about the life and inner workings of this family and what they meant to one another? I think this film was a great twist on what would normally be expected to have lots of action and destruction ala Independence Day. It's almost the opposite. Rating **** out of *****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant and Hitchcockian!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan has crafted a brilliant and wonderful film in "Signs". Dare I say that with this specific film he's reached Hitchcockian levels in his writing and directing, and that's no small feat. ***Reading Further May Spoil The Plot***I dragged my heels in seeing this, thinking "oh great, yet ANOTHER cliched movie about crop circles." From the opening credits to the very last moment, Shyamalan creates an atmospheric and thrilling masterpiece. Casting Mel Gibson in the lead could've been a huge mistake, but under the artful eye of the director, Gibson gives a nuanced and understated performance as a damaged and faithless former priest. Joaquin Phoenix as his brother was a casting coup, as Phoenix never fails to give a wonderfully believable performance. That Phoenix brings a stunning resolution to the plot was another piece of brilliant decision-making. Exploring the possibilities of alien visitation on earth, Shyamalan manages to subtly portray one possible outcome of such an event without rubbing it in our faces. Taking his time to unravel the story works well, allowing the viewer to be drawn in in every way. As Hitchcock also teased his audience with what was to come, Shyamalan uses several techniques to good effect. Having viewed this film, I am convinced that M. Night Shyamalan is a filmmaking genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror of the best quality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs is the greatest horror movie made in the last twenty years. M Night Shyamalan has constructed a film which uses the camera angles as its main tool into scaring the audience. The best example of this is the scene in which Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is woken by his daughter and told that there's a monster on her roof, oh, and can she get a glass of water? Hess rises out his bed and in the background of the shot the camera shows the barn roof in darkness, then there is a flash of lightning and you make out the shape of the Alien on the roof. The best moment of the film is the news report on the T.V, where a man has recorded the Alien walking casualy past his window and when his children scream it could just as easily be you. The film is going to be a classic and I would recommend it to anyone who is good with D.I.Y and does not mind boarding up their windows before they go to sleep, cause its a lot of work I can tell you.</fullReview>

It's a typical Hollywood thriller, but one of the best. Hollywood usually makes good thrillers action packed blockbusters like Independence Day and Armageddon, but to see them make a quiet, eerie, slow moving blockbuster thriller suprised me. The director is real good. I loved it when you could only see the sillohuete of the alien when he's standing on top of the barn. People complain that they look kind of goofy, but when I first saw it walking by the kid's birthday party on that news channel, I was almost screaming. And the humor was a good mix. Mel Brook's brother (I cant spell his name) was a funny character in that and a good supporting actor. I loved the army sign up guy. It's a great Hollywood family movie. B+, 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even though this movie has a high-rating, I still believe it's underappreciated... that, and Gibson and his priestly demeanor are quite hunky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film in the theatre with my older and younger brother, and we loved it. It really hit home with the family storyline. Because there are only 4 central characters, they are all extremely likeable and fleshed-out. The acting is superb, and you really feel a genuine family feeling (particularly at the dinnertable scene, which still makes me emotional). The children in this movie are great (the little girl steals the show whenever she speaks). Gibson is great... like Bruce Willis in The Sixth Sense, this is probably the most mature role that he's had yet. Joaquin Phoenix is HILARIOUS, and he played well off of Gibson. I read a review on this site about how you can see microphones in almost every scene. Truthfully, I saw Signs in a real theatre and I did not see any microphones. However, when I came to college and saw it again when it was showing at the school theatre, I did see the microphones. I thought, "Thank God they weren't in the real edition that I saw," because they really did ruin the movie, especially with everyone laughing at the mics popping up during very intense scenes. Just know that the real movie does not have the microphones (do you honestly think Shymalan-whose name I cannot spell-and the producers would let something like that slide?). There must be a really early, uncut, or maybe just off-center edition floating around. Anyway, I love this movie. As everyone else has said, the suspense is handled extremely well by a masterful director. For those who have been bitching about unrealistic plotlines, get over it; how the hell can anyone know how aliens would act in a completely new environment? And if I were a member of a desperate species on the brink of extinction, I sure as hell would get to the first planet that I could in order to get nourishment, regardless of any impending weather such as rain. The one thing that I will gripe about with this movie is that seeing the alien is not so much of a letdown, but more awkward than not. When you see the alien on the TV (both in the news AND at the end through the reflection), it is quite well-done and terrifying. However, I would have rather not seen the alien as clearly as they showed it during the climax, because the computer generated effects took a great deal away from the movie. But to the filmmakers' credit, from the amount of suspense that this movie builds up, it would have been impossible to lead to anything that will please everyone (especially in the way that the alien looks). Other than the alien, the story's main strength is the family. It's one of the best *family* films that I have ever seen, really. The message of faith, not so much (to me) in a higher power, but in your family and in love, was quite powerful. And to top it all off, it's funny as hell. I still laugh at every part that I originally laughed at. Watch Signs... you'll laugh, you'll cry... hell, you'll probably soil yourself too.</fullReview>

I love Signs on it's own because it played with a fear that I already possessed and made it much more real, and to me much more frightening.This movie took elements from one of my favorite novels, war of the worlds and made an alien invasion something very real, we don't see the hero's we see the survivors, and the ability to make something so far-fetched so real is something that I admire. So in short I would like to give Shyamalan a "Koudos" and say that I can only hope to be as good as he is one day.</fullReview>

Except, this time it doesn't deal with ghosts or comic book salesmen gone nuts, but rather it deals with aliens. This film is comparable to Steven Spielberg's Jaws, in which, we don't see much gore, or the thing that is meant to scare us. Rather, Shyamlan builds up the suspense and plays off of the audience's fear of the subject matter. The film stars Mel Gibson as a farmer in Pennsylvania who is more thank shocked to find out that there are crop circles in his cornfield. Great performances by Gibson, as well as by Joaquin Phoenix make the film memorable. Also, the dialogue is wonderful. Shyamalan is truly one of the finest filmmakers out there today. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak Sci-fi/horror, yet speculative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a lot to like and dislike in this film. First, the film is not really as scary as Knight Shyamalan, its writer and director, and the studio implies. As science fiction, it is pure schlock. There is a message that the movie tries to deliver however, so I will pay the movie (7.5 user rating!) it's due, even though I didn't really like it. The rest of this review is pretty much a spoiler, so don't bother reading it until you've seen the film. If you have seen the film, and feel dissatisfied, perhaps you will agree with some of my points. I'll discuss some of the negatives, some positives, and what I think the filmmaker was trying to do and why it is pleasing to so many despite its faults.The fear factor: No scene is really scary. Part of the problem is the poor character development which may be attributed to the actors: Gibson, especially, is horrible by Hollywood standards, seemingly just "going along" and overacting for the director so that the studio can get it's money out. The performances by the children are also way below the standard here. Clearly Shyamalan is not a "people person", he is not getting the best out of his actors. Another problem is that Shyamalan is a trying to work within a minimalist horror ethic that really doesn't work cinematically. Minimalist concepts are important in film, it's just that a lot of the techniques that the director tries to bring off, just end up being annoying: The knocking all over the house for example to tell us that aliens are there, as well as the test pattern on the TV, which frankly just went over my head the first time I saw it. (Shyamalan wants us to interpret it as "destruction" of our media resources by the alien attack.) Further, the still shots on TV and alien in the alley, presented to convince the characters and the viewers that there is a world wide attack going on, are pretty lame. It seems that Shyamalan is hell-bent (my expression :) on not spending "too much" money on effects and wants to "show what can be done" with just a few resources and one damn :) expensive actor. He doesn't succeed very well, and any illusion that he has should be exposed. There is one reservation I have to make, however, it is that Shyamalan sincerely trying to draw a picture of hysteria-based reality. He is stating here that reality is NOT a fixed entity based on some objective "out there", but is based on culture, which of course, includes media such as film, television and books, as well as social interaction. He is quite successful in making this allusion and this contributes to the existentialist interpretation of the movie's message, as well as to the likelihood that the movie is going to make it onto some lists despite all of its roughness. The script: That Shyamalan is not an especially good writer of dialog seems obvious from listening carefully to what these people are saying to each other: how they often answer different questions to those asked, and speak disjointedly in general. If he feels this has a positive dramatic effect, then this brings into question what is drama, and how it works. At any rate, if this was his intention - to create a disjointedness feeling in the film viewer based on the disjointedness of the dialog - I don't think it was artistically or elegantly done, once again - it was mostly annoying. I kept asking myself, "Would these people all watch this and want to suspend their belief if Mel Gibson were not in it?" The feature videos on the DVD indicated that Shyamalan is a meticulous story-boarder. This may be his main talent, not bringing his own somewhat naive ideas to the screen in a minimalist style.The aliens: Not much to comment on here. They sound a lot like raccoons, have the classic skinny look almost to the point of effeminacy (but not so much that a man can't fit into the costume) and yet, look a bit like Spiderman. (Was it a left-over pattern from wardrobe?) Water kills them, which seems to imply that they come from a part of the universe where ordinary properties of matter don't apply. Oh yes, and they have poison gas jet in their wrist, which they use to kill humans one at a time. Hmm, this echoes back to Spiderman, doesn't it? And even though there are many of them in their flying saucers and a gang of them pounding on the house, there are only two in the movie, one in the house and one running though a back-alley in Brazil (probably the same actor). Believe me, E.T. was a lot better.The story: Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) was a priest who lost his belief when his wife, Colleen, died because of a careless driver (the sixth character, Ray, played by Shyamalan). Gibson's character is actually the strongest element of the film and clearly calls for an actor of his stature. Also, the portrayal of Colleen's death becomes a central element in the apotheosis of the movie, as Graham Hess gradually comes to realize that her final words were inspirational instructions to him on how to conduct himself and the family through their time of need (the alien invasion). This makes some sense on at least two levels: 1) That Graham was to recover his religious belief as a result of surviving this test and abandoning his angry disbelief; and 2) existentially and metaphorically, as the character says, "Everything happens for a reason", therefore the wife dies, she gives advice, the advice is followed and the family survives the alien invasion. Viewers may respond then to this according to their own personal degree of religiosity: the more religious will tend to see it as a reconversion story, echoing their own reconversions. The non-religious can weigh the existentialist message, "Everything happens for a reason", and reflect on whether their own experience bares this out and perhaps, whether or not it should. This is a positive message and a coherent statement by Shyamalan, which will not play as well in Peoria (Christian fundamentalists may consider this as too mixed a message, while they should "thank God for small favors" in that Shyamalan puts religious belief in so positive a light. Only the skeptical empiricists will be left completely out in the cold. Oh well, you can't always please everyone, right?In summary, I think that Shyamalan has made a movie that will be often discussed and will always have to be judged on its own merits, which is probably as it should be. The film is important in that it deals in speculative matters of human knowledge (not the existence of alien beings), rare in American Cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signs has a deeply moving message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs is one of M. Night Shyamalan's best films to date. Those who view movies looking for plot holes, or over analyze movies into degrading submission need not see it, it's too good for you. Those who are willing to be open minded while watching and absorb what Shyamalan doles out are in for a treat. The greatest of which is the message of the film, Everything occurs for a reason, and all of us, in the end, are tied together, it is planned that way by some force greater than we can imagine. The arrival of the aliens is what makes this message shine. Even with the plot holes this message still exists, for those naysayers who are obsessed with the little things in movies that don't jive, try to look past it and see the jewel of a movie that lies within</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this film with the highest of hopes and the greatest of expectations after witnessing such an impressive trailer. The very notion of intelligent beings from other worlds visiting our own has always intrigued me, and I will usually hurry to the cinema if any new film has even a hint of extraterrestrials in it.And so with glee I rushed to the theatre to see Signs... oh sorry, signs (without a capital is the "proper" way)... I got there early, I managed to snare a great seat - for once free of obstructions like tall men and women with bee-hive perms - and what did I witness? Did I witness pure genius? Did I witness a theatrical masterpiece? No. I was subjected to almost two hours of *COMPLETE AND UTTER CRAP*.I will spare you all the horrible, horrible details of this film so that you may see just how craptacular it is for yourself. Watch it with your own eyes. *Marvel* at the intricately crafted plot holes and inconsistencies. *Gasp* at the screenplay which could be written more intelligently by most three-year-olds with a set of Crayolas. *Scream* in horror when you discover that the signs aliens, yes, intelligent beings who have mastered the trivial notion of interstellar travel, are seemingly at a loss when presented with a one-inch thick wooden door.BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE! You will be *BLOWN AWAY* when you learn that our humble aliens can be killed by WATER! Yes, good old common H20 is the equivalent of sulphuric acid to our alien fiends, and somehow, in their infinite knowledge and wisdom, they decide to use their incredible space travel technology to visit little old Earth, A PLANET WHICH CONSISTS OF OVER SEVENTY PERCENT WATER!!! OH MY GOD, SHYAMALAN, YOU ARE A GENIUS!I want my two hours of life back!1 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan + Aliens = Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the catchy score at the beginning to the showdown at the end, this film fails to disappoint. And rather than a boring 1 hour long development time in the beginning, we are thrown right into the story where it all takes place. There are plenty of jumpy bits and suspense filled moments in here to keep any horror fan happy, and the at times hilarious dialogue keep you on your toes. Gibson abandons his macho image for a more heart felt touching part, and he plays it beautifully. Another member of the Culkin clan which I had not previously had the pleasure of watching makes his amazing debut in this film, and he does it so well. Probably my most favourite character in this film was Joaquin Phoenix, playing Mel Gibson's brother. I had only ever seen him play the menacing role of Commodus in Gladiator, so it was both refreshing and a relief to see him in a more distinct, sensitive role. Phoenix steals the show with his hilarious performance, and gave the entire film just the right amount of humour that it needed. The part where Gibson walks into the room and he's sitting there wearing a tin-foil hat will never cease to amuse me...To round it all up, I found this film thoroughly enjoyable to watch - Shyamalan proves that once again he can break all the boundaries of tension, suspense and clever twists to produce a fantastic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am really shocked by the amount of bad comments about this movie. I was horrified to read that some people said that it was the worst movie they've ever seen. Oh please. Does anyone remember "Crossroads" or "Battlefield Earth"? Those two movies can qualify as the worst movies ever, but not Signs. Signs is a very suspenseful, edge of your seat type of movie that keeps viewers enthralled for it's running time. I thought all the characters were cast perfectly, except for maybe the director, who should just stick to directing, nice try though. :) All in all, I think that it was a great movie, with few flaws, definitely one you should give a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still waiting for a good film from Shyamalan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: SpoilersThe first major idea presented is that crop circles really are of extraterrestrial origin. The true, hoax origin of crop circles is acknowledged in the film, and then quickly brushed aside by the fact that in a mere 72 hour period, 18 crop circles were made in India. Surely that is beyond the possibility of human behavior! Just do the math! In the film it says it would take a 2-3 person team 1 night to make a typical group of "circles" in a field. So over 3 nights, that would require 6 2-3 man teams, or a total of 12-18 people in on the hoax. This, in India, which has a population of over 1 billion people. Also, we are told that they are being used as "markers" for the extraterrestrials to use when their invasion begins. This, from beings who are obviously very technologically advanced, being able to travel at very high speeds across space. All that technology, and to remember where they want to go on Earth they're still relying on forming patterns in crops which will only be visible about half of each day.Next we are told that the extraterrestrials are probably here to take over the world in order to exploit its natural resources, having depleted their planet's natural resources already. This is believable enough, as if the film was set 200 years in the future, I can easily see it being turned the other way around, with humans as the invaders of the alien world. It's also suggested that the aliens will rely on hand to hand combat so that our nuclear weapons will not be of value in stopping them, which is another believable idea. Not content with believable ideas, it turns out that the only weapon the aliens have is the ability to emit a small amount of poison out of their wrists, having traveled across the galaxy and evidently forgetting to bring any serious weapons. Near the end of the film, without the aliens having made any real attempt to take over Earth, they inexplicably go back home, just as quickly as they came.This film does raise some interesting questions, though.At one point, the comment is made, first by Morgan, then a few moments later by the newscaster, that "Everything people have written about in science books is going to change." This is a rather profound statement, but it is probably false. While information from an advanced civilization might give a few insights that would have taken science a few more decades to find out, the bulk of chemistry, physics, geology, and even cosmology and astronomy would be unaffected. We might get a few more organism made elements at the end of the periodic table and a few refinements of current physics, but the rest of our knowledge of these subjects would more than likely be unchanged. Biology would probably be the most heavily affected science, as we'd have evidence of biological organisms that are possibly quite different from us, and this could shed great insight on common principles of Evolution throughout the universe.Also, while much attention is given to human beings and religion, the subject of religion is ignored in relation to the extraterrestrials, which is a source for many questions, such as: Were the aliens theists? While they were above the major cities in their cloaked space ships, were they praying to their God(s) for success in their invasion in order to claim what's left of Earth's natural resources? Or, perhaps the extraterrestrial invasion had nothing to do with our natural resources but rather was a cosmic proselytizing mission, in which the extraterrestrials, with empirical evidence for their God(s), were simply trying to share this evidence with us so we can stop worshiping our false Gods and start worshiping their true God(s).And perhaps most importantly, was "swing away" good advice, let alone so good that there was any reason for thinking it was of divine origin? That is, is there any good evidence to suggest that a God would have a man fall asleep at the wheel and kill an innocent woman so that she could utter the last words "swing away," which would be interpreted by her husband, 6 months later, that this meant her son Merrill should beat an extraterrestrial in their living room to death with a baseball bat? No. Merrill owned 5 records in minor league baseball, one of which was the record for the most strikeouts. He probably would have made it to the major leagues if he didn't recklessly `swing away' as he did. It is not plausible that without those last words Graham and Merrill would have been unable to defend their family. Indeed, it is amazing Merrill didn't grab the baseball bat much earlier in the film. Also, it would have been an ideal time to heed Colleen's last words when the family was in the basement by having Graham open the door suddenly and shine the light in the extraterrestrials eyes while Merrill swung away at the extraterrestrials head with the pickaxe.In the end, the film isn't really about humans fighting off invading extraterrestrials or even extraterrestrials, but rather about using coincidences to support a belief in God. With this as the main premise, the whole extraterrestrials thing becomes not just completely superfluous, but incredibly deleterious to achieving this goal. For, if the writer's goal was to make a film about using coincidences to establish faith in God, then resorting to saying that a hodge-podge of hoaxes and unlikely ideas are also real diminishes this goal. Thus, instead of using extraterrestrials so that Colleen's last words can have divine meaning, it would be better to have a human burglar break into the Hess home, at which point Graham tells his son Merrill to "swing away" with a bat to protect the family. As is, this film provides nothing but silly, even if fanciful, ideas and scenarios about crop circles, extraterrestrials, and God.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-made thriller with heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>7 out of 10M. Night Shyamalan's success streak continues with Signs, a horror-oriented thriller about an ex-priest (Mel Gibson) who discovers something odd happening in his cornfields at night. As far as plot goes, that's enough of a decent set-up for Shyamalan to work his magic. Signs is not a story-driven excursion, as the previews may lead you to believe (it does NOT give clear-cut answers to the existence "crop circles" and such) but an exercise in sharp filmmaking and acting. For the film to work, both must be top-notch. Thankfully, we're not let down.The film delivers its share of suspenseful situations, much of it highlighted by brief glimpses of creepy images and exposure to fear of the unknown (the pantry scene is classic). Most of it works, and because of the stellar performances (there's not a weak performance among the cast), we genuinely care about the film's resolution. The movie's ongoing theme, that of a man regaining his spirituality, is thoroughly unimaginative, but Gibson's sincere performance makes it work well enough to distance itself from the routine horror/thriller. Unfortunately, the climax is a disappointment, concluding with a ludicrous plot development that needlessly cranks the silliness up a couple of notches. It is a major dent to an otherwise solid thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect alien invasion movie - and a complete opposite of Independence Day (thankfully!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some say director M. Night is trying to hammer in a message of some sort with this movie and it will sit with those generally in favour of the idea and not that much with generally opposed to the idea. I don't want to reveal too much about the movie so I won't tell you what the idea is, but let me tell you this much - I'm one of those generally opposed to the idea that is supposedly being hailed but I ABSOLUTELY LOVED this movie!The handling of tension and alien terror is superb - I've seen all the Men in Blacks, Predators, Aliens, Independence Days etc etc that have been thrown at as within the past ten years and let me tell you, this is BY FAR the among the best alien invasion movies to date.Director M. Night has some of the most amazing directorial talent that has surfaced in recent times in Hollywood and all of his past three films (the two previous ones being Sixth Sense and Unbreakable) have been fantastic, each in its different way. It is just amazing how this guy manages to craft three so different yet so absolutely intriguing and perfect movies in a row.As for this specific movie, I cannot remember when I was last gripped with so much suspense I had skin crawling all over during the climactic finale (must have been The Matrix). Additionally, this movie produced some of the best startling scenes in recent memory - a truly innocent situation involving a dog which almost made me spill hot tea all over myself. It's been years since any movie has truly and honestly startled me. Forget all the "SLAM! (door shuts unexpectedly)" or "oh my god, it was only the cat!" el-cheapo thrills "horror" movies seem to be relying upon more and more these days (just finished watching "Halloween Resurrection" a few days prior, a prime example) - Signs has directorial talent written all over it, it grips you and never lets you go until the satysfying conclusion, or maybe even not then.The one thing I'm ambivalent about is the director's continual references to India throughout his movies. In a way its cute, the director himself being a Hindu, but sometimes his Hindu characters (including those played by himself) appear out of place. In a way its a nice Hitchcockian touch, in another it is a bit distracting.The other thing I was initially taken aback was the lack of Bruce Willis or Haley Joel Osmond and their substitution with Mel Gibson and another kid of the seemingly endless stream Culkins. I know Willis or Osmond weren't even considered for these roles, but it would have been nice to have a pure-blooded trilogy complete with the same excellent actors. It didn't take much for me though to accept Gibson and Culkin, they were excellent in their roles.The conclusion itself though, I do admit, may be lacking for some. Those people probably loved Independence Day and were waiting for something similar. I for one HATED Independence Day (an embodyment of stupid film-making taken to the extreme) so I cannot express my thanks enough here to mr M. Night for giving us such a perfect alien invasion movie, truly worthy of the more demanding and intelligent yet still fun- and suspense-loving movie-goers out there. Its about time someone took a different approach and told a different story than the hopelessly dated "kill mothership/main alien during the finale thus saving the world" dribble which has been told just way too many times already.Once again, thank you mr M. Night, for this movie experience to remember - needless to say, I'm breathless in anticipation for your next movie, but even if it's not worthy of your three previous ones, you will still have made movie-making history with your existing trilogy as it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan has created another masterpiece of a movie. Signs, being his third consecutive block-buster hit, exceeded my expectations. After reading some of the other reviews that said Signs is not a good movie I had to see it, knowing that these people are the same people that can not watch a movie without gross-out humor and dazzling special effects. Signs is a brilliantly crafted movie which managed to keep me enthralled to the very last minute. Instead of using explosions, special effects and hundreds of CGI aliens, which are used in most movies to distract the viewer from the weak storyline, Shyamalan keeps the effects to a bare minimum and instead uses images and a feeling of isolation to keep viewers in suspense. Signs is NOT your typical Science Fiction movie because it goes much deeper by evaluating religion and instead of seeing the whole world in turmoil we see the whole invasion through the experiences of a family isolated on a farm. The performances are excellent. The story amazing and the movie SPECTACULAR. But be warned if you are narrow-minded and you are not stimulated by movies which make you think this isn't for you. If you are on the other hand one of those people who enjoys an amazing experience in a movie, see it now. Definitely a contender for the Oscars in 2003. Undoubtedly one of this years best movies. And also one of the best science fiction movies ever made alongside Minority Report.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes this movie has got a more or less clear message in religious terms therefore it will be viewed from different angles depending on if you are a believer or an unbeliever. The former will find it a great movie while the latter will think it's a complete nonsense. For agnostics like myself the message will be disregarded and we'll prefer to concentrate our attention on the filmic discourse. Well it's a sci-fi thriller as you probably already know and a just passable one I mean it has no special flaws to be denounced but no special inventive or original features either. The story unfolds itself in somewhat predictable developments and the acting is neither bad nor particularly good maybe with the exception of the 2 kids who deserve a special mark though the boy seems to be a little too gifted for his age but we are used to that already in children roles. Well summing it up if the night is too cold and if you are an unbeliever or an agnostic stay comfortably at home and don't lose your time going out to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't go into M. Night Shyamalan's "Signs" expecting a conventional sci-fi thriller. "Signs" involves circular formations in a farmer's crops that might be the work of aliens. It's scary and suspenseful. But it's not intended as a jolt-a-minute terror-fest, and it's not an "Independence Day"-kind of action-packed man-vs.-aliens war movie. It's as much a drama about faith as a thriller. Mel Gibson, in one of his best performances, plays Graham Hess, a former minister who turned his back on religion after his wife's death in an accident. He lives a quiet life on a farm 45 miles outside of Philadelphia with his brother (Joaquin Phoenix) and children (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin). Then things start getting weird. Graham discovers circular patterns and lines cut perfectly into his crops. He and his brother first suspect pranksters. They're wrong. When the truth is revealed, the film's characters must face the distinct possibility that they're about to die. "Signs" is about how they react and what they choose to believe. Is life a random series of events? Or does everything have a purpose, with no coincidences? Writer-director Shyamalan boldly takes a stand here, and the result is a series of moving sequences, including a finale that, if it hits you as it did me, will take your breath away. As he did with the acclaimed "The Sixth Sense" and the underappreciated "Unbreakable," Shyamalan shows in "Signs" that he's a writer who knows how to weave an intricately constructed tale and build to a richly satisfying conclusion, and that he's a sensitive, assured director with a talent for character development and blending humor and tragedy, the supernatural and everyday life. He also knows how to tell a story visually and with economy. Just watch the opening sequence. We see a photo in Graham's bedroom that indicates he's been married; we see him wake up alone in a single bed; he walks into a hallway and there are kid's drawings on a bedroom door; a wall shows a mark where a cross once hung. All of these shots tell us something, without a word spoken. Shyamalan also is a good actor. In "Signs" he's excellent as the guilt-stricken man who accidentally killed Graham's wife.That's just one of many fine performances in the film. Gibson is heartbreaking as a man reeling from his wife's death. Phoenix, taking a break from the more offbeat characters he's often played (such as the villainous emperor in "Gladiator"), gives an impressively natural (and often funny) portrayal as the brother. The kids are believable. And Tony Award-winner Cherry Jones is memorable as a compassionate local police officer. "Signs" is a great movie. Can't wait to see what Shyamalan comes up with next.</fullReview>

I don't know, maybe it's just me, but if aliens are taking over the damn planet, I want to see some damn aliens. This movie tries to be an update on "The Night of the Living Dead" but unfortunately Mel Gibson is not good enough of an actor to pull it off and Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get enough to do. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one and rent the much, MUCH better "Unbreakable". 2 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another Sci-Fi movie with the same plot as every one before it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went and saw this movie in the theater and I was expecting another great movie with Mel Gibson (one of my favorites) and what I got was a joke of a movie with a great Mel Gibson performance. I was very impressed with the layout of the film, the main characters were cast well, and the sound fx were great. BUT, and call me simple minded if you wish, I felt like I was watching Independence Day, or any other generic Sci-Fi movie... Everything from the Crop circles functioning as a way for the aliens to achieve global communication (just like the satellites in I.D) to the reason the aliens were there being to drain us of our natural resources (I.D. again, amongst several other sci-fis,) the whole movie was just another hack at a good sci-fi, with the same "Aliens are coming to destroy us and our resources" plot line, with a less acceptable ending. If you have already seen a few other sci-fi thrillers, don't bother with this movie, it's not worth your time, or your dollar at the rental store.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching the previews, I figured this would be a movie full of suspense andfrightening moments. Well, only a few of those and sometimes I wondered ifcertain scenes are to frighten audiences, but did not. It has a good plot but I feel that there could have been a lot more in "Signs." Frankly, the aliens were not that frightening in my opinion and I am still a little disappointed that I never fully understood what the purpose of the aliens in "Signs" was. I give this movie a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could of been the best thriller ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Contains a few spoilers***This movie was a good movie, but it could have been the most horrifying movie ever. The leadup to the finale was remarkable. I was horrified throughout the movie (even with the stupid looking aliens), and was intrigued by the religious imagery and symbolism. The movie was leading to a shocking finale, but unfortunately that didn't happen. This movie would have been a top 10 movie of all time if the ending was changed. What should have happened was that the picture at the end of the movie resembles the picture in the book, the house on fire with the two children and father outside. That could have made this movie a classic and I was expecting it but unfortunately it did not happen. Instead they went with the cheesy positive ending and changed the focus of the movie from alien thriller to questions of faith. If this movie had ended in a negative light, it would have been horrifying and the greatest alien invasion movie ever. It still was a good movie, with great actors, but I think the ending kind of ruins it. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really reluctant to watch this movie as the South African critics had given it really bad reviews. They are obviously Aliens masquerading as humans. Mel Gibson gives the performance of a life time. He leads you through the most tumultuous roller coaster ride of emotional ups and downs from calmness to terror, from love to abject hate just by the expressions on his face. This is a must see. If you have ever questioned those "coincidences" in life go and see this movie. The casting of Joaquim Phoenix as his brother was sheer genius and the Author / Director's cameo appearance is tastefully done and helps to bring home his passion for the story. I was a bit put off at first by the way scenes never seemed to flow, nothing is flowing about this movie. Its very "boxed" time wise. By the end of the movie you realize why the Director did that. The photography is sublime. Its like standing in a Renaissance Gallery looking at the Masters paintings. This movie is profound. YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS MOVIE!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great suspense marred by preachy overtones and awful finale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shyamalan please don't preach at me! - That's one of the first things that I think of when I reflect on `Signs'. I hate preachy movies.`Signs' is a good flick. In the year of 2002 when a good flick is virtually non existent, it was a nice and welcoming relief. It's the story of an ex-preacher, Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), who lives out in the cornfields with his son and daughter, grieving over his dead wife. Suddenly crop circles begin to appear in his corn and strange goings on happen. It's a `sign' of stuff happening. But what is happening? What are the crop circles appearing everywhere indicating? Is it some other worldly force? And can Hess pull himself out of his despair and fight them? Hmmm.. Well - can he?!Acting here is all solid. Gibson isn't called to stretch himself - look angry here, look sad there, shoulder a burden of grief, question his faith, and so on. He's still well cast in his role though and never really lets the side down. The two kids are quite good. One is the Cute Girl #3 act going for, but we can expect that. It's Hollywood. Rory Culkin, as the young son Morgan, is actually one of the best surprises of the movie. He has a remarkable maturity to his acting, and is very believable as a quiet, introverted son. Hope he gets more work for himself, unlike his brother. Speaking of brothers, Joaquin Pheonix plays Gibson's brother, Merrill. He's there to provide the more light-hearted elements later on, but also as a foil to Gibson's taciturn nature. Pheonix is good, but not remarkable, failing to get into the role the way he could in, for example, `Gladiator'.Script wise? Well there's not much of one. It's `Close Encounters of the Third Kind' meets `Night of the Living Dead'. There is some ham fisted dialogue, principally when Shyamalan (writer and director here) gets all preachy and tries to teach us A Big Lesson. It's mostly when Gibson starts moralising and pondering aloud in the tired old `why me? Why this?' routine. The moments aren't quite too far and few between to be erased from my memory and it does detract from the enjoyment at time. I can watch a movie without being talked down to. Oh and that little bit with Pheonix's character? Too heavily fore-shadowed and sign posted. Subtlety is lacking in this script.That subtlety is lacking in the script is strange because it's certainly not lacking in the directing. It's what makes `Signs' move from an average movie to a sharp little thriller. Shyamalan uses a nice slow build up, that's ever increasing the paranoia and the tension. Wisely he eschews ever taking the camera much further than the farm land, creating a sense of isolation to the viewer. The jumps are not obviously sign posted, and dramatical music cues are minimalist to score maximum effect. The camera work is tight and focused, building up the eerie tension, and the lighting is spot on, with just the right level of creeping darkness. The sound work - sharp, crisp - is also very good. I don't think I've ever jumped so much at a cinema screening and it's a credit to the movie that it made me do that. It's only let down at the end with the weak ending and incredulous plot device. Still fair dues to Shyamalan for using his director's chair well.`Signs' is one of the best movies of 2002. Now that's not saying a whole lot as there's been little good (I'm pinning all my hopes on `The Two Towers') but this is certainly a movie worth seeing with the lights turned down. It can't be a classic due to some hammy writing on Shayamalan's part, and its obvious roots, but it's a very effective little thriller (in the scare sense) and worth your time. 8.0/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dial M for Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If M. Night Shyamalan is truly the Alfred Hitchcock of the multiplex generation -- as his prodigious stylistic talent and penchant for cameos suggests -- then composer James Newton Howard deserves credit as his Bernard Herrmann. The score that comes up under the opening credits for Signs is eerie, unsettling stuff, portentous without being overblown. It promises a scary night at the movies, and Signs delivers. This is the creepiest Hollywood thriller in a very long while and almost definitely this year's horror flick par excellence. By employing the same MO as The Sixth Sense -- establish sympathetic characters and believable situations before putting your audience though the wringer -- the writer-director crafts his most suspenseful and unnerving film to date.Retired pastor and widowed dad Graham (Mel Gibson) finds some strange patterns carved into his cornfield, which he suspects is a well-coordinated local hoax. His younger brother, a failed minor-league baseball player (Joaquin Phoenix), shares his skepticism, but the kiddies aren't so sure, especially when the younger one wakes up in the middle of the night saying she's seen something lurking outside her window.There's so much more to say about Signs than a mere recap of this straightforward set-up, but it would be doing the film a disservice to reveal its surprises. Shyamalan's methodical pacing and carefully deployed shocks are more effective if you assume as little as possible going in. It's fair to say that the crop circles are no hoax, and that the little farm home that houses Gibson and his brood will come to seem less quaint and more terrifying as things progress. If you bring a date, make sure they've cut their fingernails, or else they'll end up embedded in your forearm from prolonged clutching. It's just that kind of movie.ADAM NAYMAN</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best sci-fi thrillers I have ever seen. M. Night Shyamalan is a true film genius. I went into the theater with my doubts, but because so many people referred me to this movie I decided I should see it. Was I ever impressed. Shyamalan made a very on the edge of your seat type of film. There were plenty of points in the film that straight up startled me, and what didn't startle me sure as hell gave me goosebumps. Along with that, there was a good amount of humor in the film that added quite a bit without negating the thriller-type tone of the film.Extra Terrestrials or just a bunch of geeks? If they are extra terrestrials, are they hostile or friendly? Are they really out there? Who could have created all those signs?I would love to say more about the film if I could, but there's not much more to tell without spoiling the plot. There are two main struggles in this film. The struggle between the humans and what they believe are aliens, and the struggle of a former reverend(Gibson) who has been losing his faith since the loss of his wife. Of course, Shyamalan makes a cameo appearance in his film, as he does ever so often. His character is integral to the story although he is only seen in about 3 short scenes.For once again entertaining me with a well made film, I give M. Night Shyamalan 5out of 5 stars for a VERY solid movie with an excellent plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a last few years I was thinking that scary, real scary movies are history (Alien, The Thing), M.Night Shyamalan made second masterwork (first is The Sixth sense, of course). Fealings that I had when I was watching it with my friends in cinema was just....brrrrrrr....spooky. Genious Shyamalan just know how to put every one us in position of his heroes, in this case one, lets say, normal family .Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin and little Abigail Breslin were just great. Because of them (and Shyamalan), movie can show us how we could or would act in their position. That scene when Graham Hess (Gibson) holds a door on one side and an alien who wants to get in on other side is one of the best scenes (Gibsons face) ever made. On other side, there is another story or question, as you wish.People loose their faith more and more every day. This movie has show us what could happen if we have lost our faith. So, people, be strong and never loose your faith, ever. Who knows, is it possible that there is no coincidence? M.Night Shyamalan, one big bravo, for second time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where Shyamalan can do no wrong...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry's review of SIGNS.When Kurt Busiek and Alex Ross reinvented the art of superhero comics with their MARVELS, something rather profound happened to me. For the first time in my life I looked at superheroes from the angle of imagining what it would be like to live in a world where the events that I've seen portrayed in issue after issue of a thousand comics would be thought of by the people living in that world that were. like me. normal and not super at all.It wasn't about the 'hero' shots anymore, where we stay on their plane of existence, but from the point of view of that guy down below looking up at gods, demigods and beings beyond imagination doing things one could not believe. It made me reflect upon fiction as though it were part of my world, it made me reexamine my own take on the medium that I had given so much of my active thought processes over to, and made me think. What if it were real? Then with UNBREAKABLE - M. Night did something that was even more earth-shattering for my thought processes about comic books and super-heroes. What if you've been a super-hero all along, that your own marginal expectations and evaluation of your own abilities have kept you from discovering what you were truly capable of. What if you discovered you were a superhuman, not in the MARVEL UNIVERSE not in the D.C. UNIVERSE or any of those others... But what if you were a superhuman in our world... for real.It is that WHAT IF quality that I love, cherish and adore about M Night Shyamalan.When we were younger and Steven Spielberg could literally do no wrong, I believed in the magic he used to transport me. He took people living in the suburbs, blue-collar types and took them on adventures you couldn't imagine. JAWS, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and E.T. were perhaps the most astonishing. The films he produced like POLTERGEIST, BACK TO THE FUTURE, GREMLINS and YOUNG SHERLOCK HOLMES captivated me with that same. this could be YOUR adventure quality. Even Steven's television show I grew up with. AMAZING STORIES, all of his classic period work was about WHAT IF. From MUMMY DADDY to GHOST TRAIN to THE MISSION to that Alamo episode to the Sid Caesar magician bloke episode. The ideas that flowed from Steven's head back then. all those STORY BY credits he used to have. It is just sad to see that well dry up. Now he's an adaptation boy. Finding other people's stories to tell, and really I miss his own. Perhaps he has no more stories to tell personally. If so, I'm glad that folks like M. Night Shyamalan and Richard Kelly and Charlie Kaufman are around to give the stories that are told on film that personal touch I miss from Steven's films today.For M. Night's grasp of the WHAT IF, I can't help but reflect upon a screening of DESTROY ALL MONSTERS at a Quentin Tarantino Film Festival, where he went into an amazing introduction in regards to the TOHO Universe, where he wished he could make a GODZILLA film that wasn't about the military trying to get Godzilla out of the town, but rather a Woody Allen type of movie set in the Toho Universe Tokyo where. from time to time 300 Ft Tall Monsters could come and destroy everything you know and care about. How these creatures would come to have quasi-religious cults that would worship them, that you would have basic drills just like EARTHQUAKE scares and TORNADO warnings. The Giant Monster Updates on TV and Radio. How the whole of society would be conditioned to deal with the horror in the most normal and accepting manner there could be. Much like the people in George Pal's TIME MACHINE did in regards to Nuclear War. Where it was simply a way of life that was adapted to.There's something wonderful about treating the incredible, in all seriousness, as though it is something that happens in our world and it is no longer a work of fiction and you. your neighbor. your pastors and doctors and law enforcement types have to deal with. FOR REAL. And play it serious, with everything having the weight of reality behind it. That this, for better or worse, is happening in our world, where people die, people get sick and it doesn't necessarily work out for the best. OH. And life will never be the same for anyone after this point.SIGNS is our story about THE WAR OF THE WORLDS. It isn't about the world fighting the aliens and repelling the invaders ala WAR OF THE WORLDS, MARS ATTACKS! or INDEPENDENCE DAY. This is your story. The story of the little family that is caught up in this. They are not the key to it all. They don't discover something profound that drives the aliens away. They are simply one of the millions of stories that would take place, the night the aliens came.This would be like telling the story of Moses from the point of view of some anonymous stone carver that didn't understand why flaming hail was falling from the sky, where the various plagues were coming from, but by the time the Angel of Death rumors start, you better believe he's painting lambs blood over his door, because he's seen *beep* that made him really believe.See, to a large degree that's what M. Night is doing. He's making movies about characters that don't believe in Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny or Harvey, and he's making them believe.As an audience member, I find it my duty to simply let him take me with him on these stories. Just giving myself over to Shyamalan and letting the story take me wherever it may take me.All I really knew about SIGNS was that there were Crop Circles and I think Aliens actually appear in the film. I think. I knew that Mel Gibson played a preacher that didn't believe anymore, that he had a couple of kids and that Joaquin Phoenix played some sort of relative.That's the perfect way to go into this film, because M. Night, Tak Fujimoto, the actors, James Newton Howard and Barbara Tulliver are going to take you on an experience. And when it is all wrapped up at the end, well I just want to see it again. Not for any other reason than to watch possibly the most elegant old school filmmaker working today, tell a story to perfection. Knowing exactly when he wants you to know something, when to hand you a piece of information, what to put in front of our eyes, while giving our ears something else to do. This is just perfect filmmaking for me. It really just feels perfect.Everything exactly the way I love it. There are some tiny things that might bother some folks, because they feel that Shyamalan is talking down to his audience, but I disagree. That moment towards the end of the film isn't about the 'audience' realizing something, but for a character in the film. It is about that character's blink thought - his OX-BOW INCIDENT reflection at the end of all things. Had we not seen his thoughts, for me, the moment would have lost its emotional resonance. It would have simply been. cute. As played, I felt it was perfect. It isn't a huge twist, just a moment of realization, not unlike Chazz Palminteri's character in THE USUAL SUSPECTS.except more subtle and a helluvalot less 'earth-shattering'. Like I said, the scene in question, you'll know it when you see it, isn't about you realizing it, it is about that character realizing it. About it registering for him. Then - it is time to move forward, because that character can finally move forward with what he needs to do. No matter, I loved this scene.Watching this trilogy of films from M. Night has been bliss. A trilogy about believing in the impossible. About dealing with the impossible. About living through the impossible. What a wonderful place to explore.He's done it with razor sharp humor, built out of the situations that the characters find themselves in. For example. the Baby monitor moment in the family car. how that scene evolves, where that scene goes, what that scene does. It feels organic, real and creepy as all hell. There are things to laugh at. nervously and hilariously. but it is grounded in reality.The dog scenes are simple and utter perfection. Just hair on the back of the neck, clicked heels and standing at attention wonderful. Here there is no place for humor, and he knows it. It is so nice to see a filmmaker know exactly when to release tension and when to keep the lid on.The way the television is used, the baby monitor, light, darkness, sounds - specifically the sound in a digitally wonderful surround sound auditorium. BTW - Yes, we're all aware that this film is out there in the digital pirate world, if you *beep* download and watch it this way for the first time. with only a couple of days left. DON'T DO THAT! This is an audience film. The nervous teetering laughter - the genuine shrieks of terror - the applause caused from the delight. This is a film that you let yourself get caught up in the minute to minute reality of the characters on screen and I couldn't help but react emotionally at every turn.The way he directs this family. The relationships between Father and Son. Brother and Sister. Father and daughter. Uncles and nephew and niece. Priest and community. Sheriff and Priest. Killer and Survivor. These relationships are so honestly told. So genuinely affecting and real that I was captivated and entranced. These are real relationships. Real affection, anger, frustration, delight and joy. Real fear. Real scares. Real nerves.The skill and craftsmanship involved in this film is breathtaking. You feel a scene coming that you've seen in a dozen other films, at least, and he unfolds it in a way you've never seen before. When presented with choices he chooses the path less followed. It is very odd seeing this film after FULL FRONTAL, because Soderbergh was playing with some of the same ideas, to unfold a scene in a less obvious way, but when he did it, it felt like he was doing it, whereas here. for me, M. Night's story telling is so consistently compelling and smart that it feels one hundred percent natural. He turns the soil, plants the seed, waters and fertilizes it, watches it grow and harvests the resulting fruit. Oh. and I chowed down like the happy hippo that I am.I don't feel him winking at me during the film. I don't get any smugness or artificiality from his stories. Instead I feel that I've been given a log to sit on, a fire to watch and a story to hear. It feels intimate, genuine and wonderful.M. Night has everything that I once loved to death about Steven Spielberg and Stephen King. He consummately is telling stories about real people in extraordinary situations. These people make choices that I can imagine making. I celebrate in their victories, mourn their losses and retell their stories. After the film, for the first time in a long time, I went out to dinner with the local AICNers that were in attendance and we talked about the film. We had a dinner, we sat around that table and we talked about what we loved, our dreams about more from M. Night and what is to come from him. I've heard rumors that he is interested in doing the JOHN CARTER OF MARS film at Paramount, and I can't even imagine what that would look like. Sort of like imagining what Baz Luhrmann's ALEXANDER THE GREAT project is going to look like. Again. can you imagine?Right now, M. Night is the one filmmaker, above all others, that I want to just transport me. Whom I absolutely trust to tell me a story exactly the way I would dream of having it told to me. Is he the best director working in films today? I think such ideas are ludicrous, that you can place one above all others, but for my sensibilities, my tastes, my way of watching films. Shyamalan is where Spielberg used to be for me. His stories are less IN YOUR FACE with the effects and the scores that he's getting out of James Newton Howard are far more Mikls Rzsa and Bernard Herrmann than they are John Williams. In the end though, for a boy that was brought up on Spielberg, the grown-up version of that boy loves Shyamalan and hopes that the well from which he is pouring from never goes dry.</fullReview>

Night Shyalaman's latest film would give me creeps, just like his previous two.While the film did have some terrifying moments, 'Signs' proved to be an emotionally powerful and very insightful film. While, on the outset, it may be a scary film, 'Signs' is more about the struggle of a family to survive at a time when danger is lurking.I have not seen many films like this- a film that completely consumed me. The last time I saw a film like this was when I watched 'The Blair Witch Project'- another horrifying film, but not without depth, and true beauty.Everybody should see this film.

		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert!! People who didn't like it are definitely not getting it. But that is totally understandable. Signs is a highly symbolic movie.People don't "get it" because North Americans are not used to heavy symbolism in film. The symbolism gives it a "dream-like" quality that is confusing to some. Symbolism is also "alien" to the genre of science fiction.From "The World Treasury of Science Fiction" "So much science fiction was... unreal on one hand, and so concerned with the gritty realities of science and technology on the other, that a majority of educated readers had no interest in learning how to read the genre, a practice easily picked up by children and teenagers - by taking every detail literally at first, until given other direction by the text. This is just the reverse of the way we approach the prose literature..."Science fiction is a product of the post-modern materialist world. A world in which there is no God, and only technology can save us from the random dangers of the Universe. This is precisely the ideology that the filmmaker is against! He even pokes fun at the sci-fi fans with "Dr Biimbo" and the brother's theory on "the nerds".Far from being a science fiction film that needs to conform to the expectations of the genre, Signs is actually out right "anti-science fiction". It doesn't make scientific sense on purpose (how could aliens that melt in water walk around in earths atmosphere, which contains high quantities of water, without environmental suits?), because it's not about science. It's about faith. It's about symbolism.... signs...Most science fiction is written as "what would aliens really be like?" "What is the most realistic alien invasion scenario I can come up with?" Signs isn't like that. In Signs, the aliens are just symbols. The invasion is a symbol. The house is a symbol. The signs are a symbol.So for all the atheist sci-fi fans who didn't "get" the symbolism, here it is put very simply:"when you don't have faith, you are alone in the world. Isolated and vulnerable to the soulless whims of nature. You are like a boy with asthma trapped in the basement of a boarded up house in the middle of nowhere surrounded by invading aliens."That's it. Get it now?This is one of the best films I have seen... until the last five minutes. It has some flaws, but what great work of art doesn't have a few flaws somewhere?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. Shyamalan's first blockbuster "The Sixth Sense" was a phenomenon - not for its quality but for being one of the most overrated movies in decades. Still it had its entertaining moments and the deliberate pace was a recuperation from common Hollywood fare and the maniacal mutilation of scenes by cutting frenziedly around the characters you are supposed to watch and listen to. Then came "Unbreakable" which already was a serious let-down. And now we have "Signs." A movie with a plot so dull that it makes Ed Wood an inspired filmmaker in comparison. A movie so ridiculously xenophobic that it could even make John Milius a serious candidate for the Nobel peace prize. And this inane mess, that "Signs" is, comes from the self-appointed emperor of the esoteric and religious thriller?! When will that kid in the crowd finally step up and point at Mr. Shyamalan exclaiming "But the emperor doesn't wear any clothes."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shyamalan returns, with the weight of having done two remarkable movies on his shoulders. Only two ways, apparently - or he wins, or he fails. Curiously, he manages to do both, unfortunately in the same movie. Here Graham Hess is the main character Shyamalan seems to have a fixation on - the man with something in the past that affects the way he is on the present. The strange crop signals appear, and the menace of Hess' isolated family appear. All is set for a game of creeps and chills fabulously orchestrated by the obviously-gifted Shyamalan. And you will be in the edge of your seat, as a series of creepy encounters happen. If the director had something to prove, it is settled here. As a suspense / mild horror movie, this one gives you the biggest jumps ever this side of The Sixth Sense. And then, comes an ending that, from the man that got us used to have such great endings, is hard to bear. But don't let this spoil the fun. It still remains an excellent thriller, with the quality we seek when we go to the movies to have a good time. And once more it's confirmed: Shyamalan has potential to get to the top. But think it over when you cast yourself into your movie again ok?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My only real gripe with this film: no one does the logical thing when faced with danger and grabs a weapon. The opening titles first surprised me in how they were handled--very nontraditionally. Not anything like a modern horror film. Then I realized it was a tribute to the old title cards of the days of Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock. And as the film unfolded, soon came the realization that the entire film would follow suit.As the visual style paid tribute to directing masters, even the music paid homage to the legendary film composer Bernard Herrmann. And when a director is as well versed with classics as M. Night Shaymalan, a fantastic ride is sure to follow, masterfully cutting between scenes to both narrate effectively and deliver the suspense. The plot approaches the signs realistically as seen through the eyes of one family out in the middle of nowhere.The narrowed down scope gives the film a very intimate feel, we know the characters, there's only a few so we spend time with them and get to know them. We worry when they're in danger, and they're not throwaway nobodies like they would be if the film showed a worldwide scale.Shaymalan displays a great deal of restraint in how he handles the character's reactions-realistic, down to earth in many ways. `There's a monster outside my window, can I have a glass of water?' And the father completely ignores the first half of his daughter's midnight request. I mean, would you believe it? The source of the signs is constantly kept in shadow and creepy lighting, making appearances very briefly on the screen.Are aliens really invading earth or are the signs an elaborate hoax? Shaymalan hints in one direction without giving it away, and with Shaymalan you have to wonder, `Is it really what he seems or is he leading me this way intentionally?' Shaymalan can keep the audience guessing when most directors are either incredibly predictable or incredibly lame trying to get around being predictable. And of course, Shaymalan has an underlying subtle plot point running throughout the film which makes itself apparent at the end.If you can recognize and appreciate salutes to great sci-fi films, and classic filmmakers, Signs is definitely a treat worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Signs. That sounds like an interesting name. What could it mean? What is referred by it? Those are the questions I was asking myself when watching the trailers. I expected it to be about aliens, invasion and sort of Independence Day type deja vu. I was surpassed by a more complex, enriching story."Signs" is loosely based on H.G. Wells' "The War of the Worlds" where aliens attempt to take over the Earth. However, in Shyamalan's version, there is also something else aside from the invaders: faith. Mel Gibson, a former reverend named Graham Hess, has lost his faith in God after a horrible family tragedy and become atheist. Upon these events emerging from crop circles in his fields to all over the world, his close ones, his brother Merril (Joaquin Phoenix) and his two children Morgan and Bo, along with himself, begin to interpret independently what these events could mean. Eventually, they all merge together into one: the end of the world. They must find a way to protect themselves and hope it will "all pass." The scenes have very good acting and emotion to each one.I enjoyed this film. Very much. It's not about why aliens attempt to colonize the earth or how crop circles are made. It's about one thing: a man's journey to realize that there is still something left for him to believe in, to discover whether events happen for a reason, or just "pure luck." There were comic moments in the films that were not intended to be so, but the audience I was with, along with myself, found them to be hilarious, especially Phoenix's character.I urge all those to see it. But do not be drawn into it expecting a sci-fi flic. Simply walk into with an open mind and just let your imagination do the rest. By the way, there were some scary moments that had a HUGE effect on the mood of the film. You'll love them.A solid 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The signs point to a terrible film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains spoilersWhen The Sixth Sense was released three years ago, the previously unheralded M. Night Shyamalan found himself with one hell of a hit on his hands. I watched it with the hype in mind and didn't particularly enjoy it. Yes, the plot twist was good but the rest of the film meandered without aim. Shyamalan's follow-up Unbreakable was given a harder time by critics and audiences alike. I liked it, certainly more than The Sixth Sense, but it was not a film that lingered long in the memory. It was one of those films that you didn't really need to see in the cinema, which is damning it with faint praise but there you go. So it was with some trepidation, and as I was to discover, foolhardiness, that I paid my money to see Signs. I had been warned off it but there was nothing else to see and two hours to kill.I'll get to the point: this film was about as lame as it gets. It was in essence more of the same slop from Shyamalan. One could argue that it's his individualism, a trademark style that permeates all his films. I would argue it is plain laziness. If Shyamalan is trying to make as much money as possible with as little effort, then this film embodies that attitude. Each of his films has a premise that is initially a good one - in Signs it is the ever-intriguing argument of fate versus coincidence. However, Shyamalan fails to flesh out this concept beyond a hushed conversation between Gibson and Phoenix. It is a total waste of a good idea, certainly on a film that quickly falls into the usual 'aliens are coming' trap. I might have been more prepared to accept such a tired old routine if the aliens had done something other than bang a few doors and create immaculate crop circles. How is the audience supposed to buy into the supposed fear of the characters when the intergalactic enemy makes little more nuisance than a bored teenager? The aliens weakness is water, exactly the same as that of Bruce Willis' character in Unbreakable. Shyamalan is recycling his own ideas! Give me strength. And his insistence on putting religion at the heart of his work irks me greatly - the motto of 'keep the faith and everything will be alright' is mawkish, indolent and unrealistic.How many more times can filmmakers expect the public to believe that the alien on screen is not just a tall guy in a green jumpsuit? The scene where you are given your first glimpse of the invaders in a South American home movie is laughable. When are we going to see some imagination used in cinematic close encounters? Are they all going to have heads, legs and arms? A dodgy extra-terrestrial might have been passable if the story was any good. It's not. For a film knocking on for two hours long, absolutely nothing happens. Instead you get the usual 'deep' Shyamalan dialogue, which is in fact pretentious bullshit, trying to mask the absence of plot. His direction is based upon building an eerie atmosphere but if there's nothing going on within that, the viewer is left with nothing to get their teeth in. The film drags its feet so often that I'm surprised it didn't trip over and fall out of the projector. Gibson fails to convince as a man of the cloth (he's too gnarled for that s**t), Phoenix's Merrill is an intense weirdo with some bizarre, apropos of nothing lines and the two kids are plain irritating (they hired a Culkin for Christ's sake).By the time the alien that visits the family farm is killed off - in a manner so damn corny it challenges belief - I was looking forward to doing something other than watch this sorry mess. It cost a reported $70m to make which is arguably the biggest shock of the whole movie. I shall never see another M. Night Shyamalan film as long as I live. He is being spoken of as the next Steven Speilberg (from whom he borrowed a couple of suspense-evoking techniques for this film) but such a suggestion couldn't be wider of the mark. Spielberg can enchant, enthral but above all entertain. When Shyamalan learns to do any of these, somebody let me know. He is, however, a fine con artist, capable of extracting millions of pounds from the public in return for absolutely nothing. If you cannot see through this wafer thin film then you deserve to be visited by a tall man in a green costume in the middle of the night. Just have a baseball bat or a glass of water handy...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot / plot-development of "Signs" is .. almost .. worse than that of "Independence Day". ID's story consisted of nothing else than a chain of plot holes. "Signs" is not much better.Well, I don't go to the movies for realism .. especially not if I watch a Science *Fiction* film .. .. but ..*** warning - spoilers - if you haven't seen the movie yet...Aliens who travel lightyears to go to earth to harvest men .. and to whom water is toxic.. walk around naked without any protection on a planet on which water is quite common... and they walk around not only unprotected but unarmed as well.. and they even don't have the technical skill to remove some simple nailed on planks (while being able to build warp speed space ships).. and they need to punch huge signs into fields to mark their landing points (still while being able to have supertechnological space ships .. with sophisticated cloacing devices).. and then use these signs at night.. and apropos cloacing devices: they are invisible to radar and cannot be seen at bright daylight - but why didn't they turn off their lights at night? .. and so on .. and so on.If the script for "Signs" would have been used in the 1950ies to make a cheap B movie, it would have been o.k. (and certainly funny watching it nowadays), but in the early 21st century? .. such a story? Oh lord have mercy with us poor movie lovers.Sure, technically, this film was a nice piece of cinematic craftmanship, which I enjoyed. But with such a braindead story - it was nothing than a waste of money and time for me to watch this film.I gave it a 3 out of 10. No "1" because of quite good acting and it's good cinematography, sound, editing, etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just like War of the Worlds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the movie Signs a character says, `Just like War of the Worlds.' Although he is talking about the unfolding events of the story, he might as well have been referring to the whole movie. Everything from Night of the Living Dead to The Wizard of OZ is fair game for M. Night Shyamalan's larceny. The whole ridiculously over-dramatized mess has no more substance than an episode of The Outer Limits.And then there is Mr. Shyamalan's acting. Although not quite as embarrassing or self-serving as your typical Quentin Tarantino cameo, the performance is even less credible. Of course, this might be the result of poor direction, which is undoubtedly the case with Mel Gibson. His super stoic portrayal of the protagonist is really a boredom endurance test. And Rory Culkin as his son Morgan is simply just a weak incarnation of another Sixth Sense youngster, but infinitely more nauseating.WARNING: SOME OF THE FOLLOWING MIGHT BE CONSIDERED A SPOILER!Yet, nothing compares to the limp-wrist, semi-naked aliens. These obviously computer-generated bogeymen are not even smart enough to wear protective clothing, control inferior beings, or even escape from a blocked kitchen pantry. They seem to have no weapons. Nor do their intended victims, the inhabitants of a lone farmhouse in the middle of a cornfield, in the middle of nowhere. Maybe they all are just trying to be politically correct. How did these aliens ever manage to travel several light years through space and arrive at Earth?And I'm not even going to touch the advice giving, clairvoyant wife crushed against a tree. I'm amazed that such pabulum impresses so many people. If you need a hokum fix, save your money, stay home, and watch The X-Files.</fullReview>

You didn't see so much Alien's (on screen) in the movie, but that wasn't needed because you always got the feeling that they were present. There were some heart pumping scenes and some where you really felt a tensed feeling.I'm not really good at giving movie's points but I believe that it's worth a10 out of 10And I really recommend you who read this to go and see the movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's difficult to say too much about how good this film is, without giving too much away. As with "Unbreakable" and "Sixth Sense", I found myself waiting for a twist of some sort, and as everything comes to a climax at the end, I was not disappointed. There are some very dark moments, yet having Mel Gibson in the lead allows some careful use of humour to balance this, without lessening the tension and very real menace. I found myself thinking about the film the day after, with the hairs on my neck standing up, it was really that good! Thankfully, it is not a film weighed down with special effects, Shyamalan tells his story through the eyes of Hess. Somehow, it made the terror all the more real, since it is difficult not to like this gentle character. Overall, thank goodness the film industry has talent like M.Night Shyamalan, a storyteller and thought provoking artist at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Signs is the third film of M.Night Shyamalan's short Hollywood career. After critical and commercial success for 'The Sixth Sense', and unfair criticism of the vastly underrated 'Unbreakable', he has opted for a different slant on the theme of Alien invasion. this is not an independence day no-brainer, but an intelligent, thought provoking and original movie. I think I'll struggle to name another film as good this year.The central story revolves around Graham Hess, a former minister who has lost his faith. When mysterious crop circles appear beside his home, a life changing, and faith seeking journey begin. To say much more about the story would spoil it, but suffice to say, it is mind-blowing, and thought provoking at the same time.The direction from Shyamalan is first class, and by a man who clearly knows how to provoke a reaction from the audience. I can't think of another director in Hollywood today who can control the camera quite like he does. Comparisons with the great Alfred Hitchcock come to mind.Overall, this is one the very best films of all time. A bold statement maybe, but nevertheless a true one. I left the cinema with a wide smile on my face as I knew I had just witnessed something very special.Highly, Highly Recommended 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie about gave me a heart attack. That is the degree to which the tension builds in this film.And before continuing, I should like to address the elements many of this film's detractors seem to have seized upon. First, this is not a science fiction film per se. It's not at all about the infamous crop circles about which many Star Trek fans would probably love to see a speculative plot written. Indeed, the science of the story is, at best, somewhat dubious.But trust me, you won't care. 'Signs' is about fear and it's about faith and it's about how difficult it is to confront the former without the latter. And what this director knows, and what so many other directors don't, is that the greatest fear is the fear of the unknown. It's the fear of what you think you see in a split second of videotape. It's the fear of what you think you're hearing just above the static on your baby monitor radio. The fear of what you think is on the other side of the door.This film will have you yearning to crawl into the upholstery of your theatre seat to hide. And unless you want them to have a total nervous breakdown, I'd say leave the kids under 8 at home.It's not a masterwork, but it definitely accomplishes what it sets out to do.See it. You'll love it like I did.This movie review by Erik Gloor</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I' start by saying that i enjoyed Sixth Sense (actually its ending saved it a lot), and even more Unbreakable (it talked to me in deeper way, and i am not even sure why i liked it so much).Now about SIGNS, although i didn't enjoy it that much, i am sure a second view to it would pay off more. (MINOR SPOILERS) Many people critisized it heavily about the water-feared aliens and wondered how could that movie be so full of "stupid" and unrealistic ideas.I'll answer with a question...Didn't anybody see the "stars and moons" holes on the door and windows at the ending? Would a violent, and most of all, REAL alien try to do such a thing?Maybe the arrow-like signs just targeted the troubled homes, the ones that needed "God's help".As the movie said "the are 2 kinds of people, those who get it and those who don't". The aliens WERE the miracle.The thing that actually distracted me from loving the film, was the strong efforts of the director to show-off his directing skills. He made that so obvious, that most of the people were wrongly agreed that it had great camerawork. For me great camerawork is the one that makes you feel inside the movie and not leaving you thinking "nice shooting angle" when you watch it. Same thing for soundtracks.In other words and always according to my personal opinion most people got it completely opposite.. It had great story, but too pretentious directing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What The F**k?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why, oh why, oh why do you people love this film? It seems to have stolen key plot points from other films... Films like Panic Room, The Wizard of Oz, Invasion of the Bodysnatchers and Independence Day all get 'Borrowed' from heavily.I approve that Mr. Shyamalan attempted to include a religious note into the film, but the film as a whole seemed dis-jointed. Hardly flowing from scene to scene, appearing more like a collection of short and mildly related stories. Signs tries to be too many things to too many people, as a result the dischordant family life was washed over rather swiftly before it's resolution. The alien scenes seemed farcical, as if Mel Gibson's fee had taken so much budget the extra terrestrials had to be made of rubber. Cheap rubber.The acting and directing are first class (Mostly) but it cannot save a lack-lustre film/script from being disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS... M. Night Shyamalan's new movie is, apparently, according to the promotional material plastered over every wall, bus and poster site in town, about crop circles. Imagine my surprise, therefore, when, upon finally seeing this movie, it turned out to be about a priest who has lost his faith, and eventually gets it back. It is also about the priest's brother, who could have been a great baseball player, but never quite managed it. It is also about the priest's kids, who have dreams, and who refuse to drink tap water cos it's "contaminayyydid". Oh, and there are some crop circles and some aliens who hover over our major cities (See Woody Allen's "The UFO Menace" for a possible explanation of why aliens like to hover) for a while. Confused? You will be. You will think that you have seen nine tenths of an utterly superb and gripping movie, with one tenth of an eminently silly and preposterous Hollywood slop-fest. M. Night (as we in the know call him) knows how to make a great movie. Many scenes, even (especially) the most innocuous ones, crackle with menace and tension. Characters appear from behind other characters' backs, the camera pans to reveal that people are in the room when a scene has been going on for ages without them, objects loom in the foreground and move to reveal events in the middle distance (there's a great shot that starts with two dogs going left and right, to reveal the crop circle). He's learned a great deal from Spielberg and from Hitchcock (check out the great opening titles and music) - two pretty good people to try and learn from, you must agree. He knows that less is more. The aliens are only glimpsed, which makes them much more scary - a leg here, a hand there, a chopped-off finger over there in the corner, by the door... Perhaps the most awe-inspiringly brilliant and spine-tingling scene is the one in which we see the alien for the first time, in amateur video footage from Brazil (I think) showing kids at a birthday party running from one window to the other, shrieking with delighted terror, with the camera craning over them to try to see, and then, suddenly, when we think we can't stand it any more, there is a crash of discordant music on the soundtrack, and there it is, walking across the alley in a split second, staring at the camera. Brilliant. I'm getting goose-bumps right now, just thinking about it. Which makes the rest of this review all the more difficult to write, because the rest of the film is, well, a bit crap. Mel and the family barricade themselves in the house (why?) and the aliens attack, pausing long enough to allow Mel to tell both his kids a heart-warming story about when they were born (I'm not making this up). Aliens attack. Brother wacks alien with baseball bat. Water kills alien. Aliens bugger off. It's a Mini adventure. Mel's faith is restored. Great, if you're a religious person, I suppose. But for an atheist like me, this ain't no happy ending, man. And for a science-fiction/horror buff, it's not up to much either. Why have these aliens come to a planet covered in water, with water in the very air they must be breathing, only to find out, after several days, that water kills them? Did I miss something? Is that it? Spurious references to the Middle East don't wash, either. What M. needs to do, and quickly, is make a film from someone else's script, otherwise he's going to end up with a CV crammed with intelligent, gripping but ultimately disappointing thrillers, oh, and "The Sixth Sense" (which was pretty well perfect, wasn't it?). "Signs" is pretty damn good, for most of its running-time, but the last few minutes will leave you wanting something more, and something less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your average Alien movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing "The Sixth Sense" which to me was a really amazing movie, I was a little disappointed with Shyamalan's "Unbreakable". So I was really eager to see if "Signs" could tell me if "the 6th Sense" had just been a lucky shot or if "Unbreakable" was just a little bump in the road. And to tell the truth, despite what others might say, "Signs" is an amazingly good movie. It just proves to me that Shyamalan is a great director (and a good actor too, cos he's in the movie as well).Some will say that "Signs" is just a mix of various other movies (The Birds, War of the Worlds, Encounters of the third kind,...) but that just proves they are missing the point of the whole movie. This movie isn't about the aliens. No. It's about a family coming closer together in adversity. The alien-story is almost secondary, but i liked it nonetheless (the part where they show the alien in Brazil is really scary).The characters are recognizable to everyone and that really isn't that obvious in a science-fiction/thriller movie. Whatever bad (or good) thing happens to the family, you can always relate to them. Mel Gibson is great in this movie (almost as good as in "Braveheart") as are Joaquin Phoenix and both kids. This film is good because like every other Shyamalan movie it has a message: nothing ever 'just happens' by accident. Most things happen for a purpose. And as you'll watch, you'll find out too.So to be brief: This isn't a story about Aliens invading earth but a story of a family coming closer together (during an Alien invasion).I give it 8 out of 10.Have fun watching! It's most certainly worth it.</fullReview>

More than once i found myself grabbing the seat or jumping off it.The most shocking parts were not things you see but rather things hinted by shadows, noises and movement from the corner of the eye.For sure one of the best movies in 2002.</fullReview>

I haven't been so bored by anything since I gave another two hours of my life up at VANILLA SKY last year. The first act had me scratching my head trying to follow the plot. In the second act I was battling following asleep. By the third act I smiled a lot because the film then seemed a bit clever the way it wrapped itself up. I say a bit?definitely not enough to save this turkey. It will surely be top of my TEN WORST LIST for this year. A MUST MISS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scariest movie ever with brilliant actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read many comments about this movie and many seem to have missed what this movie was about. Most who gave the film a bad rating complain about aliens who act not logically, about bad acting, about a bad plot and so on... First who on earth wants to say that he fully understands an absolutly unknown alien race? There are no hints in the movie why or from where they came, we just know that they are hostile. I cannot understand those guys who think that all aliens have to look like humans and think like humans with a specific trait (like in Star Trek). I see no reason why a brutal but technologically advanced alien species shouldn't be doing any mistakes (even grave ones!) Humans are the best example that sometimes they are intelligent and sometimes stupid beyond imagination.To the actors: All acting was brilliant, and if you ever witnessed people under enormous stress or in panic, than nothing the protagonists did seems ridiculous or unbelievable. The dining scene where Mel Gibsons freaks out is absolutly terrifing because you can see the terror of the occuring dangers in the way the protagonists behave.The plot: All the plot is about the feeling of lonelyness. A familiy lives far away from other persons and far away from big cities in the middle of nowhere, the main protagonist has become distanced from god and when the aliens arrive this terrible feeling of being alone is rising to a unbearable level when the tv-stations stop airing and the hushing feet of stranges can be heard outside the doors. Of course the director is spicing everything up with a certain moment of realization in the end. The film is terrifying and scary, and when being confronted with these poor beings when all hope is falling to pieces and the end of the world seems to be imminent all your own problems suddenly seem to be insignificant. The film is able to convey the terror of the protagonists directly to the viewer, and therefore it's a masterpiece of modern horror-movies. Just don't watch this movie if you never let yourself emotionally influenced by a movie and if you are unable (or unwilling) to understand and sympathize with people in deep trouble. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

Night Shyamalan also is in a supporting character, as Ray.Director, producer and writter Shyamalan has never done such a good job. THE SIXTH SENSE were great, but UNBREAKABLE was bad. SIGNS is convincing, scary and entertaining thriller packed with dramatic, mystery and excitment.Phoenix is better than in GLADIATOR!

		<shortDescription>Thematically Frayed; Unintegrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the glowing receptions, both critically and popularly, for "Signs", M. Night Shyamalan's third descent into the underworld of horror thrillers, I was ultimately disappointed by his laughable take on the phenomenon of crop circles. As far as I'm concerned, out of all the movies Shyamalan has made, only one, "Sixth Sense" (1999), has actually succeeded in raising demons, let alone eyebrows, for me; and even "Sixth Sense", stylish as it was, was quickly outdone in two years by Alejandro Amenabar's genuinely terrifying reworking of the gothic ghost story genre, "The Others"(2001).It's sad to see a sci-fi thriller with potential like "Signs" flop into a banal puddle of theistic pop-psychobabble and jejune derivations from "War of the Worlds". The first half of "Signs" was slightly creepy and chilling due to an unnervingly tense atmosphere, and it seemed that Shyamalan is sticking to his tried-and-true method of scaring his audiences with what they can't see, rather than what they can. But when the not-so-little green men began popping out of the cornfield; and Mel Gibson - thinly disguised as an Anglican minister-turned-atheist - with his whiny, snot-nosed offspring, was forced to retreat to the cellar of his dismal farmhouse to escape the inevitable, it became sadly clear that the final confrontation would not produce a suitably chilling "whodunit?" surprise ending, typical of "Sixth Sense" and "The Others", but rather a preachy, self-satisfied response to the question of whether Mel Gibson will regain his lost faith. Uninspired and lackluster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not scary, not funny and not making any "sense" at all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I keep hearing how scary this movie was, but can't connect at all with that thought. Well the only thing I find scary is that so many people actually enjoy something as irrational and unnecessary as this movie. Nothing really makes any "sense" in "signs". The director seems to be somehow unable to make up his mind as to where he wants the movie to lead to and then abruptly ends it with some vague explanation of how the earth was won back again when you never once even got the slightest feeling that it was taken by the aliens. I read this spot on review somewhere and I just need to quote from it here: *spoilers*"I'm Mel Gibson and there's a crop circle in my backyard. Cue daughter screaming for no apparent reason. Cut to my 9 year old son who just stabbed a German Shepherd to death with a fork. Yes with a fork.""I'm an alien, behold my superior problem solving skills as I run around at night waking up neighbors and jumping on roofs for no apparent reason. Nevermind rational explanation. We're ALIENS!""I have hind legs powerful enough to jump up 10 feet onto rooftops, the technology to conquer the non-trivial challenge of intergalactic space travel, but I'll be DAMNED if I can kick down this wooden door." "Oh S**t, 5 minutes left in the movie! Not enough time for a plausible ending, let's just allude to a victory over the aliens with a vague reference to the Middle East.""F**k me in the Ozarks! You humans found our weakness: water. Yes, we failed to realize that water - the most abundant substance on your planet - would kill us although we can walk freely without wearing bodysuits despite all the natural humidity and water vapor in your atmosphere. Aaaargh!"That about sums it up doesn't it? The movie is plain stupid.</fullReview>

The story is interesting, the visual style brilliant, if there were not...well... The mike has been dangling all through the whole picture. It just destroyed the whole scenery. Perhaps, it will win the Oscar for the "Best Supporting Actor". But regardless to this really BIG goof (Am I the only one noticing that?), I can only recommend this film to all of those out there who like their X-Files-style-pics with a litte bit "drama". What annoyed me a bit was the religious aspect. It is obvious from the first ten minutes on, that Mel will find his believe and will be priest again. Isn't it? Nevertheless, 8 out of 10, I hope this one will stay in the Top 250 for a long time (My favourite of M. Night)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(WARNING: MAJOR PLOT SPOILERS.) Signs is a tremendous movie. Its cuts to the chase very quickly but still holds great tension and is very effective. OK, there isn't a twist in the end, but so what. When I was watching the movie I kept thinking,"the twist is coming any minute now". But then I realised that a twist wasn't the way to go. It would establish Shamalyan as being a one-dimensional director who can only direct the one kind of movie. Well I'm glad that Signs broke the link, its all for the better.The acting is limited but works very well with what it has. Its leads Gibson and Phoenix are excellent. Luckily, the children aren't typical brattish swines,ie. Spy Kids. And thank the Lord they aren't cocky snobs either, ie. Rupert Grint, Emma Watson. M. Night Shamalyan even has a small part in the film and has developed a good American accent, (speech coaches, a plenty).I enjoyed Signs just as much as I liked Unbreakable and The Sixth Sense. I can't wait for his next movie. 8.2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Signs, Graham Hess suddenly finds odd shapes in his farm crops. He thinks that it's all just an elaborate scheme conducted by nerds, until his two children start acting odd. As the movie progresses, more and more eerie events occur, Graham now sees figures outside of his house at night, and odd looking figures walking around in his crop fields. His kids and his brother know that it's an Extra Terrestrial, but he still thinks that it's people playing pranks on him. Signs maintains a very charismatic, freakish tone to it. The difference between Signs and previous M. Night Shyamalan films, is that the Signs has more supernatural elements to it. In Unbreakable, there was no eerie tone to it, and in Sixth Sense, there was an eerie tone, but did not feature aliens, or anything related. The greatest part of Signs, is the fact that the film has a very unique and original plot, and the acting was pretty good. Mel Gibbson's plays as Graham Hess, a man who has recently lost his wife, and since then, he has also lost his faith in God. Mel's character has somewhat of a sense of humor. I think that the best part of Signs, was the odd looking aliens. Those were very spooky. I REALLY hated the ending though, everyone said that it had a complete twist in the ending, but it does not. Right now, M. Night Shyamalan has an unbelievably great reputation. Kudos to M. Night Shyamalan for making this piece of art. Great movie, very freaky ass, had great acting, REMARKABLE story, but a very bad ending. Overall, Signs is definitely great. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the movie offered it's fair share of suspense and intrigue for most of the running time, the terrible ending completely ruins this film.SPOILER WARNINGAre these the dumbest aliens ever to appear on the big screen?In the first place, why does a super intelligent species need to make crop circles in order to navigate earth, when they are capable of the mind boggling navigation feat of interstellar space travel? Perhaps they made "dust circles" on asteroids en route.Why, when you presumably know the planet is abundant with water, not wear a simple space suit to protect yourself?Where are their weapons to defend themselves? They have their special gas squirter, but no guns? That alien at the end just stands there taking a beating, and does nothing to defend itself, despite displaying incredible athletic abilities earlier in the film.The end of this movie is so rife with contrivances, that, for me at least, it ruined the relatively enjoyable sequences leading up to it.3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE SIXTH SENSE Part III</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT Who told M. Night Shyamalan that it is really cool to make the same movie over and over again? Let's remember: (*Spoilers!*) In THE SIXTH SENSE we have a middle-aged man (Bruce Willis) with lots of personal problems who - with the support of a smart weirdo-kid - finds out that he is a ghost (Surprise!!!). In UNBREAKABLE we have a middle-aged man (Willis again) with lots of personal problems who - with the support of his not-so-smart weirdo-son - finds out that he is a super-hero (Surprise!!!). In SIGNS we have a middle-aged man (Mel Gibson) with lots of personal problems who - with the help of his two weirdo-kids - finds out that he is a kind of super-hero priest who uses his faith in God to destroy the aliens (Surprise!!!).The worst thing about Shyamalan and these identical storylines is, that these seem to work very well for most moviegoers and that his movies make such lots of money... I was surprised when I read all the positive reviews of SIGNS in the US and compared them to those published in Europe, nearly all of which were bad ones. I wonder if there are really such deep cultural gaps between America and Europe and why some groups of people seem to be so attracted by these kind of paranoia-movies and some don't.And another thing...Well, I don't have a problem with kids given a main role in movies. Actually, Haley Joel Osment was great in SIXTH SENSE. But he didn't feel 'real', more like a superior being. That's OK because that was the character he played. The children in SIGNS are very similar to Osment's character... but they don't show any emotion!!! What's up with these kids? Is it the actors' lack of talent or does M. Night Shyamalan think that little children behave like that? Examples? - The family dog is killed by the son: No emotions. ([calm] "Dad, the dog is dead.") - The little daughter sees an alien at night: No emotions ("I can't sleep. Wanna drink some water.") - (*Spoiler*) Imagine a six year-old girl which has to see how an alien tries to kill her brother... What would she do? Scream? Cry? Lose consciousness? Well, in SIGNS she just watches the scene and mumbles some weird stuff about the water which will ultimately kill the alien.What's a movie where all the characters feel so unreal that I don't care about them? A bad one, from my point of view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having always been fascinated by crop circles, and being a fan of both Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix, I was really looking forward to this. I was disappointed with Unbreakable, but had a feeling this would make up for it, and it more then did. It's SCARY. Thankfully scaring us with the UN-seen rather then the seen, this really makes you sit on the edge of your seat. Mel Gibson is of course fab, and Joaquin Phoenix is as usual marvellous, and providing much of the laughs inbetween the gasps of fear! Clever, thought provoking, and marsterly directed, this will no doubt keep the crop-circled fields of England a source of interest!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is what a movie should be: scary, suspensful, mysterious, and wonderful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1999, 2 films were written by a little known director who made 2 films before: "Praying With Anger" (1992) and "Wide Awake" (1998). The director's name: M. Night Shyamalan. The 2 1999 films: Co-writing "Stuart Little" and "The Sixth Sense," which he also directed. With "The Sixth Sense" becoming an international hit (becoming the #1 thriller of all time, getting positive reviews, nominated for 6 oscars-BEST PICTURE, BEST DIRECTOR, BEST SCREENPLAY, BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR, BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS, and BEST FILM EDITING, and grossing almost $300 million), Shyamalan is at the top of his game. Now, it's 2000 and with "The Grinch" becoming the #1 B.O. hit of 2000 (grossing over $260 million), Shyamalan decided to switch from dead people to superheroes/comic books with "Unbreakable." During it's release, the film got mixed reviews and grossed almost $100 million. Now, it's 2002, and "Spider-Man" is the #1 B.O. hit (grossing over $400 million), Shyamalan again switched from dead people to superheroes/comic books to crop signs/aliens and decided to use Mel Gibson instead of Bruce Willis as the main character. The new movie is called "Signs," and it's getting alot of positive buzz. Well, after being bugged by my friends every day since the first day of school, I finally saw the movie on a Saturday. AND IT WAS THE SCARIEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!!! Scarier than "The Sixth Sense" (which I loved) and scarier than both "The Blair Witch Project" and "The Exorcist" (which they both sucked). M. Night Shyamalan has done it again. For those of you who enjoy thrillers, then "Signs" is your movie. Plus, I'll be waiting for Shyamalan's next movie. I like to see what he does next.A+ ****** (out of ****** stars) 13/13</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Signs is Independence Day without the spectacle. It is full of suspense and heart.It's been awhile since I've watched a movie and felt like I was literally on a roller-coaster. The audience would gasp and fly back into their chairs as if we were headed down a steep incline. Just as we would relax, bam! Another twist and scare!The suspense harkens to the best of Hitchcock. The music is haunting, much as John Carpenter's "Chiming Bells" from "Halloween." Like "Halloween," there is no slasher-type close-ups and then bam, a big scare. But many times you feel the scares coming, a la "Jaws," and there's nothing you can do to stop them. You just have to ride it out!Some complain about the subplot, but it adds the heart to the movie. Without it, this movie would never have stood up so well to "XXX" and the other competition of summer, 2002.Go for it. Watch for the "Signs." And enjoy the ride!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The genre's of Family Drama and Suspenseful Thriller.they don't really fit together. or do they?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Signs", the newest from director M. Night Shyamalan, has revived a nearly extinct art form-- True Suspense. This absolute skill requires four basic but necessary components: complex characters, at least two story lines of different genre, a filmmaker that thinks past the commercial success and looks through to the genuine idea of the movie, and a soundtrack that is more chilling than the show could ever wish. "Signs" reaches all of these goals and exceeds them with a tremendous amount of heart and terror (unfortunately, I have limited space to write so I am going to focus on the first two rules predominately).As per all of Shyamalan's movies, the characters are the most intriguing puzzle piece of the movie. Mel Gibson portrays Graham Hess, an Episcopalian minister that converts to atheism after the heartbreaking death of his wife. His two young children (Rory Culkin and Abby Breslin, both are extraordinary child actors whom I am excited to see more from) are trying to cope with the loss of their mother and adjust to the complete transformation of their father. Joaquin Phoenix plays Merrill Hess, an uncle and brother that acts as the `fill-in father' while Graham is mourning over his wife. The idea of a newly single parent isn't new to Shyamalan's films though, in `The Sixth Sense' the mother of Haley Joel Osment is a single parent and in `Unbreakable' Bruce Willis is ready to divorce his wife and leave his child for a career in New York.Going into the movie, I expected a mind-blowing thriller about aliens attacking the planet while a farming family defends their home-and that I did receive. What I didn't expect was the profound force of the metaphysical and heartbreak surrounding all of the characters. While most will argue this is a film about aliens, I will contradict and say this is a film of survival. Images of aliens terrorizing children and the unmistakable sounds of an alien in a cornfield will stick with you as you drive home, but so will the touching speeches given by Mel Gibson and the fact that fate and faith guides us and the message that whatever happens has happened for a reason. That my friends, is the moral of this story, unlike some alien movies that teach us big guns and a lot of ammo will resolve anything.Though `Sixth Sense' brought Night into day, `Signs' will allow him the opportunity to be a legend in filmmaking. Some compare Night to Hitchcock and Spielberg, but Night has formed his own niche in the motion picture industry, now, others will be compared to him. The true test of a movie is whether or not you can describe the emotion and significance in a single sentence, if you can, then you have just wasted your time on a movie. The nearest thing to a single sentence summary for `Signs' is. A reverend turned atheist must protect his family and reconsider his beliefs when a worldwide phenomena touches his home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worse horror movies I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This looks like a movie that was made for kids. There is not a single moment where I felt really scared. Sure, there are a few times when you might be shaken up because of a stunning moment in the film, but there are basically no more than 3. Instead of being scared, I was laughing a lot more during the movie.I also noted that M. Night Shyamalan, (the director), does not know how to be a team player. Not only he directed, produced and wrote the film, he also decided to play a role in it. What for? After watching his two prior films, The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, I came to realize that he falls in the same cliche over and over. He always wants to make a twist and a breakthrough at the end of each film for the audience to marvel themselves, but this time, the trick did not exactly work. However, it seems that the American society likes to watch the same things, so I guess I have to give him the credit of knowing how to sell his product.I am starting to think that Shyamalan's ability of creating original ideas, is running out, for none of them so far outcomes his first hit, The Sixth Sense. I am hoping that he comes up with something smarter next time, otherwise, I will definitely never recommend any of his movies again.Be smart, and do not waste your money, wait till it comes on T.V.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This really was a strange one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2 hours after coming back from the cinema and I still don't know what to make of this one. On one hand is the utterly outstanding direction. Night Shyalaman is an absolute master of cinematography. He knows exactly what to show in each scene, and how to build up suspense. He knows how to surprise you incredibly effectively. On the other hand is the slight damp squib of the story.SLIGHT SPOILERS:Basically the point of this movie is less about the supernatural and more about faith. It seems that the principle is to see how far we can be pushed before we're rewarded, and ultimately what we're willing to believe.SPOILERS OVER:The performances are good, and Shyamalan once again puts in a small cameo, and very well acted it is too. Basically the story is about something very strange happening on Gibson's character's farm. They appear to be signs, but what do they mean, and what's making them? Ultimately it's so immaculately conceived it's easy to look at the good parts and forget that it doesn't seem to be a story which is what is necessarily expected. Whether that's a good or bad thing is up to you.I'd certainly recommend it, but what you get out of it is up to you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tonight I'm still in shock, after sitting through "Signs". This has to be the scariest film I've seen for years ! After a relatively ordinary opening, the film gradually builds to a genuinely terrifying climax.Based on the traditional principle that what you don't see is often far more scary than what you do the director masterfully wrings every last drop out of his material and ties up all the clues to produce one of the best films of the year.The whole of the relatively small cast is just excellent, and Mel Gibson has never been better. However, even he is acted off the screen by his young co-star Abigail Breslin.Tell all your friends to go and see this movie - just don't do it alone !</fullReview>

The elements for a great movie are all there, they simply fail to have a sequence or to flow in a coherent manner and at times it goes way beyond unbelievable, I did end up thinking that Independence day was more believable than many parts of this movie. I don't recommend it but guess one has to see it to make up his or her own mind, specially in view of the many positive comments posted here.</fullReview>

The alien invasion story is padded out with a (truly horrifying) back-history about the main character (Mel Gibson)'s wife - disappointing for sci-fi fans. The director offers virtually no information on the alien race, and what is offered seems absurdly naive. This movie isn't worth watching even for the sometimes humourous plot improbabilities - its the kind of film that sucks your sense of humour out of you!</fullReview>

The mind-boggling coincidences, patheticly obvious foreshadowing, cheesy messages relentlessly hurled at the viewer, glaring plot holes, silly use of technical concepts, and all around poor quality can not even BEGIN to counteract the few genuinely creepy or scary sequences. Even if you buy into the explanation that the entire movie was a dream (which I don't) then the idea was not implemented well if only 1 out of every 5000 people got it. In addition, the dream explanation degrades the entire movie into a churchy, "how could I ever have doubted my faith?" piece of garbage! If you see this movie, I'm sorry! If you like this movie, I pity you! If you vote to keep this movie in the top 250, I hate you with a passion the likes of which you've never seen!1 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, "Signs" is a misunderstood masterpiece. I can forgive anybody who hated the movie's unrepentant desire to be about something other than an alien invasion, even though it contains an alien invasion. As consumers of cinematic adventures based on interaction with alien beings, we're not used to seeing films that ask you to think this way about it. Spielberg's "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" is a great example of what I'm talking about, and although it's a completely different kind of film, "Signs" is the flip side of the same coin. Spielberg's film was hopeful and featured aliens who we can assume were benignly curious about us. Both films are not about the actual aliens, but rather about the way the knowledge of intelligent alien life changes the characters. "Signs" takes a different route and gives us human beings coping with the arrival of alien beings with hostile intentions.That is where the drama and wonder lies in "Signs". The characters are vividly created, both at the level of the script and in the acting. There's not a bad actor among them. Ultimately the film doesn't want to show you the aliens, although it does and they are very creepy. People have been making movies about this kind of scenario since the dawn of cinema, but rarely is a movie made that takes its terror not from what the aliens are and not from what they do, but from how the human characters come to terms with the fact that not only are we not alone in the universe, but that these extraterrestrials mean us harm, and we have not yet figured out how to fight them. Not many films are able to make me feel truly afraid no matter how many times I see them, but "Signs" is one of those. The scenes of the small family trying to fend off alien creatures who are trying to break into their home are presented entirely from the point of view from inside the house, a lot like the climactic bird attack in "The Birds". They're unsettling and terrifying.I don't understand why the film's detractors insist on going over perceived plot holes to make the point that the film is bad. Sure it's foolish of the alien race to try and engage human beings in battle on a planet covered with water, something that destroys them. Look at the foolish things human beings do all the time--although our mistakes are on a much smaller scale, what is so preposterous about an unknown enemy being so egotistic to think that they could pull off their invasion despite their own weaknesses? We don't understand anything about them other than what is right on the surface. We can't comprehend their race, let alone their motivations, and there are numerous reasons why they could be doing what they're doing. Perhaps they are raiding Earth out of desperation, despite their aversion to water. Maybe they have never encountered liquid water, or are just learning how harmful it really is for them. Maybe they learned this well into their attack plan, but their own desperation or hubris made them attempt it anyway. Perhaps we're the only other life in the universe they've encountered, and they don't have a choice. Perhaps they're so intelligent they lack common sense--and who hasn't known a human being like that at one time or another? Whatever the reason, "Signs" isn't about that. It's about the way that irrefutable proof of alien life would change us as human beings, and make us consider what is important to us and what is meaningful. Not only that, its impact comes from the small family at its core and how they are coming to terms with their own tragedy. The fact that the father's crisis of faith seems counterintuitive to the film's revelations doesn't particularly bother me--personally, I think the arrival of alien beings on Earth would result in such madness and terror that the aliens would not even have to invade for us to destroy ourselves. As human beings, much of our self image and our morality depends on us being the highest form of life in the universe, the very center of a universe created by a God that we believe is fixated on us and what we're doing. Such irrefutable proof of something bigger in the universe than us would disrupt all of that, and result in mass hysteria and possibly the unraveling of our society. "Signs" is the only movie I've seen that has attempted to take on these issues realistically, since it shows us its main characters losing this innocence and being fearful of what will replace it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best movies i have ever seen signs has just the right elements to grab atleast one academy award. People critisizing the movie are those who didnt get the story right....The movie may have some flaws but its forgotten by the screenplay of shyamalan. Mel gibson joquan phoenix had done their best. The cinematography is awesome.shyamalan scared us just using the most common objects like TV and Baby Monitor.The film shows how every major event or some unusual habits can be the signs of a greater thing to come. It will help you understand why an unusual habit of yours may be helpful in future and which may change the course of yourlife and i realised that something like that happened in my life. One of my unusual habits saved my life. The unusual habits and events that occur in your life are the signs of something you are about to face. The movie shows Bo's fear of contaminated water and morgons asthama phoenix's old bat and mel gibson's wife's death and her last words, all the above save them from the hostile alien.Over all the title signs itself gives you creeps when you think really deep. and the music and the background score especially the title sequence is breathtaking.I never get scared by horror flicks but this scared me in a very unusual way as it is something close to my life.anyways this movie has become one of my all time favorites. Critics please dont give a wrong opinion and scare people away from watchin the movie which will obviously scare them.I gave this movie 10/10 and its worth watching it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan's SIGNS is one of the most remarkable displays of sheer craftsmanship triumphing over vacuous material that I have seen in years. A former minister turned farmer who has recently lost his wife in a grisly car accident wakes up to find his Pennsylvania cornfield bedecked with a trio of huge crop circles, the husks flattened as if by an imaginary , unseen giant. As Graham Hess ( Mel Gibson ) and his younger brother and two children look on , trying to fathom what has caused this phenomenon, director Shyamalan very cleverly wraps the audience around his cinematic green thumb : questions abound - have aliens invaded the Hess property , or have a local gang of troublesome goons decided to wreak havoc on this good man's family? And what about the eerie sounds being picked up by a seemingly ordinary baby monitor? At other times porch chimes clink in a mad cacophony of sound and a child's swing set moves erratically, not by a sudden breeze but a menacing presence that has just slipped into that cornfield beyond. All this is orchestrated by a master film technician having great fun keeping the viewer on the edge of his seat. When the film starts to get heavy with portentous signs of Armageddon ( alien spacecraft are seen hovering over major cities of the world , compliments of a CNN -like newscast ) , Shyamalan leavens the mood with unexpected, goofy moments of humor ( brother Merrill becomes a manic t.v. news junkie, the two kids don homemade aluminum foil hats that look like giant Hershey Kisses .) As the film draws toward its by now not very surprising conclusion, one is amazed out how this incredibly talented young filmmaker has milked a plot so devoid of substance and yet has made a movie that is by and large a riveting experience. He borrows shamelessly from Hitchcock (check out those elegant opening credits and James Newton Howard's magnetic, Bernard Herrmann influenced score ) but he also has his own very definite strengths. Aside from a brilliant mastery of editing and sound design , Shyamalan knows how to bring out the best in actors. Mel Gibson gives his most relaxed and appealing performance in a long time. Joaquin Phoenix displays an immensely likable, goofy charm as the brother and last but not least, the two kids are terrific. Rory Culkin , so good in YOU CAN COUNT ON ME , has a precocious flippancy that provides much needed humor and Abigail Breslin as his younger sister Bo is absolutely adorable; both children emerge as real kids, no small achievement. As to what lurks in those mysterious cornfields, I'll leave that to the uninitiated. The cornfields may be hollow, and you may feel that you've been had by film's end , but M. Night Shyamalan is a ingenious huckster who has you believing while you're watching his teasing, thorny thicket of a movie.</fullReview>

You actually see it walking down the street and close up in a house. And then the movie fell from a perfect 10 to a horrible 1! It lost all credibility and I was laughing through the last part of the movie. This is a shame because the director really has caught this "there is something out there vibe" it was really intense. But it ended up as a plain big budget b-movie after you actually saw the object of terror! Shame on you M. Night Shyamalan !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signs is a truly frightening and expertly engineered reinvention of the "alien invasion" sub-genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan has finally completely convinced me of his creative genius by following up two brilliant films(both surprising and powerfully original explorations of familiar and time-worn genres)-The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable-with yet another that not only lives up to his previous works, but in some aspects even surpasses them. Signs is everything I hoped it would be, and definitely more-Shyamalan has personalised the "alien invasion" sub-genre, which has spawned explosive and grandiose special-effects laden blockbusters like Independence Day as well as classics like War of the Worlds and Invasion of the Body Snatchers, with truly amazing results. In Signs, Shyamalan focuses on a single family, and (might be considered a SPOILER)unfolds a worldwide alien invasion through their eyes, wrapping this entire scenario with an issue of lost faith. What results is riveting, truly frightening, moving, funny, meaningful, in turns, and most importantly of a palpable intensity that is so lacking in most newer "horror films", or most films of any genre in recent times, that it will leave the viewer breathless and completely taken aback-most pleasurably, that is. Note that pleasure is used simply for lack of any other word-Signs will do far more than stimulate the nerves with mild entertainment. It moved me to heights of emotion, be it fear, anxiety, nervousness, sadness, and many other hues of the mental spectrum. Signs is cinematic art- visuals, acting, sound, music, and pure, throbbing creativity combine to make it an unforgettable experience. Go see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow...Signs was...wow....To put it into perspective, I have NEVER cried at a movie from sheer fright until now!! I would recommend taking an emotionally stable friend (or one with severe ADHD who can't focus long enough to know what's going on) along for the ride since you'll be freaking out to no end!!Though there is a long stretch of time where you just keep WAITING and WAITING for something to happen, and are forced instead to gaze into Mel Gibson's beautiful...sexy...baby blues (ew, and he's, what? 50? geez that's old!), the last half of the movie will make you darn near pee your pants in sheer terror @_@ Shalyaman's portrayal of one single family's reaction to world-shattering events, a slice of life rather than a grandiose perspective, was nothing less than cinematic genius. The setting was all too perfect...cornfields are scary enough to begin with, but throw in a few spandex-clad "aliens" (not a spoiler!), and you have a recipe for fright. And I've resorted to cliches to describe Signs...*sigh* ~_~But despite my praises for a filmmaker FINALLY making a genuine scary movie, it's still the kind you only really need to see once. Otherwise it loses part of its suspenseful magic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains Spoilers!! I'm led to believe by the trailer that it's going to be a really scary movie.What do I get? A bible thumping "priest lost his faith" piece of crap with some crop circles and aliens thrown in so they can market it as a scary movie.I have no problem at all if they wanted to make a movie about a priest who lost his faith, my problem is that I was mislead by the trailer they released into thinking it was something it wasn't. Had I known what this movie was going to be I wouldn't have seen it. In fact, I know a lot of people who wouldn't have seen it and I think the people in charge of marketing this movie knew it as well. That's why they released such a misleading trailer.This movie was not scary at all. There were maybe 2 or 3 scenes that were actually scary, and the only reason I was then was because of a quiet scene suddenly interrupted by a loud noise.I won't even get into all the problems with the plot, it's been covered already by many reviewers who have said exactly the same thing I'm saying only much better.There were only two good actors in this movie: Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix. The chick that played the cop was just horrible.Even worse than this movie is the people who seem to think they're smarter than the rest who say `The people who gave this movie a bad review just didn't get it.' I got the movie just fine, but it was a falsely advertised, badly acted, horribly written and terribly directed pile bat dung. I laugh even more at the people who try to excuse this piece of trash by saying `It was a dream.' I think they're wrong, and even if it was a dream from a child's point of view, that doesn't excuse the fact that it was a bad movie!1/10? I want 2 hours back. The only reason I don't ask for my money back also is because it's not the theaters fault someone made a stupid movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A waste of time, a waste of talent...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is obvious enough to anyone who watches "Signs", that as a child, the writer/director, M. Night Shyamalan, absolutely adored Spielberg's "Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind" and "E.T". And rightfully so.But as a grownup, we could at least expect him to show a little bit of novelty. In "E.T." we've already seen someone running through a dark corn field, holding a flashlight, looking for the extra-terrestrial. We've already seen common people preparing for the historical encounter with aliens in "Close Encounters" and in many other films. We've already seen the aliens hover above the world's main cities in "Independence Day" and alike. So why does Shyamalan repeat these scenarios in such a boring fashion???If he want's to show that "anything Spielberg can do, I can do better", well, he can't.In "The Sixth Sense" he had a great original idea. In "Unbreakable" the idea wasn't that great, but at least it was original. "Signs" brings the promising director/writer to a sad low-point.It is a conservative, righteous and annoying story about a father and his son. The aliens are just guest stars who drop by from other movies, better movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gibson + Schyamalan= GREAT MOVIE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs is another winning film from M. Night Schyamalan, one of the leading Asian directors in Hollywood today. Schyamalan, who already had a unique talent in film story telling since he was very young, once again has shown that very talent and strike gold in Hollywood with Signs.As a film, Signs is a very itriguing and very detailed suspense thriller story that has a good mix of sci-fi and horror elements. Signs takes a very close look at the "crop cycles" phenomenon of UFOs, a particular matter that had lacked attention in movies since most UFO movies prefer to look at the "abduction" scenario.As a Schyamalan film, I find Signs the best since the 1999 classic The Sixth Sense. There are many things about this movie that struck hard with attention and at the same time left me something to remember for a long time.Signs is also a great vehicle to have superstar Mel Gibson work together with the super talented Schyamalan. They both benefit each other's work ethics and at the same time add depth to the movie. Mel's acting is very good and has presented his character very well.Joaquin Phoenix is also good in this movie and complements well in the movie playing Gibson's brother. The 2 kids are also good.Schyamalan's style of filmmaking is of golden quality as usual, such as reflections on TV screens, suspense buildup and scary visuals. I also enjoyed seeing his cameo appearance in Signs, and despite being a known filmmaker, NOBODY in the movie theater here in the Philippines knew that the man they saw on screen is the director himself.Signs is a great movie and now I'm already waiting for the upcoming DVD release which I will surely go for!EXCELLENT MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A PHENOMENON: a BAD movie that appeals to PSEUDO-INTELLECTUALS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people, including professional reviewers, found "Signs" to be disappointing on many levels and for many reasons.The movie trailers and ads were blatantly deceptive: this is NOT an "alien" movie, nor was it especially scary. Also, the direction was derivative and simply ripped-off from other films.Besides that, the screenplay is nonsensical, filled with inconsistencies, and is just illogical in so many ways. These have been described at length and in detail in the reviews and on the IMDB "Signs" message board. Read them. The only question is who was dumber - the aliens or the humans.But then an interesting phenomenon occurs. We see fanatical and sycophantic comments from a hardcore cadre of people who are in fact pseudo-intellectuals who think only they can fully comprehend what M. Night Shyamalan was trying to do. It appears to make them think they are smarter than they are by imagining they have unique (but in reality false) insights into this movie.The reality is that "Signs" is a superficial and manipulative movie that is also highly pretentious intellectually. As such, it appeals to those who are equally pretentious. It's an interesting phenomenon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Potentially my favorite thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This would have to be one of my favorites - if not favorite thriller movie i've seen. It's the second best movie of the year for me, behind AOTC. *SPOILERS* Father Graham Hess(Mel Gibson) and his family start to discover that they are not alone when mysterious things start to happen, like large crop circles happening in their corn fields, and dogs acting weird and aggressive. Then they start to see the extra terrestrials.I admit this movie was very tense and scary at some times, because you expect something to happen every time they zoom in on the door or window, etc. I felt a fear like the kind of fear I feel in real life, which I haven't felt with other movies. Also the film has plenty of unexpected surprises around every corner, which adds to the thrill and fear of it.Before I saw this, i thought Mel Gibson wouldn't fit the role, but he did a great job, as he helped bring out the suspense in Signs. Rory Culkin was also great in this film. The special effects were very good, but could have been better, as it looked like the aliens fitting in with the surroundings about 75-80%. Although not much action, it makes up for that with everything i just mentioned.Overall not the best movie in general, but the best thriller I have seen.76%</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the ride, not the destination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never mind that the ending of this movie goes nowhere, it's the ride that counts! I enjoyed this movie because it took a major event--the arrival of aliens--and told it from the perspective of an individual and his family.(mild SPOILERS ahead)One of the strong points of this movie is that the director did a great job preparing us early on for the claustrophobic scenes near the end. That is, he carefully let the camera follow the actors around all parts of the house and the outside surroundings so that we become intimately familiar with the environment. When the battle came at the end, we could recall a mental map of the house so that we knew what was going on and where (for example, when the dog was strangled near the end we remembered where she had been tied up). By creating a mental map, the director engages the audience and makes us all-too-aware of the family's increasingly desperate situation.I'm not sure why the plot revolved around faith, since ultimately we know that it is just a movie and that the "coincidences" were built into the plot. The director should have been more clear about his intentions--if he is making a movie about faith, how can he explore this theme without hardwiring miracles into the script?As a suspense picture, this movie does considerably well. It is entertaining and genuinely frightening. The deeper meaning was well-intentioned but ultimately flat. But, if one can manage to suspend disbelief long enough to marvel at the "coincidences" than perhaps the message of this movie can linger longer than it did in me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains Spoilers!!! I was so excited to see a movie done by such a young guy given the reigns,cover of Newsweek! even, and his having done a great job with "Sixth Sense", but WOW!.. this will become a cult film on how many cliches and unoriginal thoughts you can pack in to one movie, and still bore the s..t out of everyone--unless you're 6 or something, and all this stuff would be fresh... and you haven't seen the Wizard of Oz yet.(that's how they get the aliens to sizzle with water, yes I know, brutal,,but it gets better) Also, I'm puzzled! why did he have to appear in the movie?.. answer: He completel y loves himself and believes his hyper-greatness to the point of embarrassment. Sure, everyone has heard of Indian men being misogynistic, but to weave it in to American film is a huge HUGE no no. For example, during a kitchen scene when Mel(bless his heart, as this will be his last blockbuster budget film after this stinker)he has the little kids washing dishes as he comes back all freaked out from seeing this thing in cornfield..what little kids wash dishes without being beaten to do so?.. ok, so anyway, the little girl is splashing water on Rory Culkin, and Rory is sitting there taking it, not knocking her off her little step, like a little bro is supposed to.. why.. because Night sees women as powerless, and especially little girls.. because they will grow up to be women.. and ergo powerless in his society.. so let them have their fun now.. or believe they will have power when they are young.. to hide them from the nasty truth for women in non-American society.. for shame. Keep that for an Indian film.. not an American one. There were so many hilarious cliches.. boarding up the camera to change the scene.. i laughed out loud, or Mel's wife sitting there crushed by a car, and she's sitting there hanging out with him, saying yeah,, this sucks, tell the kids to do their homework..and that I love them, and isn't this a pisser? i think he would be hugging her.. kissing her.. running over to her immediately, not waiting for the highway patrolwoman to calmly explain to him his wife is almost dead. so David Lynchy, but yet not supposed to be!.. or in the beginning when the car starts up! (sound effects) before the patrolwoman is fully in the car.. Ok.. maybe i'm being hyper critical, or reading more into this than I need to.. but BOY this was so bad!! i might have to see it again.. Mel rams the needle in poor rory's leg so hard at the end, he would break the needle off in the poor kid.. "Oh.. Oh,, don't speak.. let's see if he's going to live.. we don't know yet.. he.. he.. didn't breath in the poison because his lungs were closed.."(actual line) At least color the kid's skin blue so we know that he is out of breath for the last 3 minutes if he was going to paint it to the dumbass public so blatantly.. which he did several times throughout the movie.. flat out explaining obvious things to us.. so we could said "oh, yeah, yeah, I thought so". Joaquin Phoenix.. who is an AWESOME actor.. seemed to be rolling his third eye within his head at having to say some of these stale lines, I would love to laugh my ass off with him about the filming of this.. because I bet there was alot of tongue biting. Great tool for film schools to use to avoid cliches and spelling things out so blatantly.. and to remember not to worry if your mother will watch the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Signs" was an entertaining movie. The acting throughout was good especially Cherry Jones. The overall tone of Mr. Shyamalan's films is unique. There seems to be a quiet buildup of tension. I was somewhat disappointed in the aliens and the action in the last reel. I think the buildup is done so well that the payoff would have to be tremendous to live up to it. I found this also to be true in "Unbreakable". Like Spielberg Mr. Shyamalan plays up the tearjerker scenes.SPOILER ahead.The alien reaction to water was a bit much. A rain storm would wipe them out. The earth invasion would be thwarted by turning the hose on them. Wouldn't you think after an encounter with morning dew on the corn that they would devise protective clothing. Also the alien sudden change in personality from elusive spyers to aggressive attackers didn't go. This seem to be a common problem with monster flicks.SPOILER defunct.Overall this was a good movie well worth seeing. It is a must for Mel Gibson fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is all a piece of muffin. Someone could have done a similar job, delivered the same message and have more action in less than 5 minutes. The movie is all based in one place (two if you count the scene of them in town), and is yet again a way of getting people to believe in god.Lets start with the aliens! First of all, they are 'allergic' to water. If these aliens are seriously smart enough to invade a planet and have the technology to make things invisible, you'd expect them to wear some sort of protective clothing to reduce contact with water. And what do they do when it rains? Water will be pouring down all over, are they supposed to stay inside until it's a dry day? Second of all, if they are smart, they would use another method of communicating (such as a tracking device) rather than killing crops. Third of all, the aliens of course, have to have the two arms, two legs, two eyes, mouth etc just like us humans do, but of course, without the clothes and genitalia. Last of all, they communicate using radios, and as predictable as it may seem, a typical baby monitor can pick up the radio signals. What are the odds, that these aliens invading a planet full of poison (to them) would use a radio frequency identical to a baby monitors!There is no climax in the entire movie, there is nothing to look forward to. The so-called scary scenes are nothing compared to other movies. Independence Day has better and scarier scenes than this movie, and the aliens aren't allergic to an abundant source on the planet either! More than half the movie is based on the farm and in the house.The little girl who claims there is something wrong with every glass of water she drinks is just a dumb idea. She would have to be bent in the head to think there is something wrong with every glass she drinks.Overall I say this movie stinks. Go see a comedy for a better time, and don't bother with this bible-based movie. All it's here to do is to lure you into religion, and get you to start believing in god.I give it 1 / 10, because it made me laugh a few times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In some respects, this movie was well done enough to be an 8 or 9, but in another very important aspect, the movie deserved a 5. So, I give it a 7. I like Mel Gibson a lot and the rest of the actors were fine. The concept was interesting. It had good intensity. And, the film looked very good. But, critiques are about criticism. And, ultimately, the movie was fairly ludicrous.I have two favorite genres. One of them is Sci-Fi. Anytime you watch a Sci-Fi, you have to suspend disbelief. But, I have always maintained that you do not have to suspend logic. By that, I mean, a movie should be consistent within the parameters it sets for itself. This movie did not.SPOILERS: I could go on all day, but how did the alien whose fingers got cut off manage to figure out where to come??? Was it looking for revenge? Where did it pick up the friend? Furthermore, they can travel across time, but they can't figure out how to get out of a closet??? And, why exactly doesn't it have any weapons? It can travel across time, but it can't carry a 6 shooter??? And, what is with the water? We have figured out how to wear protective covering since the middle ages, but despite being able to travel across time, they can't figure out how to protect themselves from water??? I mean, it was just one big duh after another in the last 30 minutes or so. They can travel across time, they plan to take over our world, and they need crop circles to tell them where to congregate??? PLEASE!!!The irony is that when we first went to this movie, we only got to see the first 70% of it before the theater - and all the other theaters - were evacuated for some fire (supposedly). So, we went back at a later date. We would have been better off never having gone back and just appreciating the first 70% and imagining the last 30%. If you can overcome the ludicrous assumptions at the end, you probably will like the movie. I can never forgive stupidity. But, I can forget. This is a movie I will forget.</fullReview>

The ending must be amazing at least!"You will be disappointed.I think my review is pretty meaningless and empty, i have not given it any thought whatsoever...i hope i have helped you understand that this is exactly what i felt after watching this "signs".Jaded.</fullReview>

Gee, these aliens are so smart they can plan this whole setup and invasion of earth, yet are unable to break through a wooden door?? Water does them in? Gee, I guess they never encountered any dew or moisture while they were making crop circles, huh?? I adore Mel G., and thus found it impossible to watch him as a cringing boob, unable to take any definitive action. All-in-all, I was very disappointed. A Sixth Sense it wasn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the epitome of Hollywood run amuck. This was a very boring, very pretentious film. I can not understand why American audiences are going to this film in droves. This could have been a $1 million low-budget film. In fact, minus the huge salaries of Gibson, Night and the rest of the Above-the-line talent, it looks like that's all they spent.I felt watching this film that Night has started to believe his own hype that he's the next Speilberg. This is not the same craftsman that made the wonderful "6th Sense." It felt like he made decisions because he could, rather than what was best for the film. Example: why bother bringing in the best VFX Producer in Hollywood (Erik Brevig) to design and supervise the alien when you never get to see the alien for more than seconds at a time? The same affect could have been done better and cheaper with a Stan Winston or Rik Baker monster creation.This is a tremendously disappointing effort. I'm more disappointed in America for watching this crap than the filmmakers for making it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>i liked it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i liked this movie a lot first off, i think perhaps the title doesn't refer to the signs of the aliens coming but rather to the signs to mel Gibson that god does exist. also appealing to me was how this supposed horror sci-fi thriller turned out to be very spiritual in nature. i can also see how this would be disappointing to those of little faith out there.as for the weak plot, it was only weak as far as the aliens go, and I get the feeling that that is what night wanted. it makes you stop thinking about the aliens so much, which would be distracting to the hidden story. kinda brings out the issue of faith again.i also really enjoyed the ending because there all the little signs that had been posted for Mel finally came together, just how little things that seemed kinda weird at the time turn out to be evidence of a higher power. getting you to trust in the lord and not lean on your own understanding.some one said that they thought it was very formulaic, but i don't see how a sci-fi film about god can be formulaic. actually seems to be the opposite.The surprise ending is that it is about god and not aliens. (as it was advertised)this movie is incredibly appealing to some and not to others. If you want a spiritual and philosophical work for the soul i recommend it. if you are looking for the horror thriller that has lots of cool special effects and gory fight scenes i wouldn't want to waste the movie on you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Perfect Example of Why I Love Movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Words cannot describe how much I loved this movie. Take a moment to forget about analyzing the suspense, acting, directing, writing, editing, and entertainment this movie has to offer, and simply ask yourself if it is possible for you to be touched by a movie in an emotional or spiritual way. If it is not possible, then feel free to go back to over-analyzing and hunched over your ego in search for so-called "holes" in movies that do not match-up with your own limited perception of reality.But if it is possible for movies to mean more to you than mere chopping blocks for editing and plot analysis, then I would highly recommend this movie to you.Oh, and by the way, the suspense, acting, directing, writing, editing, and pure entertainment in this movie is top notch. Combined with the message in the movie and the emotions I felt during and after the movie, "Signs" delivers the full package. It has everything. It is as close to perfection as I have seen in a movie my whole life. It is my new favorite movie of all-time!I liken this movie to a parable. The message behind the story in a parable is much more important and focused on than whether the story is realistic. Many people choose to look at this movie and compare what happens to the way they view reality. YOU MISS THE ENTIRE POINT OF THE MOVIE IF YOU DO THAT!The point of this movie is that you have the opportunity to watch how this particular family responds to a major crisis. It tackles the issue of possibly losing the most precious thing in the whole world...Faith!Enjoy this movie if you can. I feel sorry for you if you cannot. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was atrocious. Mel Gibson is a fine actor, and so is Phoenix, but they are not enough to carry this pathetic attempt at a thriller. Right from the get-go, NOTHING happens. Let's see, ONE crop circle appears in his field, they fork a dog, and then sit around the tv and tell each other what is happening. They do not show us these "startling images" on the TV except for once, and that one time the footage looks like that old stock footage of Bigfoot running through the woods. The child actors are horrible as well. The little girl looks like the Bride of Chucky, and her voice has no inflection at all. Of course, that could be said for all the characters, except for the aforementioned Phoenix and Gibson. And we also see an alien foot and hand, and that is it until the very end, and when we do see the alien finally, it is like they stuck a green beer bottle in front of the camera. You can't make out many details, and the screen is pretty blurry and obscured. The theme is non-existent. Gibson gives up being a preacher because his wife gets killed. So now aliens showing up out of the blue (and then disappearing with nary an explanation) is going to make him find his faith again? The wispy threads of a plot fail to come together in any cohesive pattern. I think there are two lines in the film that sum up my thoughts. The first is Mel Gibson saying, "You're wasting your time!" I couldn't agree more. And the second is Phoenix stating, "This is just like War of the Worlds." Perhaps, but WotW was a good movie.</fullReview>

Why would the vet (played by M. Night) be running around loose after killing a woman with his car? He also now has an SUV. He didn't even get sued, and still has a license?How DUMB was the reverend and his brother not to grab some weapon on a farm when the aliens invaded his house?? They really needed some mystical "last words" from his dead wife to remind them to pick up a weapon?The aliens can master inter-stellar travel, force fields, and anti-gravity ships, but they need carvings in cornfields to navigate and can't figure out how to break down a door??The reverend and his stupid brother when nailing up the doors boarded up the wrong side making it useless!!So much more.

		<fullReview>After a string of failures at the box office for Disney like Bad Company, Reign of Fire, and The Country Bears, Disney is hoping this will be a sign of better things to come. M. Night Shyamalan has been described as the next Spielberg after the surprising success of The Sixth Sense in 1999 and the cult following of the 2000 film, Unbreakable. Now that he has conquered ghosts and superheroes, he now goes after aliens. Will Signs bring back the same success or better of The Sixth Sense, which debuted in the same weekend in 1999, or will it show the decline of the director's success?The story goes that a man by the name of Graham Hess, a former minister, has lost his faith after the death of his wife in a car accident. He soon finds that crop circles have appeared in his corn fields but dismisses them as pranks and nothing more. But soon the news from around the world shows the lights from alien space crafts and everything that we had feared about life from other worlds is coming true. An invasion by the life forms looks to happen and now Graham must find the faith within him which is the only way to save his family. The story, which was written by M. Night Shyamalan himself, is nothing but pure majesty. The plot mixes humor in well needed places and for the first time this year, I was scared more during a movie then I had ever been before. And I loved every moment of it. The story doesn't seem long or too short which is a great rarity among the modern feature-length films.Mel Gibson, who has starred in many great successful films like Braveheart, What Women Want and the Lethal Weapon series, is sure to have another huge hit with Signs. Gibson plays the role of Graham Hess down pat. He plays with so much emotion especially with the scene involving the last supper the family shares together before the alien invasion happens. The tears just stream from his eyes which made the scene just so perfect. The kids in the film were amazingly good. Some cute children will ruin a film but these kids played their roles perfectly making us laugh, cry and scared. Joaquin Phoenix has another great role after the success of Gladiator. You just cheer for him at the very end of the film, which I will not give away in this review. M. Night Shyamalan, who made a cameo appearance in The Sixth Sense, plays a much larger role in Signs and shows that his genius goes beyond directing and writing.Overall, Signs spells another huge success for director M. Night Shyamalan and actor Mel Gibson. This is the best movie I have seen in 2002 and one of the best films ever made. The scariness and the emotions go way beyond that of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. The music was perfectly scored by James Newton Howard who also scored The Sixth Sense, Dinosaur, and Atlantis: The Lost Empire. The opening credit music set us up for the greatness to come and made the credits very interesting to listen to. There are so many things to love about this film that any problems seem ridiculous. Though the ending to the film, which I will not give away, was a bit cheesy but that is what Shyamalan intended. The Sixth Sense delivered a surprise ending but Signs gives you what you should have expected but dismissed it for some surprise ending. The movie is meant to make you think as a movie goer and it does that with excellent flare and style. Signs is sure to remain the top film of the year despite heavy competition from Harry Potter &amp; the Chamber of Secrets and The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers later this year. Make sure you make it your duty to see this film. It would be a crime to miss it. You never know when life from other worlds may visit. You would like to be prepares, right? ;)My Rating: ***** out of 5 (A Perfect Score)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>almost perfect sci-fi film (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For approximately the first 90% of its running time, `Signs' is a terrifically entertaining sci-fi suspense thriller. As he did a few years back in `The Sixth Sense,' writer/director M. Night Shyamalan shows that he has the ability to rethink old genres, mainly by providing enough philosophical ballast to help counter the more farfetched aspects of the subjects he is tackling. In this case, the subject turns out to be those mysterious `crop circles' that have periodically dotted the world's landscape for the past three decades or so. Shyamalan centers his story around a Pennsylvania farmer named Graham Ness (Mel Gibson) - actually FATHER Graham Ness, since we discover early on that the man is a former minister who has recently become an atheist after the sudden death of his wife in a grisly car accident (though his denomination is unspecified, one wonders why his former parishioners refer to him as `Father' and ask him to listen to their confessions when he was obviously NOT a Roman Catholic priest). Graham lives with his two young children and his younger brother, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix). One day they awaken to discover that some crop circles have mysteriously appeared in their own fields overnight. As more and more of these strange images begin to spring up around the world, the thought that the earth may be facing an invasion from hostile extraterrestrial forces starts to take hold.It would be hard to overestimate just how effective Shyamalan is at generating suspense throughout the film. For close to ninety minutes, we sit utterly spellbound as the story unravels itself, never quite sure where the author is taking us, but being more than willing to go to wherever that destination might be, fully confident that the author will not disappoint us (that turns out not to be the case, but more about that later). Shyamalan has the artist's touch of being able to terrify his audience more through anticipation and indirection than through scenes of actual violence and carnage. The creepiness of the imagery is what makes all this work. The director can take the most mundane object and infuse it with feelings of portentousness and dread. One thinks, in particular, of Phoenix staring into an ordinary cornfield, made menacing by the howling wind and the fact that we know something sinister may be lurking deep within it ready to pounce out at any moment. Or of Gibson confronting an ordinary pantry door, behind which may be a creature too terrifying to even imagine, let alone do battle with. The sound effects in the film are extraordinary, heightening the suspense tenfold by allowing us to picture the threat in terms that most frighten us. Actually, Shyamalan reaches back to some pretty impressive earlier works for his imagery in this film. There are echoes of `E.T.' in Gibson's journey through a cornfield at night, flashlight in hand, as he searches for a mysterious creature he has not yet seen but knows most likely exists. We are reminded of `The Birds' and `Night of the Living Dead' when the family begins boarding up the house as a protection against the supernatural threat from the outside. And, of course, there are elements of `Close Encounters' in the rural setting and of `Independence Day' and `War of the Worlds' in the sight of alien spaceships parking themselves above cities filled with terrified and bewildered citizens. Yet, each of these images comes across not as slavish thievery, but as heartfelt homages to some of the most effective suspense films ever made.One intriguing aspect of the film is that Shyamalan does not provide us with a prologue to his story. We are afforded no glimpses into the `normal' everyday life of this family before all this begins to happen. From the very first moment of the film, we are plunged into the nightmare scenario. This corresponds nicely to Shyamalan's other two films in that he likes to create worlds that seem somehow off-kilter right from the very start. The generation of atmosphere is clearly one of this filmmaker's greatest strengths.Yet, given all these undeniable virtues, what exactly is it that keeps `Signs' from being the masterpiece it so obviously wants to be - and that it falls just short of becoming? I think the problem is that Shyamalan does such a fantastic job raising our expectations that we just can't help but be disappointed when the somewhat flatfooted resolution is ultimately unspooled before us. For all his intelligence and talent, the author can't quite seem to get his theme and his storyline to coalesce into a profound, meaningful whole. Graham Ness is obviously a good man caught in a major crisis of faith. He has come to doubt not only the efficacy of prayer but of the existence of God Himself. So far, so good. But where does Shymalan end up really taking this theme? Nowhere really, and that is the problem. The fantastic, sci-fi plotting ultimately seems too elaborate to be just making the simple point that life is not merely a series of random chance happenings and that Graham needs to go back to believing in God again. All of this just to show THAT? Frankly, any number of events could have led Graham to this epiphany. It wouldn't require extraterrestrials to do it. Given the devices used to get us there, the storyline starts to seem arbitrary and the resolution PALTRY (which was certainly NOT the case with `The Sixth Sense'). And in many ways, the final shot - of Graham once again donning his clerical collar - seems to ring untrue, since if the world really were to be made cognizant of the existence of highly developed life existing on other planets, wouldn't people be more inclined to turn away from the old time religious belief systems, which would most likely seem antiquated and unexplanatory, in favor of some new theological paradigms? In this aspect alone, the ending rings strangely hollow.Shyamalan has evoked extraordinary performances from his gifted cast, particularly from Gibson who hits just the right note of bewilderment, sadness and fatherly devotion to turn Graham into a fully developed, three-dimensional character. Joaquin Phoenix provides humor and strength as Graham's devoted younger brother, and Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin all but steal the picture as Graham's resourceful and savvy children. James Newton Howard has provided a variegated and haunting score, often echoing the great work by that all-time master of suspense music, Bernard Herrmann.`Signs,' in the final analysis, is a flawed but still tremendously powerful and entertaining film. Don't let the disappointing ending color your overall impression of the work. Despite its imperfections, `Signs' clearly emerges as one of the outstanding films of 2002.</fullReview>

The director is the same one as the Sixth Sence and he does as good if not more. The acting is superbly acted. Mel Gibson and the bad guy from Gladiator do there best jobs in Signs.

		<shortDescription>War Of The Worlds plot revisited but using a family as they would fare in a hyperthetical situation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Identical plot to War of the Worlds in that the aliens arrive without unannounced and without warning. At first people don't suspect an alien invasion. The next phase their presence is seen when many spaceships, worldwide, are seen everywhere. The third phase tells of people getting killed by the aliens and finally, the aliens being defeated and the earth is safe again. In both movies, very limited detail of the alien form is given, reconnaissance aliens are seen searching through houses, being killed, the goodies all live and the world is saved again. That said, the main difference is the use of a family situation and how they deal personally with the invasion on their own farm. There are poignant scenes, ones showing empathy with some humor and suspense also added to make the film really worth watching.The story starts with a widower, his brother and the widower's two children playing on a corn farm in Philadelphia. The next morning he goes into his corn field to discover strange sightings as his crop is crushed in the shape of some strange key. Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) soon discovers on television that similar sightings are occurring elsewhere around the earth. Hess was once a reverend who lost faith after his wife was killed in an automobile accident. The following night, strange noises could be heard outside and a human like shape was seen by Hess and his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix). Still not expecting aliens, they thought it was just practical jokers. The children go to the library and read up on aliens as television broadcasts now report that the aliens are seen hovering in the sky above many countries and cities. One of Graham Hess's acquaintances was first blamed for the trouble on the farm, but a subsequent visit to his place saw him fleeing for his life. His last words were "There is one of them locked in the pantry." Gibson's search of the house was both dramatic and also filled with laughter. The alien somehow got two fingers severed in an accident there. That is all we saw of the alien at that stage. Meanwhile around the world, there were reports of many deaths by poisoning. The aliens could somehow excrete a poisonous vapour, thus killing any humans in their way. The next and final night saw the family barricade themselves in their house, expecting the worst. Just after they thought they were safe, the aliens entered through the roof, giving the Hess's just enough time to barricade themselves in the underground basement. The acting during this tense and dramatic night was of a high quality and well worth seeing. The morning saw things very quiet and when the son Morgan (Rory Culkin) has a real bad asthma attack, Gibson has no alternative but to venture upstairs again. On turning on the television, we soon learn that the aliens were defeated and those remaining fled in haste. On turning around, we see the alien from previous, with two fingers missing, holding Morgan. The alien can be seen directing a stream of poisonous gas onto Morgan's face. Merrill, as we learnt earlier, was a champion baseball player who once hit a record distance of 504 feet.

		<fullReview>Ok. Here goes. I couldn't really tell which was the plot and which was the subplot. The aliens or the preacher losing his faith. Some people have said the subplot is Graham losing his faith, others have said the aliens are the subplot. It seems to me like they are so intertwined, that it is all one plot. I liked that though because you go in, from watching the trailer anyway, thinking "Alien Invasion Movie", and get smacked in the face by realizing it's a lot more than that. To me that's a good thing, if it is done right. This was done right. Plus, I liked how M. Night put things on a smaller scale. Like from one family's point of view. Instead of making it an all out action/special effects flick with the the army out there blasting aliens and stuff. Of course, the army and the big war with the aliens was there. You just had to leave it to your imagination. At least until the end, which I liked. You all know what happens. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost Faith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's all about faith, right? Well slap me around the face with a dead halibut!Shyamalan brings us a mildly interesting film about the reaffirmation of faith of a man who has lost it after the death of his wife, packaged as an alien/crop circle movie.SPOILERS..Although elements of the film were indeed well crafted and filmed, it seemed a shame that the director felt it necessary to 'hammer-home' his concept of faith and belief that 'things happen for a reason'. The issues of faith were much better dealt with in films like Contact and not as tidily resolved or telegraphed as they were in Signs. Many have critisized the alien element of the film and have been berated for not looking past the invasion and concentrating on the main 'faith' theme. The problem that arises when you're developing a story that contains serious issues, like fate and faith, is if you surround it with inconsistancies and implausabilities (no matter how improbable the scenario is), it loses alot of it's impact.The acting in the film is commendable and even M.Night does a reasonable job (with his hydrophobic (yes, again) prophecy) and the story moves on at a reasonable pace. That is, until towards the end. Subtlety is thrown out of the window in favour of childlike story-telling and your left feeling that a good film (certainly amongst this months fare) becomes completely average.I for one, feel too many people are quick to applaud the works of certain directors (especially those that share their name) and not judge a film soley on it's merits. Based on it's merits, this is a wholly average film.Oh and by the way, the Hitchcock associations end with the opening credits!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me, this movie is made based on a presumption: audience are a bunch of fools and they just accept everything the movie has to tell! Well, maybe some of the audience are, but not everyone.When I watched the trailer, I thought this was a horror/supernatural movie. 20 minutes into the movie, I told to myself: "No, this is not a horror flick, it's a sci-fi movie. That's cool!!" But, as the movie dragged and drew to the end, I knew I had again wasted my good money on a bad movie. However, this movie particularly aroused my anger because it failed to give a reasonable explanation of its main plot. It even failed to give us a direction to use our imagination. I felt insulted when I walked out of the theater...Some defenders claim this movie is all about "faith". Well, if I want to see a movie about "faith", I have tons of better choices than this garbage. (A beautiful mind, Good will hunting..., to name a few.) Avoid this one if you still respect yourself!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**POSSIBLE SPOILERS**OK, I don't mind when people have a legitimate gripe with a film. I do mind when I read comments in reviews like, "It was extremely irresponsible for Shyamalan to make a movie without giving any thought at all to its credibility and believability." Uhhh....if I may make a brief point...it's about crop circles and an alien invasion! Until I have an alien in MY pantry, I'm gonna have a slight believability problem. That said, I thought this was a very good film. Not up to the Sixth Sense, but enjoyable. Mel was solid, the kids were excellent, and Phoenix was funny. And as for the plot problems...hey, maybe the aliens were just stupid. I know a guy, works at Boeing aerospace, he designs solid fuel rockets. He has locked himself out of his house three times. (That I know of, I have a key, so I get the call.) He walked into the street, and was hit by a car, broke his leg. Yes, he's an actual rocket scientist, and he wandered into traffic. My point?

The director will just keep on making films, good or bad, because he's been on that track ever since the day his rich parents provided him with the means to be filmmaker. Mel Gibson will go on being whatever kind of actor he's supposed to be and that's not very clear from what I saw in this film.

		<fullReview>Mr.Shyamalan is a promising commodity when faced with the mind numbing lowest common denominator fodder we have shoved in our faces from most hollywood productions...I'll be the first to admit that. A brief glimpse of the coming attractions before "signs" is more than enough evidence of that. However, I cannot see how he's succeeded in bringing us much more in this latest effort."Signs" does manage to keep my attention, however, it is ultimately a sadly uneven film. Too many films have played with a central character who's lost his faith only to gain it again through some extraordinary sufferings. This story has been appearing time and again since the Bible. However, the ultimate failing of "signs" is that it hasn't illuminated this story in a way that it hasn't been before. The strength of M.Night Shyamalan's previous work is that it has offered an aggressively unique approach, and has sought to play with the mind of the audience. The only way that "Signs" played with my mind was the dumbfounded feeling I had waiting for my mind to played with. It's straightforward approach jammed into a pseudo artistic wrapper is more insulting than a movie that slaps me in the face with it's formulaic weapons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must warn everyone that this movie is really, really weak. It relies mainly on cheap "noise shocks" to make the audience jump. The characters are quite unbelievable, and much of the plot is senseless.HERE COME THE SPOILERS. Some Signs apologists will try to say that this movie is not about the aliens. I can see why they would say that, because this main plot line is atrociously thought out, and utterly indefensible.You have the Earth being invaded by aliens whose intelligence gets them all the way through space to our planet, with ships capable of cloaking themselves. But then, that's where the genius stops, quite abruptly. You see, they have come to a planet that is 2/3rds water (which is toxic to them) in order to "harvest" human beings, who are also mostly water (hence water present in their dwellings). Human beings also have a proliferation of weapons, and yet what do the aliens bring, besides their gangly bodies? Nothing. (BTW, I love how a humanoid body strong enough to jump up to the roof of a farmhouse can't kick down a pantry door!) Their natural weapon is a gas-emitting spike on their wrists. That's all they use! Not a very wise choice for conquering the Earth now is it? And what makes them think they could rely only on their "poison gas" to harm us, when our basic physical properties are so different? Finding out whether your only weapon works after traveling light years to the battlefield is not very wise.So where do these practically unarmed geniuses land, after their "recon" mission is complete? Among other places, the United States, the most effectively armed nation on Earth. Wouldn't it make more sense to go "harvest" the more defenseless humans in Africa, who have practically no infrastructure? Well it might, if the writer/director had worried as much about the story as he did about getting Mel Gibson to cry for him.The aliens use mere radio waves to communicate (did the FCC give them authorization?) to each other, which somehow doesn't alert the military, who could at the very least have started jamming it. But hey military, shmilitary, this director is afraid of guns, so the defenders of our nation get no mention.Another archaic tactic the aliens use is marking targets with- tada! crop circles! Nobody will suspect a thing about these giant areas of crushed crops, will they? Of course not! And using a less obvious, more technologically advanced method of designating targets (we already do it with lasers or GPS) is out of the question.But wait, maybe the aliens aren't the dumbest folks around this town! How do you like the fact that Mr. Gibson knows there is an alien trapped in some guy's pantry, but doesn't call the cops! I can understand if he's a wimp and doesn't want to open that door to take on an alien himself, but at least call someone who will! Great, just leave it for someone unsuspecting to find...This is an over-riding theme in Signs- leave everything up to someone else. Mel leaves the alien in some fool's pantry, then goes home and boards up his house. He doesn't even take steps to arm himself so he can protect his family. Do you know anyone else as useless as that? Would you leave it to the rest of the world to protect you from the aliens who are in your house looking to kill you? Shammie fails to create a believable character. It's also hard to picture the sunken-chested, narrow-shouldered Joaquin Phoenix being a home-run champ. He's a cool actor (8mm) but an athlete he is not.Sure there's some good crying and flashbacks to a dying wife, but did director/writer Sham have to use aliens to tell it? Of course not. They implied the supernatural/alien plot in the trailers to pack you into the theater. From there, it's every sucker for himself...Don't support junk movies! You deserve better!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have reviewed this movie already, but wanted to address the points of a couple other reviewers. Several have brought up the "atheist in a foxhole" thing, but apparently they weren't paying attention to the movie (granted, Shymalan's films require a far better than average attention span). Gibson's character never lost his faith, but rather is angry at God over the death of his wife and is despairing (this point is very clearly delineated by a certain scene). Also, it's interesting that most of the negative reviews tend to focus on inane, cerebral nit-picks that have nothing to do with "willing suspension of disbelief" (which is critical to the enjoyment of a fantasy film such as this). For example, the comments about water, comments like "this couldn't happen" or "that couldn't happen".... all I can think of to say is "no kidding, we aren't watching a docu-drama." If you can't relax, surrender and allow a movie to stir your subconscious, stay away from Shyamalan films. Perhaps the director succeeded all too well here -- people certainly seem to be polarized over this one, but few are indifferent. 9/10 (please read Roger Ebert's review, which I agree with for the most part).</fullReview>

It was interesting that Shyamalan using a former religious man as the main character in Signs. In the movie it make you question your own faith reflected how the character and family feels. Each director bring some to the movie that reflects a life experience his life and religion is a part of Shyamalan's experience from his young school life. He is being compared to Spielberg, but he has an different style than other the director out there. Shyamalan is one of a kind, in the future he will be consider a master at his craft.</fullReview>

Faced with only two closed minded options of 1. Have faith &amp; be strong, or 2. No faith, stand alone &amp; have fear, Mel wusses out and finds God again.Rather than explore some modern, progressive ideas such as 3. No faith, stand alone and be strong, Mr Shamalamadingdong's work continues to decline to appeal to the lowest common denominator.

This film features the most useless ALIENS that ever appeared in a major SCI-FICTION movie. It is hard to imagine an alien travelled millions of miles across the galaxy to conquer the Earth but cannot breakdown a door and afraid of water. I like Mel Gibson even this is not his normal action film and there is a lot of extreme closeups (so if you are obsessed with Mel Gibson then this film is a gem). Night Shyamalan tried hard to make a punch line (similiar to what he tried on Sixth Sense and Unbreakable) repeating throughout the movie -- "Tell Merill to hit ..." I do not know the rest of the audiences, the punch line is a cliche.</fullReview>

Even the opening credits will get your heart pounding. Signs is a masterpiece mixed with classic horror and a brilliant plot. This movie would not be complete though without its amazing cast . Gibson is amazing, Phoenix is wonderful, Breslin adds a touch of cuteness, and Rory Culken proves that Macaulay isn't the only talented one in the family. Like most of Shyamalan's films Signs deals with a middle wage family struggling with some tragedy. Signs is one of the best movies of 2002. Go see it , but dont go alone.</fullReview>

And for you people out there thinking "Aw, come on it can't be that bad!" well, my friend, it is. The acting was not only bad, but down right freaky. At many parts in this movie, it had me wondering whether the whole Hess family weren't aliens themselves. And don't get me started on the cop. I still think she's from another planet! From the very beginning of the movie when the kids discover the crop circles and start freaking out, I knew this was going to be a weird movie. Think for a moment how actual kids there age would react if they saw something like that. They probably would have come running back in the house yelling "Daddy come look! It's so cool!" Not nearly as freaky as these kids acted. It's like they were reacting to the situation as if they were much older. I didn't find this movie very scary either. I found myself laughing more than anything. The only thing worse than the actual movie is the fact that I wasted 7 bucks and 2 hours of my time. And what could possibly be even worse is the fact that there could be a sequel: remember what the boy said about the aliens coming back later with a much bigger army?!

		<shortDescription>Tapped into so much, another totally awesome Shyamalan film! The most scared i've ever been during a movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, i've long since reached that point in my life when "horror movies" don't have a hope of scaring me. And no, i wouldn't call "Signs" a horror movie. But it *actually scared me*.Many said they weren't scared at all, strangely enough some people seriously recommended "The Exorcist" as a scary alternative to "Signs" - imo "The Exorcist" is about as scary as losing a sock in the wash! I thought that was a *drama* movie... So maybe different things are fundamentally frightening to different people, and "Signs" just tapped straight into my personal little fear-verse.Just let me say that he draws fear from the simplest most fundamental places. I've never seen a movie actually capture that. You know how horror movies seem to try and *create* a scary scene? I get the impression that Shyamalan didn't try and *create* scary moments, he looked at things from real life - things you think about when you're thirteen years old, huddled in fear under the covers of your bed reading a book about UFO sightings - he took *those* things and drew fear from them. And they aren't anything like horror movie scenes - because they're actually scary.As others have said, there's more to it than that. I won't go so far as to say "this wasn't a movie about aliens", because it obviously was. It just wasn't ONLY about aliens. I feel that it was a movie about everyday things, but it was also a movie about fear. We saw a range of different sources of fear (two or three of the scariest moments, if i had to pick "scariest moments" out of a film that was so consistently succesful at keeping me on edge and involved, didn't nessecarily involve anything extraterrestrial!). It made me think about the fears portrayed in the film, and where they come from. I think i could say it made me feel like a little child.CRITICISM:I'd like to critisize some of the criticism for the movie - unfortunately that involves referring to spoilers, and its a sin to spoil a Shyamalan movie, so here's fair warning - the next section is intended for the perusal of those who have already seen the film:IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT, DONT YOU DARE READ AHEAD!! YOU'LL REGRET IT!! FAIR WARNING!!!!!SPOILER SECTION:*************************************************Various people around the world have critisized the science of it. But they're wrong. I am a huge Biology geek. I LOVE critisizing the idiot things that moronic Hollywood scriptwriters do. I LOVE nitpicking the wannabe-science of movies.But this movie was Solid. Some of the best SF i've seen. And the 'scientific' criticisms of it don't hold water."Why would those aliens come to a planet whose surface is three-quarters water?"They didn't land in the ocean!! Do human explorers look at an island and say "Ooh, look, a volcano. Potentially dangerous, better not go there at all"? Of course not! Sheesh.Even if they had wanted to land in the ocean, the ocean is saltwater. Earth's surface is 75% water, but only 2% freshwater - and most of that is polar. Saltwater is a VERY different thing to freshwater, as any physiology student (or fan of the supernatural, come to think of it...) will tell you!! Furthermore, they could easily have come from a planet that was mostly seawater - in fact, they most likely did. How? Read on."Why would those aliens attack humans, who are 80% water?"We aren't freshwater either. The water in the human body is chock full of solutes. We might drink freshwater, but the second we absorb it we dissolve our chemical systems in it and it becomes highly concentrated salty stuff. It's a very different kind of water."How did they get through the icy Kuiper Belt?"They had spaceships. Thats also how they managed to get through space, by the way. And furthermore, they needn't have gone through the Kuiper Belt anyway! The Kuiper Belt is a Belt, not a Sphere!! It doesn't surround the solar system, only the solar plane. You've gotta think three-dimensionally when it comes to outer space."How could an animal like that evolve? Water is the basis of life!"Uh huh. And what happens when you feed saltwater to a freshwater animal? Those aliens could easily have been 80% water, just like us, and it wouldn't create ANY plot holes. Like i said before, the water in your body is more like seawater than freshwater. The idea of an animal that is killed by freshwater is quite plausible. In fact, i'm sure some Earthling examples actually exist. If i had to guess, i'd say that these guys evolved in saltwater, but never adapted to freshwater for basic chemical reasons. The rivers and lakes of their world are probably to them what lava flows are to us. They probably instruct their children to stay away from river deltas when swimming by the shoreline in the same way that we instruct our children to stay away from rip tides.The next criticism is a philosophical one."Wasn't it insulting to atheists?"I'm an atheist, and i wasn't the least bit offended. One has to understand when seeing a movie that the character on the screen is not supposed to be YOU. I don't look anything like Mel Gibson, so it wasn't too hard for be to be unoffended by what felt right to him. The guy wasn't a real atheist to begin with. He didnt make some miraculous conversion during the course of the film, he only returned to what he knew. He found an alternate way of looking at things that had turned him away from religion, and, in the context of the film, a perfectly valid way of looking at things. And definitely not one that was specifically Christian, in case anyone suspected otherwise.********************************************SPOILERS OVER!! (DON'T SCROLL UPWARDS!)I loved this movie! See it, revel in it, let yourselves be dragged into it.And celebrate!! Never again will i watch a typical BS horror movie and think "It's so depressing that this un-scary stuff is all that directors seem to be capable of".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just have to add a second review. I can't believe the rave reviews for what I think was a stupid movie. How in the world could you like this movie? ITS FULL OF FLAWS! I could list them, but just click on my username and read my other review for the details. Anyone, who reviews this movie and thinks its a great piece of work hasn't gone past a basic knee-jerk reaction. "What a cool looking Alien. WOW! This is a great movie!" And its not even that scarey. Its not scary at all. I was FAR more frightened in the Blair Witch Project than in this piece of garbage. The movie gets worse and worse in my mind as I think about it. It was extremely irresponsible for Shyamalan to make a movie without giving any thought at all to its credibility and believability. I am sorry to say this, but anyone who likes this movie isn't very intelligent or they don't watch very many movies and are overimpressed with some of the cheap thrills Shyamalan throws in there to "WOW" the crowd. I have had more suspense watching the Fear Factor and I find the Animaniacs to be more believable than this total waste of film. Shyamalan has changed his film-making direction (with this movie) from "Braveheart" to "Scream". His only goal now seems to be to shock people in quick-and-dirty scenes with little or no plot at all. If you liked this movie, then you are going to LOVE the Halloween series. Stop watching dramas and start watching cheaply made slasher films like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's your point of view? (Spoiler Warning)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, I think Signs is a great movie. But, there are a some of minor points to consider:A.) There is definitely a great dispute over what the aliens should have looked like, but the argument is futile because of point B. Also, this is primarily a horror movie. The fact that it contains sci-fi elements is secondary. B.) This is a movie about faith, NOT alien invasion or crop circles. The crop circles are just a sign of aliens invading, and the alien invasion is just a diversion from the main theme. Thus, for people to argue about how absurd and unbelievable the aliens were is beside the point. Moreover, if the aliens were reasonable or believable, they would NOT be as scary.C.) The movie is all about suspense and build-up. The plot is secondary. Think about the plot of Sixth Sense, about a boy who sees ghosts and finally overcomes his fear. This movie is about man's triumph over evil. It is about a man who has lost his faith, who finds reason to believe again.D.) For people who enjoy really scary theme-park roller-coaster rides, this movie will not be scary, it will be a joke. So, if you fall in this category, you should not go to the theaters expecting a scary movie. Instead, rent the exorcist.I have to disagree with people who say that this movie does not fall into any genre. I think it has elements of many genres: drama, sci-fi, horror, suspense. There are enough funny scenes to make some people think that this is a comedy. However, what you consider it to be, depends on your point of view. For me, it was a good drama.So after having said all that, I'd give Signs at least a 3/4 stars in my book. Not only did I like the ending, but I thought it was great. (I might be in the minority here). I thought the last 20 mins of the movie were the best. When I walked out of the theater, I was satisfied that I had seen a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, well worth the money, but...(spoilers)The film shows us the life of a man who has lost his faith in the existence of God due to a terrible personal tragedy. The aliens are used as a device to in some ways 'bring him back' to God, and this is all well and good, displaying the director's skill well.However, the presence of the aliens in the film assumed such significant proportion that in my view they ended up pushing Father Hess' struggle to come to terms with what he perceived as the actions of an unjust and cruel God into the background.Don't get me wrong - go and see it, Signs is worth it. If you enjoyed Unbreakable and The Sixth Sense you will also enjoy this movie, but to me at least it felt a little off-balance.</fullReview>

I read many of the reviews given by other IMDb users before seeing this movie, and frankly I'm kind of mad. Some people were saying that this movie has a ridiculous ending which ruined the movie. Some said it was Shyamalan's worst film yet. It seems like these people don't understand the movie.Everyone should agree that the performances were great, especially the kids. Abigail Breslin and Rory Culkin were brilliantly casted and fit their characters. Joaquin Phoenix had a really funny character and did a good job providing the comic relief, and of course Mel Gibson was great.Everyone should know by now that the movie is about a former reverend who has lost his faith after the death of his wife and lives with his brother and two kids who have found what seem to be crop circles on their property, right? Good.Now the important part...*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*Do you remember the movie about the lovable farmer/Vietnam vet/shrimp boat captain/probably a lot of other stuff played by Tom Hanks? Of course you do, it's Forrest Gump. And do you remember the meaning of that movie - how he was trying to figure out if there was a God and if everything has a meaning and is meant to happen? Well in case you didn't know, this movie had the same meaning, and the same plot.M. Night Shyamalan just decided to mix that plot with an alien invasion rather than a mentally disabled farmer/Vietnam vet/shrimp boat captain/probably a lot of other stuff. Shyamalan felt like scaring everyone again, something that he is very good at and did a very good job at with this movie. For the people who thought the aliens looked cheesy and ruined the movie, how else do you think they should look? Shyamalan found something that everyone fears and brought it to the big screen in a very realistic way based on what people have thought aliens looked like and what an invasion would be like. If you thought he should have left the appearance of the aliens to your imagination, he left something more important to the audience's and the characters' imagination... the actual invasion. He wanted you to feel like you were there. Also, without the aliens just leaving, there would have had to be a big war or the end of the world, and without one of the aliens threatening the characters you would have felt ripped off. If you didn't want to feel ripped off, you would have to show the alien when it threatened the characters. Personally I think an invisible alien would be the worst thing you could do. It was very interesting how the plot developed and how it showed the different details that turned out to have an impact at the end of the movie, and it was touching to see Mel Gibson's character re-gain his faith at the end. The ending was by no means ridiculous and surely didn't ruin it.10/10... Without hesitation!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guess what?! NOTHING HAPPENS!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan's work has gone from great (The Sixth Sense), to okay (Unbreakable), and now to just plain awful with Signs! The story could be interesting, but every time it seemed like something was actually going to happen...it didn't. That is the main problem with this movie: NOTHING OF INTEREST ACTUALLY HAPPENS! There is a lot of talk about things happening other places and a few minor things happen, but the movie gets so boring after about 20 minutes that if something did happen, you probably wouldn't care anyway because it would interrupt your nap! And as for being scary, the scariest part of the whole movie was when the dog barked the first time. The most enjoyable parts of the film were the few moments of comedy.All in all, I would say this is a low-budget movie trying, very poorly, to hide behind a powerful cast, a popular name, and miles and miles of advertising. Quite frankly, I expected a lot more from everyone involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Signs" is M. Night Shyamalan at the top of his form. Every scene meticulously crafted, awe-inspiring camera work and some genuine scares. Interestingly, the two people I saw this film with didn't like it. One thought it was completely contrived and predictable (which I don't understand at all). Perhaps Shyamalan creates "thinking person's" films, I really don't know. Having seen both "The Sixth Sense" and "Unbreakable" (I liked both, although it took several viewings to understand what the director was aiming at), this one was by far his best work. Fascinating, flawed and unstereotyped characters (a bit weird, but "real" nonetheless) and a wonderful slow pace thankfully free of too much flash and special effects. Spectactular camera work, a haunting atmosphere... what more can you ask?Hold on... except for the last 5 minutes. I think I "got" the faith message, and didn't need it hammered in with a baseball bat. I would have rated this film 10/10 except for that one flaw (which I suppose is necessary with a movie intended for 'mass audiences', and please don't take that statement as elitist). 9/10.</fullReview>

I saw this film two days ago and I still thinking about everything I watched. The acting was great, except Shy... himself, is like a piece of wood talking, he must stay behind the cameras, his work there is perfect. The story is amazing. The extraterrestrial attack is only a excuse, the faith in something bigger which is taking care of us is the principal topic. We never see during the film any spaceship, thats great, I'm a little tyred of special effects. Probably they shouldn't show us the alien, but it was necessary to close the perfect circle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We're in the money -- This movie's cruddy....That's just one way to describe this magnificent manure pile from M. Night Shyamalan. Clearly, this guy should have NEVER quit his day job.The story develops (what little there is) exceedingly slow. After 10 minutes I was shouting, come on get on with it, why are you dragging the inevitable out. The slow thin plot development, would last another 30 minutes.The almost contact lens depth of character did NOT add to the overall effect of this film either. "THIN" is the keyword to this movie. Thin plot, thin shallow characters, thin dialogue...It all lead up to a very predictable movie experience.There were scenes in this movie that look like that might have been taken from the George Romero Classic, "Night of the Living Dead!" -- Only "Night of the Living Dead" -- did have a plot to it! This thinly wired reconstruction, could only hope to aspire to such acclaim.The alien (note SINGULAR) in this movie looked like something out of "Godzilla" or "Creature from the Black Lagoon." In other words, "a guy in a rubber suit!"I thought this movie trivial and banal at best. Mel Gibson is a fantastic character actor, BUT NOT IN THIS MOVIE. This movie basically would sux the chrome off a trailer hitch. I was surprised Mel would agree to film such a bedraggled piece of crap. It can only mean one thing: They paid him well for his less the spectacular performance. Every actor has his high's and low's, and this certainly was not his best performance. Of course with "contact lens" character development, you can't expect much.The "ending" did NOT resolve the conflict of "are the aliens going to invade, and are they friendly" question. It ended quite abruptly, with no real ending at all. Like I said the director, M. Night Shyamalan should NOT have quit is day job.Don't waste your money on this, its a piece of work from the get go.Rated 1 reel out of 5.Wayno</fullReview>

Thanks to a fellow reviewer "Paul Tempke" and a second viewing, I can say "By George I got it!" The whole movie is shown from child's Point Of View. That's why it feels childish. The cute little girl in the movie is dreaming the whole movie! I am sure a lot of people missed the entry of the girl in the story. The first line she says to her dad is "Are you in my dream too?' Since this thing happens so early in the movie that we simply ignore it and look for a dramatic ending (talk about conditioning). That's where Mr. MNS scores. Well now you know the secret, you can figure out other things. The only reason movie doesn't get a five star rating is that it is meant to fool you and director exploits that advantage. Good job MNS, I am just wondering what your next movie will be, Dream of a Ghost? Probably not. Please keep up the good work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unlike Merrill, M. Night does not strike out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shyamalan's movies are characterized by chilly camera angles and eerie soundtracks, but his greatest talent is in understanding his audience, and how they work. Consequently, this movie is one of the funniest I've seen in a long time, as well as the scariest--he alternates between the two to give us time to recover. So while it is spooky, the suspense is not always at a high level, making the movie enjoyable and the jumps and screams fun. I will be the first to admit,though, that I was a bit reluctant to turn off the light the night after seeing it.Most of the complaints about this movie seem to be about its implausability, which is odd, as movies are supposed to be a break from reality. If you really want something realistic, go watch a documentary. And as for complaints about the aliens themselves, Shyamalan's neatly skewered you with Proffessor Bimboo's book, and Merrill's theory on The Nerds.Well written and well acted, it's interesting to note how few people there are in this movie. Four main characters, two supporting, and a few people we see only once. This adds to the feeling of isolation, and it allows us to really get to know the Hess family, especially Graham (Mel Gibson). Gibson does an excellent job in this movie, portraying the ex-reverend with a sublime subtlety; he never over-acts, but moves seamlessly from gentle humor to fear and terror. You can't help but empathize with him.The rest of the cast is great, too, M. Night can act as well as write and direct. Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) provides effortless laughs, and the two children, police officer, et al, are quality.The actual direction does not dissapoint, either, and the details are what make this movie great, not just good. The circle patterns on the curtains, the sense of timing that makes everything fit together in the end and still be surprising, the alien pattern on the tv as they finish boarding up the house...look for these things and you will enjoy the movie that much more.Alfred Hitchcock remarked that a good thriller should play the audience like a piano. If you see this movie, you'll be putting yourself in Shyamalan's hands, to be frightened and humored, and as Merrill might say, stiiiiiiiiimulated. So do yourself a favor, if you go to see this movie intent on picking it apart, just stay home. But if you want an enjoyable hour or two, which will stick with you and may even provoke thoughts, then see this movie and enjoy.</fullReview>

So a bunch of naked aliens, who came trillions of miles (and really had no place in the film), who can't break down a door (please note that one door that gets boarded up opens AWAY from the boards), can't (even though they have five inch claws) claw through some bags of dog food and are vulnerable to WATER (then why come to a planet which, along with it's inhabitants are 70% water?), help a man regain his faith in god? How was this? Why did these aliens need Crop Circles? If it was for navigation, why were they in space? If it was to mark the house as potential victims, why that? I found this film to be just a mess, kind of an anti-Close Encounters. And what's with that utterly reprehensible ending, with an alien getting beaten to death with a baseball bat? I don't know why this film is getting such great reviews, since it was a mess. I didn't like Unbreakable, which was another contrived mess and I'll likely never watch this film again, putting it on the permanent shelf with A.I.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains Spoilers Going into this movie, after seeing the trailers, I expected a great movie, going more in depth in the long debated topic of crop circles, complete with lots of suspense. However, that was not it at all. They barely even go into the crop circles, they pretty much simply explain them in about one line and out of the movie. *What spoiled it for me* ~first off, the aliens themselves. They looked so dumb they pretty much took all of the suspense out of the movie, because I was not scared of them at all. ~M. Night Shyamalan cameo as the man who kills Graham's wife. His performance, for the most part, was very bad. He just had this glazed look and stared in one spot as he delivered his line in this scene that was supposed to be very emotional for Graham when he finally talks to the man that is responsible for his wife's death. ~It said in the movie the aliens were invading to take our resources. Yet they are allergic to water. The earth is mostly made up of water, so that part made absolutely no sense to me. *What I DID like* ~I must say, I did appreciate the acting in this film. Mel Gibson was very good, as always, in his role and I thought he only topped himself in this one. Abigail Breslin, the little girl who plays Bo, is the cutest thing I've seen and I thought she did a very good job as well. The rest of the cast was amazing also. ~I did like the ending, when it is all summed up and Mel Gibson gets his faith back and realized his wife's death had meaning. However, I didn't like the fact that the death of his wife could make a Godly man like a priest stop believing in God, considering it is a well known fact that everyone does die. All in all I thought this movie was okay, nothing more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One. It's over. Two. I now know I have seen the worst movie ever made and can relax a bit. I've seen movies that were bad by accident. I've never seen one that was this bad on purpose. The various premises of the film are absurd and insult the intelligence of the sixth graders whom it was obviously written for. I was tempted to see it by the approval it's director received in a weekly newsmagazine I subscribe to. I will never trust them again. And Roger Ebert has now lost my confidence as well. I don't even want to talk about the details of the film except to see it was unremitting garbage (but the little girl was sure cute!).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan lucked out with The 6th Sense. Unbreakable was a harsh disappointment, and now Signs is even worse. Shyamalan seems to have a problem with building a plot. He has excellent ideas, but when it comes down to assembling an interesting movie that actually makes sense, he falls quite short. His "plot twists" and "surprise endings" are getting worse and worse.Let's break this movie down. Forget all the amazing similarities to Panic Room (child who requires regular medication?). Forget the cheesy lines. Forget the wasted "suspenseful" scenes where Mel walks around outside, tells his dog to shut up, and returns to the house. When you strip all the inconsistencies and all the fluff, you are still left with a disappointing movie with a empty plot and poor excuse for a "surprise ending".I was expecting some sort of a revelation. Maybe my hopes were too high, but the movie essentially being about a greater power telling everyone to hit the alien with a baseball bat fell short. And don't get me started about the aliens. Who invades a planet composed primarily of water, buildings, and humans with basically unarmed beings who cannot open locked doors, melt like the witch in Wizard of Oz, and can be beaten to death by any guy wielding a bat? All of this while wearing green spandex, and carrying poison gas devices with a range of 4 inches?If you were going to create a movie based on faith and preordination, why pick such off-the-wall elements? To prove that even the most strangest of coincidences can become clear in the end? I howled with laughter when Mel exclaimed his hopeful "that's why he has athsma; his lungs were closed". It was obvious that Shyamalan was trying much too hard in this one.I wouldn't even give this film a "wait-for-the-rental" reccomendation. Don't believe the hype, it isn't worth your money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Save your money and don't bother to see this turkey. The strangest thing about this movie is that the characters seem to be sleepwalking their roles. Emotions do not ring true. There is a peculiar tinge to the reactions and personalities in the key roles that makes them seem to be off the beaten track of humanity. I am not sure who the aliens are. In fact, I think the director would have done better to have taken the film in that direction. This is one of the most peculiar, boring, and pretentious films I have seen in a long time. The only time you will gasp at this movie is if you have forgotten your inhaler.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE TRADEMARK TWIST? UNSUSPECTING AUDIENCE DUPED BY SHYAMALAN</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER: THE TRUE PLOT/STORYLINE - OTHERWISE NO SPECIFIC DETAILSThe only twist here is that this movie was marketed as a scary mystery involving the origin of crop circles and aliens but has very little to do with either. If you are in the mood for a tired old plot with heavy-handed (some might even say nonsensical) religious messages rehashed with the prospect of aliens/crop circles featured basically as a 'hook', AND you don't expect the characters to speak or act realistically, AND a logical plot is not terribly important, then you probably won't have too much of a problem with this film. But that is not the film I expected to see. My strongest, and totally unexpected, reaction to this film was ANGER! I don't mind seeing a bad film, one that just doesn't pull things off, or is the sad product of people with little talent or imagination. But this is personal! Shyamalan's previous surprises have been revelatory and thought provoking. With 'Signs', Shyamalan has demonstrated an appalling lack of respect for his audience and apparently has no ethical qualms about using them to make a buck or to force-feed them his viewpoint, whichever is the motivation. The audience here is just being duped, manipulated and ripped off. If you happen to like the end message, that's fine, no problem. However, pleaseunderstand that it is STILL a 'bait and switch'. The fact that someone might like the cheap, shoddy and unimaginative 'substitute' instead of the shiny new product they were enticed into the store (theatre) with, doesn't change the fact that a rip-off took place. All you really get is one of the oldest movie plots in history - man has faith, man suffers a loss, man loses faith, something 'miraculous' happens, man gets faith back. AND we are manipulated into seeing it, paying money and giving up 2 hours of our life that we'll never get back, by false advertising. No offense to any spiritual believers, but if I wanted to see a movie with a supposedly 'uplifting' religious message, I can think of a LOT better ones than this to watch. Yes, there was a good bit of genuine humor and a few very suspenseful moments. I was suspending disbelief and really enjoying the humor and suspense (even though very contrived) up to a point. The problem was that almost from the start the whole thing was marred with implausibilities in plot, dialogue, and character's behavior that just kept adding up until they inevitably made it difficult to enjoy the film even on a superficial level. Even so, I held out hope until the end. My reward? The big finale was just stupid, period. I can only assume the much-anticipated trademark 'twist' is, in reality, simply that many people will be suckered into paying to see a film they otherwise wouldn't have watched and won't enjoy.

		<shortDescription>So good I saw it twice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I saw the movie twice within the period of a week.My first thoughts after the movie were along the lines of "good movie, yet some things could have been improved on" when I saw it the second time, I took into consideration the great camera work and other small details that really made Signs come together (when seeing a movie for the first time, one doesn't usually sit down and analyze it for its true meaning). I wont sit here and tell you what I think the deep down hidden plot of the movie was, nor will I talk about a such and such scene where Mel Gibson does such and such with his kids. I will say that this movie is great, not quite as scary as The Sixth Sense, but I believe Signs wasn't intended to be a knock off of The Sixth Sense.To sum the movie up in a nutshell (ah what a clich that is): A small town farmer finds a crop circle in his backyard (yeah we saw that in the preview). Mel plays a single father (wife died) who lives with his two --surprisingly smart for their age-- kids, and aliens stop by for a cup of tea. That is all that can be safely said about this movie, other than "go see it!"Will you like this movie? Well that depends how you enter the theater, if you are a Sci-Fi horror buff like myself then you will enjoy the movie, if you liked the "makes you think" aspect of The Sixth Sense, then you will have no problems sitting through this movie, and leaving with an intrigued look on your face. I will say one more thing before I go, Signs had me thinking "how in the heck are they going to end this movie?" which is a very good way to keep the audience attentive, and involved in the show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Worst film of 2002!! Poorly written, poorly acted and the most over rated, over bloated acting this side of a really bad Roger Corman film!! After seeing Mel pimp this film on every talk show, looking at nefty trailers and a nefty website I was trilled to see "Signs" on opening night! Boy I was 100% wrong! This film was bad! It was boring, it was laughable and the ending was the worst. There was not one mind blowing climax, no thrills or chills, just lots of Zzzzzzzzzzs and Z grade acting with Mel looking for another Oscar &amp; Mr. Phoenix wasting his talents!!! M. Night Shmalyan is a 1 hit wonder director. "The Sixth Sense" was great, after that forget it even "Wide Awake" was bad! This man can't direct! Know wonder he is compared to Steven Spilberg, they both make over rated, over hyped films that add up to nothing but a big fat zero!. After spending 2 hrs in movie hell with "Signs", I saw "Full Frontal" the same night as well. "Full Frontal was alot better, &amp; at least Steven Soderbergh has imagination and knows the definetion of diretor unlike some directors that need a PR person to find the answer in a book! The whole idea of "Wheres God?" mixed with strange shapes made out of corn, Mel acting like a fallen priest with no faith (I had no faith in this script so we were both doing good!) with close-ups of sweaty Mel sounding like he was having an orgasam with the end of the world theme running throuhgh it etc. was just to much to take with out laughing out loud or giggling at the fact that someone somewhere wrote this B-grade wanna-be cult film. This had the silliest plot since say "Plan 9 From Outerspace or even "ID4" for that matter"! "This film was "Field of Dreams" Meets "Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind"! No sense, no purpose just a film for actors to get paid lots of money to make a really crappy, dull and non-intelligent film, by a director that needs to take sometime off and find out what it means to make good quality film or at least attend 1 film class at a film school!! The Raseberry Award for worst film should go to "Signs" as well as the Rasberry award for Worst actor and worst dirctor! The only reson this film is #1 is that it was hyped to the max and poor movie goers like me were suckered into spending hard earned movie money to see a film that we thought was going to be scary, fun etc, all it turned out to be was cheap cartoon art. The only thing scary was the fact that Hollywood spent money making this film when the same production costs could have been making a better film with more imagination &amp; story! Worst film of 2002!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Signs was a very good movie! It is not simply a thriller, but instead a story of two very controversial subjects these days, extraterrestrial life and Religion. It was a very thrilling movie that was also a tearjerker, it seems you would have to be intelligent to really understand this movie. I felt that MNS really showed what being a family is all about, and keeping the faith at the same time. It was very much better done then most thrillers, and it didn't really need the hi-fi extra graphics that most movies need, it was scary enough without that stuff. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is not an atheist. it is a true love story that will jerk your emotions and make you jump!Signs was better the `Unbreakable' - but MNS can NEVER top `The Sixth Sense'! We have another winner, and I am sure MNS will bring us many more, way to go!</fullReview>

The film blew away all my expectations of it pushing it to the very top of my favorite films list. I won't go into detail of the story (go see it now if you can!!) but it was funny and frightening and sad and shocking and all the things a good film of its genre should be. Gibson was at his best in this and young Culkin and Breslin gave chilling performances. Phoenix has got another notch on his belt and proved yet again that in front of the camera he can be anyone, do anything.The beauty of this film is that it's conceivable, not like the futuristic Matrix, Signs is a story that could happen today and that is what's so terrifying. The plot is full of twists and is perfectly woven; I cannot wait to see another film by Shyamalan.Swing away, Merrill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Minor spoilers.Okay. I've already written this once, but apparently some of you didn't read what I wrote. Many of you think that the aliens being killed with water is stupid and unreal. Think about this: if the aliens do know about water but have never visited earth and have never felt water, then they wouldn't know that water is harmful to them. They have no water on their planet. Also, that alien is computer-generated for the most part at the end of the film. They wanted him to be designed like a human. Also, many have complained about Shyamalan getting effects happy and giving in to showing the alien at the end. The next time you watch the movie, imagine the final scene without the alien. I did, and it looked pretty stupid. Shyamalan knows what he's doing, and he does it well. Signs is close to being a masterpiece and should get some Oscar nominations. 9 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story of the film combines the traditional "aliens visiting planet earth" story-line with a theme overlooked in other films, crop circles. I was disappointed in the lack of information revealed in the movie's theme. It may have perhaps been the writer's intention to have the viewers' experience the happenings from a rural farmer's family perspective, but nonetheless, the "realism" aspect of the story was hard to grasp, mostly because of the lack of revealing the reactions from people on a wider scale. To me, story-line was weak, and it seemed to me the crop circles were the least touched-upon element of the movie. However, the movie did a good job of grabbing your attention and keeping the suspense going, with many scenes that may make you jump. The movie is still worth seeing, but it may come as somewhat of a disappointment for a film starring Mel Gibson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually see movies in two places: the Signature Theaters down the road, or the UA/Century Theaters down the freeway. I say UA/Century because they're pretty much right next to each other and it doesn't matter which of them you go too. They are both good theaters, big screens, great sound, and the obligatory overpriced concessions stand food. Signature Theaters is only three months old now, and so it still has the new theater smell. The last movie I saw there was AUSTIN POWERS: GOLDMEMBER, and I'm still very impressed with the whole theater. It's close enough to walk to, if it weren't a billion degrees outside, and it's big enough to fit ten movies at a time. When I can drive I will be there every weekend. It's got large screens (bigger ones for the newest releases) and great sound systems (except when I saw STAR WARS: ATTACK OF THE CLONES with my friend Parker. It was not so good that time).The point is, that's where I see movies. Everyone's got their theaters that they know and love. But every now and then you'll visit someone or go somewhere and realize that your favorite theater is no where to be seen. And so instead of your favorite place, you have to visit some foreign theater to see a movie. In this case, I was in Denver when I saw the movie SIGNS. I've been the Denver once before, for about five hours, and this time I got to stay there for six days. During that time I got to know the 16th Street Mall near our hotel, and that was where they had a large UA Theater. When I first saw this theater, I knew that it would be a great place to see a movie, which just happened to be SIGNS. It reminded me a lot of the theater at Planet Mall in Costa Rica, where I saw HANNIBAL and THE MUMMY RETURNS. For those of you who have no clue what I mean, then you'll just have to be clueless.We arrived about sixty seconds late to SIGNS, so it was already dark and the movie was already playing- leaving me no time to see how big the room actually was. But it was packed, so we were forced to take the three seats a few rows away from the middle of the room. Pretty good seats, just a little the left of the middle, and so everything is kind of stretched out across the screen from my point of view.Anyway, now that you know where I am in this world last Saturday, I can tell you about the movie. Remember that we were a minute late, so whatever opening credits this movie showed are already over. Right now we see Mel Gibson walking around a house and then he's brushing his teeth. At the same moment I sit my butt into a seat, I hear a little girl screaming. Mel Gibson hears this, too, so he's looking out of the bathroom with a "what was that?" expression on his face. He knows that it was his daughter that just screamed, so he and his brother run out of their large country home to investigate the sound. The kids (a son and daughter) are not to be seen in the immediate area, which means they're somewhere in the cornfields that surround Gibson's house. Now Gibson and his brother run into the field to find the kids. They finally get to the girl, who leads them to the boy, who points out the GIANT CREEPY CROP CIRCLES sliced into Gibson's lovely cornfield. Zoom out to reveal strange formation of circles in cornfield. Some kind of strange sign, perhaps?Before I go on, I want to admit that cornfields have always scared me. Not because I'm allergic to corn or anything, but because corn stalks can be over ten feet tall. So imagine wandering into a cornfield, spinning around three times, and totally losing your sense of direction? How the hell are you supposed to get out? Even if you try to walk in one direction it's hard to tell if you're even moving in a straight line. You could just be walking toward the center of the field, and you have no freakin' clue. I don't like the idea of being trapped in a cornfield. I think this fear started after that one scene in the X-FILES movie a few years ago, you know, after or before the giant bee hive thing. Luckily they don't spend too much time in cornfields, except for the part when Gibson catches a glimpse of the creature's leg vanishing into the corn stalks. Even if you've seen the commercial, that will send chills down your spine.But back to the story. Mel Gibson plays Graham (like the cracker) Hess. He's an ex-priest who has lost faith in everything that has to do with religion or life. Why, you ask? It's a sad story, really. And you don't learn the whole thing immediately. You'll be shown why Graham lost his faith as the movie goes on. But before you finally learn, you wonder why he's such an inconsiderate jackass when it comes to being hopeful. He's a good family man, but he's not the best guy to go to when you want to be cheered up. I like his character, a lot, sort of like how some of us like Denzel Washington in TRAINING DAY. But Graham isn't a crooked cop, he's just a man who lost faith. You'll understand what I mean. If you want to know why he's lost faith, highlight the hidden paragraph below.His wife was killed by a local resident (played by M. Night) that fell asleep at the wheel. Graham feels that God would never allow someone so innocent, peaceful, and beautiful to die so horribly. So from that moment on his completely gives up religion. He won't even say grace at the dinner table anymore, and he's lost hope in hope.The other characters are Merrill Hess, Graham's younger brother, who is played by Joaquin Phoenix. You may remember this actor from GLADIATOR, in which he played a jealous evil king. Now he's the younger brother that has always been considered as a failure in this town of Bucks County, Pennsylvania. This is all because Merrill has the all-time strike out record for baseball as a kid. And so everyone thinks he's a loser. Poor guy. But lest we forget he's also got the homerun record, so he's quite good when it comes to swinging a baseball bat. Anyway, he's my favorite character in this movie. Then there's Graham's children, Morgan and Bo. Morgan is about ten, I think, and he's there for being Mr. Common Sense. He's the one that knows that hell is about to be unleashed, and still no one believes him. Because no one believes the kid (see EIGHT LEGGED FREAKS). Morgan is played by Rory Culkin, who does a good job. Bo is the little seven or eight year old girl played by newcomer Abigail Breslin, and she really does steal the scene sometimes. I'm not sure why, but she's just so damn good at being a little girl. Strange. The other characters would be Officer Paski and Ray Reddy. And a short cameo by Patricia Kalember, who plays Graham's wife in the flashbacks.What is this movie about? It's basically about these crop circles, at first believed to be elaborate hoaxes, that turn out to be signs that aliens are coming. Whether or not the aliens are hostile isn't learned until later. Before the aliens actually land on earth, they are sending down one or two aliens to survey the scene before the rest of them arrive (as told, almost comically, by the army general that Merrill visits). The story doesn't talk about the whole world, and how they react to the aliens, but rather just the Hess Household. It's about the family and what the think/do/talk about as this alien encounter is happening. We have no knowledge of what the aliens are doing outside of this house, except for a few short updates from the news on their TV.Now, the important question. Is SIGNS as scary as the commercials say? Is this the most fun you'll have being scared all year? Could this be the movie that brings Shyamalan out of the UNBREAKABLE ditch? One question at a time, please. First, it's not scary. Sure there are the freaks out there that think aliens will really land and destroy us all, and so this movie might scare them a little. But the rest of us are still not sure what the believe when it comes to alien life, and this movie doesn't scare us anymore than ALIENS did. It won't give you nightmares or make you second-guess those bumps in the night. I always blame the refrigerator for those noises, and after seeing SIGNS, I still do. Second, it is the most fun you'll have being scared. But the commercials lied, because I've already told you that it's not scary. Instead, it's the most fun you'll have jumping out of your seatand spilling all your popcorn. This movie has a ton of spooky scenes that end in giant heart-stopping moments with loud sounds that will cause you to jump of fright. Namely the under-the-door scene, the dropping-of-the-flashlight scene, the hand-through-grate scene, and many others. So this movie makes you jump quite often, if nothing else. My uncle jumped during one of the scenes with the dog, and his popcorn went flying all over the place (so that really does happen, in case you were wondering). And third, this movie is a good movie that brings Shyamalan back into the swing of things. It's not a perfect movie, but it's better (in my opinion) than UNBREAKABLE, which was ruined by its abrupt and unpleasant ending. I mean, why Samuel L. Jackson? Why must you kill so many for just one?The trailers also say "What one man believes might save his family." And, before I forget, this is kind of true. But it's the other way around. It's "what one man has to learn to believe that might save his family," because, as I've said, Graham has lost faith in everything. Okay, that's all. Just wanted to clarify that. And now you should know the whole basic plot.And now I guess I should recommend this movie to you. But first:Here's what the movie is: the most fun you'll have jumping out of your seat all year. great dialogue, sometimes rather hilarious. makes you increase the grip on your popcorn.Here's what it's not: scary.You should see this movie soon.- Chris</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walking out of a movie, you can have any one of many reactions. Walking out of Signs, I was still replaying the scenes through my head, realizing the message of the plot. Won't spoil anything here, but this is not a turn your brain off and see the moving pictures type of movie..it's complex, very well directed, very well acted, and entertaining. The Sixth Sense was a good story, a great movie, but the ending did leave you with a feeling that if you ever saw the movie again....you'll lose out on the suspense. Signs is a movie that you can watch again and again and pick up on some lines, scenes, or even character movement that will help you to see the "signs" even sooner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Worst film of 2002!! Poorly written, poorly acted and the most over rated, over bloated acting this side of a really bad Roger Corman film!! After seeing Mel pimp this film on every talk show, looking at nefty trailers and a nefty website I was trilled to see "Signs" on opening night! Boy I was 100% wrong! This film was bad! It was boring, it was laughable and the ending was the worst. There was not one mind blowing climax, no thrills or chills, just lots of Zzzzzzzzzzs and Z grade acting with Mel looking for another Oscar &amp; Mr. Phoenix wasting his talents!!! M. Night Shmalyan is a 1 hit wonder director. "The Sixth Sense" was great, after that forget it even "Wide Awake" was bad! This man can't direct! Know wonder he is compared to Steven Spilberg, they both make over rated, over hyped films that add up to nothing but a big fat zero!. After spending 2 hrs in movie hell with "Signs", I saw "Full Frontal" the same night as well. "Full Frontal was alot better, &amp; at least Steven Soderbergh has imagination and knows the definetion of diretor unlike some directors that need a PR person to find the answer in a book! The whole idea of "Wheres God?" mixed with strange shapes made out of corn, Mel acting like a fallen priest with no faith (I had no faith in this script so we were both doing good!) with close-ups of sweaty Mel sounding like he was having an orgasam with the end of the world theme running throuhgh it etc. was just to much to take with out laughing out loud or giggling at the fact that someone somewhere wrote this B-grade wanna-be cult film. This had the silliest plot since say "Plan 9 From Outerspace or even "ID4" for that matter"! "This film was "Field of Dreams" Meets "Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind"! No sense, no purpose just a film for actors to get paid lots of money to make a really crappy, dull and non-intelligent film, by a director that needs to take sometime off and find out what it means to make good quality film or at least attend 1 film class at a film school!! The Raseberry Award for worst film should go to "Signs" as well as the Rasberry award for Worst actor and worst dirctor! The only reson this film is #1 is that it was hyped to the max and poor movie goers like me were suckered into spending hard earned movie money to see a film that we thought was going to be scary, fun etc, all it turned out to be was cheap cartoon art. The only thing scary was the fact that Hollywood spent money making this film when the same production costs could have been making a better film with more imagination &amp; story! Worst film of 2002!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Signs was a very good movie! It is not simply a thriller, but instead a story of two very controversial subjects these days, extraterrestrial life and Religion. It was a very thrilling movie that was also a tearjerker, it seems you would have to be intelligent to really understand this movie. I felt that MNS really showed what being a family is all about, and keeping the faith at the same time. It was very much better done then most thrillers, and it didn't really need the hi-fi extra graphics that most movies need, it was scary enough without that stuff. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is not an atheist. it is a true love story that will jerk your emotions and make you jump!Signs was better the `Unbreakable' - but MNS can NEVER top `The Sixth Sense'! We have another winner, and I am sure MNS will bring us many more, way to go!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I left the theatre from Signs and I was literally shaking, from adrenaline, amazement, whatever. The film blew away all my expectations of it pushing it to the very top of my favorite films list. I won't go into detail of the story (go see it now if you can!!) but it was funny and frightening and sad and shocking and all the things a good film of its genre should be. Gibson was at his best in this and young Culkin and Breslin gave chilling performances. Phoenix has got another notch on his belt and proved yet again that in front of the camera he can be anyone, do anything.The beauty of this film is that it's conceivable, not like the futuristic Matrix, Signs is a story that could happen today and that is what's so terrifying. The plot is full of twists and is perfectly woven; I cannot wait to see another film by Shyamalan.Swing away, Merrill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Minor spoilers.Okay. I've already written this once, but apparently some of you didn't read what I wrote. Many of you think that the aliens being killed with water is stupid and unreal. Think about this: if the aliens do know about water but have never visited earth and have never felt water, then they wouldn't know that water is harmful to them. They have no water on their planet. Also, that alien is computer-generated for the most part at the end of the film. They wanted him to be designed like a human. Also, many have complained about Shyamalan getting effects happy and giving in to showing the alien at the end. The next time you watch the movie, imagine the final scene without the alien. I did, and it looked pretty stupid. Shyamalan knows what he's doing, and he does it well. Signs is close to being a masterpiece and should get some Oscar nominations. 9 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story of the film combines the traditional "aliens visiting planet earth" story-line with a theme overlooked in other films, crop circles. I was disappointed in the lack of information revealed in the movie's theme. It may have perhaps been the writer's intention to have the viewers' experience the happenings from a rural farmer's family perspective, but nonetheless, the "realism" aspect of the story was hard to grasp, mostly because of the lack of revealing the reactions from people on a wider scale. To me, story-line was weak, and it seemed to me the crop circles were the least touched-upon element of the movie. However, the movie did a good job of grabbing your attention and keeping the suspense going, with many scenes that may make you jump. The movie is still worth seeing, but it may come as somewhat of a disappointment for a film starring Mel Gibson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every few years a young director comes around and everybody raves. A few years ago it was Quentin Tarrantino, before that David Lynch. Now everyone is excited by this latest flavor (who incidentally sports a directing style highly influenced by David Lynch and Alfred Hitchcock). Sorry, Mel is one of my favorite actors, this role stretched his repetoir even more. I can't figure out why he did it. One reviewer, more perspecacious than most, understood the film was about the redemption of Mel's faith, but for goodness sake, that was the subtext of the film and only about ten percent of viewers ever understand the subtext of a complex film. But first, you must have a good compelling story and sorry, but it wasn't there. Watching this film reminded me of an impressionist painting of the pointalist school. Lots of images, good camera work (although overbearing), but the story had more holes than my old gym socks. Perhaps the Director felt he could fill those holes with some interesting camera angles and a few good boinks in the script. At the end the audience was grumbling. They'd been cheated out of a throughput plot. Maybe it was too sophisticated. The big test will be to see the fall off in box office in weeks two and three. If it drops more than 35% then the word of mouth wasn't good. If not, then the picture has legs. One thing this picture does lack is repeatability. I, for one, have no desire to see it again. Why did Mel make it? Did Frank Marshall get down on his knees and beg? Remind me to ask Mel the next time I see him.</fullReview>

Two dogs get killed in the movie, both in a fairly horrid fashion.The acting in Signs is so terrible that my first reaction was that this was another `pod person' movie, and all our main characters had been taken over by aliens.

		<shortDescription>A great postmodern sci-fi film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*possible spoilers* I find it interesting that those who are members of the postmodern generations (x-ers and millennials) find this movie more appealing then the boomers and others. Perhaps it's because this movie is not about how our scientific minds and weapons destroy the invading forces, but rather how faith and love overcome adversity. It's really not a movie about aliens invading at all. It's a movie about finding your place in the world, and remembering what's important. (Much like Unbreakable... which too was a great postmodern movie)Signs is great and scary because we are taken into the life of an every day family, and are forced to witness the happenings in the world through their eyes. It is scary because we only know what they know, which is very little. And the scariest part... which many have disliked, was the end, when the aliens just up and left. Why? Because we still don't know. Did they really leave, or is it a trick. And when Gibson's character unplugs the t.v., it became even scarier. The only link to the outside world is severed, and suddenly we are made to feel uneasy again. Shamaylans genius is in his ability to scare us simply by unplugging a t.v.I mentioned the ending, and how most people gripe about it. But seriously, what do you want. Would it have been better if there was an Independence Day type battle, or Mel Gibson running out with the family, and kicking some alien ass. Or how about a surprise ending where we discover, as has been suggested by some, that the little girl is an alien, and she protects them. Or maybe she turns on them. (I'm picturing the scene in Night of the Living Dead in the cellar with the young girl stabbing her mother with a gardening spade) Personally, I thought the ending was perfect. We don't get to see the fight. We don't get to see the aliens poisoning people. We only know what the family knows. They are just as confused as us, because they don't know any more than us. To go outside the boundaries of their experience would be to ruin the genius of the film, and destroy the suspense.Go to this movie not because you want to see an alien movie. Go because you want to see a movie about a family and their struggle to overcome adversity in their lives. You will get scarred along the way. Consider it a bonus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible rip-off of War of The Worlds for the politically correct</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I love science fiction movies. We are such fanatics that we bend over backwards to find something nice in even poor examples of the genre. So today, in spite of some really bad reviews, we trecked over to our neighborhood theatre to take in the first show.While I am a Brooklyn New York kid, my wife is the first off an American farm since 1710. This is important, because the director obviously has no knowledge whatever about farm life, even in an upscale area like Bucks County, Pa.Essentially, this badly done rip-off of War of the Worlds takes place in a rural setting. Our alleged hero (played by Mel Gibson) is a widower who lives with his younger jock brother (played by Joaquin Phoenix) our hero's two children and two German Shephard dogs. They see crop circles, extraterrestrials, blah, blah, blah.With that said, everything falls apart, so much so that the audience around us laughed several times at the absurdity. And we live in a very upscale neighborhood where males bend over backwards to display their feminine side to get dates with yuppie women.In the first place, no farmer lives in a rural area without the benefit of at least a shotgun. And few if any farmers are vegetarians. And there was no livestock on this large afluent farm... not even a chicken. And farm children don't come out with remarks like "aliens are vegetarians because their brain develops better (Sorry Mr. Shyamalan. You may be a Hindu but there's no place in the cinema for preaching your vegin philosophy)."Even the two large German Shephard dogs are passive. When they sense a threat, they p**s on the kitchen floor and attack the children they love so much. Boy, whoever wrote this rot doesn't know German Shephard's very well.The only male image is a macho female police officer. In the entire movie, she is the only armed person. But in keeping with passive dogma, no firearm is ever drawn.Throughout the entire movie, the men elicit expressions of cows in the pasture and never come to the defense of anyone, including the children. Even without firearms (highly unlikely in a rural Pennsylvania setting), they never pick up a kitchen knife or even a broom for defense. They just stare blankly and hug the children when threatened by aliens. Come to think of it, they clutch the children tightly, placing them as shields. Maybe they hoped their vegetarian children would grab a kitchen fork and defend their beleagured home.There were other "progressive" cliches also, but one really sticks in my mind. A recruiting Sergeant (a Sergeant First Class to be exact) and the only soldier in the film is portreyed as a moron. And the only person enlisting in his office looks like a retarded ax murder on the run.All in all, this film was an exercise in sucking up to every progressive special interest group. But as for science fiction, it will go down as dull, improbable and a waste of time.This movie deserves a "0" rating for robbing the audience, but we had a good lunch afterwards so I'll give it a "1".</fullReview>

Upcoming Spoiler Alert!Some have complained that if the aliens have studied earth, and are coming to get earth's resources, then why didn't they know that water was deadly to them, and why didn't they wear wet-suits. First of all, if there's no water on their planet, then they've probably never felt it. Therefore, they didn't know it's harmful to them. Second of all, this may sound like a cheap explanation, but maybe, they didn't wear suits because they were wearing a skin-tight protective shield, or perhaps they just underestimated earthlings and didn't think that they would need the suits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an art director maybe I'm qualified to point out some things other viewers may not grasp.This was a purely pointless exercise in film making with so many holes in the plot that it defied credibility which led to me fidgeting and squirming in my seat for the full running time (spoilers ahead):A. For a rural preacher-cum-farmer, Mel Gibson wears entirely too many brand new freshly bought clothes, has a nice supply of makeup personnel around to keep his hair obviously over-dyed at all times, and always seems to be distinctly UN-weatherbeaten for a man of the soil. Being freshly shaved throughout the movie seems to take away any realism from the goings-on which would lead most folks appear quite ragged after a few days of what his character was supposed to be experiencing. Perhaps his character was written to be the Martha Stewart of farming. Horribly miscast for box office value, GQ Farmer Mel sleepwalks through his role, making one wish for a rough hewn leading man-a guy with dirt under his fingernails (Harrison Ford, perhaps) that could at least make the character credible-in spite of the comic book dialogue.B. Gibson is a fella who vows not to bring TV into his world while sitting on the biggest story in U.S. history. The entire world is focused on the aliens in the Mideast and India and wrings its CNN-hands while back in the states, 45 miles from Philly, the world knows nothing. Mel does. He's cut off a creature's fingers while the alien is trapped behind a farmhouse door. Does anyone in his household care while he casually relates this incident and forgets about it? Heck no. They just go on watching TV and cracking insipid jokes. I believe both his inquisitive children and brother would want to know more and sneak-off and pay a return visit to the creature to take a curious peek at it...and maybe take matters into their own hands.C. Mel and his kin seem to live in a vacuum. The rural police just disappear after the first reel and never again go looking for Mel and family, even when the news goes worldwide and the end of the Earth seems very near. Unusual, 'cause in small towns like this the authorities are, well, neighborly and would be concerned at least, if not for Mel and his brother, for the children. Phones never ring. Surely the police know the end of Pennsylvania is at hand and something must be done to save the town's Favorite Son And Family.D. Sophisticated aliens from another galaxy seem to travel through space sans clothing. Wonder if they walk around stark naked on their own planet where variations in temperature are not a problem. ? Or maybe this advanced race has "evolved" past the hangups found here on Earth.Oh yes. They melt (in an obvious paean to the "Wicked Witch's" death in "the Wizard of Oz") when water is poured upon them. The aliens didn't seem to undertake a thorough scouting report on the planet they insisted upon occupying (lotsa water here on Earth...or maybe they (gasp!) didn't know about water!). Please. I spent six bucks for this?E. The aliens are easily routed and defeated by forces here on Earth with a glossed-over explanation that a mysterious and unexplained experimental strategy was undertaken by a group of parched middle easterners-which drove the creatures from our planet! Were they sprayed with water-laden crop dusters?F. M. Night Shyamalan's awkward and self-serving cameo goes on for far too long. Sure, his character COULD turn-up in rural Pennsylvania. So could lovable CrocMeister Steve Irwin, but both folks would be highly improbable occupying farmhouses in lovely Buck's County.I just can't go on. 1 out of 10 for this overlong piece of Celluloid Sominex.If you want to witness highly entertaining (and far more believable) shtick of this genre, pick up a DVD of George Pal's "War Of The Worlds". Or "The Day The Earth Stood Still." Or the original "Invasion Of The Body Snatchers."No need to hurry, though.Those films will be around a heck of a lot longer than "Signs".</fullReview>

Night did not want to spell it out for us so cut and dry this time around, he relied a lot on the audience's perception of this movie. M. Night did not wait for the very end to twist the plot like he in Unbreakable and Sixth Sense, but he used a more clandestine approach to make the audience think and send them back to see it right away at least two or three times to check their theories.SPOILERSM. Night has taken a child's candid and insightful approach to life as the key in all of his films. It as if what he has been trying to tell all us is that children are the key to all of the life's mysteries. Therefore, just as Haley Joel Osment had the key to the purgatory creatures and Wide Awake's Joseph Cross held the key to answering his own impossible question, little Bo Hess has the key to what actually went on in this movie. Her first lines were strange but overshadowed by the horror of such a mammoth crop circle. Bo said to her father `You're in this dream too?' and her father, Graham (Mel), replied `This isn't a.' (Graham never finished the lie) Bo comments about dreams two other times throughout the films duration. M. Night also shows many night figures like metal moon wind figure blowing from a ledge of the barn and star cut outs of wood during the daylight to contrast with a dreamlike atmosphere. These contrasting images portray a dream taking place that even though the dream takes place during daylight hours, night figures still exist, perhaps solely for symbolism. Having the entire movie, except the very ending when Graham is shown becoming a father again, dismisses a lot of the distasteful comments said about the film. Some did not like the abrupt Sci-fi turn the film took at the end, they prefer that M. Night tap into the tricks he used in Unbreakable and continue to only show a dark reflection of the alien or just its shadow and an occasional finger or two but not the entire alien. But, dreamlike apparitions must be shown in their entirety unless the dreamer as a lack of imagination. The movie did not show a cut a dry dream for one reason. Think how upset audiences would be if M. Night panned from Graham's bedroom from the dream to him waking up. The audience would walk away feeling that they accomplished nothing by going to see the movie that just witnessed a man's dream that re-established his faith. Therefore, it was imperative for M. Night to flash forward to the dream's outcome and put in the hand of the audience to decide what they just saw.M. Night keeps amazing me with his innovative style, twists, and plots. Movies about questioning faith are potent force in everyone's mind and M. Night tackled the task in the strangest but most perfect and thrilling way. I have become the biggest M. Might Shyamalan fan and I know want to be the first in line to all of his movies and I hope that one day I could meet or even get a chance to work with this brilliant filmmaker. I gain something new every time I re-watch Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs. IN a disappointing summer season of blockbuster movies, Signs stands alone as the must see of the summer and the must own when it comes out on tape just so you can enjoy this ingenious piece of filmmaking over and over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll keep this short. For those of you who think this is a thriller about crop circles - think again. For those of you who think this is a trip down a sci-fi pathway laid decades ago - think again.The film superbly mixes the elements of everyday life, a tragedy, unexplained occurrances and life outside the planet to address a philosophical issue we'll most likely never be able to answer... Is everything fated or merely coincidence?The movie tickles your mind early on - leading you along it path of crop-circles and sci-fi. Dropping between these sub-plots is the thick of the story told, the events revealed as flashbacks are quick and unobtrusive, yet speak volumes about each character's emotional state. As the movie begins to race, flashbacks pound harder. The dialogue takes on a more desperate feel, and you as the moviegoer are just beginning to realize the statement the movie is about to make...Was this meant to be?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raises a fair question...do you believe in it or not?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, lets see, I had the privilege of seeing this movie a few days ago. It was a strange experience, full of suspense, intrigue and smart dialogue (the kind of dialogue that makes you think or laugh sometimes), but I think the film has been misunderstood. The misunderstanding of the concept of the film is not the director's fault, not even the plot, it is merely a wrong interpretation from the advertising of the film. In a way it works, since the ads never prepare you for what you are going to see, which is good and surprising, but for a reason this is not sufficient for some people who are stuck in the idea of just seeing what the ads presented.Once you see it, you will know that signs were not those huge things no one could explain, but other things more complicated that require your faith in a good director like Shyamalan to fall for it. Somewhere in the movie there's a scene in which the character played by Joaquim Phoenix asks Mel Gibson's character what he believes and Gibson says that there are always two different kinds of people, the believers and the skeptics. Taking those words, it is true, I found people hating this film and some other loving it, two groups, one believing and the others not. I take a stand on the first group, since I haven't found much movies this year that raises so many questions and makes you think more than once of what you just saw.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signs of what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs of great filmmaking? I don't think so.First of all I am pretty angry about several things. First, I am particularly distressed that the individuals posting here who liked the movie insist on accusing those of us who didn't of needing some kind of over the top special effects to enjoy a film. WRONG! I can think of many great films that did not need exploitative or gratuitous effects and were fantastic films. I can also think of films that had great effects and were still pretty bad movies, Independence Day comes to mind. My taste runs from Woody Allen to John Carpenter and I try hard to judge each film on its own merits. Speaking of John Carpenter he did a bang up job with Starman with minimal effects and the Jenny Hayden character was able to regain her faith after the death of her husband without me feeling totally manipulated and ripped off. Secondly, I am a bit confused by the overall rating of 8+ when so many people seem to share my sentiments. Mostly I am mad that I paid good money and wasted the time to see this film.!!CONTAINS SPOILERS!!I do not understand the comparisons to Hitchcock. I am a big Hitchcock fan and the only thing I can think of that is similar is the theme of an average guy caught up in unusual circumstances. I guess you could also say that Shyamalan is trying to build suspense through psychological terror instead of doing it overtly. Unfortunately he uses every obvious psychological gimmick in the book to yank the audience's chain. Hitchcock was much more subtle with a long buildup and lots of character exploration prior to things getting heavy. The main problem with this film is that the story fails to perform the most important function to make the premise work. There is very little information given to help us understand or like these characters. The most glaring example of this is the characters' reaction to the two dogs dying. The main characters are totally insensitive to the deaths of the beloved family pets. When the boy kills the first dog the family is barely upset about it and the second one is carelessly left outside for the evil aliens to massacre. If I ever wanted to try to like these characters or care about them it eventually becomes impossible. Then there is the matter of a total lack of background and believability. As many others have stated, why is he a farmer as well as a preacher? If he is a farmer, does he do any farming type stuff, ever? Where was Merrill before all this happened? What compelled him to come help Graham out? Neither Mel Gibson's nor Joaquin Phoenix's character reacts or behaves as one would expect people in this rural setting, or anywhere else for that matter, to act. They also do not seem to behave consistently within the parameters of who they are supposed to be. Actually, so little background is given, it is hard to figure out who they are supposed to be. I find it hard to believe that anybody who was just told that their neighbor has an alien locked in the pantry would not even try to pry some additional information from them. I don't care what the history between the two people is, basic survival instinct would dictate that you would want to know as much as possible. Same thing when they are locked in the house and then the basement. I am appalled that these guys supposedly care about these kids and don't even pick up one of the many gardening tools lying about to prepare to even try to defend themselves. Especially since Merrill was the baseball player who would swing at anything. It was almost painful to see two really good actors like Mel and Joaquin made to play such two-dimensional characters with such rigid, stilted dialogue. Mel's monologue about there being two kinds of people was good but seemed out of place when the rest of the time his character was basically despondent. Why was the stuff about the redneck neighbors even mentioned? The little boy was precocious to the point of being annoying. The little girl was cute and quirky. The lady sheriff was an engaging character and very well portrayed by Cherry Jones. She was actually the one saving grace of the film.I could go on and on about the ridiculousness of the whole aliens with an aversion to water who are going to invade our planet to harvest humans using ground tactics nonsense but I think we need to go ahead and bury that horse. There are so many holes in the plot and script that my head is ready to explode trying to comprehend how M. Night could have made this film. I loved Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. I thought his slow, deliberate style of storytelling was totally appropriate in the context of those two films. However, Mr. Shyamalan needs to recognize that different stories require different treatments. Just because this formula worked a couple of times before does not mean he can make every movie using the same kind of devices and stylistic elements. I think he is a very talented writer and director who just needs to grow up and get over himself.I also share the sentiment of many who feel cheated by virtue of the trailers for this film. I do believe that when we, as the paying, movie going public are marketed to, that the filmmaker or distributor should have a responsibility to make the marketing reflect at least some of the flavor of the film. I basically feel like I was tricked into watching what was essentially an exercise in how much the viewer could be manipulated with the fewest possible resources in terms of sets, effects and dialogue. A kind of minimalism carried to the point of absurdity.I will see M. Night's next exploit, only because I now feel like he owes me something and I would like to give him the chance to make up for this fiasco.One last comment: One of the other reviewers on this board suggested that this was all a nightmare the little girl was having. That would actually make the most sense out of everything. Unfortunately, I do not believe that was the intended twist. I think M. Night would have made it more obvious at the end if that was the case. I really wish that he had.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shyamalan does it again. Often I have not felt the impact of his movies until I have walked out of the theatre and sat thinking about later on. I was bit skeptic as to how can he pull off an Alien invasion movie, which is more of a popcorn movie theme, but he has done it brilliantly. It's not so much about Aliens, but more about human fear and faith and it's brilliantly executed. Don't go and see this movie expecting a Spielberg-like suspense thriller, it's deeper than that. Fear of Alien invasion has never been so realistically portrayed before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>M. Knight Shyamalan owes me $10 and two hours of my life back. This movie proves that he is a one hit wonder, still riding on the wave of ego building praise that Sixth Sense gave him. From the opening credits ("Written, Produced and Directed by M. Knight Shyamalan") to the closing credits ("An M. Knight Shyamalan Movie") to his own appearance as a minor but major to they storyline character, this movie seethed of him telling us how brilliant he thinks he is.Put aside for a moment that this movie is about aliens, nothing in this movie made sense. From the very beginning of the movie, nothing made sense. What made Mel and Joaquin get out of bed at the very beginning of the movie and know that they had to run into the corn fields? What made the kids go into the corn fields in the first place? And the little girls first line, "Are you in my dream too?" HUH?And please, M. Hit us over the head with your "clever" plot devices. The close up of Rory and the enhaler. Gee, is that going to be a plot device. The 3 second shot of the wall with the faded cross on it. What are you trying to tell us, M.? Mel is not a tidy person?Do not go see this movie! While I think he is a great director, I sincerely hope this movie ends M.'s career as a writer, producer and actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shayamalan's best picture yet, I left the theater uplifted.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It sounds stupid to say I left a science fiction movie uplifted, but the movie isn't really about alien invasions at all. It's about Faith, a base belief in human beings that life can be better than it is, hope for the future and acceptance of the past and present. A belief that there is a reason for things to happen the way they do.I keep reading reviews saying the ending of the movie left people hanging. I think they are missing what M Night was trying to do with this film. The movie doesn't answer alot of questions about the aliens, and I think this is why people say the ending is abrupt. I don't think the movie is about the aliens at all. It's about what happens when a man who claims to have lost his faith has just that put to the test. Mel Gibsons character is meant to provoke something in all of us. His character is designed by M Night to hold a mirror up to our lives, and reaffirm that good things can happen and that maybe things do happen for the best. I think he wrote this movie to give people hope.Shayamalan used the Aliens (in brilliantly chilling fashion to test the Faith of his character in the movie. Obviously, a scary alien invasion will test a man's character. Shayamalan found a great way to put his character to the test, a really frightening one, and a topic that keeps you interested. He could have told the same story with no aliens in it, it just would have been billed as a drama and less people would go to see it. He used scary aliens to sugar coat a story that many viewers wouldn't see otherwise, a really smart move, and a great result for us!My guess is he (M Night) wants people to identify with mel Gibson and make that emotional journey with him as the movie progresses. Do things happen for a reason? Is there and grand scheme of things? Does life have a point or purpose? These are the topics Shayamalan was focusing on when he wrote the script, and I think that his hope was just to get people thinking about what they believe. What the director believes is pretty obvious by the end of the film but I won't ruin the ending for those who haven't seen it. The point is, this movie will move you emotionally, and scare you to death at the same time, and I can't think of any other movie that can say that. What a ride, absolutely fantastic filmaking!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Thoughts on Signs and Why You Should Listen To Them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After viewing The Sixth Sense I realized that a new director had been born, and seemingly out of nowhere. The movie was filled with great camera shots, good plot twists, great acting, and an unexpected ending. M. Night Shyamalan had made his mark on the world, suprising everyone. His earlier film "Wide Awake", which isn't a bad movie, was soon forgotten. Many people have never even heard of it. With three movies in the can he moved on to his next one, Unbreakable. I actually enjoyed Unbreakable. I felt it to be a very creative film with another good story. Unfortanately, many people shared opposite views than mine and Unbreakable did not do as well as I hoped. Soon after Unbreakable, Signs was announced and I knew that a movie about aliens directed by M. had to be good. So i waited a year, anxiously awaiting the arrival of Signs. Finally the day came.I saw Signs on a 70 ft. movie screen by my house. I saw it at my favorite theater, obviously because of the screen. When the opening credits started I was incredibly hoping that this would be a good movie. The credits were strong and powerful, with music by James Newton Howard, I was immediatly hooked. The movie was exactly what I hoped for. It was creepy, inteligent, comical, suspenseful, and just a great experience to watch. M. Night Shyamalan is truly a master of his profession. He can write and direct and he's good at doing both. I had chills while watching the movie. I thought Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix fed of each others line brilliantly. Even the children could act. The daughter was very funny. Wherever you are Mrs. Culkin, keep shooting out kids because the all can act. Rory Culkin did suprise me because i didn't think he could perform at the level in which he did. The score to the movie was fantastic. As an avid score collector I would know. Overall, the movie lived up to my expectations and went beyond them.Now you shouldn't just shrug and say, "What is this kid talking about...he's such an idiot." I go to a movie almost every weekend and i usually see more than one. Now there are stupid people out there who think they know what they are talking about, but they don't. They think if they use big fancy words us neandrathols will think they are king and believe everything they say. Well don't, listen to me and everything will just be fine and dandy.TRUST ME, GO SEE SIGNS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>my official review: (no spoilers)"All Signs Are Good"Signs is aptly titled, not only because of what the movie itself deals with, but also, because it hints at things to come from the brilliant M. Night Shyamalan...It starts off setting up the story we see in the previews: there's crop circles appearing everywhere...what are they, and whose making them? As the story progresses, we find out, as we all know, that these are indeed alien creations. We then are left to wonder and figure out, "why are they doing this?". This proves to be the underlying question of the movie. Along the way, we experience several jumps and jolts (actually, more like half a dozen) mixed in with refreshing bits of witty humor, an unexpected yet wonderful and ingenious addition to the film. As the plot continues to unfold and reach to deeper depths, we learn the circumstances of the death of Graham's wife, and hence, why he has turned against his once embraced God. There is one particularly striking speech by Hess about types of people that really brings this aspect to heart. At a point in the movie, we finally see the real plot emerge: can this family stick together and make it through, even in spite of the desperate times?The technical aspects of the movie are outstanding. The acting is top notch, and perhaps even award-worthy for Joaquin Phoenix. The many quirks and subplots of the film provide superb foreshadowing for the rest to come. Everything involved with the movie is beautiful, and were this film to be properly recognized by the academy, I feel it would receive nominations for cinematography, supporting actor (Phoenix), editing, sound, score, screenplay, and directing, and maybe even best picture. Even if one does not find the story to be involving and compelling as I did, they surely must enjoy the movie for it's technical brilliance.The movie as a whole feels like a superbly crafted mix between a great summer thriller and a moving family drama. Expectations are met, and to some points, exceeded by this film. Others have commented about the story's ending being a letdown, but to me, it was fitting to the real meaning of the movie. Sure, certain aspects of the film are cheesy, such as the some of the visuals and the few plot holes, but it's all in good fun, so my reccomendation is this: see this film, not for a twist ending that won't be there when the time comes, but for a thrilling, taut, and engaging movie-going experience of a lifetime.9.4 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'd looked forward to this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I really enjoyed "Sixth Sense" and had high hopes for M. as a filmmaker. I also loved "The Fast Runner" so I obviously have no problem with slow-paced films. I thought Spielberg's "Close Encounters" was some of his best work, so there should be no doubt that I have no problem with the theme of alien abduction/invasion. And, yes, I generally enjoy Mel Gibson. Though I don't think he is necessarily a great actor, he definitely has enjoyable screen presence and I've seen him nail some scenes (Danny Glover seemed to bring out the best in him).That said, let me also say, "M. what were you thinking?" Actually, I think I know what you were thinking. You were thinking, "Everybody loves me and tells me I'm the next Spielberg, so it must be true." Ego, my boy, is the surest way I know to create bad film...and this was (in my opinion, mind you) truly bad film. And no, you can't really hide the fact that you have your ego rather heavily invested in everyone else thinking you are the next Spielberg when you use the LARGEST TYPEFACE in all of your credits for the one immediately following the fade out that read, AN M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN FILM...just in case we had forgotten. There is also that matter of placing yourself in front of the camera as the veterinarian who had killed the wife, showing us all how well you can emote...which ain't so much. Keeping your head down and looking remorseful does not constitute acting.Honestly, M., were you making a sly spoof of the genre or were you just incompetently ripping off the films that influenced you? Did you think it was clever to only show the alien in soft focus? Can you really imagine that a family that has locked itself in the basement away from a bunch of hostile aliens would simply turn off their flashlights and go to sleep? Do you think anyone would be able to sleep if they thought the end of the world was at hand?! One more...and be honest about this...did you really just make this movie to sucker us all into the theatre on the pretext of seeing a fun, scary film only to pull the old bait-and-switch routine with your particular religious hysteria? I suspect you've been reading a bit of Deepak Chopra, judging by the sudden introduction of the synchronicity theme at the end (Mel Gibson chanting, "There are no coincidences, there are no coincidences"). What did that have to do with anything? I can think of no explanation than that you had in mind the whole time to razzle-dazzle us with alien-created crop circles (which you, inexplicably, decided to rename crop "signs") only to sucker punch us with a simplistic and bland pseudo-spirituality at the end. The whole thing reminded me of a Scientology pitch.Wait a minute...is M a Scientologist? That could explain a lot. For example, it could explain why he threw in the crackpot writer on aliens who is really the one who knows what is going on. Come to think of it, there is even a bit of naming pattern evident here: L. Ron Hubbard / M. Night Shyamalan. Hmmm... Though really, did we need a kid reading a book to tell us that if the aliens are hostile there are one of two possible outcomes--they win or we win? That's usually the case in those situations. Even "Independence Day" paid the courtesy to our collective intelligence to assume that we would figure that out for ourselves. Just because Mel Gibson's character had lost his faith doesn't mean he had turned into an imbecile, too. Worse, you seem to think your audience is stupid. Well, I was stupid enough to pay to see the movie...but I won't be stupid enough to see another picture that includes the overblown (literally and figuratively) title: AN M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN FILM. For this I thank you: you've saved me about ten bucks in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great thriller but seemed kind of shallow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***** WARNING - SPOILERS *****This movie has some brilliant directing. People are talking about Shyamalan as the next Spielberg but he reminds me more of a modern version of Hitchcock with his directing skills and innovative camera techniques.However, despite the wonderful direction of the movie, it was very disappointing to me. Shyamalan seems to like putting a twist in all of his films. In the Sixth Sense, the big twist worked beautifully. In Unbreakable, it didn't quite work as well since the twist was rather poorly-developed and the story wasn't very good anyway IMHO (in spite of the excellent directing and acting in the film).In Signs, the twist is again rather poorly-developed and the premise for it is seemingly tossed in rather awkwardly (in my opinion) during a speech made halfway through the movie which is basically about beliefs as to whether everything happens for a reason under control of a god (fate) or not.By the end of the movie, the twist is revealed and we find out that the main focus of the movie is not so much about aliens as on a man losing his faith finding 'signs' of miracles happening. To remind us to go 'ooooh' and 'aaaah' at the poorly-developed twist, the scenes of the premise speech is shown in a flashback. The aliens turn out to be a rather exotic vehicle for testing the man's faith - convenient because they're the only things that keep the movie exciting and allow for neat but misleading trailers.Some people might find the religious revelations to be really great and exit the theater feeling really good about themselves. Personally, I just winced a bit and tried to shrug it off. I think the movie tries to be like Contact by mixing in questions of religion and faith with extraterrestrial activity, but falls short of being the great through-provoking film that Contact turned out to be.Nevertheless, Signs does manage to be a great thriller with some very suspenseful scenes heightened by Shyamalan's great directing and the film's effective use of music and sound effects. However, don't expect too much more or you might get disappointed like me. I think Shyamalan should keep to directing and try finding some other people to do the writing for him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signs by design</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan's "Signs" was totally unexpected, not with respect to the ending, but rather for it's funny and quirky style in the midst of a story structured for great apprehension and fear of the unknown. Ultimately Shyamalan has created a parable about the nature of faith, and that things happen by design. The fact the Shyamalan does all this in one movie is an amazing accomplishment. Mel Gibson is a Graham Hess, who is a farmer in town in Pennsylvania. He has two children, Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin). We soon learn that Graham was an Episcopal priest, who left when his wife was killed in an accident. Also Graham's brother, Merrill, is also living on the farm helping him out with his kids. One of the Signs appears in Graham's corn fields. They are the kind we saw in the 1970's that were supposedly used my ancient astronauts (i.e. aliens) to navigate earth. Strange things are happening. Dogs are going crazy. Bo says that her glasses of water taste funny. Soon after spaceships appear all over the world-- all on TV. Do they come in peace? Mel Gibson gives one of his best performances. As Graham he is suffering, and not only has he lost his faith, but even has it that God has betrayed him. There is an awesome scene in the movie where Graham and Merrill are watching new reports of the spaceships. Graham says that there are two camps when it comes to "signs": one group sees the wonder of it, because they believe in something by design, the other fears the end of the world, because they see that they are ultimate all alone. Both are generated. And Graham falls in the latter. Gibson's character is struggling, and he makes his plight so noble and human. This makes the movie worth watching. The interesting thing about "Signs" is that along with the tension and apprehension created for the possible aliens, it is not really that necessary to the story. And this actually makes "Signs" special, because it is really about Graham's life and his family. Shyamalan surprises us in the end in a paradoxical way, in terms of our expectations. It is satisfying and honors the integrity of the characters he made us care about, particularly Gibson's Graham. "Signs" is a very good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw Signs int the cinema yesterday. The movie was brilliantly well-done! M.Night Shymalan again creates a thriller masterpiece. He also appeared in this film, just like he does in all of his films. Mel Gibson (What Women Want) and Joaquin Phoenix(Gladiator) were great. Also little bro of Maucauly Culkin and Abigail Breslin were also good with their performances. This movie had laughs, chills, sad moments, and some rally great "jump" scenes. I give Signs a 10 out of 10!!! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wasnt as good as it was hyped up to be...... (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was disappointing. Firstly, the Americans hyped it up to be such a great film and absolutely scary, WHICH I KNEW FOR A FACT WAS RUBBISH seen as the Americans couldnt even make horror films if their lives depended on it...'scary' to them is like someone dropping a bottle on to the floor and the sound created is enough to send chills down their spine! I was amazed at how many of the audience in the cinema in New York (where i am on holiday) screamed every time they saw something remotely unusual..such as an alien hand suddenly grabbing someone..whereas in England, the audience would have remained quiet and said: "Ok....where is the scary bit??"Secondly, the ending was much too short and a greater effect would have been to show more of the reflection of the alien being on the television screen and a view from behind it before showing a brief glimpse of it right at the very end rather than just to show its whole face and body for a few minutes and spoil it. Shamyalan had built up the suspense and made us aware of the beings' presence throughout the movie, so why spoil it all at the end?Thirdly, the movie on the whole is very short and it seemed that the only good scenes were at the very end of the film. I read somewhere that you shouldnt go alone to watch this film..well thats right...you should bring all your friends with you to have GOOD laugh at how the Americans think a 'scary, alien' film should be.I AM very sure that if this film was released in England with the same director and crew, it would have been an absolute flop because the Americans, as usual, think their movies are the best when in actual fact they are mainly rubbish and not even scary, i.e. Mothman Prophecies, Signs and the worst of all: Minority Report. A British director would have done a MUCH better job of it. But Shamylan does write his movies well, i have to admit. Shame he couldnt direct it well. i give it a not-so-scary 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Plot Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok imagine this, you are part of a super advanced alien colony that needs to attack another planet to survive. You decide that Earth looks good enough so you start heading towards it. You finally get there and all looks good, you have the planet in your grasp, until wait! oh no! You forgot that you went to a planet that is 90% water and water makes your freaking skin melt off. This movie features some of the biggest plot holes i have ever seen and some of the crappiest aliens also. I think the thing that bothered me the most about this movie (no not M. Night Shyamalamandingdong's pitiful attempt at acting) was the scene in which one of the aliens was beaten mercilessly with a baseball bat and did absolutely nothing to stop from being killed. These are the same aliens that could jump up on 10 foot high roofs in a matter of seconds and yet they apparently cannot do anything but stand still when being beaten over the head with a bat. I will give this movie some credit however because if you look past the bad acting and the retarded aliens there are a few scenes with very good cinematography. Lastly, I hope to God that if the Earth is attacked by aliens in the future, they are the ones from this movie so all you have to do to survive is stand by a freaking sprinkler.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first sign I got watching 'Signs' was a long yawn. The second sign I got was my eyelids feeling heavy. The third sign I could not wait for was the neon one spelling exit. The director who brought us 'the sixth sense' is what is known in the music industry as a one hit wonder. Even A-Ha had one good song. 'Signs' makes 'Police Academy 6' look like an Oscar contender. The plot is.....invisible. The characters boring, (I mean I was hoping that little brat with asthma would just stop breathing and die already.) Mel Gibson must have taken so much money on his salary little else was available for special effects. Check out the alien who looks like a Winter Olympian luge athlete with the tight green bodysuit. This is one of the poorest movies I have ever seen in my life. I could not even recommend this to my worst enemy. 0/10 (I can't see where to give it 1/10. Yes, it is that bad.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's time for your close-up Mr. Gibson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. OK can we hold off for awhile with the "genius" label for M. Night Shyamalan? Is he talented? Definitely. Can he put together a beautifully made film? Definitely. Is he the most creative story teller of our time? Hardly. "The Sixth Sense" was a very well crafted, twisted, almost mystical film. The surprise of "Unbreakable" was obvious from the first half hour, but still enjoyable. "Signs" brings us another well told story, only this one appears to be a rejected X-Files script - very simplistic. A couple of nice scares thrown in for fun, but overall this one is a bit boring. Could Mel have underplayed his character anymore? Two awfully cute kids help cover-up the straight forward story. I would also encourage Mr. Shayamalan to not succumb to the Clint Eastwood school of becoming the star in your own movie - it is a distraction and direction will suffer. If you wish to act, go act in someone else's movie. It is a big jump from cameos to critical roles. Another outstanding score from James Newton Howard - our best film scorer working today (including John Williams and the caught-in-a-rut Danny Elfman). Mr. Shayamalan, you are obviously a movie fan who gets paid to make movies. This is a life many of us only dream of. We are depending upon you bring something new to the screen every time. You are set financially - don't let that stagnate you creatively. The next one is important.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...to him going in the direction of having something of that influence down the line. M goes at it, unlike Spielberg, largely through his script work, the way he puzzle together the elements of character, dialogue, structure. Often, the epiphany of his work is the coming together of all the elements which crystalizes into his point. The glasses of water all over the house, the little boy's asthma, the strike out king...all these elements climax into Gibson's character's absolution. The leads are all wonderfully written and performed. There are scenes that stand out in my mind but given the Spielberg proclamation (made by Time or Newsweek, I don't recall), the one that stands tallest is the dinner table one where Gibson finally starts to go to pieces. Thinking back on it now, I don't remember if mashed potatoes were involved, but it did play like a rift on Spielberg and Dreyfuss'dinner scene in "Close Encounters."</fullReview>

It is not the Sixth Sense but it is wholly satisfying. A lot depends on whether you are a Type A as defined in the film. If you are, you will love this movie. If not, you will probably dismiss it as something trivial. I had read a lot of the previews and I expected to be disappointed so that may be why I was so pleasantly surprised. M. Knight is really a very effective director and his script is very good. There are parts that are slow but they have to be because the dialogue during these moments are very important to the theme.

It's about what people go through in their hours of needs, how they react when their faith is challenged, how they change after that. Mr. Shyamalan really knows how to build suspense and tell a story. He's the real deal. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was utterly disappointed after seeing "Signs." M. Night Shyamalan has captivated me in the past with his creative wit and intriguing stories. This story is neither original nor is it very intriguing. The scenes seemed very choppy and did not flow together well. There were some great comedic scenes and the actors were fine. Unfortunately, the story they were in just wasn't as interesting as their characters, whom we learn almost nothing about. I kept waiting to find out more about the characters, especially Joaquin Phoenix's character - but it was not to be. The end was abrupt and seemed like the writer ran out of paper or something and just decided to end the film. It was a great jump-out-of-your-seat, spooky movie, but that's pretty much it. M. Night is capable of so much better...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shymalan does it again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry, but if you didn't like The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable, then you are not going to enjoy Signs. All three were directed by the great new director M. Night Shymalan, and they are not your typical summer boom boom sequel clunker crap. His movies put character and story before the special effects, and move slowly so that you can get to know the cast, instead of clocking in at a quick, popcorn digesting 80 minutes. Signs, unlike Shymalan's past efforts, does not have a shocking ending that will knock your socks off, but the ride is enjoyable enough and I can understand why he didn't want to rely on that gimmick as a director. There are many moments where you just have to laugh, about twice as many that make you want to cry, and even more where you're creeped out to the point where you're pressing into the seat. Some may have a few questions about the ending, but I think there are enough clues for the audience that it all makes enough sense. The acting is pure gold, too, from Mel Gibson's reserved, cold manner to the naive, curious delivery of the two children. I especially liked Bo, the tiny girl who has about a hundred adorable lines. Mel's brother in the movie, Joquein Phoenix, also gives a nice parallel to the polite, faithless Gibson character. It is odd to see Phoenix glued to the TV screen, since it reminded me of how people must have been on 9-11, but the thought never disrupted the film. So if you like Shymalan's films, great thrillers, comedies, or just a film with a good message of faith, then go see Signs. I do not think anyone will be disappointed. ****/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Film, Awful Ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of the poor reviews this film has received are unwarranted. This is a charming film about a man's faith. It's clever, suspenseful, and visually pleasing. But the ending was just plain stupid.SpoilersThere's a throw-away line that the aliens don't use their technology because we'll retaliate with nuclear weapons - that's probably true, but we're going to use them anyway: what idiot is going to say "Well, we have more powerful weapons to use, but since they're attacking hand to hand, we're going not going to use them." Even if the aliens don't want to risk their technology falling into our hands, they have an awful lot of humans to kill, even carrying something as simple as flintlock rifles would save them an awful lot of time. Of course, none of the humans in the movie seem to have thought of weapons, either. Even if the good reverend doesn't believe in firearms (which would make his the one farm in the country without one) they could've grabbed kitchen knives, or carried that baseball bat around. I know that if I thought aliens were breaking into my house, I'd at least grab *something* to try to protect myself with. As for the aliens - they can manage interstellar travel, but don't think ahead to wear wet suits when invading a planet where water literally falls from the sky??? Hey aliens! Next time you invade a planet, put on a waterproof outfit, and carry a weapon! I guess the water vapor in the air wasn't enough to hurt them....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: Spoilers Signs is a good movie, better than some of the stuff I've seen this summer, but it does not live up to Shyamalan's 'Sixth Sense' and cannot compare to 'Unbreakable.' 'Signs' is scary, no doubt about it (I will be sleeping entirely under the covers for weeks) but the ending was a pathetic. Thinking back to the 'Sixth Sense', the ending was a surprise and clever.In 'Unbreakable' the ending made the entire movie disturbing and sent shivers up your spine. This ending just makes you feel uncomfortable because you know something was missed and your trying to understand what is so surprising about it.When I went to see this hoping for an intense sci-fi horror film. Instead we get this religious propaganda to add to whole patriotic and religious thing we got going on in post-September eleventh world. I was hoping the aliens and how they are torturing this one farm family would be the main idea but instead it is all about this ex-reverend and how he's questioning his faith after his wife's death. Like we haven't heard that story before. But people will enjoy it anyway, even the "Group Number Two" people will manage put up with it, but the ending almost ruins the whole movie.I can't find the surprisement and cleverness in how it is all in God's plan to defeat the one alien that gets into the Hess's house. Morgan's athsma prevents him from being killed by the poison gas. Bo's water problem enables them easy access at water so they can melt the alien to death, and the dead wife's dying words prompt the uncle to grabbing his baseball bat off the wall so he can beat the alien to death in hand to hand combat. Okay? See what I mean about the lack of imagination. I give this movie a two and a half. The music is awesome and there are some particularly funny parts (my favorite is when Gibson and Phoenix are running around the house, thinking they're chasing their vandal-neighbors and Gibson, still against the cursing, is shouting, "I am insane with anger!"). I give points to the little girl, Bo, because she doesn't just rely on her cuteness to make her character look real. Though, the relationship the children have with their father is sort of a rip off of the relationship between the two children and their mother in the 'Others.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every time I see one of M. Night's films, I find myself admiring the technical aspects -- the framing, the attention to detail, the deliberate pacing -- more than I admire the end result.In other words, he succeeds as a technician, but really fails to entertain. This one is no exception. I WANT to like this movie, but despite some genuinely creepy moments, I could not. He and Spielberg suffer from a similar problem -- both are spoiled rich kids who never grew up. This is reflected in their work, by the complete lack of maturity and true depth. They both have a very adolescent view of adulthood and the world, not the adult view of adulthood and the world. Spielberg is finally maturing a bit, but Manoj has some growing up to do. Admittedly, I still like his work better than most of the Hollywood crap out today, and he shows some promise. That is what makes it even more frustrating -- promise that has not yet been fulfilled. If Hollywood had more like him, and fewer hacks like Michael Bay and his ilk, then I would be a little more hopeful about the future of American film, but not much.Check it out, enjoy it (or not, you brainless MTV types), and understand that movies don't have to be fast paced to be entertaining, but that this one could have been much better with some more time spent on the script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wake up! Signs borrows HEAVILY from Night of the Living Dead.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just want to point out one thing here that people are too blind to see--It needs to be made perfectly clear that M. Night Shyamalan borrows heavily from low-budget horror classics that never got the attention they deserved in their day. THE SIXTH SENSE, Shyamalan's breakthrough hit, stole it's entire central conceit (lead character really dead for the entirety of film, unbeknownst to us viewers) from the low-budget Kansas-shot classic CARNIVAL OF SOULS, which had, in turn, borrowed the idea from an old TWILIGHT ZONE episode. Everyone praised SENSE'S "originality" while CARNIVAL got shelved and badly distributed over the years. Now we get SIGNS, which is pushing into religious territory as filtered through Spielbergian fashion Americans love so much.Come on folks, you have seen this film before. Wake up and look at the SIGNS...Pennsylvania farm house, boarded up, being invaded by scary things in the dark while the terrified inhabitants look for answers by watching TV news broadcasts that come and go... That's the same plot as George Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD substituting aliens for zombies, isn't it? Even though Romero was interested in tapping into racism, sexism and human interaction, while Shyamalan is using the crop circles plot to focus on a different kind of interaction (man and God), it still angers me that a high-profile director can do a film like this and get endless applause when they borrow so many ideas from others who got pigeonholed, ignored and ridiculed.Even though I walked away from this film with a bizarre aftertaste, I'm going to be fair by saying it is subtle, focused, sensitive, well-acted and tense in parts. But it's also time to give George Romero credit for his massive impact on fantasy, sci-fi, horror and suspense films and it's time for people to go back to the original horror classics and understand where the so-called "new and original" ideas present here, and in so many other big-budget blockbusters, stem from.Score: 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The tale's in the telling, we're told, and I would have to agree. SIGNS is at times as poignant and powerful as Shyamalan's previous two films- and as suspenseful. Like Hitchcock and Romero and Carpenter before him, Shyamalan never loses sight of the fact that it's the WAY you tell a story that makes it memorable (or forgettable). The plot can be by-the-numbers, the characters tried and true... but the director's APPROACH needs to be compelling- consistently (otherwise, s/he's a one-shot wonder). In this regard, Shyamalan soars: his films are superb cinema. All too often, budding filmmakers evince a promise that is never fully realized; on rare occasions, remarkable filmmakers turn every opportunity into the building blocks of a great career. Shyamalan has now carefully laid the foundation.</fullReview>

It's not a great movie, or even as good as "The Sixth Sense" (which I think is close to, but not quite, a great movie), but it is solid entertainment. I've seen complaints about the ending, but I found it fair and consistent with the rest of the movie.Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix give strong, understated performances, and the rest of the cast is good (I found Shyamalan's cameo the weakest, but he's adequate -- it's just that the rest of the cast is very good). The Culkin kid gives a "Culkin kid" performance, but he was well cast so it works fine. And the little girl is as cute as a bug.I find it hard to write reviews of his movies since so much of the pleasure of the movie depends on figuring out what's going on. This movie has less of that than TSS or Unbreakable, but it's still part of the movie, so try not to learn too much before seeing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel so sorry for the cynics on this site; people who lack the ability to sit down and enjoy a truly entertaining movie. Too many of the reviews I have read here sound like they are coming from pretentious "intellectuals" who viewed Signs with a bias, ready to pick it apart because it was beneath them and unable to appreciate the film for what it really is. For those of you who feel that way (obviously brainwashed collegiate types), why do you even bother seeing mainstream movies? Just stick to your subtitled pedantic garbage and let the rest of the world enjoy life!Anyway, I digress. Signs was everything a Hollywood movie should be (in a realm where few are). Shyamalan has proved himself again in this creepy and startling, while at the same time comedic and thought-provoking, movie. My initial response to this film was that the ending fell short. But the more I reflected on the movie, the more I realized that the alien aspect was not the story that was really being told. Someone on here wrote that the movie had two levels, one shallow and one deeper. I think that's true and is the reason why Signs will appeal to so many. But mostly, it was ENTERTAINMENT - something most movies have been missing since special effects took over the industry. I felt the movie was second in "fright factor" only to The Exorcist. And at the end, I was not looking forward to returning to my big old house in Bucks County, PA which is within walking distance of corn fields (ok, so it hit home a little!).If I could have one wish (as far as movies are concerned), it would be that I could watch each M. Night film without ever having seen The Sixth Sense. It seems that many, myself included, cannot watch any of his movies without making the comparison (just as I do with Pulp Fiction and anything Quentin did after it). But Signs is its own movie and should be appreciated as such. Just see it. I promise that the majority who do will NOT be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tempting trailer led us to...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aftering viewing the trailer(both TV and computer) and reading reviews, I was stoked to see this movie. It has a great cast, the kids are phenomenal and definitely has more than one jolt in it. ***POSSIBLE SPOILER*** The second half seemed to get sappier and what should have been left to my imagination was shown on screen. A good movie but definitely the trailer was better than the actual show. I'd say a 7.5 out of ten (First half an 8.5)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deep and complex</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some years I've been able to read dozens of reviews of a movie form critics and moviegoers in all parts of the country, and from other countries. By the time a movie has been out for a week, there are hundreds of reactions to read. I now realize that peoples' reactions to a movie are far more varied than I ever had realized.A movie can be broadly popular by design. People who begin by asking themselves "What, and who, are hot at the box office?", and then bury themselves in a lot of demographic and focus group studies, have often managed to produce a film that earns 100-million-plus at the box office. The Princess Diaries, Pearl Harbor, Rush Hour 2--all designed with box office appeal in mind. They aren't always above average, and they don't always make a mint, but they're usually entertaining enough, and mostly make money.The more a movie is the personal vision of one person, though, the less likely that it will receive a groundswell of positive reaction and big box office. Being John Malkovich, Pi, Crouching Tiger, Traffic--the people that love them will really love them, but reaction will be more varied, and they are at a greater risk of never making back their investment.Shaymalan's last 3 movies are all feel unpredictable and unusual. They should elicit from moviegoers some worship, some detraction, and a whole lot of "Who wants to see a wierd movie like that, anyway?"Well, reactions are varied. An atheist reviewer thinks the movie validates her opinions. Another thinks the movie will steer people towards a greater belief in God. Several people say there was an alien invasion; another says they were deamons; another says it really doesn't matter about the aliens, that wasn't the point anyway.And yet 2100 people have registered their reaction, and it averages out to 8.7 out of 10. I doubt if E.T., Star Wars or Gone With the Wind could have done much better than that. How does this guy Shaymalan get so deep and complex, provoke such different reactions, and yet keep so many people liking his movies?I thought this movie extremely well done. I loved Phoenix's character. He lost out on his big chance at greatness, and he's sad and a little put down. But he isn't depressed and he isn't bitter. Mostly, he just wories that he isn't verty helpful to his brother. I loved the police woman. I thought these two characters deserve special mention.When doing movies about ghosts, comic-book heroes and alien invaders, most filmmakers would have resorted to the old crowd-pleasers: gore, violence, and sex. M. Night seems to find a teaspoon's worth enough to season his stories. I like that. 9/10 for this and Unbreakable, 10/10 for Sixth Sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best storyteller in the Movie Business. (Sorry Stephen)IMHO the central theme was the struggle between the two philosophies; that we are lucky plus having (God) watching and jiggling the odds a bit, or we were strictly on our own. The first philosophy, one which ultimately prevailed, included the coincidences which gave Mel Gibson the clues (signs) to understand the conflict he was in, both with the aliens and himself. We understand he ultimately won when he put the collar on at the end of the film. All of the clues are spread out: his wife's last message, his daughter's water obsession, his son's asthma, his brother's skill with (and seeming obsession with) a bat and inability to not swing, the clue from M. Night himself about the alien's not liking water. All fits. I can't wait for the DVD so I can hear his explanation. I completely missed all the 'signs' in The Sixth Sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really good creepy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best movie I have seen this year. It's got humor and those make you jump up in your seat moments. I think it is better than Night's last movie Unbreakable. I really don't understand some of these negative reviews. They must be coming from the same people who made a movie like Scooby Doo number one at the box office.(SPOILERS): I really thought the scene where Mel and Joaquin go running around their house at night was really funny. The lines Mel says about "I'm in insane" and such where a hoot. I thought the best scene was when the family is in their house and they hear the sounds of their dog die off and see shadows on the porch and start hearing noises. That was so scary.And I really liked how this was more than just an alien movie. It had a more serious message about losing your faith and gaining it back.And sometimes less is better. I'm glad this movie didn't have a bunch of special effects that look so fake. The one flaw was showing the alien in full view at the end. What made it so scary was before we just saw a shadow or saw a quick shot of an arm or leg and it left the rest to your imagination. At the end, the alien should have just been in the shadows so you couldn't see any details about its appearance. I think that would have been better.And although I do think it was strange how these tall, fast and probably strong aliens couldn't find a way into the basement, I'm not going to hold it against the rest of the film. There were just to many good things, from the aluminum foil hats to the guy complaining about soft drink commercials during the news reports.(END OF SPOILERS)FINAL VERDICT: A must see for any movie lover. It will give you the creeps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great work!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the director of Sixth Sense, and Unbreakable comes another great work for Shyamalan. This guy is on a ROLE!! Gibson plays a former priest (Father Graham) who has left the faith. He is a farmer and also is accompanied by his brother played by Joaquin Phoenix (Merril) who lives on the farm with him. Graham has "left the flock" after the tragic death of his wife in a car accident, and is now left to raise his 2 young kids. However, one day a crop circle appears in his corn field, and at first glance seems a prank. But later on the events that unfold at Grahams farm, and around the world, put his beliefs to the test.First off, Shyamalan has created another GREAT film. There is great tension, story telling and casting. Needless to say the film isn't totally flawless but what is good is done magnificantly. Shyamalan's tricks us into believing this is a thriller, but in reality its a very spiritual movie about a quest for faith. Because of this, when things suddenly start to "go bump in the night" the movie kind of looses focus from an intelligent look into a troubled family, to becoming almost a horror show. Keep in mind, the little bumps in the night are done with great artistry!! Also Shyamalan is now starting to pull off what I call "Tarrantino" syndrome, in that he is starting to appear in his films more obviously. In this one, he is actually a minor character. His presence doesn't ruin "Signs" but it is a bit of a distraction since it is obvious the he is not an actor.Luckily there is very little to be picky about in this film, and I look forward to this guys next "project". EXCELLENT stuff..Rating 8.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan Does It Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his most pensive and thought-provoking film yet, writer/director M. Night Shyamalan examines personal faith and explores the possibilities of predestination, in `Signs,' a riveting drama/thriller that also makes a case for the existence of extraterrestrial life in the universe; a film that questions the validity of coincidence, and puts forth the proposition that there is more going on in the vast expanses that surround our world than meets the eye. It's Shyamalan's way of saying `We are not alone,' and he does it by whispering it in your ear rather than shouting to get your attention. And get your attention he does, without question-- in a way that is spellbinding and unforgettable.Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), of Bucks County, Pennsylvania, awakens one morning and discovers a design, beginning with a huge circle, that has been inexplicably imprinted in the cornfield that surrounds his farm. And he soon finds out that this is not an isolated incident; indeed, overnight the same thing has happened in fields around the world. The burning question, of course, is who did it? And moreover, how-- and why? It's a mystery to which there seems to be no logical answer. Or is it that it's too obvious, in which case it is also unbelievable. These are questions that, over the course of the next few days, will fill every waking moment of Graham's life, as well as that of his two children, Morgan and Bo (Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin), and his brother, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix); questions about things beyond contemplation. Questions to which the answers can come none to soon.After his remarkable film, `The Sixth Sense,' in 1999, the question everyone was asking was how is Shyamalan going to top that? He responded with `Unbreakable' in 2000, another remarkable film that presented a concept of evil unique in the history of the cinema. And with this film, Shyamalan has done it again, with another unique film that is a study in subtlety and nuance. There is a quiet intensity to this film that evokes the kind of silence in a crowed theater that is rarely encountered. From the opening moments, Shyamalan casts a spell over his audience, then maintains it as he continues to build the suspense, right up to the very end. He draws you in by getting up close and personal with his camera, which successfully puts you `in the room' as the drama unfolds. It's a studied presentation, and Shyamalan sets a decidedly deliberate pace that makes it work most effectively.Shyamalan traverses territory that will be familiar to Ingmar Bergman aficionados, as he delves into one of Bergman's favorite themes, that being `God's silence,' which we find in Graham's ruminations of his own personal situation. Add to that the best elements found in such films as `Independence Day' and `War of the Worlds,' with a dash of Rod Serling's `Twilight Zone,' and you have `Signs,' a true original, unique in it's own right and artistically and imaginatively rendered by Shyamalan, a one-of-a-kind writer/director who continues to amaze with film after film. Few directors can transfix an audience with such things as the sound of a cornfield rustling in the wind like Shyamalan can. And he allows his scenes time to not only develop, but imply; and it's these moments of silence, in which he focuses on a doorway, or an empty swing in the yard viewed through an open window, or an intimate close-up of the expression on a character's face, that are so telling and entirely captivating.As Graham Hess, Mel Gibson certainly hits his stride with his portrayal of a man who has come to a crossroads in his life only to encounter yet another challenge that exacerbates his inner conflict even more. Gibson has a commanding presence on screen that naturally draws the eye, and his performance here has a reserve that adds strength and depth to his character, who is dealing with some very complex issues that transcend his immediate considerations. To make this character (and the film) work, Gibson must convey a very real sense of personal loss and a need for redemption-- and he succeeds. Shyamalan obviously has a knack for tapping into and bringing out the best in his stars; he did it with Bruce Willis in `The Sixth Sense' and `Unbreakable,' and he does it with Gibson here. It's an honest portrayal that is very real, and altogether convincing.Joaquin Phoenix, too, gives a grounded performance as Merrill, a young man who has seemingly come to terms with certain aspects of his past, as well as the circumstances that have brought him to where he is at present. The success of his portrayal comes from the fact that Phoenix manages to find the core of his character and play upon it. It's a matter of having the kind of focus that makes the character believable, which is what Phoenix achieves here. He also has the kind of chemistry with Gibson that makes their relationship as brothers credible, which, in turn, is essential to the overall credibility of the film.Shyamalan has also worked his magic with his young stars, Culkin and Breslin, each of whom give affecting performances. Culkin displays a maturity beyond his years that works well for his character, especially in light of Morgan's current fragile state of being. And Breslin is absolutely endearing as Mo, a performance reminiscent of young Heather O'Rourke's Carol Anne, in `Poltergeist.'The supporting cast includes Cherry Jones (Officer Paski), Patricia Kalember (Colleen Hess), Jose L. Rodriguez (Radio Host) and M. Night Shyamalan (Ray). A film that is intrinsically enthralling, at times frightening and genuinely eerie, `Signs' marks the accomplishment of a cinematic hat trick for M. Night Shyamalan, who is quickly becoming the new Hitchcock/Rod Serling of film, yet with his own unique signature. This makes three `originals' in a row for Shyamalan, a rare feat even among the greatest directors. The question now is, how is he ever going to top it? 10/10.  </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have become so tired of movies that pander to the idiotic masses of mall rat teenagers and moronic no imagination movie-goers that it is amazing to see that there is still a director who even tries to be original.Shyamalan with Signs shows that he is the best. Signs sent chills down my spine, and not cheap thrills, but he earned them the old fashioned way like Hitchcock did so long ago. While I don't know if the movie going masses will adore his work (they hated the brilliant Unbreakable) but he has proven that his work is the best in the biz.From the suspense, to the angles, to the score, to the acting, to the credits, everything was formed to perfection.

		<fullReview>I was worried at first that M.

After I saw Signs, I realized that he did exactly what I worried about...and it was perfect. Everyone can spot an M.

It worked perfectly for The Sixth Sense, sucked for Unbreakable, and kicked ass for Signs. His style really seems to be top-notch when he's making a scary flick. The silence and the unseen is what scares you alot for Signs, and when you actually do see something, M. Night smacks you in the face with it whether you were expecting it or not. This movie successfully scared me. Only a few movies have done that (it still hasn't beaten Event Horizon). The acting is great in this movie (finally good kid actors are found besides Haley Joel), and the script is superb. M. Night puts in enough plot and character development to make the movie more than just a horror flick. He doesn't abuse the awesome-looking aliens he created by showing too much too often. He also avoids all the horror-movie cliches you usually expect in most scary flicks. Signs makes your skin crawl and makes you jump out of your seat. It's been a long time since I heard the entire movie theater of people scream out all together. M. Night rules! Also, props to the composer, James Newton Howard, for the spine-tingling music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed reaction for a film that is too good in some parts, and too bad in others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs is a difficult film to look at as one single film. It is, essentially, broken into three various parts. Let's say that these three parts are the technicals, the performance and the plot.TECHNICALLY: The film is visually outstanding. The use of harsh shadows (i.e. faces cut in half by light, long shadows at night and muted colors at day) makes the film seem even more drastic and terrifying. This visual enhancement is a supplement to the plot as will be discussed later. The films use of special effects is almost inevident, yet it is there. Notice two major shots that seem to pan around an area that can't possibly exist. The first is a shot that pans around a night-time cornfield lit only by a flashlight, finding it's way 360 degrees back to Mel Gibson, and consider another shot that begins looking down over a yard, but seems to then move back through a broken window and into a house that over time is changing seasons from summer to a snowy winter, where we end on a bathroom door as a character then performs his actions. The other major technical note has to do with the sound design which was the most evident of the technical brilliance. Good sound design makes this films level of terror heighten by a factor of 1000. Every creaking footstep, every corn stalk that moves, every gust of wind, and even a complimentary scene of pure darkness give the sound crew some major work to do and they do it well. The attention to minor details was incredible like the pictures on the walls of the house or the little story tidbits that we hardly realize because in real life we experience them and just expect them to be there, and because they are there we find it easier to relate to and understand the world the characters live in.PERFORMANCE-WISE Strong performances from actors who are trying so hard to give meaning to everything they say and do without giving away meaning to things that will happen... I want to make note of Mel Gibson, whose performance was seemingly good, but it seems that at times he lost sight of the fact he is no longer a reverend, mainly because the script did not call for dialogue to support the concept at the moment. Joaquin Phoenix is always a joy to watch and he is consistent as the slow-witter younger brother. Children give strong performances as well while being given the simplicity of having a media induced terror fantasy to run from.**SOME MINOR BUT IRRELEVANT SPOILERS**PLOT: The major lack of the film was the plot. The idea of having the viewpoint of the story be centralized on the family was intelligent, but the small scale of the viewpoint should not have included such a large scale issue like the actual interaction with an alien. Also, with his almost reputation for doing the following two things I wonder if they were really necessary: 1) Shyamalan's cameo was important character work, but a scene involving Shyamalan's kitchen pantry is useless as it has no relevant meaning to us later in the story (it seemed used as a way to plug in the past to the present not as something to supplement what is going on), 2) the use of flashbacks... originally his flashbacks were short and sweet, but they got longer, and longer, and longer, and eventually they became arduous, we don't need a smack in the face, the pace of the film is so slow that we have the time to interpret and understand. Also, I am bugged by the aliens. Why did they have to be hostile, why did we ever have to see them. Seeing them defeats the purpose that we are afraid of the wind, or the shadows that turn out to be birds perched in odd positions, or the creaking footsteps or the dark corners. And really, did they have to be hostile, I felt almost as if the Hess' desire to understand made things seem scary enough without the aliens actually being hostile. I know if I was an alien I'd want to know what I can instead of just poisoning the world to death. As for seeing the aliens- the alien we see in a birthday party video looks like a man wearing a tight Hulk costume that you can buy at Walgreens, while the alien at the end looks like an incomplete render of a concept for an alien CGI figure (I figure that the video alien was green because it was to later be replaced with a CGI alien).The films form was outstanding and it is a film I will watch again just to marvel at it's sound design and visuals, but it bothered me that the film took a lot of cop-out tactics to find it's ending as opposed to giving us what we really wanted, an enormous shock (what is things really were an elaborate hoax, that would have been more satisfying yet would've made the story considerably different).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this movie I went in simply looking for M. Night Shamylan to prove himself to me a third time. The Sixth Sense was absolutely amazing, and Unbreakable, although not nearly as good, wasn't as bad as critics made it out to me. Yet with Signs, Shamylan has really written a screenplay that proves he can do great things. His direction is extraordinary. Once again he has made children, not ordinarily great actors, shine...and he has mixed comic relief in with masterful suspense. The film is thorougly entertaining, and keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. Well-written parts include a film laced with the question of faith, of the existence of God...and the movie is layered with an element of hope even in its darkest moments, something I believe to be symbolic of God. Extra terrestrials are seen only a few times in the film, but when they come they make you jump and they come at exactly the right times. Also, hand it to the people behind the scenes who worked on the sound. This film's sound is among the best of the year, and the music score, which is composed of mainly three notes played in a haunting and beautiful way is great and makes the film terrifying in a way that movies like Scream and Halloween couldn't do with their violent predictible moments blotched all over. While I am glorifying this film and making it out to sound perfect, there are still plot incositincies and moments that aren't quite as great as others. Still, this movie, while not as good as Sixth Sense, has proven Shamylan can tell a story as well as anyone in Hollywood. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see Signs with something akin to hope. M. Night Shyamalan's previous directorial efforts were moderately entertaining, I had free tickets and free time, and my 15-year old daughter was eager to accompany me. So, with expectations of buttered popcorn and pleasant companionship, I headed to the movies.Abigail Breslin (Bo Hess) was marvelous. I don't know that I've seen such an impressive performance from a young American actor since Christina Ricci wowed us as Wednesday in the The Addams Family. Rory Culkin (Morgan Hess) did a credible enough job that I could almost forget his famous brother. The rest of the performances were adequate, but I can't say more than that.*SPOILER ALERT* The dialogue was embarrassing, the storyline maudlin (who didn't know that Mel Gibson would return to the clergy?), and the suspense was minimal. Okay, if you find reruns of Lassie or Flipper suspenseful, then this might have made you jump once or twice. My 15-year old didn't stir even during the cheap-but-(usually)-effective dog-snarls-and-leaps-suddenly-at-owner tactic.The movie attempted to be profound and address questions of faith, but all of the philosophizing was strictly at the sophomore level, and that is assuming that the sophomore is rather shallow. There will be some that say that I just didn't "get it," but I did, thank you, and what was to be had was meager fare.The film was occasionally funny, and I do thank Mr. Shyamalan for at least breaking up my tedium with a little humor.No, I don't need my monsters to be slavering, or my suspense to be served with buckets of blood, but I do need coherence and intelligibility. A movie about crop circles had seemed a weak starting point (15 minutes of research will demonstrate to anyone how boring and mundane the phenomenon really is), but I hoped that Mr. Shyamalan would surprise us. He is capable of it, but he was apparently was trying to make a "message" movie on this occasion, in which he failed miserably.Oh, and what was it about the "I'm melting" Wicked Witch of the West ending that convinced Mr. Shyamalan that it was a good idea? Was it done as a homage? As other reviewers have pointed out, the movie was replete with other filmic references, and I do have to wonder whether they were deliberate.Two thumbs down, and a single star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signs was great!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see signs last night and wanted to wait a day before commenting on this movie. I wanted to see if my feelings would change after letting the movie and its message stew in my brain for 24 hours. At this time, I can say with 100% certainty that I REALLY! enjoyed this movie. I loved it last night and I still love it today.M. Night has once again displayed his tremendous gift for presenting a very intelligent story with a twist at the end. Unbreakable is still my all time favorite, but Signs sits on the same level as Sixth Sense as they both tell a chilling yet entertaining tale of faith and spirit.I went into this movie, intentionally unprepared. I had avoided as many trailers as possible, did not read any reviews or interviews with the cast. I knew it involved a crop circle and a scary moment with Gibson at night in a cornfield. I just let the film flow over me like a wave, and enjoyed every minute of it. It was scary when it was supposed to be, it was funny when it needed to be. The unintentional or intentional references to other films (like war of the worlds, etc.) was done only when it was appropriate to the story itself.I believe that the only people who will be disappointed in this movie are sci-fi fans who were hoping for a knock down drag out alien action movie full of amazing special effects. To these people I say, if you go into an M. Night movie with a pre-conceived notion, you are setting yourself up for a fall.This writer/director/producer/actor is all about making you think during a movie, and making you question yourself. I recommend this movie to anybody with an open mind.Jeff</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be completely honest, I feel that Roger Ebert gives a great review of this movie. Usually I disagree a lot with him, but in this case he is right on the mark. A lot of people are trying to drag this movie through the dirt because of Shyamalan's self-absorbed idea's that he is going to be the next Hitchcock. Usually I would have a problem with this but I have to say that he has completely delivered in all of his movies. And Signs is absolutely no exception. The movie has a lot of twists and turns and I'm not going to waste time explaining the plot since you can get that elsewhere. I just felt the need to tell everyone who might want to see this movie that it will be more than worth your time. One things I'd like to say before I leave is that music in this movie worked absolutely beautfully, it makes my eyes water just thinking about it. An absolute masterpiece to say the least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Next Stephen Speilberg?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the first 15 minutes and several references to dog pee, the totally mopey, morose kid actors, and the totally unconvincing ex-reverend Mel Gibson, I was resigned to sticking it out nonetheless... Oh well, it didn't get much better.The Newsweek assertion that M.Night is the next Speilberg may unfortunately be true. Not the "Minority Report" Speilberg, but the "ET" Speilberg, full of unrealistic children performances. (One of the only Directors alive that can actually make an audience WANT the kids to die), and hokey telegraphed emotional string-pulling.I hate it when I am in a movie and I can just read the script in front of me,"Child stares ahead while grabbing his Father's face and turning it toward the crop circle". So bloody obvious, so bloody awful.I just saw a low-budget feature called "Bubba-Ho-tep" with Bruce Campbell of "Evil Dead" fame. With one-twentieth the budget and a clever script, they have crafted a wonderfully entertaining film. Go see this if you can, not "Signs".If this is a "Sign" of things to come from M. Night, forget it.Final Opinion------------------Script: AwfulDirecting: AwfulCasting: TerribleAlien Design: Laughable</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a bad, bad movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Went with a friend last night to see Signs.It is one of the worst films I have ever endured in my life.Not just "Oh my, that was a waste of $9" bad (like I found The Grinch and Death To Smoochy to be). More "I cannot believe that anyone in their worst, most deluded, crack-addled moments would think this had the merest potential of being a good movie." bad.Fairly dull throughout, but the ending had me &amp; me partner slack-jawed with incredularity, as master storyteller M. Night Shamalamadingdong cunningly weaves together a handful of dull badly-signposted non-sequiters from throughout the movie, deftly driving a mack truck through a handful of plotholes, to form an offensive-to-anyone-with-an-IQ-above-70 finale.Sweet Lord, it was bad.I'm a fairly easy going person. I can watch brain-dead and/or bad movies, and enjoy them. (After Signs, my chum &amp; I decanted back to my place to enjoy Gremlins, which, while cheesy as all hell, at least wears its cheesiness with pride). But Signs was so contrived in its foulness -- so smug in it's "Ahhhh. You weren't expecting that, were you?" attitude -- it left me wanting to phone telephone numbers at random and tell complete strangers "Don't go!"It was just that bad.Consider yerselves warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been a long time, if ever, since a single movie gave me all the sensations of happiness, sorrow, fear and hope. I keep hearing disgruntled voices about "Signs" not living up to the standards of M. Night Shyamalan's earlier successes. However, I think that is simply from people trying to type-cast his films. **Possible spoiler ahead** The fact that the plot revolves more around the family's reaction to an alien invasion than the actual invasion seems to be the main cause for disappointment with this film. If you were expecting Mel to rip off his shirt and pick up the ol'shot gun to defend America amidst expensive explosions and high tech special effects than this movie will disappoint you. This was a space invader's movie that dealt with people, not aliens.It was a refreshing way to look at sci-fi. From the inside. The inside of the hearts and minds of the characters who find out what is really important to them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what you might expect, but still a winner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a huge sci-fi fan, so going into SIGNS I was not sure how I would like the movie. I knew that I loved THE SIXTH SENSE and that was enough to give M. Night Shyamalan's latest flick a try. I'm glad I did.The movie is not about aliens in the way you might be expecting it to be--explaining their origins, their circles in the crops, why they're coming to earth, etc. So if that's what you're wanting in a movie you're sure to be disappointed. Rather, the aliens provide an excellent backdrop to the story of Father Graham Hess' (Mel Gibson) rediscovery of something very precious that he lost (what that is I won't divulge.) Their coming to earth gives Hess the chance to understand some things about life and come out of the myst of sadness and despair that had clouded his life.That said, I'd like to point out some of the excellent points about the movie. First of all--the acting. It is very well done. Mel Gibson is awesome as kind of a spooked out guy trying to find out what is real and what is imagination (reminded me of his character in CONSPIRACY THEORY in a way.) Joaquin Phoenix, who plays his brother, also does a good job. He was able to bring the quirky brother to life. And the two kids are excellent...the best part of the movie I would say. Rory Culkin isn't exactly Haley Joel Osment, but he had me hooked by the end of the movie with his believeable innocence. And Abigail Breslin as his younger sister is also excellent in her believeability. After the acting comes the humor. That was not something I expected to find in the film, but it was there....a silly quirky humor. It made the film roll along. The audience would literally jump out of their seats in horror and then be laughing till their eyes teared a minute later. It was nice after the total seriousness and dryness of THE SIXTH SENSE.Speaking of which, THE SIXTH SENSE is the better of the two films, but Shyamalan still managed to create a winner with SIGNS. Using the tension and horror of an alien invasion, he showed how a man was able to regain his soul. Shyamaln definitely has a talent, and I will be sure to see his future films.See the movie, know it's a fun little flick, one that may make you think a bit. If not, at least you'll get some laughs, some screams, and even a few tears.Enjoy!! **** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M. Night Shyamalan is a genius...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love M. Night Shyamalan. I love his writing, directing and I think he is the most talented young director out there. but, I lowered my expectations for this movie, because it is so hard to make a good alien movie that one can take seriously and is believable. But SIGNS was amazing, thrilling, chilling, and compelling the entire way through. It was everything that INDEPENDENCE DAY should/could have been and more: a believable alien movie. Rather that focusing on the world's point of view and using huge expensive special effects, M. Night showed you only what one family went through, with no special effects (what a concept in modern movies!). but strangely, SIGNS is a movie about faith in a higher power, that just happens to have aliens in it. At least that the way I see it. M. Night beautifully addresses the topic of losing and finding faith.The last ten minutes make or break the movie for viewers. I haven't decided if I like the ending or not, but I didn't hate it. And to be honest, its growing on me the more I think about it. M. Night Shyamalan is perhaps the most talented directer out there. and he's so young. Even after seeing his first film, THE SIXTH SENSE, his talent, it was clear that M. Night had a big future. The first time I saw UNBREAKABLE, I hated it, but I LOVED the directing. After a second viewing, I fell in love with Unbreakable. So I was eager to see what could come next from this hugely talented and clever director. and I cannot wait to see SIGNS again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So Far, To me- Its the Greatest Thriller of all Time. Its Also the Movie of the Decade..(2000-2002) Signs Can Have you cracking up one minute....and then jump out of your Seat the next. Even Though most people think that Thrill is the name of the Game. Its Actully The Title that makes this Movie such a Classic. I Won't spoil the movie but i have to say that the Title is a Double Meaning. And Taht Double meaning, is what makes this Film So Great. The Acting Is Suburb in this- i wouldnt be suprised if i see an Oscar in there. This movie will Definitly Win Oscars, but the Acting and Directing by M Night Shalahan is just Out of this World. If You think this Movie is a Shoot them Up --bang Movie- You'r wrong. And if thats what you wabt,...you may want to skip it..but if your in for a High Quality Suspencful-Funny and Myserterious Movie, This is the Movie. Dom't listen to those Critics who Give "Wizard Of Ox, E.T and Jaws" 2 Stars.....Rodger Ebert tells us..The movie of the year...4 stars..and i agree with him. Please- See this Movie- You wont be dispointed....I saw the movie Twice in the first two nights...and each crowd (Pact House) Stood up and Applaud During the Credits........FOR TWO MINUTES!!!

		<shortDescription>Good movie, but something was weird to me...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*** SPOILERS BELOW ***I won't attempt to critique the plot or style of this movie any more than other reviewers already have. Obviously it was less about aliens and more about faith, but there was one key lapse in realism that partially ruined it for me. It's the scene where Mel is standing in the foyer with his children after they have gone to all the trouble of boarding up all the windows and doors. Mel has determined the aliens mean harm, he's convinced that an invasion is inevitable, he's figured out they can be harmed (with a kitchen knife), he's surmised that a pantry door can stop them. Here stands Mel with his beloved children standing in front of him in the foyer as aliens bang on the front door. What man in America would defend his children this way? I'm not implying this movie needed violence or guns to make it more believable or worthwhile, but there was a blatant absence of weapons from the movie. No military action reported in the news briefs. The best they could scare up at the end was a baseball bat? I can't imagine another man in the theater that wouldn't have barricaded himself and his family and stood in *front* of his children armed to the teeth (with whatever he had available). Regardless if you thought you were doomed or not, I for one wouldn't be offering myself and my children as sacrificial lambs to the slaughter. They had an axe in the basement, yet Joaquin's frail character ventures up the stairs to check the "all clear" armed with nothing but his fingernails. I don't get it, unless there was some protest by the writer/director to be had here. An American farmhouse in the midst of vast cornfields with a baseball bat hanging from the wall instead of a double-barreled shotgun? Please. I agree with a lot of other people that there's way too much violence and flashing of weapons in movies today, but the opposite extreme with a story of defending your family from an alien invasion just seems weird.</fullReview>

The style is completely Shyamalan, who seems to pay extraordinary attention to the visual details. The effect is somewhat diminished by the funny looking aliens... Although I think men in costume are better than the inevitably fake look of CGI.There was also a small problem with the casting. Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix are supposed to be brothers, but there is clearly at least 20 years of age between them. Sure Mel looks good for his age and Joaquin was made to look old for his age, but the gap was still large enough to be confusing, especially because the chemistry feels more like father-son (or maybe uncle-nephew) than older-younger brother. Incidentally it doesn't become clear until a third of the way through what the relationship is. Of course they both put in good performances, on par with their best.Aside from the three minor points, too foreshadowed/clean ending, no so good aliens, and the age issue, this movie was very enjoyable. There were moments of laughter to break the tension (too much tension is after all as bad as not enough). The children were amazingly cute (how many Caulkin's are there anyway?). Also it is refreshing to see a large scale problem (aliens) and how it relates to only one specific family, which incidentally prevents the movie from being too preachy. It is about one man's choice and not saying it is globally the right choice. I give it 8/10 with a possible upgrade to 9/10 upon further review.</fullReview>

The average persons perspective and what they go through. M. Night is a true genius, a person with a grasp of storytelling so advanced that it hits in the levels of Shakespear, or the guy who wrote Catcher in the Rye. He turns out great movies every time he tries something new, and hits everytime. The man can do no wrong. If you have a pallet for fine cinema, is a great dish to feast upon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To dismiss this as another `sci-fi alien flick' would be a shame.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director M. Night Shyamalan (`The Sixth Sense') has delivered one of the best films of the summer hands down. To dismiss this as another `sci-fi alien flick' would be a shame. He has crafted a film (and a style) that brings the viewer in with what they're expecting or wanting to happen and comes out with a deeper story without letting the audience down. He doesn't try to `dumb down' his ideas, which is why it will probably not have the same effect on those that just come in for some glazed-eyed mindless entertainment. This is not like `Independence Day' or even `Mars Attacks' in its approach. Yes, there are aliens and yes, you do see them, but they're not quite like all of the other aliens. They're not cute like `E.T.' and they're not trying to blow up everything like in `ID4'. While I won't describe them and spoil their appearance, they're merely there to bring you in. The story is deeper than that and the focal point is in Graham Hess' (Mel Gibson) character. Closer to something Hitchcock or Spielberg would do, Shyamalan keeps up the suspense and sense of wonder rather than going for the cheap thrill. The difference between this one and his previous two hits (`Sixth Sense' and `Unbreakable') is that instead of waiting for the surprise ending, Shyamalan lays everything out on the table and still has you waiting for the next surprise, just as the characters are. There's not the big payoff in the end so much as in the way the story unfolds. The mix of suspense and a newfound sense of humor go surprisingly well together here. His ability to bring you into the film and keep you there is amazing. In a theater full of people, there was hardly any noise from the audience and very few people even got up for a restroom break. To captivate an audience for two hours in this day and age is quite an impressive feat. This one is definitely worth checking out in the theater. If you can accept the fact that that nothing blows up and that you may have to actually think a little and pay attention, then don't wait for video on this one. See for yourself why many people are referring to Shyamalan as the new `master of suspense'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of reviews on IMDb seem to put down "Signs" because it wasn't a turd-pile like "Men In Black II"; basically, because it didn't have aliens running around and humans shooting at them with big guns.Well, guess what...I am sure there will be plenty of garbage in the theaters to cheer for in the weeks to come. On the other hand, for the people who did enjoy "Signs", and were able to appreciate the masterful work done by M. Night Shyamalan, it will not be soon enough until his next project is due for release.The deep character development and simple but powerful story is what is impressive about the movie. That is exactly why one is drawn in, and held tight.I hope more people will enjoy this movie, just so financiers will see the commercial as well as the artistic viability of such "films".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My husband and I went to see the film this evening. The credits at the beginning of the film were eerily done - setting the tone of a scary, terrifying suspenseful show. If you decide to attend - be prepared to take a look at the way people behave in stressful situations. It is very similar to what many people may have felt following 9/11, entranced, scared, helpless, hopeless, wanting to be educated about something we don't understand... Mel Gibson and Joaquin play brilliant adult male figures with two children Rory and Abigail, and the police officer (Cherry Jones)is a strong female who helps bridge many bits of the storyline. If you are a fan of M. Night Shyamalan, this film continues his edge on unique film script and direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*BIG SPOILERS*I just returned from the theater where this was screened at a matinee showing. I went early- with all the hype, the theater was sure to be packed.Right. If you call 12 people "packed."I paid $5.75 to see this movie.I paid WAY too much.The acting from the entire cast was among the most overblown I've ever seen- the performances were laughably stilted and the dialogue is so wooden that it could have been cut with a chainsaw and sold by the board-foot. There ARE some very tense, even scary parts to the film, primarily a segment involving the invasion of a farm family's domicile by hostile Aliens. Otherwise, this mess was a complete waste.Apparently whoever wrote this thing has never worked with exposition before. Instead of letting the audience in on important facts about the aliens a little at a time, we have a precocious, obnoxious brat (played to perfection by Rory Culkin) who spews information about the aliens until you begin to think that he might be one of them. Of course, you quickly realize that that's ridiculous, just like the film itself.The lynchpin of the movie was that there are no coincidences, that everything is apparently planned by some Higher Power and NOTHING is random. If you know ANYTHING about probability theory and statistics, you know that this is utter rubbish. I won't even waste time on the hoaxes involving crop circles. Use your search engine and you'll find out where they came from.Moreover, the film lifts its basic plot from George Pal's classic 1952 film, "The War of the Worlds." In both movies, the evil alien invaders are wiped slick by things that are generally so common that we don't think twice about them- disease bacteria in WOTW, plain old H2O in this flick. WOTW ends with a shot of a church still standing in the ruined landscape of Los Angeles while a choir hymns on the soundtrack; SIGNS ends with our protagonist, a former clergyman who had lost his faith, putting on his clerical collar once again. Actually, I think that this is also an attempt to hijack some of the Apocalyptic Doomsday success from the "Left Behind" book series.Please don't waste your time and money on this. If you must see it, wait for the VHS/DVD releases. They'll be coming out very soon. I predict that this thing will bomb, and that's the only way the film makers will see their investment returned.</fullReview>

If you want to sit in the theater counting the number of people that are sleeping...then by all means see this movie.**SPOILER**The movie stinks!

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan is a hack but great at convincing folks he's not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the truly awful "Unbreakable" retractively ruined "The Sixth Sense" for me, I was curious what Shyamalan had in store for the third installment of his self-proclaimed "comic book trilogy". This supposed "Hitchcock of the new millenium" got lucky with his first (early on in its success, he admitted that the ending of "Sixth" came to him in a flash of inspiration late in the revision process- he has not mentioned that lately) and has failed at his two subsequent efforts, despite brilliant camerawork by Fujimoto. His writing is trite- get ready for the crowd to laugh out loud at some of Culkin's lines, poor kid- and his "trademark (?) surprise ending" in this film?.. Well, I'm not sure what it's supposed to be....is it that we're watching an alien movie, which we know from the previews, or is it the laughable way the aliens make their exit? I wouldn't let my dog pee on this comic book. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE Hollywood superstars, stop encouraging this man. I don't even want to know what he did for Gibson to dub him a "genius".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a likeable film suitable for everyone at the end of a hot summer-as soon as we can get those corn crops in the sooner we can forget the lessons etched in their signs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs,' directed by M. Night Shyamalan of `The Sixth Sense' and starring Mel Gibson, echoes `War of the Worlds,' `Field of Dreams,' and numerous `B' Sci-Fi's whose message about fate and faith is more important even than scaring the bejesus out of us.The film emphasizes Gibson's character's loss of faith and rejection of his role as a priest after his wife's tragic death. The titular `signs' are formations in the cornfields apparently made by aliens as coordinates for an invasion. Those familiar with Erik von Daniken's `Chariots of the Gods' will be in familiar territory; those who liked the mystical crop field of `Field of Dreams' will recognize its father-and-son reconciliation theme and its declaration that faith is a commodity in short supply.Mel Gibson underplays effectively while Joaquin Phoenix and Rory Culkin support with intensely-felt connections to their brother and father respectively. The first half of the film is suspenseful distributed exposition slowly leading to clarity about what the aliens are doing and what adjustments Gibson's character must make to deal with them and his family. The film ?s conclusion reverts to some standard sci-fi hokum meant to resolve an otherwise impossible situation for a writer.`Signs' is a cautionary tale about believing in powers greater than ourselves whose signs are all around us; it also asks us to understand the cooperative nature of survival, the bonds of humanity that transcend cynicism and doubt. This is a likeable film suitable for everyone at the end of a hot summer-as soon as we can get those corn crops in the sooner we can forget the lessons etched in their signs.  </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sign says "GREAT MOVIE!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Ebert and Roper said that they wish Night would direct all movies, I have to agree. I saw Signs last night and it was the perfect movie. It had all the elements of suspense that rival even Hitchcock. The movie depended on good acting, directing and realism. There was no gore or special effects that movies sutch as Indep. Day and ET used. One of my friends warned me that the alien looked like somebody who stumbled into a costume shop and purchased an alien outfit. Let me tell you, my friend was mistaken. The bump in the night stuff that this movie has is great. Mel Gibson does a great job a a man who lost his faith in God after his wife dies a horrible death. Then there are more signs....not just the crop circles but other signs. I will not tell you what these signs are or it would ruin the movie. I maintain that Night will indeed be THE next Spielberg if he continues making movies like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheap Faith in a wasted topic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILER-WARNING*** For the first time in my life I really want to give away the main content of a movie to spare others great disappointment. E.g. the crop-circle fans and specialists whom the movie abuses because it neither provides up-to-date interpretations of the phenomena, nor will the crop-circle (known from the ad) play an important role at all. It's the typical US-American fear of invasion - in this case: of aliens - that dictates the film. So it plays with recent events of mass hysteria. Ironically, Mel Gibson's role as a pastor who lost face about a common thing like the death of a beloved gets his faith back when he meets his wife again as an alien. And more ironically, after he has ordered her killing, not detecting her for what she really is and misunderstanding her last words as a human being and her rescue-effort as an alien for her asthmatic son (by a special in-breathing system that the aliens possess). Actually, it is water that kills the alien. More scientific bull***, as we know for years know that esp. water raises the possibility that we are not alone. So - what in the end has director Shyamalan told us? That Christian faith is ridiculous? That we don't know who's our friend and who's not? That one X-Files episode can create a more interesting environment than a big budget movie? That he doesn't know how to end a movie elegantly after building up some tension? Well, thank you, Mr. Shyamalan, at least we understand this: Hollywood just isn't spiritual enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Very Very Disappointing movie. BIG SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie who apparently shares the secret for filmmaking of Steven Spielberg. More like a rip off of Steven Spielberg it sounds to me. In fact it doesnt rip-off only Steven Spielberg but Night of the living dead, Twilight zone, Independance Day.... the list goes on and on. A very bad movie secretly disguised as a movie about 'FAITH'. Yeah right. There are only two moments in Signs that made me jump, great enough to think there are signs of talent in such a conceded director. But the tension and suspense it manages to amount to pretty much.... NOTHING. The climax involves a man beating the alien to death and spraying him water. Wow, this took my breath away in all the wrong ways. Horrible Horrible movie. Thank god I didn't pay for SIGNS, ironic since I believe that faith has saved me from spending 10 bucks. I was also disappointed that the crop circles are only featured once in the entire movie. I think they would have a key role in the movie. But the first five minutes pass by and its the last you've seen of them. Then why the hell devote a poster and a trailer to it? I was extremely disappointed with this movie. It deserves a one, the lowest rating possible. Not because it doesnt have anything good about it, but for the way things are handled in the end. Don't get me wrong I didn't expect a twist ending but I sure as hell didn't expect it to be about a man swinging a bat at the alien.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signs of suspense, fear, and the unkown... trust me they exist!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gosh, what a phenomenally creepy thriller! It starts with James Newton Howard's music extravaganza, followed by a bedroom scene with Mel Gibson's Graham Hess character. The edginess, suspense and horror never seem to cease from there onwards. until the very end! Oh yes, there are plenty of unavoidable shock waves that will keep the viewers awake and intriguingly attentive!Believe me, this film is proof of what an incredibly fabulous and brilliant storyteller and director M. Night Shyamalan is! He never fails to allow every one of his characters to push the viewers through their journey of utter fear and suspense, in the hope of defining what's amiss and solving the mystery. Oh yeah, Shyamalan's application of the supernatural does exist here, as with his previous films. Oh yeah, he sure can make a family's home far from being their safe haven. And he sure does know how to introduce the voice of the media to keep the family in touch with the outsiders! The viewers will find themselves interacting non-stop with every character in the story. There's no way the viewers would want to blink their eyes. at least not with this film, for fear they'd be missing out something. That's how powerful this film is.A talented cast for a brilliant plot. It does not matter whether it's Graham Hess or his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), or even his children, Morgan and Bo (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin) you're watching. And I do enjoy watching the Merrill character as he does pump up that uncanny intrigue to his presence with the family. Yep, all the characters will keep the viewers completely tensed and fearful, one way or another, in anticipation of the unknown. Watch out! Shyamalan is not only making his Hitchcockian-style cameo appearances, this talented guy actually holds an acting role that is truly relevant to the sub-plots! Man, oh man, his appearances are a real treat to his fans! Overall, all the actors' performances do give credibility to their characters. Truly great facial expressions from all, especially with those provided by young Abigail Breslin! Gosh, just watch her incredible eyes!James Newton Howard's music soundtrack is a real treasure. It creates tension before and within each scope of events. Tak Fujimoto's cinematography is beyond words of description, except for `Wow, wow, wow, oh WOW!' My mind was totally filled with awe as I observed the stretches of lush cornfields. And these takes almost made me lose sight of the momentary humor that comes with the characters' acts. Oh yes, the humor is clearly needed as a relief from the continuous development of crouching suspense and fear. Even the episode nearing the end of the story will succumb the viewers to a further climatic and edgy appeal. Just stay on top with your hearing. You'll probably grasp like I did at the finale, and might even be led to say `gosh, how appropriate!'Call this movie a science fiction, or a mystery, or even a tale about faith, if you wish, but this film is bound to psychologically plague the viewers' boggling minds with a need to search for clues to the characters' questions at every change of frame. A great masterpiece of mystery and apprehension! Even the film's editing is flawlessly excellent, no matter how utterly chaotic the scenes may be! This amazing film puts the viewers right in the heart of every scene, all the way through it. Oh yes, I'm definitely seeing it again. Oh yes, I'm definitely adding its DVD to my movie collection!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give the trailer cutter a film to direct.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film about crop circles was how this film was seemingly sold. It sounded dreary and desperately out of date. Then I saw the trailer.Wow!I so wanted to like this film. Although I disliked Sixth Sense (because of Haley Waley Osment and the blatantly obvious twist) I had loved Unbreakable (I know, going against the grain), and by the look of the trailer, Signs was going to be up there with Unbreakable.Oh dear!Joaquin Phoenix is a great actor, as is Mel Gibson, as is the youngest Culkin - but even they couldn't save this film from being the most overblown pile of nonsense ever...period. The script was reasonably good, dialogue wise, but when it came to plot it seemed that M Night had fallen asleep at the keyboard, repeatedly bashed the zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz key with his head and thought ?that'll do'. I couldn't work out if I was watching a sci-fi film in the style of Close Encounters, or a Carry On film as it veered from one extreme to the other. This couldn't be the film I had seen in that trailer? Unfortunately, it was.There must have been a bit of a budget on this film, so where did it all go? Mel's pocket? Just when it seemed like things were about to happen, the director decided that locking everyone in the basement, where they couldn't see anything would be 'really interesting'. Maybe, if there had been more tension, more suspense it would've been interesting. Unfortunately we were waiting for that for the entire length of the film, it never came.Then there were the characters. I love character driven films, but when there are only about six main parts why does M Night takes one of those for himself? Fair enough, take a cameo, walk in and out of a scene ala Hitchcock, but don't give yourself such a role again, please! It's not fair on the viewer.The finale was the biggest cop-out of all, I thought I had seen a film with a reel missing. Biggest let down of the year so far.All the way through the film my mind kept wandering back to that trailer, it made the film look great, exciting, suspense filled. I started thinking 'Give the guy who cut that trailer a film to direct'Unless it's M Night, then don't.Like Joaquin's character in the film, a failed baseball player who hit so many strikes -M Night, for me you've hit two.One more and you are out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm oh so very confused...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, like many other people, waited anxiously for this film's release. However, after watching a screening of it I was left somewhat confused.The sci-fi element of the film left much to be desired as it was practically non-existant until the last 10 minutes. In fact, it seems to be thrown in there for the sake of adding some special fx and getting interest from the public eye.The films director (M Night Shyamalan) got himself off to a great start with The 6th sense, then met with mixed reviews over Unbreakable; a film which took a great deal of time to get to it's point but payed off in the end with one of Shyamalan's surprise thought provoking endings. I was half expecting the same thing from this film about half way through(a long subtle trail to a great finish) but this was not the case.Instead, the film drags on and on in a slow build up fashion which leads to a great deal of nothing. If that thought provoking ending is in there, I must have missed it. I suppose it was left forgotten, boarded up the house with the many glasses of water, a baseball bat, and a a holy man whose lost his faith.Signs does give a good performance from Gibson and fair performances from the rest of the cast, including Shyamalan himself (who actually played an important plot character). But alas, unlike Gibson's character, I did not regain my faith in the end, however it is diminishing in Shyamalan with each passing film.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'The Sixth Sense' turned into a religious film with aliens...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Several of my friends have recommended this movie to me over the years, telling me it is an engaging psychological thriller and one of the scariest movies they had ever seen. I finally found a copy of 'Signs' in a thrift shop and decided to check it out for myself. I waited until it turned dark, turned out all the lights, and settling in for a thrilling adventure...The story immediately introduces the audience to eerie and mysterious crop circles in Graham's (Mel Gibson) corn field, where he finds his kids walking around (in a typical children-who- casually-say-something-creepy-to-their-worried-parent fashion) after waking up. The plot then delves into the realms of extra-terrestrial life from the viewpoint of an average family (by average I mean average on-screen family, where there is a young boy, younger girl, single parent (with a deceased spouse), and some other family member who has come to live with them) who live in a small, rural town in their old farmhouse. Many reviewers see 'Signs' favorably because of its attention to the realistic aspect of a hypothetical alien invasion, focusing on just your average family and how they see what is going on in the outside world. However, Shyamalan goes too far in this regard, using sometimes extremely cheesy dialogue and several awkwardly written scenes to stress this family's averageness.I won't go any further into the plot, and anyway I feel like there is nowhere else to go. Throughout the movie, the dialogue felt extremely forced and it sometimes felt more like I was reading a screenplay off a piece of paper than watching a film. I was expecting much more depth and character development going into this Shyamalan movie, especially after watching 'The Sixth Sense.' However, I was highly disappointed, as the film felt like a failed attempt at incorporating the psychological elements and suspense of 'The Sixth Sense' into an extra-terrestrial thriller/horror film (I mean really, Mel Gibson even begins to look like Bruce Willis after a while). I gave it a 4/10 because the directing and cinematography is decent (I enjoy Shyamalan's style), but the screenplay is extremely sub-par. The premise of 'Signs' isn't half bad, but it would have made a much better short film than full-length feature. The acting and directing is fine, but the film felt hollow, with a solid shell and nothing to fill it. In addition, there was an unexpected and completely unnecessary religious element added to the film (I won't go into detail to avoid accidentally giving out spoilers) that completely changed the general feel of the movie from a psychological, extraterrestrial thriller to that of a religious flick, in my mind.If you're looking for a psychological thriller, sci-fi, or horror film that will keep you as engaged as 'The Sixth Sense' and leave you staring at the screen, this movie isn't for you. Just watch the 'The Sixth Sense' again. However, if you enjoy Shyamalan's style and want to see his take on an extraterrestrial thriller, you may enjoy 'Signs.' Just don't expect to leave the movie in awe or have any nightmares about it (you're more likely to have nightmares about the screenplay than the actual aliens in the film).(I'm not even going to get into the plot holes, just read the other reviews...)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it really about aliens?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan's "Signs" (2002) is about a disillusioned minister (Mel Gibson) who lives in the country with his son &amp; daughter and brother (Juaquin Phoenix). The reasons for his disillusionment become clear as the story unfolds. When a mysterious crop circle is discovered in the neighboring cornfield they wonder if it's a prank or an alien invasion! Although the plot deals with a possible alien invasion, the theme is faith. There are two general views of life: 1.) That life and the universe are one big meaningless accident and you're just an insignificant bug that will soon be squashed out of existence and memory. And 2.) that there's an intelligent design to the universe and, although it's somehow fallen (i.e. severely messed up), there IS meaning, love, hope and purpose, even if we are presently unable to fully comprehend it.The film addresses the clash of these two opposing views. We've all experienced the conflict of these two positions within our OWN hearts; it's the clash of flesh (id) and spirit (super-ego). On the one hand, we WANT to believe the latter position, but life dishes out so much crap that we are seriously tempted to give in to the former.This is the struggle Gibson's character faces in the story. He's given up on God and is stumbling in the dark; he's just going through the motions to exist. His smile is mostly a facade.Many people diss the film for an obvious plot hole regarding the alien's weakness, but Shyamalan's too talented to not realize this. It's a sign to what the film is really about (sorry; I couldn't resist).***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you've seen the film)It's possible that the aliens aren't really extraterrestrials but rather demons from the underworld (the dark dimension) invading the physical realm to take as many victims as they can. The idea that they are aliens is just a mass deception and, remember, the devil is the "father of lies".There are many clues: The spaceships are never seen, just lights in the sky (the devil's also called "the prince of the power of the air" in the bible). The primitive method of harming the aliens is discovered in the Middle East and is holy water. The daughter was said to be a "gift from God" who was sensitive to impure water. The dog and bird were clearly possessed. The crop circles are occultic symbols and possible portals to the underworld. When the disillusioned minister cries out to God that he hates him he actually displays his faith; after all, he has to believe in God to speak to him. At that precise moment his son recovers from the asthma attack and the news announcer declares that the "aliens" are retreating. You see, FAITH sends the enemy fleeing with their tails between their legs.Also, we see evidence that the demons are personal in nature. The "alien" locked in the vet's pantry was linked to the guilt and disillusionment that haunted the vet and the minister after the death of the latter's wife.***END SPOILER*** There are many other clues, but I don't want to spoil the fun of finding them for yourself.I'm not saying that this is the only interpretation of the film, but rather than it's a legitimate way of viewing the material because it all ties together. Also, I'm not suggesting that you have to believe in God to appreciate this movie, which is obviously not the case.I should add that I don't feel "Signs" is a great movie despite being impressed with its hidden meaning and potent themes. I give it a solid grade mostly for these reasons but, honestly, I don't find the film all that compelling. While watching it, I don't feel much for Gibson's struggle and grief; better writing would've made me feel for his situation, like Ted Danson in "Loch Ness". Also, the story plays out in a generally boring manner, the characters don't really trip my trigger and I was never seriously creeped-out by the creatures. At the same time, the movie's not bad and I especially like the reverent ambiance, which most of Shyamalan's films possess.BOTTOM LINE: This is a cool Shyamalan film and is about on par with "The Sixth Sense" and "The Village" (and, yes, I realize a lot of people despise the latter, but I'm not one of them).The film runs 106 minutes and was shot in Eastern Pennsylvania.GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my favourite type of sci-fi thriller; whilst fantasy, and ultimately set to shock and scare, it is still brilliant in terms of it's content, script, conception and intelligence. It is not schlock, the violence and suspense are gripping and plausible, there's no 'silliness'. You commit to what is on screen almost immediately. M. Night Shyamalan (who has a small but pivotal role as well as writing and directing) is a genius of creativity. He doesn't spell the plot out for you as if you were stupid, as much American film/TV tends to, but a lot of background is outlined in the opening sequence before anyone has spoken a single word, just by paying attention. Informational conversation is realistic and whilst it informs the viewer it still makes sense in terms of the characters, so the viewer has to piece it together rather than being presented with it. Brilliant writing - can't praise that enough.Over all the film is fantastic, there's nothing that I can fault really. All performances are perfectly gaged; Mel Gibson is great, Joaquin Phoenix in perhaps my favourite role and he looks amazing ;-) and the two child actors Rory Culkin and the adorable Abigail Breslin were played naturally and just right. There are no massive bells and whistles in terms of big budget SFX, sets and contrivances, the film offers its 'kicks' on suspense and the less-is-more, almost for-the-stage, attitude to filming. It was filmed, by appearances, simply and often in the dark, using limited light to add tension. The musical score adds tremendous amounts of depth, drama and spook-factor and silence is used cleverly too. What builds a crescendo of dread is the narration given by television news reels, often on in the background, and that reporting adds realism to the plot:- You get a view of the outside world, and imagine what it would be like if anything like this happened. Some of the worst bits of the film are things you barely see but have you on the edge of your seat, just like Merrill (Phoenix) watching the TV, and you need to keep your wits about you if you are going to see all the connections as nothing is superfluous in this film it seems.The title, Signs, refers to the crop circles but also in the context of faith and belief, and the emotional roller-coaster in this film is based around Graham Hess' crisis of personal Faith and the element of predetermination or lack of coincidence in our everyday lives. It is both touching but also challenging, and as the film keeps you intimate with the action using up close shots and unusual focus on eyes, to draw you in, so you are brought to think about how you feel too as another onion layer. Whilst a very tense film, there are delightful smiles and laughs dotted throughout, and some moments of comedic laugh out loud genius (Phoenix has some great timing) and even having seen it before, it still doesn't fail to please, entertain and thrill on every level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a clever, brilliant film. It is beautifully directed and photographed with award winning director, cinematographer, and actors. Film students should watch it. It is not a face paced,noisy action flick but a thoughtful and scary movie. I will not insult some of the detractors but some people feel compelled to insult a film if it has any Christians in it despite the fact there are over 2 billion Christians in the world. What if we never saw any films that did not feature anyone not like us? And when did film reviewing become about the politics and not the art? Better not ever watch any Hitchcock! Fans of Hitchcock will enjoy this. Non-Christians will enjoy this as well. The religion is not heavy handed but there is a side story about a man struggling with faith.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe they didn't realise water hurt them because they live on a planet without any</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've felt obliged to register an account just so I can answer some of the objections being raised by the negative reviews for this film.Foremost among them is the question that "why does a super advanced alien race which has a weakness to water chose to invade one of the only planets in the universe with liquid water present?" Most asking this question are presenting themselves as paradigm's of logic.But they state the answer to their own question within the question. Most planets in the universe do not have liquid water present. Therefore, it is possible, and even probable, that the invading aliens are from one such planet. It is therefore more than possible that they did not realise they had this vulnerability. I think humans would be caught similarly unaware if we invaded a planet an found we had a deadly vulnerability to the gaseous form of gold, for example (ignoring temperature as an issue.)Other criticisms are why such athletic aliens cannot brake into a boarded up house. However, they do brake into the house. Really quickly. They just avoid doing it via smashing through wood and instead find an easier way in. The latter option, to me, indicates a higher level of intelligence.I could go on, but I'm just going to say that you could either a) suspend your disbelief or b) stop trying to be the biggest intellects on the internetz. The film is wonderfully crafted, has a great score, the acting is first rate, and the culmination of several different plot threads into a singular tense ending is great. There is lots of things to like about this film, and seemingly a few to dislike if you really try hard enough.But don't try that, just enjoy it for what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You have to drop the Gibson/Phoenix/Shyamalan baggage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to write a review of this movie now (2011), after all the attention that Mel Gibson's ugly tirades got, after Joaquin Phoenix's crazy "mockumentary", after M. Night Shyamalan's missing the mark with "Lady in the Water," "The Happening," and "The Last Airbender." But if you can let go of the baggage that subsequent events have loaded onto this movie, it's a decent, watchable movie. It does have some flaws, but it's well above average as entertainment and gets points for originality from all parties.So: what's it about? It takes a little while to declare itself. Initially it seems to want to be a suspense drama. And then it morphs into a sci-fi invasion drama. And then, at the end, it finally declares itself: it's about unlikely events providing a redemption for a man of faith who, for a while, lost his faith.First things first: Gibson. Up until we were inundated with recordings of his ugly tirades of venom spewed at his ex-girlfriend, and his anti-semitic tirade during his DUI arrest, Gibson was a genuinely likable actor who could project a streak of craziness that made him suspenseful to watch. There was also a sense of humor about him; at any moment in a serious drama, he might break out with a comedic moment that lightened things up. And he conveys these things in the character he plays here, but he also gets across to us that this character is a man who has lost his calling and doesn't know how to fill the empty place it left.Working with him to move the plot forward is Joaquin Phoenix as his younger brother, a man who hasn't lost anything of a calling because he hasn't found anything to hold him yet. He exists in this movie mostly as a foil for Gibson's character, and he plays that part well. He's an actor who is sexy and charismatic and has a feel of dangerousness even when you know he's solidly on the side of good things.Through a series of events surrounding an alien invasion, Gibson takes actions to protect his two kids, Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (an adorable, and tiny, Abigail Breslin). As events proceed, we get flashbacks that lead us to the source of Gibson's disillusionment and loss of faith, the death of his wife in a freak car accident.This leads me somewhat obliquely to what I have to regard as this movie's biggest flaw: Shyamalan doesn't seem to have much faith in the ability of his audience to see what he's getting at. He is not subtle in getting his major premise across; he wants to spell it out, then repeat it for emphasis, and then finally beat us over the head with it to make sure that we "get it." This is jarring, to say the least, and it works against the movie: it's hard not to feel that maybe if he feels the need to be obvious, BLATANTLY obvious, perhaps he's unsure of himself and his craft as a writer and a director. He doesn't want the material to fail: but I think that if he wants to craft movies that are more than workmanlike entertainment, he has to take chances in trusting the audience and trusting himself and his ability to get things across to the audience without spelling them out so obviously.He doesn't want to take that chance, and that shows. And it hurts the movie.I kind of think that it affected Gibson and Phoenix, too. There are some moments in the film when it seems like they're just going through the motions, just "reading" their lines, not living them and making them live. Gibson does this more than Phoenix does, and it makes me wonder: was Shyamalan afraid to call him on this and demand better from him? It's obvious to the whole world now that Gibson has quite an ego, and with his experience both in front of and behind the camera, he must be an intimidating presence to direct. Was he holding back and just going through the motions because he didn't like some of the material? Was Shyamalan unaware of how Gibson came across, or was he afraid to demand better? I don't know and it doesn't matter. Those moments when Gibson is obviously not engaged in the material are jarring.In the end, I want to recommend this film with some reservations. It's decent entertainment and has originality. It also has flaws that hold it back.But I think the bottom line in deciding whether you want to watch this film or not is whether you can disengage what you know about Gibson, Phoenix and Shymalan off the set from what's happening on the screen. If you bring their baggage to this movie, I don't think you will enjoy it at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about the signs of faith that can heal a family's wounds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With more than 2000 IMDb viewers' responses, Signs certainly seems to have stirred up film watchers' imaginations. My comment here will be brief because I don't want to add to the general mayhem the movie seems to have generated; but having read even a few opinions, I am convinced some things need to be cleared up.First, Shaymalan, like Spielberg (and many other Hollywood directors who don't admit it,) is by his own description a B movie director; he makes no pretensions towards creating art, except for the masses. Viewers should not necessarily expect subtlety or technical brilliance in films intended to provide large audiences with a campy version of horror. Viewers can enjoy Shaymalan's films for their eccentric views of horror or special effects, films strong on mood and atmosphere but not necessarily on plot or character.Signs, however, surpasses these limitations, and is clearly the director's best effort so far -- despite himself, he has made a good film. No need to mention the masterful building of suspense that he achieves here -- even the film's critics acknowledge it. And the moment much-talked-about -- the "Brazilian video" birthday party -- will scare you indeed. Small children may indeed be terrified. I am not a small child, and I was.To view this film with some objectivity, ask yourself not what you as a viewer look for in a film, but what the director intended to achieve in it. A so-called lack of plausibility, for instance (understood as a lack of 'believable plot') actually has the purpose of deflecting us from the real horror of the characters' lives: their inability to come to terms with the death of their mother and spouse. Whether or not an alien race would evolve enough technology to travel through space but not enough to break out of a locked room is irrelevant to the sense of terror that our awareness that there is an alien in that locked room actually causes. Clearly the film is not 'about' an alien invasion or some other preposterous nonsense, but about this family, torn apart by guilt and grief over the death of the mother, and how one singular experience -- I will not reveal it in case there may be someone out there who has yet to see the film, but it involves being locked in a cellar -- changes their lives by bringing them face to face with the unaccountable and mysterious gift that life is -- and that sharing this gift amongst the living demands the defence of the living, and requires sacrifice to protect them -- far worthier than wasting one's life in the doubt and despair that the death of a loved one can cause.Shyalaman thus raises the question of faith and the value, indeed the need, of hope. Family is worth protecting; those we love are worth our sacrifice in defending them. That is the purpose of using the 'macguffin' device of the crop destruction (as this is a basic plot line I do not believe mentioning it counts as a spoiler) for this is what sets in motion the long string of events that ends up bringing the family to its epiphany, or moment of revelation.I find it odd, really, that so many viewers seem to think that only 'pure' horror (which I suspect means gory or bloody) or 'pure' science fiction (which I suspect means science fantasy, as one might find it in Lynch's Dune or one of the Star Wars films) can guarantee a stylish, satisfying entertainment. Cearly films like these can offer an exciting escape from boredom. Signs, on the other hand, eschews the sensationalism of science fiction to focus on what actions are necessary in life to maintain faith and love in a world increasingly disoriented, violent, and destructive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Other Signs !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is the best among M. Night Shyamalan's movies that I watched yet. It wasn't laughably fabricated like (The Village). It wasn't the real disappointing (Unbreakable). And most of all it can be viewed for a second time to savor its high-minded concept unlike his previous, ironically more popular, (The Sixth Sense).I love it when the genre movie carries a message. So how about a spiritual message as well. (Signs) is about believing in fate and its genius wisdom, which's beyond the human mind. But it is where the best of it is the meaning of its story, while the worst of it is the way this story was handled. Simply, the mix was uneven.The first half was outstanding on all the levels. The second part looked like a humdrum where the horror wasn't made well, the scene in the basement was dead, and the aliens seemed phony. Yet I was sadder for the dealing with the invasion matter, since I wholly saw it ? as the same ? before, being Shyamalan's frank and shameless rip-off from War of the Worlds. Generally this second half was sick of laziness. That made it a bit poor and boring.Undoubtedly it is one of the most important roles Mel Gibson had. And he was the highest element in the movie. Maybe most of the financial success ($227,965,690 gross out of $70,200,000 budget) came from the idea of Gibson's being, and for the first time, in a horror. But there weren't more super elements. Maybe some moments of the direction, the low tone pace, and the creative intro music by (James Newton Howard).Though, I still have faith in it. I believe this time Shyamalan wrote this beautiful tale then made the mystery around, while he concerned, in other movies, about the mystery first. It says a lot about paying more attention to the other signs. The signs of the omnipotent presence of god, and the complicated plans of fate. It is not another movie about the thrill and the horror of evil-creatures-attacking-peaceful-home; it's about that as just a calamity, which we must face and, most significantly, learn from it about higher issues. As if Shyamalan says what a crap if we thought about signs of aliens, ghosts, superpowers..etc. and forgot thinking about the signs of god. So this is why it will live longer, being the most valuable, among his works and any other Hollywood crap.Just look at the lovely last scene, it pushed me to ask why this wasn't made while Jamie Stewart was alive. This kind of tales, concerning returning to faith, was in fashion at the old Hollywood. Here, it only wore new clothes. Thank god that the flaws didn't spoil, totally spoil, what is beneath them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the Hell Was This Story About?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is moderately suspenseful and clever. But it isn't about aliens at all. The film is about a man who lost faith when his wife died and he lost courage. His family then fell victim to the usual depredations of fear and paranoia. In this case, an irrational fear of aliens. The "uncle" character played by Joachim Phoenix was someone who tried to be a big league ball player. He made some memorable plays but he was know as the strike out king because he gave up on himself. Mel Gibson spends the film refuting his old position as a father - a minister, and as a dad to his kids. It takes the aliens to make him come to terms with his wife's death and become the father for his kids, and his community. Having said all this, M. Knight Shamalan is a pussy. He uses suspense and horror genres to convey Normal Rockwell ideals of family and societal values. What a jerk!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Scary Movie 3 parody version is less dumb. Seriously.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary Movie 3 is also funny and a lot more entertaining, so just watch it instead of Signs. Why? Because Signs doesn't quite make a great deal of sense.It has great cinematography, and quite a lot of the acting is good, but it's boring delivery and plot-hole plagued "storyline" makes it a real chore to watch. I was barely able to finish it because it was quite a boring piece of drivel. It was like they came up with the various events of the film and squeezed it all in together. Yeah, that'll do for a film. Here are some *SPOILER* examples: "Let's make the aliens be able to travel to earth but unable break through wood" (This is one point that Tom Logan in Scary Movie 3 says) "We'll write the aliens to attack humans even though they are composed of water, even though that kills the aliens" (The human body is composed 90-ish% of water) "Let's have an alien just suddenly stand around at one point whilst being attacked" (An obviously carelessly ultra-clear continuity mistake for what excuse...?!) "Let's have a kid killing a vicious dog whilst it's brutally trying to attack him without any noise being made from it. No barks, no growls. No screams. Just the quiet rural air" (Perhaps a drugged common sense failure?) "We'll write that special space sensory machine can't pick up alien signals but that a baby monitor can" (Hell why not have an Orange Cinema Advert moment with you're future ideas!! "So what, then, what next? A mobile phone? An MP3 player? A microphone! Or maybe even a laptop!") Yeah, those are extremely excellent ideas! No, they really are. For a pot-smoker. I mean come ON guys! A primary school kid could write a better plot. No wonder Scary Movie 3 p***-took it. Really SM3 should've done more to take the p***, using those plot-holes I mentioned above. I thought they over-did the whole religious faith thing, too. I think that ruined the film, too. By the way, I was joking about the sequels, because...well, from those plot-holes, don't bother. Or write it drug-free.All in all, this film is rather boring and a madly mixed together breakfast and dinner. Seriously, you're not missing anything if you haven't watched, so don't bother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moody atmospheric film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big Shyamalan fan and always make time to see his latest offerings. Signs was different and not as good as Unbreakable and the sixth Sense which still remain my two fave Shyamalan flicks.Signs had a great cast and was shot in his typical style... moody, atmospheric, great cast ,great acting especially from the child actors but it had some gaping holes.Possible spoiler : Why can't Aliens who have mastered space travel and even crop circles not be able to get in through a simple, barricaded wooden door. Plus earth is covered by a lot of water.. why risk their lives to take over such a planet where water is easily available to be used as a weapon? But for the upside the actors all did great jobs. Mel Gibson played the role of Graham Hess with conviction...... his lack of faith and how he gains it back through his experiences. I especially like the scene he had with Joaquin on the couch when he asked to be comforted.I thought Joaquin had a nice part, with some of the scenes that helped to melt the tension and suspense. I love the scene when mel comes home and see his family on the couch with their mind protection hats. The two child actors did really well as is expected in a shyamalan flick.Watch the movie and enjoy the suspense and mood which is obtained with hardly any special F/X.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>aliens cross interstellar space to a planet 70+% water...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>and then die from any contact with the stuff. Right. Next time maybe they'll just nuke from orbit... or go for Mars, instead. Hell, just drop a few large asteroids and wait for humans to die out.This film is just about the most ridiculous alien invasion film since Mars Attacks - unfortunately for M. Night, Mel and company, this film wasn't trying to be ridiculous. This movie would have been MUCH better had it stayed with the "unseen menace" approach. That worked well in another fialed film effort: IT. The first half of the movie is solid and then it just falls apart when the threat is solidified and made real. Unfortunately, this is even worse. There is NO explanation why aliens, who can cross interstellar space, are vulnerable to the most common substance on the planet they invade or why they are apparently incapable of harming human beings.Another commenter says this is a movie about faith. Well, I used to have faith in Shymalan. Maybe he can regain it... but this movie is crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wouldn't watch it a second time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't particularly impressed with the much-exhausted idea of aliens taking over our planet. The thrill factor of this movie wasn't any good either. Not to mention, the fact that things didn't add up greatly hurt this movie. In order to combat the problem of highly intelligent and hostile beings from entering their home I would think one would have to go through a lot more trouble than to club it a couple of times and throw a glass of water in its face. I did, however, enjoy the acting of both the adults and the children in this movie. The emotional intimacy of the family and their crippling past made me tear up more than once. The light humor also made it that much more enjoyable. I think it would have been best if Shyamalan had just taken the whole faith issue and ran with that instead. As a psychology enthusiast I would have been very interested. I can't stress how much of a distraction the "aliens" are to the true meaning behind this movie! It could have been much more successful and memorable, but instead it's shoved into the "what if aliens exist?" category along with all the others. Just for having aliens in it! Even the physical appearance and behavior of the aliens were clich. In the beginning the movie is very intriguing but I feel as if they didn't know how to continue in that direction or they'd think a much more complex plot would take too much time and effort but in the end it just hopelessly collapsed. I was so disappointed by the finale and it just left me wanting more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie asks two profound questions: Am I alone? Are we alone? It addresses them thoughtfully, with subtlety and restraint. The answers to both questions remain elusive, but Shyamalan leads us down a valuable pathway in this eternal search.The strong direction brings out compelling characters, as expressed by a superior cast. Cherry Jones is fantastic. For that matter, so are Gibson, Phoenix and the rest.Signs is NOT a B-movie, and it is NOT an action movie. It is NOT even a sci-fi movie per se. Rather, it presents a grieving family in the face of an existential crisis (or two, actually). This movie speaks to life's most basic questions with emotion and clarity.It does not compete with Aliens (which I also loved) or Independence Day in any way at all. If that's what you are looking for, do not buy this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've heard many people saying, that they were disappointed after seeing "Signs". The reason why they get disappointed seems to be, that they expect a horror movie when they go to the cinema to see a M. Night Shaymalan movie. That's a mistake, in my point of view. M. Night combines superstition, beliefs, and everyday conflicts in his movie. The last one may seem a little odd, considering the plot in "Signs". But the truth is, that the film is far more than just another horror movie. It's a reflection of the human mind, faith and weakness.Expect a dramatic, sad, frightening and exceptional touching film. It will make you wonder if it could actually be authentic. But remember: It's no horror movie!Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "Less Is More" Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this film in 2002, it was and still remains the only movie that has ever truly scared me. Of course, my taste has changed considerably since those days, so I recently decided to revisit the film. Upon rewatching it, I've found myself more impressed than I've ever been with this masterpiece.The story follows Graham Hess (Gibson), a former reverend torn apart by the loss of his wife; his two children Morgan (Culkin) and Bo (Breslin); and his brother, Merrill (Phoenix), a former minor league baseball star. This already stressed out family is put under a considerably heavier trial when they find mysterious patterns in their crops and are then tormented by the following alien invasion of Earth."Signs" is the perfect example of the "less is more" approach. Director M. Night Shyamalan builds the tension so expertly throughout the film using nothing but silence and clever camera angles that by the time the climax arrives my chest is about to explode. In fact, I have never seen another film that utilizes silence and shadows so well, it's really makes the film so scary for me. Anytime we see any part of the aliens, it's always so brief or obscured that we're never really sure what it was that we just saw.However, the film does contain some rather illogical flaws. For instance, why would a baby monitor pick up a sophisticated alien transmission? Why wouldn't the aliens cut the power supply while they were invading Earth? How could they have survived even a second in Earth's moist atmosphere if water kills them? But I, for one, was too enthralled in the story to care.Another thing I greatly appreciated in "Signs" was James Newton Howard's excellent score. It was not ubiquitous, clich, or intrusive like the identical "original" scores in all the Hollywood fright films of late. It was there when it should have been and it wasn't when it shouldn't have been.But "Signs" is not just a frightening sci-fi film, it also a film about faith. Graham is a man struggling with his beliefs, which leads to a rather powerful scene toward the end of the film in which he must talk his son through a violent asthma attack while exclaiming "I hate you!" at God. Such scenes are also quite demanding from an acting standpoint, and the acting is capably handled by both of the leading men and also by the small band of supporting actors. Oh, this reminds me, keep your eyes open for a cool little cameo by Stella's Michael Showalter.On top of all this, the film also features beautiful, vivid cinematography and genuinely ingenious, fluid camera movements from Shyamalan.I guess "Signs" is one of those "love it or hate it" films, as I have heard lots of opinions on both sides of the spectrum and not too many in the gray area. As you have probably noticed, I am one of those who love it and I will watch and enjoy this excellent piece of cinema for years to come.9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a avid movie watcher. Not just of a lot of the copied, formula driven movies of today, but classics such as Casablanca, and Citizen Kane. I like human movies about human problems. Sure I'll watch the latest crowd pleaser of sfx bonanza to be entertained, but to understand something, i like to watch films with at least some truth or meaning to it. Signs is an amazing movie. Think about it. What if you lived on a small farm , in a small town, when suddenly aliens attack our planet. I know it sounds preposterous. But don't you wonder what you would do? How scared would you feel? The key to this movie is just that. This is the story of such a family. The key here to the film is that we are secluded. the entire story takes place on this farm. No cuts to new york as the aliens destroy the statue of liberty with there "death ray". No, the camera stays on the farm and follows what these people do. Not only does this create unbelievable tension, but makes you feel claustrophobic. It makes it feel REAL. It is touching, and scary and makes you think. A great believable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I laughed a lot when I watched this movie. It has lots and lots of hilarious scenes and lots of unintentionally funny stuff in it. And, if you were wondering, it doesn't have any really scary scenes in it. But then again, it's more about the faith and family of Graham Hess (Mel Gibson). Graham is this priest, who has lost his faith after his wife had died in a car accident. Now he's living with his two kids, Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin), and his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix). One day huge crop circles appear on their field. Then they notice that strange things start to happen all around the world.Signs relies much on slow narration and it's own quirky atmosphere. There are TV reports shown all over the movie, which work as testimonials of the truthfulness of the situation, it's not in their imagination.Well, in all, I cannot recommend this movie, if you want fast scares or lots of action. But if you like slower narration and not so obvious plot line this is for you.</fullReview>

Instead Mel Gibson just seems rude and uncaring, his brother lacks zeal and the children deserve to be eaten by something.Avoid and then, if it chases you, avoid this film more seriously.

Making a slow paced film does not engender quality only boredom and predictability. Is there anything less scary than crop circles? Someone should point him in the direction of a decent editor.Pope Mel further proves that he's a terrible actor when he's not doing comedy. No surprise that the king of self-righteousness stars in a film where a Christian has his faith re-affirmed by aliens without realising the dichotomy of the situation. Surely the presence of aliens negates the presence of a god. Let's face it, there is no god. That's a fact unless you can prove otherwise.A polished turd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By the Morons, for the Morons,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs is the worst science-fiction film ever made. Its alien-invasion story is so idiotic it makes Independence Day look clever, and the cinematography is as dull as the plot is stupid. There must be at least an hour of closeups of Mel Gibson's slack, basset-hound face looking nervous but steadfast. Poor Mel needn't have worried so much, because the aliens menacing his farmhouse are so helpless they literally can't figure out how to break down a boarded-up door. Their plan to conquer earth is simple: they plan to wipe us out by breaking and entering our humble abodes and fighting it out with us in unarmed combat. That's right: these advanced interstellar travelers can't come up with any better way of wiping out six billion people by breaking into each and every house on the planet and attacking us with their bare hands, or paws. That's right: they don't have any weapons at all. Yes, folks, these critters can cross the galaxy, but they don't have enough sense to bring a weapon when they attack, not even a tire iron. So when the aliens decide to make Mel's little farmhouse their first strategic objective, their battle plan is simple: a single alien skulks around the living room, totally unarmed, trying to look menacing. This makes the interstellar burglar an easy victim for Mel's little brotherJoaquin Phoenix--an ex-baseball player who's lost his batting average, just like big brother Mel has lost his faith. defeats the alien in the farmhouse living room by getting the IL' Lousiville Slugger off the wall and hitting a home run right off the extraterrestrial's ribcage. Oh, wait, I forgot: the bat just softens up the evil alien, knocking him to the floor where he's finished off by...a spilled glass of water. It seems these technologically advanced ETs failed to note, in their decades of recon, that 2/3s of Earth happens to be covered with water. It's a good thing Phoenix mugged the poor fool; otherwise that first alien picnic at the beach would have been a real bummer. Signs may be a collections of dismal clichs, but it is original in at least two ways: not only are its alien invaders the first to arrive without any weapons, but they're also the first in film history to be baffled by simple wooden doors. First Mel's neighbor locks an alien scout in the pantry, where it scuffles around helplessly. Then the bigger invasion force lands, advances on Mel's farmhouse, and withdraws without managing to get in. What clever tactic has baffled them, you ask? The answer will surprise you: Mel and family have boarded up the doors. Boarded-up doors, a baseball bat, and a spilled glass of water: that's all it takes to foil an interstellar invasion. The really interesting question is why this movie makes its space invaders so comically helpless. Do American audience just need to imagine an enemy they could actually handle, after all the grim news out of Iraq--or are the film's director, star and millions of adoring fans just plain stupid?John Dolan</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie Blucks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently decided that this movie is, without question, the worst movie ever filmed. The only thing I could come up with that was redeeming was the scene with the blurry alien. 3 redeeming seconds. Yikes. The fact that aliens with an "agua allergy" would come to a planet that is 2/3 water populated by 'humans' who are also 2/3 water shows that either the aliens, or the film maker, was completely out to lunch. Since the aliens don't really exist... Swing Away... Half-a-wife... the director playing the part of "hey I'm a dazed guy in a truck"... God's against them and for us (the human race)... and on and on... The magic of movies allows this one to suck AND blow at the same time. I would rather watch my Uncle Chuck's vacation videos. He went to Buffalo last year. Branson the year before. Want to watch a scary alien movie? Rent John Carpenter's The Thing. 'nuff said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing the trailer for "Signs" and thought, "that looks like a totally stupid movie." Months later I saw it and, whaddya know, I was dead on. It's bad enough that it includes as a fundamental story element CROP CIRCLES, the quintessential hoax in which people to this day still choose to believe (despite the original hoaxers' "coming out" years ago). The formulaic threads are nearly sickening. The religious man who, thanks to some tragedy, turns his back on god, but by the end of the movie realizes the "truth" of his restored faith, tying a pretty bow around the tidy happy ending. Basically this movie seems to have been written backwards. It's like M. Night Shamalamadingdong wrote the scene at the end where all these disparate and unexplained pieces come together and make "sense," then threw in a bunch of filler to achieve a feature-length duration.SPOILER:And what the heck is up with the water thing? If you were an alien who was like deathly allergic to water, why the bloody blazes would you come to Earth in the first place, and then park your UFO in the middle of a freaking dew-covered corn field?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They're Here -- Yet Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected this to be one of those special f/x schlock fests with people running around, screaming hysterically, amidst dazzling fireworks, but it wasn't that at all. Instead, everything began quietly, deliberately, ominously. The eponymous signs are crop circles, the first signals that something is up world-wide. Not too promising a beginning, since the circles were debunked years ago. But the nicely evoked rural atmosphere of Bucks County, Pennsylvania, was charming in the same way that rural Iowa was charming in "Field of Dreams." (Bucks County is now being devoured from the north by Allentown and engulfed from the south by Philadelphia and will shortly resemble every other mall-blighted area in the country.) And, then, too, I was kind of impressed by the overall tone imposed on the flick by its director. Everyone speaks slowly and quietly, often actually whispering, although there is no reason to whisper. It looked as if it might be an unorthodox, thoughtful look at the nature of the universe, or at least our perceptions of it.Then, alas, the blocks began to fall into place and what we have instead is a kind of Steven King horror story skeleton fleshed out with techniques derived from the X Files. Mel Gibson, in a decent performance, is a clergyman who has lost his faith after his wife's death and turned to farming. I hoped against hope he wouldn't recover his belief in God after undergoing some additional crisis. Phoenix is his failed baseball-player brother who doesn't have much to do except help out around the house, doing such chores as whacking aliens with his baseball bat and accidentally smashing the only light bulb in the cellar when they need it most. The two kids, however, are engagingly underplayed and the little girl is given some funny lines. (Although nobody laughs, or even grins at any time in the movie.) Gibson too has a comic moment when the family votes on whether to leave the house or stay and hole up there. When he is outvoted, he abruptly claims to have "two votes" because he represents two parents. The boy gets angrily to his feet and says, "That's bull****." Well -- it's funny in the context of this rather grim flick anyway. The plot has just about every cliche you can think of. Does the reverend regain his faith? Actually, it's not clear whether he does or not. Are there awed newscasters on TV reporting crop circles and lights in the sky from all around the world, saying things like, "God help us all"? Is there a sick kid who, in order to survive, must have medicine that has been left behind in a place of danger and must be retrieved? Is the family trapped in the cellar, as in "Night of the Living Dead"? Do they spend half the movie fumbling around in the dark with only two flashlights between them, as in The X Files? Is the house hastily boarded up with planks nailed over the windows and doors, as in "The Birds"? Do the aliens try to creep into the house through neglected openings such as a coal shoot, as in "Close Encounters of the Third Kind"? Are they finally defeated by something found all around us in everyday life, like harmless bacteria ("The War of the Worlds") or water ("The Day of the Triffids," "The Wizard of Oz")? The answers are yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, and yes.Still, I admire the attempt on the part of the people responsible for this flick, the director in particular, to breathe some life into these moribund elements of the plot. At least they tried.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Ado About Nothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I watched this film, it became apparent that I was watching some form of H. G. Wells's The War of the Worlds. That novel is a skeletal frame for the alien part of the film. Aliens come to Earth. The farmhouse is very much like the one seen in the 50's picture of that name. There are many other similar things. But the alien aspect of the movie, while very integral to the plot, is but one facet of the story, the major thrust of the story deals with a man having recently lost his wife lose his faith in God. Now, having seen The Sixth Sense a few times and loving it for its ending, I went into Signs expecting something of the same. In that regard I was disappointed. The ending can be seen almost at the beginning of the film. So, I had to put that aside and think about the story. The story is pretty good if you look at its philosophical roots about how you look at what you are given in life. The movie is really about perception and how each of us is to perceive what we are given in life. We can always focus on what we don't have and have not accomplished, OR we can look at what we do have and have accomplished. Do we see the glass as half empty or half full? This aspect of the film makes Signs a compelling picture. Mel Gibson does a very good job playing a man torn by his feelings. The rest of the acting is good as well (with the exception of M. Night Shymalan in a fairly big role). The story is laden down with too many contrivances and for that reason Signs will not appeal to many. It has a silly ending if you don't see the man struggling with his faith as the major focus of the film. The director does infuse many taught, suspenseful scenes, and although I believe this film lacks the the power of The Sixth Sense, it does pack a few punches.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan Still Falters Due to Trickery.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another M. Night Shyamalan film that tries to dazzle and then surprise you at the end. The routine still works to an extent, but overall Shyamalan is still living off his enormous success with "The Sixth Sense". Former religious man Mel Gibson, his wise-cracking younger brother (Joaquin Phoenix) and Gibson's two young children seem to have a relatively peaceful and uneventful lives in Pennsylvania. Peaceful that is until crop circles start appearing and animals start behaving strangely. It must just be something local, right? Wrong. It appears that similar situations are occurring all over the world. What could all this mean? "Signs" is one of those films that tells its audience way too much way too fast. The suspense that is built up early on is eliminated too quickly as Shyamalan cannot keep the rabbit in the hat long enough this time. The same problems that plagued "The Sixth Sense" and "Unbreakable" are still prevalent, but a little more pronounced in this one. Overall the film is still pretty good, mainly due to Gibson's screen persona and Phoenix's comic relief. Shyamalan has an important cameo appearance as a doctor with a secret. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspense over Substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Signs" is a movie that's mainly interesting because it's genuinely scary (at least in the cinema). The director M. Night Shyamalan proves beyond a doubt that he's very adept at creating suspenseful moments out of basically nothing and uses suggestion and vagueness to build the tension. It works really well. The rest of the movie is so-so. The acting by the adults (Mel Gibson and Joaquim Phoenix) is quite strong but the little kids are once again nearly unbearable to watch, mainly because they say things no kid of their age would normally say. The story is kept intentionally vague since it serves only as a framework for the suspenseful scenes, which I think is excusable. It's not like we needed a new "Indepedence Day" anyway. Where the movie does go wrong, however, is in the message, "Everything happens for a reason", it's trying to get across. There's way too much quasi-religious talk in this movie for my taste. I don't believe in predestination and this movie certainly didn't make me change my mind about that. The whole alien invasion (including all the lives that it claims) seems to happen simply to give Mel Gibson his faith back, and Mel's son has asthma solely because he wouldn't die of the alien nerve gas that way? Come on... Without the message and the religious angle, I would have loved this movie. As it is, the movie is still pretty good (since it's really scary) but not a classic like "Sixth Sense" was. **1/2 out of **** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the first movie that I have seen in many years (since watching Alien and Aliens on video as a kid with a bunch of people), that has been able to ... scare me.It had excellent build up, great realism -- and was just damned creepy ! Top-notch entertainment as far as I am concerned. No idea through-out the movie what would happen next or how things would turn out.I am someone that likes non-standard endings. I like it when things don't turn out well, when the "bad guys win", so to speak. But I found myself toward the end of this movie thinking deeply that I didn't want the bad thing to befall them, and I really wasn't sure if it would or not. It's rare these days to find a movie [at least with a suspenseful one like this] where you really do care about the characters, this one fits the bill.I gave it a 9.5 in my head after watching it in theater, and I gave it a 10 on here. Definitely worth watching ... and make sure that the lights are out, and the sound is turned up loud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is that sign ahead? It's got to be a U turn, STOP, or detour!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** SIGNS: It has got to be a U turn, STOP, or detour! On the plus side, this film did have several jump-out-and-got-ya scenes, it was in color and the dialogue was in American English. Unfortunately that's all of the plus side. We are introduced to a family still in mourning; where the Mom/Wife/Sister-in-law has been killed in a freak accident some months before. From the trauma of losing his wife Mel Gibson's character resigns his position of a community spiritual leader ( A Priest in some unnamed Faith) We soon understand that he not only doubts God, but he is actually P***ed at him. His brother, son and daughter are suffering not only because they too have lost a parent/sister-in-law, but the head of the family (Mel) has lost his spiritual conviction and love for life. It is apparent that his faith is turning dark, and he is becoming more reclusive.Enter in the Water-soluble aliens. Crop-Circles, we are lead to believe, all along have been communications for alien invasion plans. The aliens mission, IQ, and combat tactics are all found in a book purchased by Mel's eleven-year-old son, from the small Pennsylvania farm town's local bookstore, which we are informed had ordered it by mistake. (I think it was a hardbound copy of the 'Signs' Script.) From information there in contained, they all survive, the days and nights of terror that follow. For comic relief, all, but Mel, at one point don a hat of aluminum foil, which resemble twenty-pound Hershes kisses (an obvious Pennsylvania product tie in). This is done, so the aliens can't read their thoughts, and maybe control them too. It's in the kids book, and so far it ain't been wrong. With out the poor attempt at a classic science fiction plot, this could have been rewritten as a family drama. Mel had his character down well, but those dam pesky aliens. It seems unlikely that a species of aliens would want anything to do with a planet covered with a liquid (water) that dissolves their tissue. It was tough knowing that the kids super-soaker in this `Signs' invasion, would have been like the yodeling cowboy in the movie `Mars Attacks'. `Signs' however wanted you to believe. It wanted you to believe that the Aliens, who, though super athletic, are adversely affected by light and melt from water, and run around nude for a force recon combat mission, on a hostile planet. Also, the alien's spacecraft now appearing by the thousands over the cities of earth are never met by a military response, Just a lot of looking up in wonder, and panic. While the only offensive gesture offered is the pointing of news cameras. (Anything more violent may cost more to show on screen, and they may not want to come back to earth, for a sequel.) `SIGNS' could have been an `ET' warm fuzzy type of movie, where the aliens crop signs, are made by 'alien' secret agents, living among us. The C-C in Tom's field pointed out that ` The human creatures here need solace, and a renewed faith in the Creator'. The characters would eventually discover that different signs, in various fields around the planet mean different things like; 'Help this person', `Take this one back home', `These idiots still think Crop Circles are hoaxes', you get the idea. Maybe the priest, or one of his children, would be the only human that could read the messages, etc. The version we got was pretty worthless. Thinking they were in the 'The Birds' Tom and his brother board up windows and doors, they should have at least recalled that this was only marginally effective on five pound birds. Moreover, it doesn't even make a good waste of time here, for soon after the last nail is hammered, the family is forced in retreat to the basement shuddering in terror. The Aliens have no tools or weapons, other than a poison gas they secrete from their bodies though a tube protruding from their hand, and can use it only if they hold you down, and squirt up your nose. These space wimps attempt to get in by using the basement doorknob, or the old forgotten coal chute. They have all night, but fail to breach the inch thick basement door or the franticly stacked sacks of dog food. The next morning after surviving the night of terror, they all emerge to learn that the aliens have departed, leaving behind their injured. Mel's son is having a seizure for lack of medicine, and is grabbed up by one of the stranded invaders, and gassed. He must have been hiding in one of the many Hitchcock shadows. Gibson, a veteran of many military films, should have pointed out the flaw in any global invasion strategy which includes giving the enemy (us humans in this case), samples of it's army to study alive, or dead. The aliens are tall and skinny, at least eight feet tall; at no more than a hundred twenty pounds, and as aliens go, not that bad looking. Enter Batman. A one time local baseball hero, the 20 year old brother of Mel's character takes an enshrined Louisville slugger from the wall and kills this stranded alienated alien. Mel's character, finds faith anew when he discovers that his sons chronic asthma didn't allow him to breath the poison gas used on him, so the boy lives, and the movie concludes showing the passage of time with a winter shot of the house. All religious Icons back on the walls, Mel is once again `Father Thomas', and God is spelled once again with a capital `G'. The aliens are gone with no further mention. (and they all lived happily ever after) To me this film is a big stinker, because I could see within it, no less than three good movie ideas slamming into one another and the mutant result was what we were forced to swallow with our popcorn.</fullReview>

His brother (Joaquin Phoenix) has moved in to help him take care of the kids. The local sheriff (Cherry Jones) tries to comfort him, but Gibson pushes everyone away. Then weird circles appear in his crop fields and his kids claim to see creatures.Mel Gibson turns in the best performance to date in his career in a role in which he is cast against type. The rest of the cast is exceptional, with Cherry Jones really standing out in a brief performance. Good set-up gives way to many frightening and masterfully done scare scenes.

		<fullReview>I was completely bored throughout the movie. I found it agonizingly slow and not really much happened for a film that was hyped up so much.WARNING - SPOILERSI had a real hard time believing in the aliens. There were so many contradictions I found it annoying to watch.If the aliens had the technology to fly to earth in spaceships, then surely they could easily overpower the humans or have much more technologically advanced weapons than the silly gas idea. I mean, having to get that close to humans to overpower them is a sure way to lose any fight. And if they were only there to gather a few specimens, why arrive in such a conspicuous way?Many of us had problems with the water hurting them. Since this planet is water based, surely they would have a problem with the air which can be up to 90 percent water!They seemed quite weak and vulnerable, with no resistance to a simple wooden door, knives, baseball bats etc. Gee, what about the guns normal American people keep in their homes?The script was the big problem. And the basic plot was just that...basic! It's a *yawn* tried over and again idea. Man loses faith, man regains faith...boooorrriiinnnggg. Why not be a bit more adventurous and do it the other way around??? Man becomes religious, then realizes he's made a big mistake and goes back to being a non-believer.

		<shortDescription>Signs of Things to Come? (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I walked out of Signs in awe of how unimpressed I was. As much as I like Night's visual sensitivities I just could not walk away from this movie liking it no matter how much I tried. It's as if he's gotten formulas with a concept that didn't have much lasting power anyway. The Sixth Sense was a great film and so was Wide Awake. One made hundreds of millions of dollars the other barely made ten and it seems as if that has defined his style. While in his last two films the slow pacing has been somewhat to a benefit it absolutely hurts this movie that felt like it went on much longer than it had to. The movie is very strong at the beginning we get firmly established and differentiated characters and a series of escalatingly eerie events. The image of Morgan holding the baby monitor up to the sky is fantastic but that seems to be the last moment of greatness in this film after that it thuds. The things that worked in The Sixth Sense didn't work here while Mel Gibson did a very good job in this film the moments where he tells his children about when they were born were absolutely contrived. While the lack of visual contact with the aliens in the beginning is justifiable the lack of confrontation with them in the cellar itself is rather self-defeating. And thus, lends a certain feeling of anti-climax to the actual climax which by the way takes its jolly good time showing up. The casual identification of their motivation after the fact and also that we don't see them flee hurts the film. One of the best visual moments was spoken and it wasn't a case of the dialogue was so great showing it would hurt. The "Bird incident" was quite interesting. Ultimately Signs is a collection of interesting and creepy incident that have no idea where they want to end up. The climax which also included a montage like Shyamalan's last two films, packs no added wallop. While I didn't much care for Unbreakable the ending of that film does also provide an amazing shock. In this film, however, the end does not explain the whole of the film. Which is not usually a problem but certain critics who shall remain nameless said there was a quote 'You've got to be kidding me end.' There wasn't! Shyamalan's profound writing about how maybe there were 'No coincidences' was absolutely wrecked by the fact that he had to justify a logical ending with such flashes. I overheard someone say on the way out of the theater that "He's the King of Fancy Endings." This ending wasn't fancy at all and it like the film was a letdown. Also this film unlike the other two leaves many questions unanswered which defeats the style of ending and the film as a whole. All in all M. Night Shyamalan is very talented filmmaker who has to break out of this pattern. The beginning of his career is rather akin to Spielberg's with an early film that weren't much of a success and then a world wide breakout. They also stayed in the same genre for a while (Night's really in a subgenre). It truly is time for a change as far as his choice of subject matter goes, he's a very talented filmmaker and I will go see his next film I just hope he takes a new approach.</fullReview>

This story is basicaly "Independance Day" old from the perspective of an isolated farmhouse.. you get all the old standby alien invasion angles, but you are so cut off from the main story and forced to focus on this one family that it gets scarier by implication. The atmospheric touches and the total absence of underscore for much of the film add to the fear and suspense factor that ratchets up till the end of the world scenerio plays itself out. Mel Gibson as an emotionaly damaged former preacher and father of two young children is good in an underplayed role as is Joaquin Phoenix as his former minor-league ballplayer brother. The film is good for long stretches before finaly falling apart at the end and failing to live up to it's expectations. GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>boring family drama in a sci-fi disguise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>there is a thing that film makers should not ignore, which is called a scenario. if you don't have a story that doesn't have any value to tell, just don't force to make it into a movie. when they do this they only end up with a movies like 'signs'. the movie starts with some unknown signs at a cornfield. so it diverts you to imagine a nice sci-fi story behind alien communication. however at the end of the movie the mystery behind these signs still remains unclear. This movie is basically a boring religion oriented family drama with little to offer if you're waiting for a quality sci-fi story. The word 'sign' is literally used to give a moral lesson such that anything that happens on earth is a sign that god exists and everything depends on fate. And aliens are just for adding some spice to the story. it was totally a waste of time for me. BTW: i gave 2 points instead of 1 just for the sake of acting. (ps: there is no explanation why the hell those aliens came to the earth, a planet 3/4 of which is composed of water, if they melted upon contact with h2o. there is so much nonsense in this movie but whatever...)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good scare!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it came out, and at the time I was 12 years old. It frightened me quite a lot, thats all I remembered. Saw it a moment ago for the second or maybe the third time, and I must say that I still get a bit scared. The atmosphere and feeling of every single minute in this movie is outstanding! Mel Gibsons character is a former priest who lost his belief when his wife died. He lives with his two kids and his younger brother in a farmhouse. One day they see some strange patterns in the corn field, and there the story begins. Joaquin Phoenix who plays the brother is as good as always. The eerie and creepy atmosphere is more and more significant the further in you come. The negative things about Signs is that in some points its quite excessive. For an example, some scenes are very obvious and its a bit too cheesy! But as a summary:- Nice story, good actors, and quite a scare if its your first time! A movie thats in my opinion very well made! I really recommend to everyone who hasn't seen it :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't understand...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...why this film got so many bad reviews. I'm not a fan of aliens or horror films so perhaps these people are judging it by those standards. Maybe they came in expecting "Alien" or "Nightmare on Elem Street", so if that's what you're into you definitely skip this film. But if you're looking for a soulful, delicate and powerful film that makes you think about the bigger questions (God, coincidences, faith and hope) and offers some actual ANSWERS (something films have little of these days) you'll enjoy this film even if you aren't into aliens or horror.Basically, it's about Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), an Episcopalian priest who has just suffered a horrible tragedy that has made him lose his faith in God. He lives on a little farm with his two children Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin)and his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix). One morning he wakes up and discovers crop signs in his corn field. He at first thinks its just some neighborhood boys horsing around but soon it is discovered that there is a full-scale alien invasion underway all over the world. The best thing about this film is how realistically the character's respond to this emergency. I think if anything this insane were to actually happen people would at first be wholly unbelieving, then skeptical, slightly anxious and then full-blown terrified. They would sit and watch the news all day, holding their loved ones close, board up their homes and hide in the cellars or pack up the car and drive as far away from the trouble as they could go. Most alien films move right to the aliens wreaking carnage after the first ten minutes and therefore they lose something, they become a simple fight/flight ride that we never really required to think about. This film for the most part never showing the aliens, only in glimpses, and therefore our imaginations are allowed to enhance the fear and tension. This makes it a slow-moving film, but it never loses that sense of anxiety, the feeling that somewhere out-there, something is watching you and waiting to pounce...The message of the film is a universal one: at one point Graham asks his brother what kind of person is he, one who believes in blind luck and happy chance, that you are all alone in this world, or are you a person who believes that there are no coincidences and that there is Someone up there, watching and taking care of things? I myself am a Christian, but I think no matter what your religion, you will be able to take something comforting away from this film. I have seen many Christian films that do not give such a powerful display of faith as this one and I respect Shyamalan for being able to pull this off without it once seeming cheesy. The acting in this film is wonderful; the performances or subtle and quiet, these are everyday people still fragile after a tragedy, yet powerful and genuine. I know Gibson has been criticized and judged these past years, but he is without a doubt one of the best actors out there and his performance is the linchpin of this film, he character is so obviously damaged and insecure, yet when called upon he gives such strength and power. Phoenix is a great supporting role, he is quirky and rather simple, but no less strong or deep than his brother. The children are great, Culkin and Breslin work to together seamlessly and exude genuine love and tenderness for one another. Cherry Jones has a small part in this film but she is excellent in her scenes and even Shyamalan himself has a small scene, a very emotional one and he is actually very good. When I first saw this film I was unsure if I would enjoy it, the slow pace and the subtly of the performances, but by the end all this payed off: I knew each character deeply and I was invested in their story, and the ending was one of the most moving experiences I have ever seen in film. Go see this film, you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't enjoy or appreciate "Signs" because I kept expecting a M. Night Shyamalan plot twist or something similar.The not always explored Alien topic is taken in a new direction this time. It's treated like a worldwide problem and chaotic situation.I lost interest at the half of the running time, but then things started to make sense. The plot is complex because it mixes plenty of feelings. The whole losing the faith moment is the key in order to understand the whole movie..."Signs" mixes visually shocking moments and deep feelings of humans.But when the last impact sequence happened, I almost cringe! It was unexpected and very eerie. Shyamalan did it again but this time through a solid plot and character development.At first I thought it would be a situation created by the characters' paranoia but I'm glad it wasn't like that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie so bad I had to sign up to IMDb to complain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't comment on the plot holes of this one, which were abundant. In typical fashion of watching M. Shyamalan film I was looking for the unique plot twist from the get go. I swear the first half hour I thought the plot twist was that everyone were B-movie actors a la the "Truman Show". The dialog was so corny and the characters were used so blatantly to explain the plot and their emotions.The "explain the plot to the audience" police character was a bit too much. It wasn't until they went into town and the army recruiter guy tells us the aliens are "probing" us with their crop signs I realized that the bad acting and HORRIBLE dialog was not a plot twist, but the signs of a director/writer with no critical ear.That he appeared on screen in something quite less than a bit part seems to really prove that this director's ego has run amok. Sixth Sense was awesome, I really enjoyed Unbreakable, but it really felt like this movie was really hamstrung by his need to provide us with his surprise ending, which completely fell flat. The movie felt forced, the characters were completely 2 dimensional, the dialog was clich.Even the music for me was too much. It was an hour and a half of X-Files music, completely over-used so that any moments of real suspense felt mundane. Sorry, this movie was bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's not much point in writing about the content of this film. Read any number of reviews for the plot holes. Essentially it's just laughable. And not in a good way either, not a 'so appalling it's funny' kind of film. This film is just really, really poor - pointless, lacking any sense of narrative, so stupid in the details and totally, utterly un-suspenseful. I think it's trying to manage a kind of Hitchcock 'what's happening out of shot?' suspense, but it does this without any actual suspense whatsoever.Barely watchable, if at some times kind of mesmerising for its awfulness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I've rarely seen a movie that left me with an ambivalent feeling as strong as I had it after watching "Signs". It is another proof that M. Night Shyamalan is as talented in creating a threatening mood and lead the audience to nail-biting scenarios as rarely anyone else in the United States. The scenes in the cornfield are some of the best in recent suspense cinema history and could easily have been in one of the best movies in recent history. If there hadn't been this other part in this film, meaning the past of Mel Gibson's character as a priest, the death of his wife and the way he slowly finds back a way to believe in god. In a horror film it is advisable not to show the threat, so the viewer has many possibilities to envision it for himself. You have to keep the possibilities open. For creating suspense, Shyamalan is well aware of this principle. But when it comes to the faith storyline (and also the resolution), Shyamalan ignores the many possibilities and serves religious hardliners.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's OK to take a break Shayamalan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming on the heels of a smashing hit in "The Sixth Sense", and a solidly satisfying movie in "Unbreakable", "Signs" really didn't live up to the excellence that so quickly has been expected of M. Night Shayamalan. Still, "Signs" was a pretty good movie by all accounts. The movie dealt with two different issues: the lost faith of a former clergyman and the covert attack of aliens. The alien story was very simple and traditional: there were crop circles and the aliens had oval heads with big beady black eyes. Of course it was still suspenseful when seen from the eyes of a family that is holed up in their basement fearfully awaiting their fate. Every antagonist has their weakness though and fortunately for mankind the aliens' weakness was the one thing that the earth is 75% of: water. The movie didn't offer any real twists or attempts at misdirection. It was fairly straight forward and still provided plenty of entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exactly. I thought it was excellent. I think that all you haters out there are retarded too. The point of this movie wasn't aliens invading earth. any one who has seen a movie knows that you have to dig deeper to get the true meaning of a movie. The meaning in this case was, as stated by a fellow user below, is faith within yourself. Graham isn't just battling the aliens in this movie, the main idea is of him battling himself and his inner demons.Personally i believe (since its technically classified as a sci-fi/horror) that this is in fact one of the best horror films of all time. All of you expecting big ugly aliens with guns that can kill us to be scarier need to crawl back under your rocks. One of my film mentors once told me "what is scary on screen? seeing a big huge drooling creature, or something on the otherside of a door scratching and growling trying to get out and at you?". Any of you want to argue me on that, go watch the 6th sense.The stereotype in horror films these days is the directors seem to think that using 150 gallons of blood and 24 hot babes fornicating left and right will some how scare the crap out of us.M. overcomes that stereotype in Signs. We don't even see the creatures entirely until the last 10 minutes of the film, and he still left most of the people in the theatre closing their eyes too scared to see what happens next.In conclusion, all of you haters out there need to shut up. all you do is complain about how bad a film is. get a life. see something for what its good for. grow up. instead of criticizing stuff and saying you can do better, than go out and do something better! go make the next casa blanca, go re make citizen kane. just do something instead of being so down on others since everyone is so down on you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terrific in every way, M. Night Shyamalan's Signs is one of the most thought provoking thrillers of our time and Shyamalan's greatest work!When a Pennsylvania family discovers crop circles (among other weird occurrences) on their farm, they begin to believe that Earth is about to have some hostile visitors from above!With Shyamalan's stylish direction, an excellent cast, and an engulfing story that's both suspenseful and touching, Signs becomes one of the most beautifully done thrillers in many ages. Shyamalan is at his best as he captures the power of his intriguing tale both cinematically and emotionally well. He gives us a story with lovable, sympathetic characters who come into an extraordinary and terrifying situation, needless to say it's a captivating story from start to finish. It also possesses lots of color, as Shyamalan throws in plenty of tension, thrills, humor, and deeply stirring scenes. James Newton Howard provides a lovely music score for the film that is scene-by-scene perfect.The cast is a true highlight as well. The always-excellent Mel Gibson is strong as a reverend who is losing his faith following the loss of his wife. Joaquin Phoenix does well as Gibson's bewildered brother. Young Rory Culkin is great as Gibson's son and adorable Abigail Breslin is splendid as the daughter.A truly wonderful film on all levels, Signs is a film that will be enjoyed by all, not just fans of thriller genre. Even those who don't care for Shyamalan's earlier pictures may be surprised by this gem. It's well worth seeing more than once!**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How does this film merit a 7 rating?M Night Shyamalan seems to have carved an unspectacular niche in his own little 'tales of the unexpected' series. Everything about this film seems to have been done as an afterthought. No, it's not scary. No, it contains no real action to speak of. No, it's characters are not developed beyond a contrived subplot (or rather, only plot) of a preacher losing faith. Shyamalan seems to try so hard to present the amazing in an unamazing manner, that the result is... just dull (The Village is a prime example of his 'technique').As for the infamous water storyline, I don't want to hear about it being a metaphor, or it's the germs or whatever other excuse you can dream up to justify bad storytelling. These are the facts:Aliens vastly superior to us invade Earth, but are allergic to water. EARTH. A planet that is something like 70% water, populated by humans (also largely made up from water) who cry water when upset (a handy defence against these invaders eh?). Oh, and it has been known to rain here from time to time.There's a hell of a lot more pollution in the air than in our water, but hey. Don't tell the scriptwriter. He's trying to be clever.</fullReview>

I don't care if you think it's the concentration of whatever, that't bs it melts their skin only at the end, at least a slow process would happen the whole time.As far as the wood doors, thats an even bigger plot hole. If you think aliens might not know what "doors" are, think again. Every creature on earth understand the concepts of "doors" and "rooms" at some level, look at the spider that builds trap doors for its prey. They would have some way to be able to break down the door and get in.As far as being unarmed, they would understand the difference between nuclear and conventional weapons. Especially if they really sent recon parties. If they are really that smart they would have known all this. And you can't tell me that they wouldn't have even brought tools as simple as a knife?

Complete bullshit movie. The whole movie is full of boring moments, and the action is limited to a few man running around.

		<shortDescription>Scary and Moving At The Same Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to see why `Signs' would be such a success with moviegoers: people are constantly looking to have their faith reaffirmed, especially in these times, and a film like this is able to provide that reaffirmation in a unique take on the horror genre. It's scary and moving at the same time. Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan has created a far more surprising thriller than he did in his breakthrough `The Sixth Sense', this time constructing a puzzle that you don't realize is a puzzle until the climax. Ostensibly a film about an apparent alien invasion, Shyamalan concentrates his story on a farmhouse in rural Pennsylvania, where a pastor (Mel Gibson, in a carefully constructed performance) who has left the church after the untimely death of his wife struggles to reconcile his anger and disbelief; in this regard it becomes a very personal film questioning not only the presence of God during tragedy but also a God who creates tragedy as part of plans both great and small. Shyamalan creates an unnerving atmosphere by deliberately withholding information about the invasion: most of the news reports are speculative and haphazardly disseminated, allowing the audience to identify and share a sense of dread that lingers long after it's over. Unlike `The Sixth Sense' there's a droll humor that sneaks up on you (a scene involving a teenager's spontaneous confession delightfully tricks you into laughing when you least expect to) and it gives the film a reassuring warmth that helps keep everything centered. Shyamalan seems to realize his limitations as a thinker--he doesn't pretend to be profound--but he does treat his audience with respect and invests his film with an intelligence and wit that's perfect for a studio feature. A very satisfying experience, not easily forgotten or dismissed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The newest film in the legacy of M. Night Shyamalan, SIGNS manages to pull off some very effective creepiness in the very beginning and also holds your interesting throughout the course of the film. Mel Gibson is great, aswell as Joaquin Phoenix. The film was very creepy and contains steadily mounting terror. Vaguely similar to Mark Pellington's THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES, the film keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end.The film is scary and in some cases, disturbing. The aliens are very well designed. The film actually surprised me. I was not expecting Shyamalan to stick with the story so very closely throughout the entire film almost. With his earlier works, THE SIXTH SENSE and UNBREAKABLE, he focuses on the relationships between family members very closely to create a lot of drama that has a payoff. But, most of this film is taken up by fast-moving situations that involve alien activity and crop circles. My only complaint, and I mean 'only', is that the film tries way too hard to be funny. It tries much harder than Shyamalan's earlier works and is the type of humor that is not 'laugh-out-loud', but it is funny because you were not expecting it in a sci-fi suspense thriller. The sequences of the film that are scary, ARE scary. They could have been a little more effectively done, but otherwise, they were very well-crafted. SIGNS is a great movie that will live in movie history forever in both the genres of thriller and sci-fi. SIGNS gets 5/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signs is a moody masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to M Night Shyamalan movies, they are often heavily criticized for being too absurd. And the critics may have a point when it comes to some of the movies, which holds a very low class. But in this case, the critics are absolutely wrong. I can honestly say that "Signs" is one of the greatest Sci-fi movies ever created. The story centers on Graham Hess (Mel Gibson). A former priest whose faith in god has been shattered after his wife died in an accident with a drunk driver. After the accident, his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) moves into the farmhouse where Graham and his two children, Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin), live. Months pass and few things happen that are out of the ordinary until Graham discovers an enormous crop circle in his field. Instantly, Graham and Merrill wonders which gang that may have come around to make a big prank but after they see breaking news about crop circles all over the world, they begin to expect an extra-terrestrial interference. This is the plot of the movie, and just reading it can make you anticipate that it is going to be a very exciting film. And it sure is. "Signs" really shook me and made me discover a whole new kind of suspense. To create a movie that is tense for 106 minutes, you are going to need class actors. And in this case, M Night Shyamalan, does not disappoint. Mel Gibson, two times Oscar winner, is perfect for the role of Graham Hess, and Joaquin Phoenix delivers both tears, hoorays and a couple of laughs. Even the child actors, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin, are very talented and play their rolls in the best way possible. Do this movie have any flaws or plot holes that may lower the rating? Absolutely. There is a plot hole in the movie which makes viewers want to give it a low grade, and even some flaws that excludes the movie from being one of the smartest ever directed. But people have to remember something; M Night Shyamalan does not aim for being the cleverest director with the smartest plots. He aims for something else that is called sheer suspense, and in that field, he is one of the greats. If you want a film that will knock you over, maybe not in the level of intelligence, but in the level of suspense, look no further. Do yourself a favor and buy a big bag of crisps, sit down in the sofa and watch "Signs" and you won't regret it for a single minute. This movie is going to rock you, shock you and especially give you a new experience that you always will carry with you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This a very good movie . Mel Gibson's and Joaquin Phoenix's characters are not over the top and they are like a real family. Mel Gibson gets to try to portray an understated, confused, and emotionally scarred character. Joaquin also gets play a similar character, though he is less inhibited than Mel Gibson. Their calm, sullen personalities contrast with the unbearable situation they find themselves in. Directed by M. Night Shyamalan, this is one of his best movies and a very underrated one at that. I saw this movie when it was released back in 2002 and I was very impressed and I have seen it quite a few times since then. I didn't even know that the cute little Bo was Abigail Breslin until last night when I was reading her acting credits. I like that girl very much and she is immensely talented.Rev. Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is a former priest who has lost his faith after his wife was killed in a freak car accident. Six months later, he discovers a gigantic crop circle in his yard. Similar events begin to happen all over the world. Graham's children, Bo (Abigail Breslin) and Morgan (Rory Culkin) think it is aliens, his brother, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) thinks it's pranksters, and Graham doesn't know what to think. The crop circles cause a media frenzy and test Graham's faith as he journeys to find out the truth behind the crop circles. When the truth is discovered and it turns out his children are right and the aliens have come to take over the planet, it becomes a battle to save his children from the aliens.One of the reasons why this film is hated by some is the idiocy of the aliens. They can make huge crop circles in the middle of the night without anybody noticing, but they can't break down a door and enter into a house!! Even I was surprised, but not angered. It is like in some vampire movies where you have to open the door and invite the vampires in for them to come inside a home. The direction is amazing and Mel, Joaquin and the kids give awesome performances. Mel Gibson's character doesn't have as much dialogue as his kids have. Abigail Breslin is so cute in the movie. She is a attention grabber even when she doesn't have any dialogues and I loved her. Rory Culkin as the son who has asthma is also quite good. The atmosphere is bleak and they are all alone in their home. They do not contact other people much and this is a major factor in the delivery of the movie. Shyamalan is interested more in the human drama within the family, rather than the invasion itself, that is where he is brilliant. All the built up tensions in the family is being thrown right into each other's face due to the impending apocalypse. The reason for the alien invasion and their subsequent running away to their home planet may have come off cheesily, but it didn't. It seemed very realistic that water could be like acid to these creatures. Though the aliens come in only a couple of scenes, the tension is immense and I got scared a couple of times. The climax when Graham tells Merril to swing away is amazing. The aliens could have destroyed Earth by their weapons and all humans could have been extinguished and they could have won. Or humans could have blasted them away from the skies. Why didn't they do that? That was the problem with this movie. Still, it is brilliant if you do not think about that.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as Sixth Sense, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...Still a very good movie. I am a firm believer in the fact that M. Night Shyamalan is a fantastic director who has taken on some very, very bad movies. This was one of the last movies he made before he started to go downhill.While not incredibly scary, this movie still provides a couple jump moments, most of which come in the basement scene.The story itself is set up very nicely. While it is much more predictable than The Sixth Sense, I still loved the way Shyamalan initiates the story, daring the viewer to come and watch. Those crop circles in the corn are pretty ominous. And in addition it has Abigail Breslin, whom I've come to the conclusion is the child version of Cate Blanchett-someone who can play any role they're given, and play it well. And she was like five years old when this was being filmed. I hope Breslin stays around for a long time.And Mel Gibson ain't too bad, himself. Before he got, allegedly, really anti-Semitic, he was a very talented actor. This isn't is best work (I'll reserve that honor for Braveheart), but it is still a decent performance.The thing I enjoyed most about the movie, though, was not the plot, the characters, or the few and far between scares. It was how real of a family the Hesses seemed to be. They are not romanticized in any way. There is anger and tension, but also love and caring. With the trajectory of his career going the way it is, I doubt that Shyamalan will ever again reach the heights he did with The Sixth Sense. This leaves to hope that the highest he might be able to go is back up to the level of Signs. And this is a great movie. Maybe after he finishes the Last Airbender, Shyamalan will return to the reason I, and Im sure a lot of others, love him. For the suspense, the intrigue. He tells a good tale. We can only hope he hasn't forgotten how.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an alien invasion film, it fails. I just couldn't really get on board with the fact that they went into their basement, fell asleep, woke up the next day and it was all over among other things. However, as a character story of a man regaining his faith, it succeeds quite well. I'm not a religious person by any means, but I admired it nonetheless. In some aspects I did really enjoy seeing an epic alien invasion as portrayed through the eyes of a simple family with no huge explosions or battles or anything like that. It made it much more suspenseful and terrifying knowing that if the aliens actually did get to them they wouldn't have a shot of fighting their way out. As Joaquin Phoenix's Merrill says "It's war of the worlds." but instead of epic shots of explosions and alien technology, we see the fear and hopelessness of a single family.I love how slow-burning it was as well. It takes a while to get into the actual invasion, and all of the chaos on the news channels that we see just makes it a very exciting and suspenseful journey. I thought Shyamalan handled that very well. For instance, when Merrill sees the Brazilian video with the brief shot of one of the aliens, it shocked and intrigued myself just as it did him. However in bringing up the aliens, I have to say that they looked pretty ridiculous and just far too fake. It looked like something out of a playstation one game. I also wasn't too impressed by Shyamalan's attempts at humor in the film, aside from Joaquin Phoenix. It felt too cheesy and out of place. Some of the dialogue didn't go over so well with me, but most of it was good enough. Performance-wise, Phoenix is superb and Gibson falls pretty short for the most part. The kids are fine but nothing to write home about, and Shyamalan's brief appearance is laughable just like it is in all of his films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this dreadful waste of film I felt like I had seen it before. After thinking about it for awhile, I realized that it was an almost exact copy of the 60's movie "day of the triffids". sure there are some differences, but if you watch the two together, there are so many similarities that it can't be just a coincidence. In triffids, the aliens are killed by water. same in this one. except for crop circles, and the fact that the aliens are humanoid instead of plants are the only real differences. If Mr. Shamalamadingdong wanted to create a scary film, he could have picked any other decent movie to ripoff instead of an old 60's piece of crap like TRIFFIDS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>just another silly alien flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the summary suggests, there's hardly anything new about Shyamalan's 'Signs'. It started off on a somewhat sort of promising note. I mean if the fear of the unknown just remained that, instead of becoming fear of the alien, then it would have been a far more engaging flick. The actors seemed to perform better until it's known that aliens were attacking. That's when acting becomes overacting or hardly acting (which is the case with Gibson). Why did Shymalan opt for a typical Hollywood flick? Probably just to feed the majority of the younger teen generation with what they find entertaining. After all this might be the break they're looking for from the brainless sex comedies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Story of purpose in life retold in simple but atmospheric way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Contains mild spoilers**Never mind the patchy logic behind the alien invasion. Never mind the laughable way it is portrayed by news networks in the movie. Never mind the rationale of the actions taken by reverend Graham and his family in this emergency situation.All the above mentioned elements of the plot (complete with the isolation of a barn-like home next to a cornfield) are merely nice clichs, familiar for any movie-goer. Can anyone think Shyamalan wants to be original here? No. He just uses these blocks (and in a tongue-in-cheek manner, too!) to create an instant ambiance of suspense and retell a universal story. The story of purpose in life.Human purpose is an underlying theme in all major works by Shyamalan, Unbreakable and Lady In The Water being his most obvious attempts to elaborate on it. Out of these movies, Signs delivers the simplest and most convincing answer.Yes, you do have a purpose in life. Yes, suffering through a major crisis gets you closer to it. (In fact, this may be the only way you ever open up your eyes to see.) And yes, at one point, you will suddenly and unexpectedly understand the master plan.This all is told very simply yet quite powerfully in Signs. And, if you ever get the idea how the whole setting doubles as crooked mirror for cheap pop art (surely easier to realize from a non-American perspective), you are also in for a laughter. Or a grin at least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't go into the clumsiness of the alien theme, the slow pace, the absence of plot, etc, as enough about that has been said already. I do feel dirty after watching this movie though, so I have to say a few unflattering words about it, and its creator. It is now clear to me that the author of this piece, whom I can not, in good conscience, call by name here, is the biggest fraud and hack in the movie industry EVER. Yes, both "The sixth sense" and "Unbreakable" stunk, and this is even worse.The philosophical concept (the pitiful "You see, in this world there are two kinds of people, my friend" speech), that supposedly is the *actual* theme of the movie, is as shallow as it is flawed (or should I say, "as clumsy as it is stupid..."?). The movie make it sound like all skeptics (i.e. the people who concluded that the Earth is actually round), or "HOMO SAPIENS SAPIENS TYPE B" as we are branded here, are altogether nihilistic, immoral, devoid of creativity and imagination, unable to find a purpose in life, and most insulting of all, THE ONES WHO ARE AFRAID OF LIFE? Did it not occur to The Unnamable that it is precisely because of the so-called "fear of loneliness" that people have invented gods, miracles and providence in the first place?It's actually trash like this that makes me consider religion, just so I can believe there is a "place of constant summer" (by his own logic, The Unnamable is destined to go there, as he created this landfill guided by the divine, rather than by his own free will) for people who constantly insult my intelligence, and will sink to any level of self-degradation just to force their idiotic ideas upon the world."The only thing worse than being talked about, is not being talked about" indeed.Even Mel Gibson, who plays the loving father and "Soldier of Jesus, America and Democracy", in movie-after-abysmal-movie, seems to cringe when forced to deliver that "key scene" (at gun point? I can picture The Unnamable standing just out of camera shot with a gun in his hand, waving at poor Mel: "This is my masterpiece! Say it! Say it!"). Other than that, he sleepwalks through the whole thing - even more so than Bruce Willis, in all his dramatic range, in those aforementioned movies.Nobody else seemed to have a consistent personality either. The kids alternated between creepy, cute, lecturing, and indulging in their gimmicks (as opposed to personalities). Joaquin Phoenix' character was superfluous to begin with, he seemed to have been added for the "baseball" scene alone, and looked like a child molester the rest of the movie.And of course there's a dog thrown in there for added melodrama, which I guess makes sense, because this guy is like the Dean R. Koontz of movie making.Insulting, shallow, boring. Flush it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mad Mel's Mrs Dies?Again! (This is not a spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, you'd have to be seriously worried if you were Mel's wife in film. Black men in 1970s action flicks have a more tenacious grip on life. At least they generally cark it at the end of the film, gallantly laying down their lives when victory is at hand so the goody-goody white boy can ride off into the white-only sunset with a tasty bit of crumpet.Mel's wives/girlfriends/love interests rarely make it past the opening credits.Yep, Mad Mel has lost his Mrs and is mean as hell. But this time its god he's p* ssed with. Can even Mad Mel mess with the messiah? Sure he can.Oh, and there are some aliens as well? Ho Hum.Signs is the third of the almost invariably enjoyable M Night Shyamalan films. It is a long way from being his best.This is not, as many have said, because the film contains little in the way of "twist". Last time I checked, many great films had no twist at all and were still great. And Shyamalan's style is far more dependent on building suspense than pulling an unusually coloured rabbit out of the hat at the end of the last real. But such is the joy of Hollywood. Make one film with a great twist, and be forced to repeat it.Shyamalan once again does a great job with suspense. Once again, family is integral to the plot. But the real core of this film is faith. Mel, you see, has a dead Mrs, and he knows who's responsible. Apparently, it's none other than god. Phwewee, somebody's gonna get hurt. Reeeal Bad! Okay, this is mildly diverting for a while. Mystic Mel does a pretty good job of the whole "I'm not wasting another moment of my life on prayer" thing. Possibly the pain of him having to say these lines happily coincided with the pain of the character. Or am I being cynical? Mel can certainly act when he can be bothered, as he frequently showed ? sometime south of 1986.The supporting cast is also superb. Joachim Phoenix is excellent, as are the two kids. Cherry Jones does an excellent job as the benevolent, Fargo-esquire local copper shorn of all the Coenisms.There was some great comedy. Mel walking into his living room to find Joachim and the two kids on the sofa with two boxes of bacofoil on their heads was a fantastic touch. And, dare I say it, Mel's personal leitmotif ? the untimely demise of his better half ? left a genuine lump in my throat.But there are two fundamental problems with the film.The first is the aliens. They just get in the way. Okay, they provide the basis for the suspense. Okay, there are some interesting parallels to be drawn between faith in god and the nutters out looking for aliens in prairie country. And I suppose the fact that the nutters are right in Signs adds some significance to Mel's own character development. But I can't help thinking that it is attempting to juxtapose the essentially frivolous with the deadly serious - and not very well ? The Village does it much better. So, in M Night's film the nutters are right. But we all know (don't we?) that in reality, they're just nutters. So is it an apt metaphor or just all hogwash? The second problem is the finale. I'm biased possibly but to me it just didn't make sense. "The Lord Giveth and the Lord Taketh Away ? seemingly on the basis of his own personal whimsy". I'm not convinced that this is a good basis for the massive character shift undergone by Melvine the Terrible, and you're left with the conclusion that either he's not a very clear thinker at all, or he's been throwing a rather childish tantrum for most of the rest of the film. Neither lend the script credibility.Watch the Village is my recommendation. It's a massively under-estimated film (possibly Shyamalan's best). In many respects it is a half-remake of Signs, and is somehow less? trite.A minor work of a very good filmmaker. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan's Best Film To Date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan has a knack for making some really good movies and some really bad movies. Although "The Sixth Sense" was a very entertaining thriller, M. Night Shyamalan's "Signs" is overall a better film, and it could be one of the best alien films of all time.Graham Hess lives with his two children and his brother on a farm in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. As if losing his wife in a car accident wasn't enough devastation for his family, they are told that the strange formations being found in their crop circles are the work of aliens, looking to invade our planet. Although skeptical at first, Graham slowly figures out that the world really is being invaded, and that he and his family could very well be near their deaths....The film wastes no time in getting the story started. Less than five minutes into the movie, the crop circles are already there and the authorities are notified. Yet the film still manages to spend enough time with the characters for us to get to know them well and for us to really care about them. Shymalan proves that he is a master at keeping the tension going throughout the whole film, even when its pitch-black or dead-silent. He even manages to add in some pretty funny moments to the film. The acting is generally well-done, from Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix to even the child actors.Some people are not going to like the film's ending, for whatever reason. Some may not like the fact that we actually get to see the aliens at point-blank range, while others may not like the aliens' weakness. I feel a little bit of both, but they're very minor things when looking at the film as a whole."Signs" is probably the best alien film I have ever seen (apart from "Men In Black"), and is so close to being a four-star film in my book. Its one of the few films I have ever seen (probably the only one) that has actually terrified me just because of its realism. Everything about it is just that close to perfection. Its not an alien movie just for science-fiction fans, its a high-stakes drama for anyone.Rating: ***1/2 P.S. When the newscaster on the television says that the footage may be disturbing, believe her.</fullReview>

The build-up was reasonable, but i was expecting some sort of twist to the plot other than the aliens were here to annoy local farmers!! I found the concept that these aliens had travelled light years to get to Earth to then wander around a farmhouse being 'menacing' unbelievable to the extreme. Why travel all that way to get locked in a cupboard and not be able to escape?People, do not watch this film if you value your time and sanity, it's a pointless waste of celluloid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie should be rated TB (for True Believers only). Sorry if I hurt a few feelings here, but frankly my atheist perception of this movie was it being an incredibly feeble, childish collection of wistful thoughts about divine power. The story sacrificed about everything that makes IMHO a watchable movie on the altar of this unique goal.I guess a true believer will deem unimportant the blatant psychological inconsistencies riddling the script. I don't even feel like elaborating on the main character's struggles with faith: the lowest grade of basic emotional tricks you find in about half the movies shot since the invention of cinema, only very poorly used and with the subtlety of an elephant in a china store. Even the poor dog seems unable to maintain even a roughly credible behavior. His turning against the children must have been caused by alien poisoning - a metaphor for being possessed by the Demon, no doubt.As we say in France, this movie is only preaching the already converted. Frankly, why go and fetch aliens to put forth the fact that having a child with a bad asthma and another obsessed with decorating the house with half-filled water glasses was all manifestations of divine wisdom? That seemed incredibly contrived, irrelevant, pointless. It left me wondering what pains the director went through to come up with something a major would buy:- hey guys, I got a script all about faith and predestination. We should win about 90% of the baptist audience with that. Plus all the clichs on the ideal white American family getting together to overcome the ordeals of life, that should grab a solid share of the corn- and bible belt. Not counting the Gibson right wing fan base. Now will you buy that? - not good enough - what if I throw in some aliens? What if they melt in water and spit poison from their wrists and get their fingers cut with cooking knifes, mmm? - Mmm... That should scrape enough little kids, X-files nostalgics and nerds plus a couple of UFO freaks to round the profit margin. OK, that's a deal!Dear oh dear, what a world we are living in...P.S: and just to prevent misunderstandings with the Shyamalan zealots, I got the "it was all just a dream" thing. Not an excuse to throw pretentious and inconsistent acting, plot and psychology in our faces for 2 hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2/3 of the movie is worthless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has it's charm, and certainly has some suspenseful moments. However, without giving anything away, it falls very short in the reality department. I accept that with Sci-Fi movies set way in the future, but this movie tries to make certain things seem plausible, yet no one would deal with the situation like the main characters would. Upon reflection some reviewers say they saw these flaws, but I'm surprised more didn't see them while watching how absurd the scenario's were. I'll try to give two examples without giving away too much info. At one point the family headed by Mel Gibson determines that the Aliens are going to be hostile. They correctly deduce that based on their location, they will be subject to that hostility, yet decide to stay. Secondly, when the danger is immanent, instead of preparing to defend themselves, Gibson starts relaying stories to his kids about their births. This movie is strong in the beginning, but loses most of it's credibility towards the time you should really be enjoying it. The end is also very weak, but I can't explain it without giving too much away. If you like Mel Gibson, and go in with low expectations, you might enjoy some of this film. Otherwise don't waste your time or money.</fullReview>

OK, I'll allow for the possibility that like many established facts that came before it, there may be exceptions. Crop circles, Aliens can't break into homes, etc, etc ...The one thing that I find really puzzling is that Gibson, a man of faith and religious conviction, didn't have problems with how his character's faith was restored. DID HIS WIFE REALLY HAVE TO DIE FOR HIM TO REALIZE THAT HIS BROTHER COULD CLUNK THE ALIEN OVER THE HEAD?! Could she have simply casually made mention of his ability to swing at a fourth of July picnic? OK, perhaps if she had not died, he wouldn't have ran into the person who killed her, to discuss his amazing insight that the aliens can't handle water... etc, etc ... At the end, faith is left looking more like superstition than before. Clearly, not the intention.</fullReview>

Night himself (all praise be unto him). do not let them confuse you with their logic. the laws of science, character motivation, fundamental storytelling and common sense only apply to filmmmakers who CANT walk on water. Shyamalan is the creator and thus does not need to finish his movies. they are not about what they say they are about , anyway. they are about something else. they will tell you what they are about at the end, and then they aren't even about that. they are about whatever makes us as humans like them, and like them we shall , for we are proud to be sheep in the herd of the master. thank you, M.

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.We have our new Speilberg, and that's a very bad thing indeed.Like Speilberg, this guy knows how to engage us with more or less competent filmschool pacing and supporting imagery. Both shameless exploit children as part of creating a world of simple, Hallmark values. Both mix very subtle craft with blunt, obvious, repeated moralistic messages. At the end, both make you wonder why you watched their film. Was it just to take up that small time?But a clever viewer can see something else going on. In the film world, there are two communities from different worlds. One community is steeped in corn and seeks to only amuse. They don't understand the other community at all, those who seek to enlighten, transport, explore. These `aliens' sometimes raid the cornballs' talent pool. Mel even was tempted and tried to play Hamlet before discovering his true faith. Very clever of Shyamalan to place himself in the film as the unknowing connection between these two worlds. He is able to empower -- quite by accident -- some `signs,' visual power from the artist-aliens. He is even able to capture one and instinctively knows what they don't like: watered down stuff. Then he runs away.Not all of this is a joke. Note how Shyamalan uses the TeeVee to display images of the aliens, all the way until the end when the image of the intruder is reflected in the TeeVee screen.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not very scary, too f***ing obvious really. The aliens were possibly the most stupid bad guys ever. Why are they not wearing suits - on a planet that rains? They come millions of light years and don't even have any weapons, war machines of any kind, nothing. They fight with their fists! I can't suspend my belief that far I'm afraid.The movie built up sooo slowly and then very little happens. It felt like I was watching a long x-files episode with an annoying christian agenda tacked on which I didn't appreciate either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Signs sees Mel Gibson as Graham Hess, a former preacher turned farmer who wakes up one day to find that someone, or something, has carved an intricate pattern of circles and signs into his crops. Turning on the news he discovers that similar symbols are appearing across the globe, prompting fears that the end of the world could be just around the corner. Where one would go bad enough, Graham is trying to raise his two young children while coping with a crippling crisis of faith brought about by his wife's death in a car accident. Paranoia and grief make a dangerous combination, and as further unexplained happenings occur, Hess must take extreme measures to protect his family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Critics of "Signs" abound, but they make the mistake of asking fantasy to meet the criteria of reality, thereby, guaranteeing their disappointment.Many point out the plot holes. Really? What insight! These same cinematic judges probably consider Alfred Hitchcock's films brilliant, even though he notoriously used the unbelievable for the sake of suspense. Hitchcock's masterpiece, "Vertigo", asks the viewer to accept that a man not realize that the "new" woman isn't really the "old" woman whom he'd known intimately, simply because of her different makeup and hairdo. And "The Birds" viciously amassing in Bodega Bay where not one person owns a shotgun certainly makes perfect sense. Luckily, no neighbor noticed Jimmy Stewart's flagrant use of an 18-inch, telescopic lens from his open "Rear Window" to view their comings and goings."Signs" fulfills its objective: Entertain the viewer. Shyamalan M. Night knows how to tell a tall tale. Prepare to feel suspense, humor, fear, reverence, and much more. Check your need of credibility "at the door" and simply enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Shyamalan "not quite what it seems to be" film par excellence, and excellence is indeed on show here. There is a huge matter of import to be conveyed by the film, and every scene from start to finish contributes smoothly and richly to that overall effect, whether it be a subtle or overt one, eccentric, scary, engaging, humorous or deeply moving (and all of these states of mind and emotion are to be found in abundance). Furthermore, every cast member from youngest to oldest seems to display conviction, an unusual and tangible awareness that what they have to do in the film will help add up to something amazing.A taut alien invasion story is told here in minimalist, no-waste fashion, at first hand through the experiences of small-town, Corn Belt America, and more globally through sparing use of the old TV broadcast dodge; but there is also a wider battle for the soul and spirit of the film's chief hero, Graham Hess, portrayed by Mel Gibson. Interestingly, then, it is not the Gibson performance that stands out most (fine though it is), but those of supporting cast Joaquin Phoenix (as Graham's live-in younger brother Merill), Shyamalan himself, Rory Culkin (as the son of the family), and my personal favourite, Cherry Jones as Officer Caroline Paski, who contributes far, far more than her number of lines might suggest.Perhaps it matters little whether we can or cannot accept that the painful, stupid or trivial things all around us might add up to more than the sum of their parts. It is enough that someone is bold enough to produce a piece of true art in which that possibility is taken so fully and so beautifully to its logical limits. It is a fine and wondrous thing to behold.It seems unlikely that anyone who wanted to has yet to see this film, and it is clear that not everybody "sees" it when they see it, as it were. Equally, there may be some people out there still labouring under the misapprehension that this is just sci fi (assuming of course that any sci fi is "just sci fi"). But given how any true science fiction fan will have to regard a plot twist about the alien's unpleasant experiences on Earth as ludicrous, that merely goes to demonstrate that alien invasion is not the film's primary purpose, and that nothing in this world can be quite perfect. Nevertheless, for this reviewer, this in some ways modest offering ought surely to rank as one of history's finest ever films. And yes, I really do mean it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**********SPOILERS BELOW********It's true that the movie doesn't necessarily respect the viewers mind. Sophisticated aliens who can travel between planets decided to come to our beloved earth which is mainly made of water. It turns out that these aliens are vulnerable to the water. This makes you question why would they take the risk and come here? Why come to a planet that will kill you? The purpose of the alien visit is not very clear, maybe they were desperate, maybe there home planet was torn apart by some civil war? In fact you won't think about any of these questions during the movie. The movie has so much thrill it will keep you on the edge of your seat. Few movies manage to get a grip on you. The build up of the events is very suspenseful. The first time I watched it I was a kid and I got scared in some scenes. As I watched it again as an adult I felt the thrill in some scenes. I think what makes the movie a great experience (for me) is not the plot, but how the stories evolve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great thriller, but not your typical alien movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs is a wonderfully crafted movie, going far deeper than I ever remembered it being back when I watched it as a twelve year old. Characters exhibit growth and dynamicism, while the entire film is very diverse with its thrilling and scary scenes, heart-wrenchingly tragic recollections, and pondering conversations. On the surface, it's a film about a man and his kids and brother on a farmhouse coming to terms with the onslaught of an alien invasion. Going deeper, it's a movie about coincidences versus miracles--are you faithful, or are you being reasonable? Countless times throughout the film, situations directly ask this question--was it meant to be? Or was it by chance? Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is an ex-preacher who lost his faith after his wife died in a freak accident. His outlook lays the groundwork for his decisions made throughout the movie.It's amazing how scary a movie can be without even seeing an actual alien. Throughout the movie, the suspense builds up, and then more details are revealed to the viewer, satisfying their anticipation. Then there's the grand finale, so to speak.I believe where this movie shines is in the cinematography, music score, and ambient sounds. Some may say the acting is a little plain, but frankly, I picture their entire situation as shock. Considering that the crop circles began appearing only 6 months after Graham's wife died, the whole family would still not have gotten completely over the original fact--let alone aliens. Shock numbs the emotions.I've seen this movie several times, now, and I always enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far better movie than people or critics give credit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs is one of those movies where you just have to sit back an watch, while not expecting much or looking too far into the plot. This movie has been tagged as a "Mel Gibson movie," or an "Alien Movie." Neither are accurate. Signs is a movie about a man that has lost his faith through some of life's unfortunate turn of events. His family struggles to cope with the loss of their mother and their father's loss of faith. Sometimes when a person loses all faith, it takes some great event or miracle to turn him or her around, and in this case, its aliens. This is, in my opinion, M. Night Shyamalan's best picture to date, and one of the better films made in the last decade. This is not a big budget special effects picture, and if fact, you hardly see the aliens at all. This movie is suspenseful and downright eerie at times, helped along mostly by Howard's wonderful score. Signs is as creepy as your mind will allow it to be, and on top of that is as much a spiritual odyssey as it is an eerie movie you should watch at night with the surround sound up and the lights off. If you haven't seen this movie based on your dislike of other M Night films, do yourself a favor and see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan defence force assemble!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After viewing metacritic (a mistake) and looking and several of the reviews here I am forced into giving my response to the ill gotten hate. This film in no small amounts is absolutely wonderful and totally unique on its own.Lets start with the plot of an ex-clergy man turned farmer Graham living through what seems to be a strange turn of events. Suddenly he finds a crop circle instantaneously appear in his crop with no obvious indication as to the culprits. But those issues are packaged with the family of two small children which he and his brother care for.Graham and his family of course feel the tension of these happenings and old wounds which never healed become salted. But the as a large impending force looms. Graham must evaluate his life. The family look to each other for strength. But still with all those mysterious goings on Graham and many others contemplate deeper matters.The carefully built suspense is artistically used to give everyone including the audience a sense of foreboding. Everyone is hearing from all over of these events that are playing out globally which no one can answer. As these claims escalate it seems a pivotal moment for both the world and such a small family. The genius is of course putting an ordinary family which tries to deal with the global events so extraordinary. It gives the film a very isolated feel especially with such a small core cast. The music is used so sparingly and it uses long pan shots for added effect. The nearby village is scarcely populated by folk so ordinary but some of them seem more clued in then the rest. The exchange of stories leave most the family uncomfortable in their denial.Most of the family members all have their little quirks which they pull of well. Merril acts much the tough guy but looks up to his brother Graham as well as holding some resentment to the road not taken. Bo is a strange girl who seems to know things strangely more accurate than what the adults can fathom. The second kid is the one who resents his father for not listening to him and for his ignorance. All the cast pulls a wonderful performance of a family broken by tragic and yet not distasteful problems like alcohol abuse.The draw towards this family is something but with these turn of events, it feels as though they are coming to a crossroad. The decision may rest on something more than just what they have come to know. Indeed facing the unknown they are fearful and unprepared.Shamalan manages to bring faith into the movie without being condescending about it. Graham puts it perfectly about how people may view such events. Simply there is the viewpoint of faith. The willingness to believe something is far greater than your own comprehension. That doesn't say atheism is wrong in any way either.For a story to tell about a compelling family, a suspenseful thriller and evaluate the intricacies of faith, this movie can only be called excellent.The detractors however question the antics of the alien forces. But the stupidity of it is judging aliens by human logic. To aliens we humans would seem to be completely illogical. Aliens would indeed act in a whole other manner and customs. People seem to hate the symbolic weakness of water and yet for reasons we don't understand perhaps there was something in the water that was effective. I could give a million reasons as to why the aliens acted in that way. To simply call them ridiculous is an ignorant claim.This movie goes for an homage to the alien invasion movies of the bi gone era. Yet like the rest of the movie nothing is as it seems. it was never an invasion but a raid. As the threat passes the world mourns is loss but the family feels safe and whole.People say this film is too similar to his other ones but i feel that is more to do with Shyamlan's style of film making. In terms of themes it couldn't have talked about anything more real and important than family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Using the mystic of Close Encounters, the suspense generating tricks from Jaws, and a skilled crew which includes, (DP Tak Fujimoto, and composer James Newton Howard) M. Night Shyamalan pulls through and delivers his best picture yet. Signs is not pretentious, nor does it intend to show off, or pull anything new. If fact, it feels more like a throwback to the late seventies-early eighties, when Spielberg brought the inhabitants of other worlds to ours. Signs is a slow mover, but it ain't a dull one. When it wants to, it can get inside your head, and when the moment is right, it goes bump. Hopefully this is not one that you will soon forget after viewing.In Bucks County, Pennsylvania, farmer and former reverend Graham Hess, wakes one morning to discover crop circles in his cornfields. Before long, global news is reporting circles all over the planet. As controversy starts to emerge, Hess struggles to hold his family together. They are all still recovering from the death of Mrs. Hess six months back. The signs of terror continue to grow closer and closer, until they arrive at the doorstep. And The family (along with the rest of the world) fights for not only self control, but their lives.Instead of showing the big picture like Close Encounters, Signs is far more subjective. Furthermore, while Spielberg was more keen on showing people's physical reactions to the arrival of something from another world, Shyamalan wants to show the psychological reactions, in particular that of Graham. His loss of faith in God, has turned him into a man with little or not hope, which is something he needs (and we all need) to help us in times of dire trouble. Signs is an example of the right way to form a horror movie. Rather than making us jump every ten minutes with a random shocker, Signs takes its time and relies on the fact that we the viewers don't see the threat even though we know it is there (because we catch a glimpse of it every couple scenes)As superbly crafted as it is, Signs is not without flaw. There are moments which feel highly unbelievable and contrived. for example, I strongly doubt that a TV newscaster would give a rough statement such as "Everything they wrote about in science books is about to chance." Also the manner in which the heroes manage to defeat the threat is not only cheap but it feels like a plot hole. (at least it is the only one).On all other grounds, Signs is near-perfect. It blends drama, sci-fi, and horror, into an evocative little movie which is definitely a big step above Hollywood mainstream.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vastly underrated!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, lets dispense with all this hooey about this movie being a failure...both critically and according to box office receipts. Sure, the reviews weren't as grand as those of M.Nights previous works...but the same could be said of most directors...the George Lucas sagas, Francis Ford Coppola's "Peggy Sue Got Married" as opposed to his "Godfather" movies. Like everything in this big world, success and failure are cyclical. With regards to profits? well, it has made back its investment many times over...can the same be said for "Matrix Revelations?"OK, now to brass taxes: This movie is great for several reason, not the least being that it does what it initially sets about to do...build suspense, create drama, and finally, crescendo and resolve. I suppose if there is a complaint, and this I will freely admit, it is that the plot threads at times take too long to develop. This has been a quibble with many of this directors films. It isn't necessarily a bad thing. With a movie such as "The Sixth Sense" the languid pace accentuated the thrill of discovery. But in "Signs" the slowness of development serves to hinder the overall feel of the film...which is to say that what should have been a very tense last half hour, gets sidetracked with explanation too often. That aside, however, I thought this movie was a near masterpiece of the genre. The web of characters are all drawn convincingly to a very satisfying conclusion. The movie is rich with convincing portrayals and though slow in developing, the plot elements are well thought out. I think that this film suffered from some questionable promotion...and that its audience was perhaps expecting something more fast paced and typically "Hollywood" in presentation. But that's OK, let those who expect the typical grumble about it...I am perfectly content enjoying something that uses style and cunning to build tension rather that an explosion every ten minutes ala Michael Bay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Signs has a definite Hitchcock degree of scope. Characters are well rounded, tension and suspicion are kept to a peak until just the right moment, there is a story within a story and it plays into the hands of the actors. Its a definite watch at night, in the darkest room, blast the volume...not so much horror film but thriller, with horror elements.Signs follows the story of the Hess family. A single father widowed tragically when his wife is killed in a car accident and former priest. He lives with his two kids Bo and Morgan and his younger brother Meryl. the family awake one morning to find a large crop circle in the cornfield of the farm they live on. The young boy Morgan jumps to the conclusion that aliens are the cause, he's a bit of a truth is out there kid, but his ideas are discounted by the family who believe it was the local hooligans playing an elaborate prank but soon these signs start to appear in countries all over the world.the film takes a dramatic tone only really jesting at the idea of this alien invasion theory but tense edge of seat scenes throughout keep the idea fresh and believable. Its a fifties drive through movie in theory but its simple idea leads it to modern sophistication with serious story telling and some tight acting from the leads Gibson and Phoenix. All elements kept this viewer enticed and lead along. its a hard film to walk away from especially mid way through were a terrifying revelationshows up from out of the blue in the form of a news reel showing afamily party ruined by a mysterious creature, which will require a bit of time to come down from.in all honesty its an entertaining film, filled with top shelf acting and suspenseful directorial skill from M.Night. Its a good watch only let down by the odd pacing seen between the first and second halves buy still it really doesn't matter because it really is entertaining in the long run.

		<fullReview>Shyamalan focus's on various aspects of UFO's and Aliens, but Signs also has a great sub- plot which delves into religion, family, and love. Many people accuse this film of being quite boring, but thats due to people thinking its going to be some sort of 'Invasion' action horror which it isn't. The structure and content of the script is very clever, as the narrative cuts to different plot lines. Once again Shyamalan has the power to use various techniques of suspense that produced so very scary scenes. Thumbs up to James Newton Howard who produced the score, it improves the 'fear' element so much.The only thing I didn't like about Signs was the special effects of the water catching the Alien on the shoulder. Its a shame they couldn't make that look a little more realistic. Overall, an awesome film that in my opinion was the best in 2002. (Lets just say its better than the happening).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Signs (2002) Director: M. Night ShyamalanGraham Hess (Mel Gibson) has made an astounding discovery: giant crop circles have mysteriously appeared in his cornfields overnight, and all the evidence suggests that they are extra-terrestrial or aliens in nature. Without warning, these unexplainable signs begin to pop up all over the globe, and the entire world is suddenly faced with a unique event: aliens from another world may be coming, and no one knows their intentions. Hess is an ex-reverend who experiences a huge crisis of faith after the horrific and untimely death of his wife. Living with Hess are three members of his broken family: his younger brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), a failed baseball player who lacks discipline, which kept him out of the major league; his son Morgan (Rory Culkin), a young boy afflicted with health problems; and his daughter Bo (Abigail Breslin), a little girl who is curiously paranoid. When Hess and his kin are confronted with the threat of an alien invasion, the failures and heartbreaks of the family comes to the surface in a volatile mixture of blame, guilt, and anger.Questions of faith, belief, and hope are all raised and explored in what is a thrillingly, terrifying, and satisfying film. Yes, this movie is about aliens, and yes this movie is intense, scary, and all the other great things you may or may not expect out of this type of film. Nevertheless, this movie is also about faith and family. Signs is about finding meaning and hope whatever we might face in life.M. Night Shyamalan is the unthinkable. You can never expect an original film out of him. Either you like his movies or you do not. In any of the films in which he directs he pulls the twist and turn technique. This unique technique should tell you that he is by far out of the ordinary when it comes to directing a movie. You can predict all you want from his films but your prediction will never come out the way you thought it would.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The former Reverend Grahams wife dies and leaves him with two children to care for and as a result, he stops believing in God. As long as he has help from Uncle Merrill, he was doing all right. Then crop circles appeared in his field and after that, a race of aliens started to invade the earth, leaving Graham and his family to fend for their lives. Before they know it, they become prisoners in their own basement, sealed in by the boarded up windows.The movie was creepy, especially the music. The best scene was probably the whole last dinner scene where everyone was eating something different while the aliens were invading. It sounded great and I love these kind of "end of the world" movies. I also liked that it wasn't too religious and yet it made you wonder if you are a person who believes in coincidences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw it recently on TV, here are my thoughts on it.Signs is about Mel Gibson portraying an ex-priest who lives in Pennsylvania with his 2 kids and brother in law. A mysterious crop circle appears in the middle of the corn field.It was too perfectly done for it to be a prank.Mel's character at first thinks it's just done by a group of nerds who have no life or anything better to do.Eventually strange things happen. And more crop circles are shown everywhere in the world. It's said to be an end of the world.This movie isn't too perfect. It just has more suspense and less aliens. You only see an alien for 4 minutes worth in the movie. I dislike movies that don't show you what you want to see. The acting is a little dry. And the story needed some more work. Cause the ending was just blah once you see it you'll know what I mean.I know there's better Mel Gibson movies and "Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind" have much more aliens than this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I mostly like this movie because the terror is presented in a subtle, weighted way. We learn more about the characters than the threat. Obviously, from the beginning, Mel Gibson's character is carrying around some big guilt and big inertia. So when the threats begin, he can't get off the mark (sort of like the guy in The Patriot). As the signs begin to appear, it is up to him to regain his faith and want to move on. The horrible incident with his wife has made him move away from god. What is missing for me is the uncertainty of what the threat is. It's obvious "what" it is but not "why" it is. When the movie concludes, we are left wondering where we will go next. It reminded me a little of Hitchock's "The Birds." Is there more out there and who are they and what do they want? Why are they evil and why did they decide to threaten us. Still, like most of this director's movies, it is beautiful to look at and works on most levels. Gibson is back and forth with me. I never have doubted his acting ability. At times I'm not sure what he wants out of a film.</fullReview>

Many of us have had thoughts about aliens and about them trying to take over the world but this movie is the only one I've seen which also has other people implicated in the story. By this I mean that the action is not based only in the USA and it doesn't end in the USA, a big difference between this movie and the X-Files(for example) or The Faculty(recommended). The movie also presents a whole new reason why the aliens want to take over the world and also uses the crop signs as a very innovative guideline.Also the way they manage to defeat them is very "new" All in all I think the movie is worth the time and the money spent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At the heart of the story, the story is about faith and love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is really about a man's faith and his love for his family when confronted with one crisis after another while in isolation. Mel Gibson's character must deal with a crippling loss and the story is about his recovery from it. Mr. Gibson seemingly invests more of himself in this role than in any previous role he has performed. He appears defenseless as the movie starts and, while he and his family are under severe but subtle attack as the story progresses, the family's strength is entirely based on a reliance on each other and on an unspoken yet unrelenting faith in each other. The Director has shown in this and his other movies that are clearly a product of his vivid and poetic imagination that the theme of the movies he makes, much like the movies prominent New York directors make, are set in the same locale, here Pennsylvania, but always about spiritual and transcendent topics. In "The Sixth Sense" it was a universal and eternal love, while here it is faith under attack and a strength in those we care most about. Outside events, deaths, abandonments, and seeming isolation can destroy faith but the individual can choose in the final analysis to look for faith, to seek faith, and to find it in the searching. Mr. Gibson's character finds what faith he thought had abandoned him and he finds it closer than he ever imagined it. This movie is excellent in following the Gibson character's pilgrimage to a new and stronger belief in himself, in his family and in his faith.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I like about M. Night is how he never compromises his direction and the artistic rendition of the stories he wants to tell. This movie has some flaws and a glaring plot-hole. Why couldn't the aliens at least bring body armor when they knew that much of the earth is covered with water?The first time I saw this, I was really catatonic as Night is an expert in making his motion pictures solicit for the appropriate viewer's response and reaction. He is an expert in anticipation of action. Hitchcock said "The terror lies not in the bang; rather in the anticipation of it".For example, watch the scene where Merril Hess has to check out the house if everything is clear; and then he disappears for a moment. Or the scene in the cornfield where Mel is in the center of a huge crop circle, and the camera has Gibson's POV... anything can jump outta nowhere any second.Second time you watch it, the film loses scare factor but it is still beautiful as Manoj Nelliyatu is always very good in framing his sequences. Watch the beautiful mobile framing when Morgan Hess is holding the baby monitor upward towards the sky. Or the medium close-up of Gibson's face centered in-frame in the final scene inside the living room right before the concluding flashback.This film can NOT be appreciated by people who have intellectual arrogance and those who claim to have "cultured" taste in cinema. But it is very entertaining, the pacing is good. And it's beautiful.The good thing about a movie with a screenplay that's NOT as taut as... The Sixth Sense or Back to the Future is that the helmer's DIRECTION stands out and you really see M. Night display his skill as a director.Great string music by James Newton Howard and I suppose a round of applause should be given to DP Tak Fujimoto (Silence of the Lambs) as well. By the way, the knife that lops the creature's hand is CG, but you didn't know, did you? I hear Night would have wanted no CG in this film, but ILM did a good job too... and that final scene in the living room? It just gets you supercharged.The LAST scene outside is where Newton's enthralling score starts to flex it's muscle and melody but it still remains as the three-note motif you hear throughout the movie. The opening credits, done to Howard's score foreshadows the kind of experience/ or the emotions/ moods/ suspense that you will see in the film.Signs.10/10although no one will agree.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan is my favourite director. All of his films have inspired me to make my own. I absolutely loved Signs as I do, every other one of his films.Signs has a truly fabulous cast: Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, and of course M. Night Shyamalan. The photography in this film is BRILLIANT and the story line BRILLAINT and the acting BRILLIANT all over this is a BRILLIANT film. The only flaw in this movie is that I didn't want it to end, I just loved its powerful ending, as it all wraps together neatly. This film should have been up for Oscars as should, every other one of his films. I loved how Night blends his scripts with JAMES NEWTON HOWARD's powerful scores in every film.

		<fullReview>I Saw the movie. It was pretty good - but just a few comments (some of you budding film directors ought to take notes).The Aliens were too ugly up close - the bad guys have to look cool - these critters looked too much like zombies or cheap horror movie creatures up close - from a distance they were OK - dark and scary and alien but being so disgusting up close ruined the effect..There were a couple of good scenes - good atmosphere, and the movie almost went over to being a war of the worlds type picture - would have made a great serial if the aliens kept at it...(A world ruined..scary aliens rounding people up..)Second the religious aspect was overdone - it's OK to make having faith part of a movie- but the whole religious thing almost made it into another "Prophecy" or "Excorcist" or some other dark corny backward religious-horror flick..Not that I have anything against religion - but religious horror flicks are too dark and somehow uncool I think..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Signs" for me is the best drama/sci-fi film ever. The story concerns a family who lives in a farm, faced with the danger of alien invaders appearing all over the earth. Many scenes have M. Night Shyamalan's ability to increase suspense by making the audience wait as long as possible until something scary happens. Signs is a must-see for Shyamalan fans, sci-fi buffs, and particularly everyone. With a stunning denouement, top-notch acting and some sheer terror, Signs is an instant classic.grade: 10/10MPAA Rating: PG-13My rating: Ages 12 and up (terror, language, violence)</fullReview>

I found "Signs" to be a very good movie with some sad parts and some scary parts. I think the acting was good and the special effects were awesome.In my opinion the scariest part of the movie is when Bo tells her father that there is a monster outside her window. That part freaked me out. I think the saddest part is when Mel Gibson's character is having his last conversation with his wife. I cried during that part.Overall I suggest everyone should see "Signs" because you will really enjoy it. I give "Signs" 9/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of my friends really hate this movie. Some of my friends are dumb. Me, I like this movie, not matter what people say. This is a kind of scary thriller drama made by the same guy that made The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. I don't know how to spell his name so I will just call him the guy? I will try to not give away anything from the movie so let me just say this; Mel Gibson plays a farmer and he lives on that farm with his family. One day there is some strange formations in his crop field, and this is where the story begins. Mr M. Night `something or another' has made a powerful and entertaining movie in `Signs'. The characters are well played and likable. Maybe there is too much drama for some people, but I really think that builds and holds the movie the entire time. So in my opinion, if you like Sixth Sense and Unbreakable you will enjoy this movie. I rate this movie 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler WarningI have seen this movie and I liked it. I find this movie a pioneer in dealing with belief in god -as an orthodox issue- through science fiction -as a relatively modern subject- which is what I liked, and that is what some people missed about this movie as they looked at it as is, they didn't read what is between the lines, they ignored that the science fiction was only a means of discussing the orthodox issue of belief. The title could be seen as signs from god instead of signs from the aliens -as suggested by the poster- Starting from the beginning of the movie till its end M. Night Shyamalan was giving hints that everything happens for a reason, that God doesn't just shuffle events or fates randomly. I think that Shyamalan is trying to prove that all the daily events that we either brag or complain about is only a small part of a bigger thing and somehow I think that this is the key to get a better understanding of this movie and that is what I liked about it. I found Shyamalan was a little bit Cartesian in the process of proving the viability of belief in God.On the other hand, judging this movie on strictly science fiction bases I actually found it hilarious. First of all, the idea of crop signs saying attack or land here or whatever -as suggested by Scary movie 3- is a bit stupid. If I had the technology to travel through the universe would I need landing signs designed on such a "mark your territory" approach? Secondly, the idea of aliens, who by the way can be "erased" by water, invading a planet that is 70% covered by water is amazingly idiotic. Among the things that I also disliked about this movie was the look of the aliens. It was old-fashioned and outdated. As a matter of fact it was the standard issue alien of the 60's brought back to the new millennium, but this could be explained by Shyamalan's vague tendency of unfocusing on the fiction part, rather, making it a means of discussing belief or faith. Finally, I think creating such a controversial movie could be one of the things that contributed to its success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M. Night Shyamalan is a genius!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*-Catch it on TV **-Worth a Rental ***-Buy it Used/On Sale ****-Buy it New/Top Dollar *****-Worthy of a Blind BuyM. Night Shyamalan is a genius storyteller and filmmaker. It is as simply put as that. His third commercial film is his greatest acheivement since Unbreakable. Signs is not an alien invasion movie. It is the story of a man who, after a tragic event, loses his faith in God and, following a worldwide event, regains it. Signs is the type of film that is scary the first time around and fun to watch the second and third. It's fun to see how Night set us up for the climax of the film by including a lot of exposition throughout the rest of it. Shyamalan brings back the atmospheric creepiness from The Sixth Sense and adds quite a bit of comic relief that was absent in his previous work. Mel Gibson's work as Graham Hess, a widowed former reverend and father of two young children, is fantastic. Joaquin Phoenix is very impressive as Graham's younger brother, and former minor league baseball player, Merrill. Abigail Breslin and Rory Culkin are Bo and Morgan Hess in the film. Both children are terrific and, along with Phoenix, provide most of the comic relief.Night's trademark slow pacing is still present in this film although not as much as in The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. The pacing fits the story to a tee and helps create and build the tension towards the true nature of the crop circles in the film. James Newton Howard provides another brilliant score and enhances the experience considerably. His music is not as explosive as it was for me in Unbreakable but it was brilliant nonetheless.Overall this is M. Night Shyamalan's strongest film. I do not consider it the masterpiece that I felt The Sixth Sense was, I was just more drawn to the story this time around. If you are a fan of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, then you will not be disappointed by Signs. It is surely a ***** film and is highly recommended.</fullReview>

If you REALLY watch and listen to the details, you'll understand that there truly ARE signs around all of us each day. Unfortunately, there are few of us who take the time to pay attention to those signs. If you liked the movie the first time, you'll definitely like it better the second, third etc. The entire cast was excellent- even the kids!Night Shyamalan is a genius in his story-telling!

		<shortDescription>Another fascinating genre reinvention from Shyamalan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So far, M. Night Shyamalan and done startlingly unusual takes on ghosts, superheroes, and now aliens. This movie follows a completely different path from other movies of its genre. The movie takes place away from the action, and one only has a vague idea of the overall picture. Almost nothing is shown; at times the movie seems to just be teasing the audience with action that is just out of sight. The movie is full of lovely touches, and the ending is absolutely stunning, as though someone had created an elaborate domino trail that you didn't even know existed until they started falling one by one. As with previous Shyamalan films, this is a thoughtful movie using genre conventions to create something unique. It's probably not quite as effective overall as The Sixth Sense, although the ending is so powerful that it overshadows any weaknesses of the film as a whole. It's far more successful than the interesting but unsatisfactory Unbreakable. Definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful and moving yet strangely unenjoyable movie watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs is a movie that makes you think. What you think the movie is going to be about is deceptive. I watched it just recently and came away confused about my feelings on it. On one hand, this is a powerful and forceful movie. It is very well acted and thought provoking. The cinematography is wonderful considering how low budget it was. However, it is a tough movie to enjoy. I freely admit I did not enjoy Signs at all, in fact I nearly walked out. Yet it wasn't necessarily a bad movie just not for everybody.One possible negative is the atmosphere. I'm big on movies that are atmospheric. With Signs, there is atmosphere from the beginning. Yet from the first five minutes of the movie, what was interesting to me, is that the movie used atmosphere less as a backdrop to the movie itself, rather the atmosphere WAS the movie. The atmosphere didn't quietly sneak up on you, it hurled itself at you full force from the first few minutes. Rippling cornfields. Dogs barking. strange sounds. etc etc. There was no buildup at all, it just came at you right away. One could tell immediately that this movie was gonna be a bit odd.The dialogue had a muted quality that actually went with the story perfectly but made the movie unfortunately a bit tedious. I will say that the first forty minutes of signs were, for me, almost unwatchable. The movie does pick up after that, as the tone is gradually altered and insite is gained into the main characters. But it's a long forty minutes.Signs is a movie that's impossible to pick on because it's impact is so intense toward the end if one succeeds in following it to the end, you won't turn it off untouched. There are certain scenes that will literally take hold of you and I credit Mel Gibson for a lot of that, he was amazing in this.There is a certain scene that I won't give away but he engages in a dialogue with God, the pain and sense of loss his character conveys is Oscar worthy and may leave you a bit shaken-if you get that far.Unfortunately, because of the oddness of the movie and the fact that it's very difficult to get into for a large part of it, it may lose certain people before they have a chance to get swept into it. I watched it with a group of people one of whom walked out and I almost did. At the end I was not sure if I was glad or not to have seen it through.In closing, Signs is a movie Guaranteed to inspire debate-(just look at the varying opinions on this board). It is intense. Gritty. Powerful. And moving. Enjoyable? Not at all. But maybe it wasn't supposed to be, this is not exactly a movie that one could possibly call commercial. Signs is a movie I perhaps respect the heck out of more then like in any way. I simply cannot give it a rating either. If I were rating it on personal enjoyment my rating would be pretty low. If I were rating it on edginess and power it would be much higher. Maybe those intrigued by a movie such as this, who haven't seen it should give it a try and judge for themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense, terrific suspense thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with Alien and The Thing, Signs deserves to be considered one of the scariest alien films of all time. The best thing about Signs is its intensity...this movie builds suspense smoothly and steadily, never letting up for a minute. Unlike many films, there are almost no "filler" scenes here. You're glued to your seat the entire time. Sound and bare glimpses of the aliens are used to great effect. The film feels real, the characters believable. Some don't like the kids, but I think they're both great...although the girl is better than the boy, who is a little too much like the smart little boy in Sixth Sense (a movie I didn't like as well as Signs).The only drawback to Signs is the ending...which I think is a little silly but doesn't ruin an otherwise great film. And yes, Signs does have more than its fair share of haters, just like The Ring (another very scary film), probably due to some people's habit of hating very good films that are also very popular (think Titanic). The only people who could truly hate Signs are people who think movies are supposed to be an intellectual experience rather than an emotional one. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PLOT SPOILER/EXPLANATIONThe whole point of this movie is what kind of person you are. According to Shyamalan there are two kinds of people. It is about which of the two kinds of person *YOU* are. If you see something you can't explain - is it due to some divine intervention, or to mere coincidence? The "coincidence" people live by fear; the "something more" live by hope.So this movie is not about aliens with ray guns who dissintegrate people and mankind fighting back to save the earth from total destruction. (Although there is a hint of that throughout the movie.) You end up having to assess all these events - whether they are crop circles or some such yet unexplained phenomena.The lead character in the movie, Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) makes his decision. His wife died in a horrible accident only later... (see the movie).While the movie is slow (because misleading advertising made it seem like another "War of the Worlds" action adventure movie) it isn't if you buy into the low-budget reality that this Shyamalan attempts here. 8/10.- ZafoidPS: I came to faith not by signs - but by the realization that Christ *IS* real. After trying all other things, and feeling utterly empty, I came to accept Christ in my heart. Ever since then I have been filled by God's Word - His Son - my Lord, Jesus Christ.John 4:13-14 (NIV) To a woman at a well,..."Jesus answered, 'Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.'"Numbers 6:24-26"The LORD bless you and keep you; the LORD make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you; the LORD turn his face toward you and give you peace." ...in Jesus' name, amen.- Z</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan Scores Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan takes on alien invasion in "Signs". But Night's approach takes a very different tack than most invasion flicks such as "Independence Day" by telling his story from the perspective of a rural American family who has somehow has found themselves in the middle of the alien's planning process. You've got to suspend disbelief and not be too analytical about the plot, since an apparent key to the alien's invasion scheme is crop circles. And that is what Graham Hess (Gibson) finds in his backyard cornfield one day. He shares his farmhouse with his son (R. Culkin) and his younger brother (Phoenix). Recently widowed through an auto accident, Graham, previously the town's pastor is now a bitter disbeliever. That is until the aliens show up in the neighborhood.I saw "Signs" at the tail end of its theatrical release and so had read reviews about how the invasion story was not the central theme. Many reviewers posited that the primary story dealt with miracles, coincidence, and the existence of God. That's too deep for me. I found "Signs" a very unique approach to the alien invasion story and was surprised at how creepy the movie actually is. The acting and directing are very good (we expect nothing less from a Shyamalan), the plot, although implausible, carries the viewer through the sometimes terrifying ordeal of a family on the periphery of the biggest event in the history of mankind. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't really understand why people seem to think this movie was so scary. Yeah theres an intensity to certain scenes, and some scenes have a certain atmosphere that adds to the intensity, but all in all theres nothing really jump out of my seat scary. Alien hands all of the sudden popping out from behind grates and underneath doors aren't scary. Dogs barking aren't scary. The only thing mildly scary (meaning that again something adds to a creepy atmosphere) are the aliens speaking. Besides the fact that the movie wasn't scary, I found most of it so well made it held my attention throughout. I liked the little facts that the writer/director shows us about the family and the affects tragedy that they have suffered from affecting them through the movie. I liked Mel Gibson, a stoic tough guy actor in American movies, reluctance to use profanity to scare off prowlers in the night. I like the adults interaction with the children. And the little things the kids do that make them fun to watch. And I especially like the fact that this is an alien invasion movie seen from one perspective, not some Hollywood sized Independence Day style epic with multiple big names phoning in performances whilst doing battle with aliens in what can only be described as scenes that wish they could be from Star Wars. Thats an interesting side to the story that intrigued me, even though it adds to a possible plot hole in the storyline. Throughout the movie there are no scenes of ruined desicated cities are huge alien armies. The only time we really know the aliens are attacking is when they surround the house and we can hear them instead of seeing them. That scene in particular is one the more intense scenes that the film can muster, and truly involve me as a viewer. One more note though, is the fact of faith in the movie. I know its interesting to have someone examining his faith during a time as portrayed, but doe it have to reach the level of sermonizing that it reaches in this particular film. When these scenes occur it really drags down the proccedings and puts a damper on the fun of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film with an intelligent message.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "Sixth Sense" is one of my favorite movies; I was totally blown away by it. This film gave me much of that same feeling. Anyone who has seen an M. Night Shyamalan film, knows that he always has a greater message within his films. He does not make movies about just ghosts or aliens, they always have a purpose. People accepted this in "Sixth Sense," so why not this one? I believe it is because people were expecting a thriller/action movie or just did not understand the film. As I was leaving the theater the day that I seen it, I heard people saying, "That was ok I guess," or "That wasn't very good." These were comments made in an unsure tone and I knew exactly why. Some people just did not pick up certain aspects of this film, they casted them off as unimportant. I have seen the widest range of comments, everything from the worst movie ever to brillant. Some critics got it right, but many did not, and that showed me a lot. If you do not care for this film, then have good reasons. Don't just say that there wasn't enough aliens or the message sucked. If you watch this message in the future, have an open mind and leave the world's sarcastic manner at the door.</fullReview>

This film has aliens in it and I'm not much into alien invasions of the "Communion" or Area 51 type. It has crop circles in it and I don't think they are very interesting either, but this is a great movie spiritually. Spoiler follows: Father Hess has abandon his ministry after the violent accidental death of his wife. He had lost faith in God and is so detached that his children are angry with him. His younger brother who has lived a wild, fun and games life up until the accident has abandon his promising baseball career to come to his brother's aid. The alien invassion is scary and comical at times but it brings this family to terms with their loss and confusion. Mr. Shyamalan has told a great story.</fullReview>

I'm not sure why the aliens didn't wear protective suits. Perhaps they did wear skin-tight suits, not realizing the suits could be harmed by water too. In a movie like this, nearly anything is possible. The movie states that the aliens didn't like water, but maybe the aliens didn't know the water was as harmful as it was to them. NASA may have sent people to the moon, but that doesn't mean the astronauts knew everything about the moon. In fact, the reason the astronauts went was to learn about it.In conclusion, watch SIGNS with an open mind, and you'll probably love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Outstanding and Thoughtful Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Signs" is in my opinion the best film of 2002 and should be strongly considered as Best Picture at this year's Academy Awards. M. Night Shyamalan has provided us with one of the scariest thrillers to come out of Hollywood in a very long time. There is an incredible amount of tension that is built up throughout the movie as well as an interesting subplot that becomes beautifully integrated with the main storyline. What really caught my attention and my admiration about this film is the fact that the story is really about a family. The unusual formations that are found in the family's corn field and the sightings of unexplained phenomenon that follow are all taken more or less from the perspective of Mel Gibson's character, his brother, and his children. Unlike a similar scenario that we see in 1996's Independence Day, Gibson and his family are not out to save the world. As matter of fact, there isn't much they can do about what is happening around them. Shyamalan wisely chooses to keep the setting in a small, farm town community and aside from what the family members view on television, the audience is forced to share in the same unsettling feeling of intense isolation that the characters are faced with. Obviously Shyamalan has studied Mr. Hitchcock very extensively (in particular 1963's The Birds) which is of a great advantage to him. It isn't often that I become truly scared at a movie, but this one tapped into an old formula that will never grow old and should be viewed as a true classic in the years ahead. It's a fantastic movie experience that blends drama with the backdrop a sci/fi horror story. Even the film's message, which becomes very clear at the conclusion, makes perfect sense and is wonderfully optimistic. Emphasizing the importance of this family's faith and love over all else. This is a good one and you owe to yourself to make sure that you see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sci-fi replete with all the elements of a modern classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can you say about faith and Cinema? Its not like the domain is new from the Cinema standpoint. The lilting ring of 'May the force be with you' might justifiably be considered as one of the reasons why Star Wars is STAR WARS. 'The Excorcist' wouldn't be half as good if, in the end, the devil won. Or what about superheroes? Gotham wouldn't have a peaceful night without Batman, because superheroes are but demigods. For decades now, cinema has fashioned its offerings in a way that has perpetually comforted our faith &amp; beliefs &amp; given them a polished second voice. But the question always is how good has the point been driven? If the patterns of a chunk of cinematic offerings are similar, then how exactly do you rate a film from another? That is where the story and the storyteller come into play. M. Night Shyamalan is a gem of a storyteller and Signs is one gem of a film. The genius of Shyamalan gives new identity to the thriller, as he steers clear of conventional generic perceptions. No matter what aspect of Signs you explore, you'd be convinced that Shyamalan belongs right up there with the likes of Spielberg, Kazan, Coppola &amp; Hitchcock.Signs is the story of Father Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) who loses his faith when his wife dies in a freak accident, leaving the task of bringing up their two children to Graham and his younger brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix). Six months later the household wakes up to find mysterious crop circles in their fields. As the family comes to terms with this incident, it gradually becomes apparent that these signs have been made by extra terrestrials and the world is on the brink of alien domination. Apart from battling for the safety of his family Graham experiences a deeper turmoil - Is faith really the solution to his fears?All those who expect the film to be an 'aliens vs mankind' showdown, would be disappointed. Indeed, 'Signs' is not 'Independence Day' revisited in an albeit domestic and scaled down avatar. But that does not stop 'Signs' from being the riveting classic that it is. The film is fulfilling in every aspect of film-making. The performances are top-notch and strong. Mel Gibson, as the widower responsible for two children and a brother, delivers magnificently in a role that couldn't be less in league with his action-hero image. In fact he revels astonishingly in some of the poignant scenes of the film. Joaquin Phoenix follows up his turn in 'Gladiator' with another constrained performance and reveals a genuine comic talent. Once again, Shyamalan extracts remarkable performances from child actors. Rory Culkin is terrific as Morgan and looking at Abigail Breslin, you'd hardly believe that she's 'acting'. The musical score of James Newton Howard goes in perfect sync with the film's moods. Shyamalan's direction retains the edginess he's become famous for, and the pace of the film is unpredictable &amp; never complacent. The camerawork is brilliant as every scene in the film assumes a consistent atmosphere of tension. And even though the anticipation never really kills you, you'd admit that you never really thought that the sound of a dog barking could be this disturbing!All said and done, it is good to see a film that does not struggle under the burden of the topic it addresses. Seeing the story unfold, the concept of quelling fears with faith assumes new importance. The film dwells into everyday territory and offers the same perspective we have, but somehow, due to Shyamalan's direction perhaps, it evokes a new respect for miracles and coincidences as you walk out of the hall. Signs is science-fiction attempted with an approach that is individualistic and perhaps even spiritual. An engaging film that is arguably replete with all the elements of a modern classic. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish &amp; Original...2002's best film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is a film with a very basic plot that has been written and directed in a unique style unlike anything we have ever seen. M. Night Shyamalan is one of the most amazing cinema storytellers, he has grown to become one of my favorite writer/director in recent years. His latest dramatic sci-fi thriller `SIGNS' has proven that Mr. Night can create so much with so little. `SIGNS' tells a basic `alien invasion story', but M. Night is NOT going to show us 20 different flying space ships blowing things up here and there, instead he is going to put us inside a family home with characters that are suffering real emotions to those that the audience can relate to. The suspense is well balanced with the comedic and dramatic side of the story. The most amazing thing about this film is how M. Night has us (the audience) paying attention to every little detail and how we are deeply seeing something when there is nothing to see, the suspense scenes don't reveal the horror right in our faces but rather in our minds. The director leaves a shot long enough for us to imagine the unthinkable by providing sounds of what we can NOT see. `SIGNS' is not a film about crop circles nor aliens; that is just a background to what the real meaning of the plot is, which in an M. NIGHT style it builds up to an answer revealed at the end of the film. This is my #1 film for 2002. And to conclude I recommend seeing this film in theatres since the sound FX's and soundtrack will compliment your viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not meant to be alien film. SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me this is my favorite movie in a very long while. First, I don't see this movie as another INDEPENDENCE DAY or another alien horror movie. I take the position that Shyamalan was trying to bring a story across about what faith is and what it means, and how one man regains his faith through an interesting circumstance. This film was billed as a "crop circle" film which I really loved because I went in thinking I would see another alien suspense movie but was pleasantly surprised to find one of the deepest plots to any movie, as well as one of the most original ideas. I would never have guessed that this movie would be a movie about faith with a majority of the plot set during an alien invasion. The minute amount of special effects used was also well done, because it didn't overwhelm the true story. I think lately many people go to movies just to see how good the effects are and not really caring about the plot (for example,STAR WARS:EPISODE1), well in this movie Shyamalan throws the plot in people's faces, and doesn't rely on special effcts to carry the movie. He also relies on the music and camera techniques to create a genuinely suspenseful thrilling experience (a la Hitchcock). The opening credits themselves were suspenseful with the music, even though they just showed names. Overall I would definitely give this movie a 5 out of 5. And probably the best movie of 2002. (LOTR: Two Towers may turn out to be better, but not by much.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible spoilersThis movie is excellent. I am also going to answer some of the questions that arise. People ask why the aliens come to a planet that is mostly made up of water? Well man goes to places that are filled with diseases that can kill us, so the aliens are pretty much doing the same, we take risks, and so do they. Why do the aliens not use their technology? Simple, if they simply just over powered us so easily then they'd end up gettin nuked, plus they could have also just stopped by to harvest a few million humans for food, fuel, etc. hence they didnt plan on staying and didnt need to break out all their weapons. How did the alien with the chopped off hand know where Father Grahams house was? Perhaps that alien was the one who was at his house nights before, and saw him. After his hand was chopped off he simply just went back and tried to repay him. I gave this EXCELLENT movie a 10 outta 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another corker from Hollywood's new Hitchcock/Spielberg (delete as appropriate)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing you need to know about Signs is that it is not for everybody. Certainly not for those who hated Unbreakable. The slow, measured pacing, the lack of real "action", the dialogue-heavy character scenes - all are present and correct in Shyamalan's latest. And why not? Personally I found Unbreakable to be an understated, underrated cult classic, and I see absolutely no reason why Signs should not be elevated to such status.The second thing you need to know about Signs is...nothing else! Seriously, this particular cinematic dish is best served cold - the less you know, the better. One of the greatest pleasures in cinema is going to see a film not knowing quite where it will take you - something which, in these days of plot-spoiling trailers, is all too rare, and something which that sly trickster Shyamalan is all too keen to play on.Any pre-conceived ideas anyone may have about Signs will probably be blown away by the time the film reaches its final act, which, despite what some critics may say, is just as thrilling as the first two thirds. During the hour and forty five minutes I was in the cinema, I did not take my eyes off the screen ONCE, I laughed several times, and jumped just as much. The sheer gut-wrenching tension made me grasp my arm rest, and the emotion made the hairs stand up on the back of my neck on more than one occasion. I really don't expect much more from a film than that.Onto the acting then, and the performances, without exception, are superb - Shyamalan again drawing winning displays from the two young children. Phoenix proves what a tremendous range he has with a brilliantly subtle performance, whilst Gibson underplays his troubled patriarch beautifully.So, Shyamalan has now made three blockbusters, all of which have been intelligent, exciting, thought-provoking and enjoyable. Shouldn't he get some kind of award for that?*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Please, wake up "horror" fans!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I...um... just saw this film. Let me preface this by saying I wasn't a fan of "The Sixth Sense" for after the first two minutes, I was bored silly. I couldn't get into "Unbreakable" at all. My lovely friends dragged me to this and I gotta say, I wasn't disappointed for I didn't expect much, and I didn't get much. I love horror films that make you wonder, grab you and make you think. Special Effects and make up are nice, but a good frightening film without them are worth their weight in gold. This isn't one of them, for this fan of the genre. Unless you're just getting into "scary" films, or are under 8 and hardly ever saw a scary film, then this is the film for you. I want to be challenged, not treated as if I got a labotomy yesterday. If this film gets any "above the line" Academy Award nominations, then the Academy is rigged. I HATE this "polite horror" trend that seems to be rearing its head in filmmaking these days..or "politically correct horror" as I am labeling it. Come on people, get some guts, again. Demand better.Plus I was really disgusted that this was explained away with the subliminal message of "religion" is the only truth. I am a big fan of Religiously themed pictures as well and this makes me want to slap the face of the writer, this is so shallow work. Shame on those who think this is one of the best pictures of the year!!! To me, this ranks up there with "Glitter" which is not all that bad, now I've seen this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My family loved this movie. It wasn't too scary or funny. It had the right mixture of both. Mel Gibson was excellent, as usual, along with the rest of the cast. Mel has a knack for using just the right children for his movies. It's about time a movie didn't depend on profanity or nudity to get through it. This movie actually allowed actors to act and portray emotion. It showed that some actors can still act without ripping off their clothes to show love and passion or show anger or other emotion without spewing profanity and offensive four letter words! (What a concept!) I hope the rest of Hollywood takes the hint and look at the great classics that did the same. Children wouldn't be left out and they could make more money!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****************SPOLERS! ***********************Well, I must admit, it is the first time that I feel like owing an apology to the director of a movie. But, also, I must admit that I think Mr. Shyamalan's incredible ability as a screenwriter this time has carried him a little so far. Why? Well, I thought that Shyamalan had gone just crazy and that he had just creafted, because of ignorance or of excessive ego, the most stupid non-understandable, illogical movie EVER. But I got it! The movie story is a dream that the little girl (or Mel Gibson character himself, I am not clear) is having, and it is childish, not understandable, illogical because of this! we are given so many clues through the movie that I feel incredibly dumb for not having got this by myself (I got it from other people's review). That is also WHY it is so scary: the dream-like inconsistencies, the terrorizing aspects of the end of the world are scary like some dreams were scary when we were child. The director has done just a job so incredible that he has hidden himself behind a underplot that is so subtle that it takes days and days to get it. I believe it is the FIRST time ever that the plot big surprise of a movie story gets you DAYS AFTER YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE. To me, it is an incredible experience.Thank you again, Mr. Shyamalan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally I'm not a fan of Mel Gibson, but I must admit that this was one excellent movie. I did not regret seeing this one at the movie theatre, unlike some of the other releases from this year.We've got a movie that combines two other similar stories: "The Arrival" and "Independence Day." Upon seeing the movie, it is kind of obvious of the similarities with ID4, but it does not go overboard. The movie is not heavily sci-fi nor is it heavy on (unrealistic) action. Signs is in fact a very suspenseful and exciting movie, more of a nail-biter than a rock-em-sock-em type movie.With regards to "The Arrival," we've got some covert activities performed by the aliens.If I had to pick out one of the most unlikely/unbelievable parts of the movie, I would have to consider the lack of government conspiracies. Today's modern myths and legends include government cover-ups, alien autopsies, conspiracies, etc. And it is commonly believed that there must be a core of truth buried beneath myths and legends. So why wasn't the government trying to cover up the crop circles or block media broadcasts?Classic examples include: Roswell, the X-Files (the Mulder years, of course), Men in Black (NOT the movies), etc.SPOILER ALERT...All in all, the movie was excellent, except for the ending. The ending was weak. I guess it goes to show you that our water may not be as pure as we think (to take a different approach than the average reviewer)... If it comes down to a true alien invasion, a superior (technological) race should not be beaten by sticks and water. These guys did not appear to be the tiny, weak, large-headed aliens you see on Stargate SG1.This movie will be added to my collection once it is made available.</fullReview>

I failed at ground level to observe the unwritten law here at the IMDb - "Keep it objective old buddy - don't trash other reviewers!" Well I'm sorry they NEED to be trashed.

Evidence of this contagious lack of awareness is so prevalent from the multiplicity of inane and counter-productive comments here!* Why would an alien civilisation prone to melting in the proximity of H20, opt to gate-crash a planet covered pretty much with water?* What kind of retarded alien technology must they have to be unable to break out of a pantry?* How self-indulgently patriotic, crass even, to have Phoenix belting the bejeezus out of a hapless alien at the end with his all-American baseball bat? (Lets call this THE ARMAGEDDON syndrome?)* Rather too cutesy having Culkin "making it" after all following his mother of all asthma attacks!* How stilted and unrealistic the characters' behaviour appears at times.I could go on!

		<fullReview>Shyamalan has done it again, this time with "Signs", and I consider it to be his best effort. This undertaking proves to be much more entertaining than his other two endeavors, "The Sixth Sense", and "Unbreakable". And although I loved these two films, "Signs" surpasses them immeasurably. The basic plot is that a family living on a farm discover crop circles in their fields, the first of many bizarre occurances. Like a good episode of "The Twilight Zone", the movie keeps the ambiguity flowing dramatically throughout. Mel Gibson is fantastic. The actor plays a man who seems always together, even when fantastic things are happening all around him. Joaquin Phoenix is good too. He is sort of where most of the comic relief comes from in the movie. That is another thing about the movie: it is very funny. Typically, movies that try to be funny AND scary end up being a big mess. "Signs" is genuinely hilarious. But then it will turn around and be absolutely horrifying and sometimes disturbing. It succeeds. Many have complained about the film's religious undertones overwhelming the sci-fi premise. This simply is not true. The two themes go hand-in-hand with eachother as one story. Shyamalan has eased a bit off the artsy camera angles, something I kind of miss. The dialogue and characters are more realistic in "Signs", and therefore makes your feelings for the people much stronger. Howard's music is not very versatile, but he has many variations of the theme and it is very effective and makes the movie even creepier. "Signs" is probably the most pop-culture-friendly Shyamalan movie, but considering how good this one turned out, maybe the other two needed some of that. I loved this movie. Everything about it was lovely and entertaining. Heck, even the kids were excellent! I can't wait for M. Night's next project to crop up! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Spoilers may be included) My mother summed up M. Night films: they're about death in various forms. "The Sixth Sense" was about a dead man who didn't know he was, "Unbreakable" was about a man who couldn't die, and "Signs" is about a man who is spiritually dead.In the latest from M. Night, "Signs", we're faced with a man who has lost his way and finds it again through the signs that he finally sees around him, signs that we all have around us and fail to see. He is forced to see them because of the coming invasion just like we would be if the same thing was happening to us.Because the film focuses on just this one family it makes me, the audience, feel like its happening to me. By cutting out other families and only giving information that it is a worldly invasion via the television, M. Night has shown me what it would be like if it was really occurring. It doesn't matter that the world is being invaded, just my little world - my house, my family - that matters. This film explores that feeling of isolation beautifully.The cast is extraordinary. As with Bruce Willis in M. Night's other films, Mel Gibson has achieved stillness in this film and he gives a riveting performance. Joaquin Phoenix is wonderful as the underachiever, Merrill, who saves the day and the children (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin) steal this picture.Some people have stated that the ending ruins the film. I found it a perfect ending for a magnetic film. All the clues are there from the beginning to the end and they tie up in a great ending as Gibson's character finally understands what all the signs were telling him.So see this film! It is a beautiful piece of work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Signs has to be one of the best movies ever made on extraterrestrial life! If you have ever wondered about life on other planets and believe in aliens, then you'll love this movie! I noticed a lot of bad comments about this movie on the site and was very surprised to read some user comments. This movie was incredible, with some strong acting from Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix, along with some other solid acting from the children in the movie. This movie has you anticipating what will happen next, and it is great as the tension and uncertainty builds up within the viewer as the movie progresses. When we first see an alien on the streets of South America, that particular moment absolutely shocked me (along with the majority of the audience), seeing what appeared to be an alien sneaking around the streets in broad daylight. This movie does a good job with how the aliens look, as they look creepy and strange, yet not as far out there as the aliens in Independence Day or Aliens look. M Night Shyamalan is a cinematic genius. This movie was actually surprisingly funny as well, providing some uplifting moments during some tense parts of the movie. This movie is also quite emotional as well at times, like when Mel and his family are having their "last supper" at their dining room table. The ending is incredible. It startled the hell out of me. What else can I say, this movie has everything that I want in a suspenseful thriller. M Night Shyamalan again has made another hit movie in Signs. I watched this movie twice because it captivated me so much. So to all of you who keep giving this bad movie reviews, stop analyzing every detail of the movie and think about the overall effect that the movie had on you.</fullReview>

Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix make a great pair as two brothers trying to fight off the aliens and Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin as Gibson's kids play incredibly mature roles.

I like the way the director intricately tied everything together. I do have to commend this cast and crew for going through with this film after what happened to our nation (filming was to begin Sept. 12).

		<fullReview>I have been reading some of the user comments on this movie and I think when some of you dismiss this story's plot as "corny" or "underdeveloped" you may have not noticed the method in this madness. The "corny" plot is only a tool that sets the stage for the real message. Bottom line, "there are no coincidences...our miseries aren't for nothing." Had this movie portrayed a straight and superficial, "good guy; bad guy" plot, it would be justifiable to say that it was junk. In this case, however, the most obvious beginning plot took a back seat while the more subtle plot slowly strengthened and became the foreground. The commercialized plot becomes secondary and the audience finds themselves more enthralled with the suspense of the main character's inner conflicts than his outward. It is a great movie for those more inclined to the psychological. If nothing else this movie is about faith and having it even in the gravest of times. The director is a great story teller and has even given this movie a Blair Witch effect: What you DON'T see terrifies more than what you do. Then, he courteously brings us for an up close look when he is satisfied that the fear factor has been stretched to the max but doesn't leave us in boredom for a second as he brings together pieces of the background into one for a most exciting ending that will have you talking about it well after its over. 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, regardless...!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly liked 'Signs', regardless of all the "contrived" parts and "plot holes", all of which were things I truly didn't notice when I was watching it. (It is in my personal opinion that everyone who reviewed it saying those things is either desensitized or overanalyzing.) True, I was not really *scared* by any part of the movie -- certainly on edge.. think the part where Graham (Gibson) drops the flashlight in the cornfield in the dark, which the previews built me up for, or that dog bark -- and I don't think there were enough leap-out-of-your-seat-and-scream-bloody-murder parts, like in 'The Haunting', another movie that aims to scare using the unseen. But despite that, I still really liked 'Signs'. As another reviewer pointed out, M. Night Shyamalan (whom, you must admit, really knows what he's doing) chose to center the movie more around the concept of faith rather than extraterrestrials.. faith in fate and divine intervention, in the idea that maybe coincidence isn't just mere coincidence. This was an original way to go about a sci-fi movie that I certainly appreciated.Mel Gibson gives a subdued, textured performance tinged with subtle comedic moments that I like, although sometimes it seems as if he is going on autopilot. The child actors, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin, underact beautifully. (They were not *lacking emotion*, people. They were lacking tacky Jake Lloyd-in-'The-Phantom-Menace' sitcom-ish exuberance. Be grateful! No -- be IN AWE!)And as for the amazing Joaquin Phoenix. I read this in a previous review, written by a one Bent Brush:" b) Phoenix could not act his way out of a box. His character of the brother is flimsily and under developed. "Firstly, it is not *his* fault that his *character* was "flimsily-" and "underdeveloped".Secondly, where the hell have you been that you think Joaquin Phoenix can't act his way out of a box?He has blown me away with every performance I have seen him give, and his portrayal of Merrill Hess is no exception.All in all, yes, 'Signs' has its flaws. But they're not unredeemable. Overall it's a fantastic experience and trust me, it's worth your money.And I'm not going to make a joke using wordplay with "signs" because... that's lame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was great, I saw it two days ago and I still feel a little creepy. Not many films can do that for me. I love that Shyamalan's films don't jump right out and grab you, no, they require a level of mental engagement and then they slowly crawl under your skin and work their way into your brain. You might not like the deliberate pace of his films, I don't mind it, but if you like well developed characters, well executed ideas and movies that stay with you for days, I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

Despite his loss of faith, however, Gibson still loves his children fiercely and he guards them very closely.Early in the film, Gibson's children discover a series of crop circles in their corn fields, and not long after, the news reports a significant increase in crop-circle sighting all over the world.

		<fullReview>All right. It's not perfect. Mel Gibson is not the actor that Bruce Willis is. Some plot issues are curiously unresolved. Diabetics should be warned about the presence of supersweet child actors. Joaquin Phoenix seems to have mastered one goofy expression for this role and had his face freeze in it. The notion of a faith challenged parson is as trite as it is tedious.NONETHELESS, this film is as good a picture as any of us is likely to see this year. The craft and artistry are nothing short of music for the eye and Shyamalan is fast becoming one of the finest directors presently working out of Hollywood. Don't miss this movie. It is simply superb. Not perfect, just wonderful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People always told me this was M. Night Shyamalan's last good movie before he infamously hit the wall. Though I haven't seen The Last Airbender or After Earth (and probably never will), I consider Signs his worst movie.The acting isn't very good, but the screenplay gives them nothing to work with. None of the characters do or say anything remotely close to actual human behavior, and Shyamalan as a director also fails to salvage this cast.I'm not the first to say it and I rightfully won't be the last, but my God is the twist a slap in the face. It's what pushes this to simply being a bad movie to an offensive movie. It insults my intelligence, and makes me wish I hadn't even watched this piece of garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Signs is a pretty good sci-fi thriller. I haven't been able to watch this movie until now but I kind of knew what would happen because I saw this movie spoofed in 2003's Scary Movie 3. Needless to say, this is a very well-acted film and quite possibly M.Night Shymalan's best film after the Sixth Sense.This is about a former reverend and his family finding a unusual crop circle in the corn crops in their backyard. Now these crop circles are destined to bring the end of the world via alien invasion.As I mentioned before, the acting is superb. Mel Gibson turns in another quality performance, possibly his last. Joaquin Phoenix did a pretty good job as his brother.Overall, this is a solid film. I was creeped out for a good portion of it. And people should back down about the faith of this film. It's pretty insane. I rate this movie 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Film I Watched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great Movie!! But i have a trick. Watched a pirate version who have 45 minutes of extra footage. The studio doesn't read the script, think M. Shalaman - Mel Gibson and see a lot of money. But when the film was over, and see them in private, claims terrorized its about drugs! then they cut the film and find a quick resolve to the movie. What see in the full version? The aliens not come to eat or conquer the earth. they come to the solar system, a place lack of space authorities, to watch a huge "rock concert" in Saturn. maybe a 20 or 50 Millons of attendance. Water only kills them in mass quantity, but in low dosis is like opium for the humans. in the middle of the show some alien says, wow the third planet is full of h2o. OMG really? A then, public, crew and even the artists come desperately to earth. Why are so stupid when they walk on earth? because are so stoned!! never was an a classical mars attack film. remember the scene when Mel and his family gets out of the basement? the tapped windows perforated with strange figures? the aliens are do this because they was in a middle of psychedelic trip. The authorities gone mad, even make a short war against other countries in the confusion, but quickly they admitted all the concealment about ufo's and extraterrestial life forms. lots of aliens dies and people in earth help them with their "drug problem"Jojo its a sarcastic commentary no watch this movie please it's good film but awful and nonsense argument!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Meaningful Pattern or Random Chaos?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is faith (the supreme assertion of human thought) desirable? Then must the mind of man find itself in that troublesome predicament where it ever knows less than it can believe. This supernatural thriller intricately weaves a well-crafted story about one man's journey of faith as he deals with the uncertainties of life and the vicissitudes of existence. And what I personally found to be a refreshing change from other flicks I have seen that have dealt with a similar theme is that this movie is just as entertaining as it is enlightening. It shines a bright flashlight upon the inner roller coaster of faith and yet gently illuminates in a subtle way that I found to be neither preachy or condescending. I also enjoyed the light-hearted moments in this movie well executed by a superb cast of talented actors portraying likable characters blending in just enough humor to balance out some of the more seriously intense scenes of dramatic tension. All in all, there were signs that this was going to be a really good movie from the beginning to the end and I believed them even before I knew for certain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M. Night Shyamalan's best movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the movies that Shyamalan has done, I think Signs is his best movie. The story that he created is brilliant and at times scary. Watching it in theaters scared the hell out of me, I'm not gonna lie.The story of Signs focuses around a Pennsylvanian family who wake up to find a crop circle in their field. They soon find out that crop circles are appearing all over the world. Mel Gibson plays a sad and confused character who lost his wife and is trying to hold his family together. He used to be a priest but hasn't been since the loss of his wife. He begins to lose faith in everything and becomes confused when crop circles begin appearing and weird things start to happen. He played the part really well and really brings this movie together. Joaquin Phoenix also brings his character to the screen.Shyamalan has a way of making movies that most directors don't do. He leaves you thinking at the end of the movie. It's not the kind of movie that has the stranger/killer walking around killing people. The story of Signs leaves you thinking what or who could have caused the crop circles to come together, one of the few things on our planet that people can't figure out. You see the creature at the end of the movie but he doesn't leave enough information to fully understand what's going on and that's what I love about Signs. It makes it that much more suspenseful and scary.I like Shyamalan as a director and I don't mind his movies, such as The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and The Happening but Signs is definitely the best film he's done yet. Signs is probably one of the first films he's done with a score. The score is one of the key elements that brings this movie together. I think it has one of the best movie scores I've heard. Shyamalan wasn't sure if a score would work for Signs but in the end it worked really well and fit brilliantly with the scenes.Signs is a movie I wasn't sure if I would like but turned out I loved it. It's normally the kind of movie I wouldn't get into but Shyamalan added all the elements to make it into a worthwhile movie. It's one of my personal favorites.</fullReview>

Signs is not a gruesome movie or horror movie, but u can say it's a thriller sci-fi movie that suits most thriller and sci-fi lovers.But not only was this movie filled with sci-fi and thriller but also in some parts it's a tearjerker and really moves u emotionally and makes u feel in depth with Mel Gibson's family..Signs 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most people seem to have actually missed the point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading at least 3 pages of reviews saying how awful "Signs" is, I really felt I needed to clarify the actual POINT of this movie. Look at the name of the movie. If you have any concept, or belief, in 'signs', karma, kismit, coincidences - or whatever terminology works for you - then you'll overlook the inconsistencies and appreciate the movie for what it was meant to be. This is, quite simply, a movie that tries to offer an alternative view of what so many people think of as simply random occurrences, a lucky break, divine intervention, or as I said earlier, coincidences - all those 'little things' in life that when they happen, seem to happen for no reason.. until all the pieces of the jigsaw come together in that one moment, and everything you THOUGHT was just a coincidence is explained. If you're a believer in "everything happens for a reason", then you'll appreciate "Signs". If you're not that type of person, then you'll do what many others have done, and look for the inconsistencies (of which, I admit, there are many in "Signs"). Watch this movie and appreciate it for the story BEHIND it, and you'll enjoy it. Watch it expecting the best alien invasion movie ever invented, and not only will you be disappointed, but you'll miss the whole point of the story. Overall, a brilliant movie for those that like to believe that everything in life happens for a reason. Not such a good movie for the skeptics. Enough said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Signs is one of Shymalans best films. But for some reason people didn't understand this film. Which is bulls*it because it is quite easy to understand. It is about loosing faith and then regaining that faith. IT IS NOT MEANT TO BE AN ALIEN INVASION FILM.A lot of people did not like that the Aliens were hurt by water,a nd were complaining: 'Oh, but they cant take over a planet filled with water because water hurts them!'Okay, I have a couple things to say to that. THEY WERE NOT TRYING TO TAKE OVER THE PLANET! If you had listened to the film, you would have found out that they were there for the people, not the planet, dips*its. Even if they were here for the planet it would make sense. If we found a planet that was filled with acid, we would still try to take over.So I get a little angry when people say the Plot Twist was terrible, because it was great.Final review: 8.5 / 10</fullReview>

If you're looking for the only good movie by this director then watch "The Sixth Sense". Now that is a movie worth watching over and over. There was actually no surprise ending whatsoever in Signs. It's basically a highly predictable movie with no story.

		<fullReview>This is definitely one of the best movies that I have seen in years. The dialogue is smart, the camera work is perfect and the information and background setting are divulged to the audience at precisely the right pace and exactly the right moment. Mel Gibson turns in his best performance that I can remember and so does Pheonix, who is extremely funny and plays a very real and well defined character. The movie is coincidently the scariest movie that I can remember seeing in theatres, and the scary moments are guaranteed to haunt you for a few days afterwards at least, but the movie is so much better than that and its so much more than a movie about aliens. As everyone knows from reviews, "Signs" means more than just crop signs, but "signs" are never portrayed in a cheesy way, but in a realistic and honest sense, and capturing such a deep topic without going overboard or making a mockery of it seems very hard these days, so that makes the film all the more impressive. Basically, its just awesome, it really is. Go see it.</fullReview>

Creating the stupid image of aliens being so stupid and mindlessly evil is the main goal of this motion picture, and they succeeded at doing so.

		<fullReview>One of the greatest and most intellectual endings in film history. A typical moviegoers' initial reaction may be dissatisfaction as the film will not deliver the shock and frights expected from the horror genre or the dynamic explosions expected in modern adventure flicks. This film is special, however, because it fits neither of those molds, providing instead a compelling narrative and moral lesson that sustains the film long after its credits roll. Don't get me wrong, there are aliens in this film and some real moments of suspense. But if you come out of this film only concerned about the special effects, then you've missed the point. In the end, this film is less about the grotesque monsters than the internal demons stalking the protagonist and his family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different perspective on the alien invasion plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie shows an alien invasion from the perspective of not those on the front line, but an average family. They are not trying to beat the aliens and save the day, but rather are just simply trying to survive. I think the film works well doing it as well. Though it is also and mainly a movie about faith which it does very well too. Mel Gibson and Phoenix do great jobs as do the children. There are scenes to get the heart pumping and the first time I say it I worried for the family a bit. I enjoyed this one a lot more than "The Sixth Sense" (didn't see "Unbreakable") because it was a lot less dreary and there was a good bit of humor in it as well. There are some parts I had trouble with however, the fact the aliens seemed to be more like zombies or something instead of lasering everyone was a bit unrealistic, but I can overlook that in the fact it is like "Night of the Living Dead" which I also enjoyed anyway.</fullReview>

Contrary, there is very little music, which in my opinion makes it a much more realistic experience. Sure aliens landing on earth may sound corny, but if it were to ever happen, this movie would be a great depiction of how one family might deal with it. And like the movie "Unbreakable", this one also has a special twist at the end, which I won't give away. This is probably one of the best examples of how a movie can be used to build up intensity and anticipation as it goes along until finally the big climax at the end. One could argue that it is kind of slow , without a lot of action going on, but it more than makes up for it in other ways, such as a real plot-line, imagine that! In any case, this is definitely a 5 star movie that is even more fun to watch again with someone who hasn't seen it yet, just to see them jump out of their pants at certain points in the flick. You can't go wrong, especially if you love spooky movies.</fullReview>

One could argue that it is kind of slow , without a lot of action going on, but it more than makes up for it in other ways, such as a real plot-line, imagine that! In any case, this is definitely a 5 star movie that is even more fun to watch again with someone who hasn't seen it yet, just to see them jump out of their pants at certain points in the flick. You can't go wrong, especially if you love spooky movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great intimate science fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was great. I've never seen such a film that looks at global events entirely through the eyes of a single family. You really get a better sense of just how afraid someone can be when their world turns upside down, and in the case of the Hess family, the main characters, it turns upside down again. As with all of Mr. Shyamalan's movies, you end up realizing that you've been watching a different movie than what you thought you were watching when the end arrives, and he always pulls it off with great skill and a different twist. The man clearly loves to tell a good story, and Signs is as good a movie as they make with a great story. The performances are spectacular, even from the kids, and the effects are simple and understated, but they pay off. I won't provide any spoilers here, but the film deals with the possibility of alien invasion and takes off from there into philosophy and faith and a whole bunch of other stuff. A great movie, maybe even the exact opposite of films like Armageddon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie completely blew my mind. I could literally feel the plot lines and threads coming together in my head, it was like a physical sensation. It was certainly helpful that I saw it on DVD so I had the option of going back and seeing what I had missed. I thought this was excellently done. The beginning may seem slow, but the movie plays on the natural human fear of something we can't see. The plot was incredibly original, considering the movie's premise is one of the most worn out alien cliches of our time. I would definitely recommend it, whether you're a fan of scary movies or think that it won't be scary enough. Just stay alert, don't doze off. It's the details that are really amazing.</fullReview>

Joaquin Phoenix and Mel Gibson brought so much into this movie and their acting was great. Abigal Breslin, who played Bo, was just so adorable and Rory Culkin - OMG! His character had asthma I was so happy lol because I have it too...pfff I wish I could've played his character...even though I'm female!!Anways... This movie really did show a great way of showing Faith...which SOME people just rat on how about 75% of the world is water, and yadda yadda yadda.! Well...eeek not the WHOLE world is water..but hey!

		<shortDescription>FANTASTIC TWIST!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fantastic film that gets better the more times you watch it. There are some major misnomers that this movie is about Christianity or Christian faith. This is quite wrong.***WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD***This movie is about one mans philosophy on life and how seemingly unconnected events can influence a persons perspective. Either you believe events are unconnected and don't see the "signs" or you believe there is a reason for everything. Making this connection (and choice) is what the movie is all about. Too many people mistake this film for Religious "propaganda" or are expecting too much about alien invasion. The aliens are the threat (not the story) that makes one man rethink his philosophy on life. In essence, he turns from "the glass is half empty" to "the glass is half full" by realizing the events in his life may have a greater purpose than what they appear on the surface. It has nothing to do with Religious propaganda. The fact that Mel Gibson's character was a priest that lost his faith was only a convenient way to package the idea. It made the "signs" more significant and subsequently had a greater impact on the audience. The guy could have simply been a farmer, janitor, or bus boy, but adding that extra dimension of being a priest to his character made the realization of his philosophy more dramatic upon the films close.This is a fantastic film that has been subject to some rather harsh criticism by those who see it in more shallow terms. It is not a movie about aliens. It is not a movie about religion. It is not a movie about faith. It is a movie about a man who begins to see the positive side to all the negative aspects in his life. This realization helps him triumph and overcome his fears. I would highly recommend this movie for those who enjoy depth of character and story. It is not intended to be "difficult" to figure out. It is only intended to make you think. I give it an 8 1/2 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It really gets up my nose when people beat down what is obviously one of the best and well directed films of 2002. I have already written a positive review of this film but there is one point which is annoying me. This so called 'plot hole' about why the aliens would attack a planet which is 70% water.I'll tell you why. Does anybody know what they are allergic to until they are exposed to it? No. Only upon exposure do you learn that it is harmful, possibly fatal. Therefore, when they do learn that it is fatal to them, they do the rational thing, leave.This movie was frightening, though provoking and above all, very entertaining. Maybe those out there who are reared on 'MTV rubbish' won't appreciate such a well crafted film, but those among us who prefer the film maker to treat the audience with a bit of respect and intelligence will.10/10P.S. Gibson has never been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goosebumps abound!: Skillful, crafty, sly, scary... but ultimately a beautiful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every year there is a point where I (mentally, at least) give up on mainstream American cinema and relegate myself to enjoying classics or smaller budget, obscure, foreign, or indie films. Imagine my surprise when I found myself hooked to the first 3 minutes of this film, and then enjoying it.Back to the film. The film is scary, it's very scary, and it delights in the stuff that scares people and little kids on a day to day basis: reflections, sounds, music, intense paranoia (paranoia is a very big factor in this film). But believe me, the threat of alien invasion is hardly what this film is about. Many scary films these days rely totally on their scare factor, this film made the wise decision not to. It uses what is scary in the film as a tool to hammer in a bigger point about faith and trust and family.Where that may sound as though it's delving into the awfully sappy world of Hallmark Hall of Fame, it's not. The film rather reminded me of The Twilight Zone (though, strangely, Shyamalan does not list that series as a basis or inspiration in the documentary). The film centers around the Hess family who suffered a devastating blow after a rather gruesome tragedy. The portrayal of grief and death and everyone's estrangement is cold and sharp, there's nothing sweet about this movie. The tone of the film has a deadpan humor to it. Everything is stricken and old looking (Graham Hess, Gibson's character, is a preacher, and a lot of his Victorian country farmhouse looks like it's full of hand me downs), except for the muted and lush visuals of the gorgeous countryside. The music (especially at the beginning, which in a theatre was loud and shocking), is deliciously creepy and chilling yet at the same time works for dramatic purposes, kudos to James Newton Howard for such a skillfull piece of work. Tak fujimoto's cinematography milks the fear, bleakness, and sarcasm from the air by the gallons. Bravo! Finally, the fears of the family about the strange occurrences, and their desperation when the super sci-fi situation seemingly gets out of hand, feels very, very real, and keeps you juggling, just like the characters, for a good while as to what is real and what isn't.The actors are the same. They're honest and blunt with their styles. They all gel their performances and characters together to create a world onscreen that becomes realistic, they are realistic. It's a horror movie, it has to be believable. The characters are flawed, with idiosyncrasies, they aren't perfect specimens, they all have something that's wrong with them, physically, mentally, spiritually, they are human after all, yet we still accept them. This really fleshes the movie out and makes it more believable and them more endearing, and ultimately, rewarding. For example: the devestated Graham Hess' interaction with his children is often listless, he worries about them, but often can't express his feelings, so they tend to turn to their uncle for any solace (wonderfully played by Joaquin Phoenix in a rare role for him as the normal, suave, and slightly comedic Merrill Hess, a man who embarrassingly failed at minor league baseball). Cherry Jones turns up in a wonderfully played supporting role as a local police officer and friend of the family's. It's not often that you see someone get so much out of a limited supporting role and give so much back to the benefit of the film as Ms. Jones does with her role. And you remember her character and performance. Kudos to her.This film is unpretentious and sly. Everything about this film works towards the goal, in the end everything fits like a jigsaw puzzle, I can't say much lest I give away any vital plot points, but let me say that it makes you believe it's all about one aspect of the movie, then hits you with a larger theme and message, but you're so wrapped up with the scary part, you forget about the latter. The "big twist" is not supernatural but human. The ending is one of the more ingenious and truly beautiful endings I have seen in years.Like Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, this film craftfully weaves drama with horror. Where I found the other two films applaudable and superbly crafted, I found "Signs" was truly endearing to me. There's something about how it gives you goosebumps during the frightening parts, yet also the human "drama" parts that was different from many a film I've seen. I rarely get goosebumps watching people interacting with each other, most of the time films can be so banal, pretentious, and cliched, human drama loses all effect, but not here. And ultimately, when the scare factor rubs off, the film retains it's rewatchability. It's a fun entertaining movie that was perfect as a summertime hit, yet it's also a stunning, stirring film that wasn't afraid to use unconventional means to get a higher, more profound, message across.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Refreshing Story, Fantastic Movie Overall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film, and would recommend it to others as it combines moments which appeal to a very wide range of audiences. Signs could probably be described as the other side of Independence Day: it doesn't focus on multi-million special effects scenes, and you never actually see any big battle scenes as the action is all on the 'home front' - the beauty is in the way that its told, leaving most of that to your imagination as you get a glimpse of the events unfolding in a realistic fashion. This is a refreshing feature in an alien movie, which normally would follow the genre and include explicit mass conflict, military scenes.The plot would be the only feature of this film that could be considered as slightly dubious. I won't include any spoilers, but the situation seems to be resolved slightly too quickly and I think it would have been nice to have prolonged the action for a little longer. However, Shyamalan builds up the suspense very well and manages to create a very atmospheric screenplay. Perhaps the alien isn't the most original creation, but I don't think this matters too much as the atmosphere around it is built up perfectly.This movie rates very highly for me, I think any plot holes are far compensated for by a well-told story. Star Rating: 4.5 out of 5, Excellent Overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely One Of The Best Movies Of The Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being the sci-fi fan that I am, when they started advertising this movie nine months before it's actual release, I waited with anticipation to see the movie.Crop circles have fascinated me ever since they first started appearing in the news and educational shows.To see someone finally make them the subject of a movie intrigued me even more.I still have yet to figure out why there were a lot of people who didn't like the movie. I don't know, maybe it was a little over their heads or something ?Looking at the movie from a purely sci-fi point of view, I assume that the people who didn't like the movie thought that the alien invasion had to be one of those types where they come in with guns blazing and blowing up everything in site.But who's to say that all alien invasions, if any at all, would ever have to happen that way ? Some alien invasions may happen quietly and from behind the scenes, as this movie implies. We would just have to open our eyes to --- "see the signs".And being the type of person who mixes religion with science (and no, I'm not a Christian Scientist) I enjoyed the duality of the meaning behind the signs throughout the movie.Also, as in "Independence Day", "Alien Nation", "War Of The Worlds" and "E.T. The Extraterrestrial", we get to see in "Signs" that not all aliens are "super beings". That -- yes --- even with all of their technology, they are still as frail as we are when you take all of that technology away. Even the simplest things can bring down a nation or a species.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excellent film from M. Night Shyamalan, once again. He even manages to show us more tricks and twists up his sleeve, although not so pivotal as Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, they are still there to be seen nonetheless.Mel Gibson is excellent in this movie, and you could so have seen Bruce Willis reliving his previous acting roles here. Joaquin Pheonix, whom I've always considered a great actor, shows me just why I thought that in a great supporting role. However, Rory Culkin didn't really hit the mark for me, but that was quickly forgotten.The plot is superb, and although huge in size, Shyamalan has decided to concentrate on a personal side to the story, a small family and how they are affected by strange events. I am going to try hard and say nothing about the story at all, for despite what all will say about there not being spoilers, if someone is telling you something about the film, then it is!I have never heard an audience scream or sigh relief before, not to this degree anyway, and I have not experienced such a feeling of uneasiness and nervousness in a movie for a very long time. By not showing you events, and choosing to concentrate on reactions and noises, you are spooked and on the edge of your seat much more than if you were just shown it.Everything is rounded and tied off perfectly, and there's such a feeling of having experienced a great movie. I find it hard to fault at all, with laughter coming right in the thick of moments of suspense and fear, and not missing a beat of the script, it shows what a great writer and director Shyamalan is. I've said this twice already, and here I go again?I can't wait for his next movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a movie!! Shyamalan scores again with an absolutely riveting thriller. i can totally understand why many people think the ending is disappointing, but for me, this is one of the most poetic, beautiful endings ever. forget the ending though, which by now is the thing that everybody is really looking forward to in a "Night Film".The movie starts chillingly and stays that way right through, the sustained tension, built up eerily in the most beautiful way. the director proving it is not what one sees but the unknown and the unseen that is truly scary. using it to great effect, we hardly get to see any aliens, alien space-ships or anything of that kind for 95% of the movie.the performances are simply brilliant, the kids deserving special mention. manoj shyamalan himself is very convincing in his cursed role.i will not say much about the plot, it is pretty well-known. what i will tell you is .... wait!!*******SPOILERS HEREIN*******Everybody came to the theatres expecting a scary movie. that they get. another thing evreyone expects is a movie about aliens. how shyamalan uses it as a hook to pull the audience into the theatre and tell a beautiful message at the end deserves high praise. forget the bigger issues of whether god really exists, or whether everything was a coincidence (of course Night answers these questions in his own way in the movie, but it is just a story). it is the beauty of the story and how every single element fits in to make these strange coincidences add up to the Big truth of the existence of God is extraordinary. and this coming from an atheist is quite something indeed. an absolute must-watch at least once, and for me a few times to soak in the poetic beauty of it all!!An Exciting, Scary but Beautiful 10!!</fullReview>

I liked him in Gladiator, and I love him in this movie. I also like the fact that Rory Culkin is in this movie. I was a big fan of his brother's when I was younger, and he shows a lot of potential to be a great actor in the future, worthy of starring roles in a few years. The director, M. Night Shyamalan, is my favorite director. I like the fact that he played a sort of cameo as Ray Reddy. He is very good at blending all of the elements of a good scary movie, just as he was in Unbreakable. I can't wait for his next movie.

		<shortDescription>The most intimate invasion movie ever made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Twilight Zone" once had an episode called "The Invaders" set entirely in a farmhouse, with a woman (Agnes Moorehead) battling a pair of tiny aliens; Richard Matheson, who wrote that episode, was not enamoured of the final product, claiming it was too slow and that the aliens looked ridiculous - and they do. Creatures that look like the Michelin Man are nowhere to be found in the thematically similar "Signs," but it does take its time. All to the good, it turns out.Whatever the M in "M. Night Shyamalan" stands for, it clearly isn't "Modest" - he's given himself cameos in both "The Sixth Sense" and "Unbreakable," and for this movie he's upgraded himself to what's practically a supporting role, although a key one. Still, it can be forgiven when the whole thing works as well as this; set in a small Pennsylvania town, disillusioned widowed ex-priest Mel Gibson discovers that his farm has become home to some very elaborate crop circles. At first he and his brother (Joaquin Phoenix) feel it's a prank, but then more start to appear... and I'll let other contributors spoil the plot. Suffice to say there's no twist ending this time, and that in spite of their prominent billing in the opening titles, Industrial Light and Magic visual effects supervisors Eric Brevig and Stefen Fangmeier are ultimately not the film's stars.The movie stays at a regular level for a lot of its length, setting up a perfectly realised world with plenty of well-judged character moments (the son's asthma, the daughter's irrational fear of drinking water, etc) - though there are plenty of intentionally amusing moments (people keep turning to Gibson's character for spiritual guidance even though he's no longer of the cloth), the movie's never allowed to become camp; when Shyamalan starts to turn the screws, the humour drains away but the tension doesn't. Most of what's happening elsewhere is related to us via the family's TV set (just as it would be in real life) and whatever the menace is is kept out of sight most of the time (until the climax, that is) - our hero's first reaction to getting a glimpse of it is to run like hell back to the house! Cowardly? Maybe, but you or I would almost certainly do the same thing...Ultimately, the ability to bring an alien invasion down to human terms, to make it more of an emotional experience than an all-out action yarn a la "Independence Day" is one of the biggest plusses of the movie; the finale may seem absurd to some, but in the context of the laws "Signs" sets itself it's no cop-out. Unlike "The X-Files" it doesn't try and string you along endlessly, instead bringing everything together. It's not all-out horror, but it is endlessly absorbing and pretty scary, bolstered by the director's cast, the restrained special effects, and James Newton Howard's striking score. Though it may not seem like it from the posters, "Signs" is ultimately very spiritual and almost uplifting; it's impossible to elaborate without ruining the movie, but those viewers who find it hard to accept that this world is all there is and that nothing just happens (and I must confess to being among that number) will find this movie very rewarding. This is a movie that hangs around.</fullReview>

They all seem to say "I expected to learn more about crop circles". Give me a break! If you want info about crop circles go watch TLC! This further promotes my view that some movies should forgo the trailers and movie posters to 'protect' these type of people. People see these things and start drooling like some Pavlovian pooch, expecting to know EXACTLY what the movie is going to be about. THAT'S THE POINT! Shyamalan IS the next Spielberg (before he sold out). He has studied such move greats like Hitchcock and paid attention. His use of darkness, sounds, and depth of characters are prime examples of this. He would rather you be scared of what you can imagine in your head, rather than what cool CGI graphic our billion dollar studio can create. This movie is definitely a 10 in my book.

		<fullReview>Signs is a great movie reminiscent of the old way of making a movie, built on suspense, great acting and the single most significant ingredient - FEAR. No computer graphics, no high tech weaponry, no non stop action. Just the slow building and continual hold of fear, and tension through out the entire movie.The formula of Signs relies on the simple fact; that we as individuals fear the unknown.The story is about a farming family who are dealing with the fairly fresh death of a family member. Gibson's Character, Graham "father" Hess has to deal with his own grief, let alone his children's. One morning, he finds the beginning of a Crop Circle, and thus the weirdness and installation of fear begins.Is it Aliens, the local mischief makers or something else entirely?A lot of the movie we go through a cat and mouse approach. You can hear the sounds of whatever is "out there", but you very rarely see what it is, as a whole. In one great scene, the Hess family are trapped in their boarded up house. The camera pans, as if our eyes, looking at the areas where we hear the movements of what is outside the house. And we know there is no where for these people to go, and no one can help them. They are a every day family, there are no weapons for them to use for protection. All they have is each other.The suspense of Signs works because the story is realistic enough to relate to. All the emotions of fear, panic and the instinct to survive, the family go through in their secluded location, is to be expected of anyone in the same circumstance.Mel Gibson is brilliant as the grieving father, once a priest, as he questions his faith. Signs would have to be the best movie I have ever seen Mel Gibson in and I've seen most of his movies!Signs is one of the best suspense movies of recent years. If you decided to see only one movie this year, make it this one. You will not be disappointed. You'll be scared.</fullReview>

Shyamalan did the right thing in not letting the viewer see the aliens and it really builds up the suspense and tension to an unbelievable level. And the story of Mel Gibson losing his faith is handled well also. Shyamalan has always been an excellent writer and in his films the big story has always been nothing more than backdrop to the characters. Like I said, I didn't care for the ending. Like when they figure out what can hurt and kill the aliens. It made no sense. Why that? But, I really enjoyed this film and I can't wait for Shyamalan's next film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly scary film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs follows a family in rural Pennsylvania as they deal with unexplained `crop-circles' in their cornfield and who or what, made them. It would be hard to say too much more about the plot without ruining the experience of seeing it for yourself. So I will simply say that this is one of scariest movies I have ever seen. But, as with M. Night Shyamalan's other movies, it's not necessarily what happens, so much as how it happens. And Signs is no exception.Throughout the entire movie Shyamalan keeps the tension high by using the music, the silence, and the camera angle, and every once in a while throwing in something scary, something to fuel the fear, effectively turning your imagination into the vehicle with which to scare you. He plays the audience like a piano. And does it very well. In one scene he has the audience feeling the deep emotional pain of Graham Hess, only to jump to a scene totally and perfectly terrifying. After the screams subside, we jump to a scene that makes us laugh.Another thing that makes Signs scarier is simply how believable it is. This is greatly achieved through incredible acting and character development. Mel Gibson turns in one of his best performances to date as `Father' Graham Hess, an ex-minister who's recently lost his wife, and is trying to hold all the pieces of his family together. He plays the part so well, after watching the movie for the first time I remarked that I had forgotten that Mel Gibson was even in the movie. In fact, all of the actors, even Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin are so believable in their parts, I nearly forgot I was watching a movie at all.Signs is not your typical scary movie. It doesn't have in-your-face action and special affects. It's not a gore or violence fest. In fact, the plot really isn't that scary. What it is, is a story with deep characters with real feelings, and a subtle terror that creeps up on you, scares the crap out of you and won't let you go for days. I give this movie a perfect 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Read this comment only if you have seen the movie and want a further understanding of its greatness:I feel so bad for M. Night if he is reading all of these comments downplaying the movie because the general audience just did not comprehend it. Here is the big spoiler... the whole thing is a dream. Notice the snow at the beginning and the end that was not a part of the major plot. There were the day/night contrasts popping up everywhere- the moon metal ring hanging from the barn during the day and sun shining the stars in the boards on there way up form the cellar. And the fact that little Bo Hess mentioned that it was a dream at least three times. She says to Mel Gibson "you are in this dream too?" and Mel replies "No, this isn't a..." He was interrupted by the view of the large crop circle in the field that overshadowed this crucial comment and redirected the audience's attention just like they did the entire movie.I give a lot of credit to M. Night for keeping his mouth shut and hiding this hidden plot real well. The twist that everyone says the story was missing came early and was reaffirmed by the snow at then end. M. Night was not going to end the movie with Mel waking up, that would infuriate the audience. Therefore, he showed the dreams outcome instead. I apologize to Mr. Shyamalan for the audience not figuring out this brilliant piece of work, I do now expect after those less savvy IMDB users read this and fully understand the movie they will go back and see the movie in awe of this filmmaking genius and change their votes and their comments. I give Signs at 10/10 and look forward to M. Night's next masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Signs" was excellent! I normally don't watch thrillers since I am scared to death afterwards, (this one was no exception...) but I am so glad I saw this movie. I just loved it! My best friend and I peeked through our hands during most of the more frightening parts, though. LOL! Everyone had excellent performances, especially Rory Culkin (Morgan). I will definitely see more of his movies! He is also a very cute kid, like his older brother, Macaulay. The ending could have been better, it was a little too sappy for me. I enjoyed Shyamalan's other movie -"The Sixth Sense" ending more. It was a thriller, though it had some very humorous moments too. EVERYONE laughed during the part when Graham comes into the living room to find his two children and brother with tin foil hats that looked like big Hershey Kisses to me. LOL! I hope to see this movie again, though not in the theater (I'm broke). I know I will most surely rent it as soon as it comes out on DVD! Overall, "Signs" kicks @$$!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a truly great film. I believe that M. Night Shyamalan will be looked at as one of this period's great auteurs. His films are what they seem in a sense and yet there is always something else that the film is really about. There was a great mixture of suspense and humor in Signs. It is no ordinary invasion film. There is a nice concentration of the psychological aspect which makes this film a great thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been waiting for 6 months to see this movie, and it was well worth the wait! Mel Gibson was fantastic. He had me thinking of what was going to happen next, and he had me worried about what was going on. Joaquin Phoenix was great! While Mel Gibson had me worry Joaquin had me laughing. And that's a good thing to have in a scary movie. A person that makes you laugh when they don't seen like they're trying. I kept jumping every time something scary come on. And Truthfully...I can admit that the night I saw it was I was laying in bed thinking about it and I had to turn on the light because I thought of the creatures and scary things that were in the movie. And I haven't seen a movie that could do that to me in a long time! GO SEE IT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would watch this film all over again just to re-experience the feeling I had in the pit of my stomach. This was the creepiest sci-fi/thriller film (with the possible exception of Se7en) I have ever seen and I have been watching them for 45 years. There are a number of creepy scenes: (1) the claustrophobic scene which takes place in the closet of the Hess home, with the Hess family hunched over the television watching news footage of an alien invader - tres creepy, (2) the scene in which a dark form appears suddenly on the roof of the Hess barn in the camera's peripheral vison -- very creepy, (3) the sheer isolation of the Hess farmhouse -- creepy, (4) the isolation of Father Hess in the vet's home with an alien locked in the pantry -- stomach churning creepy, (5) the alien radio transmission on the baby monitor -- baby-stealing creepy. This film relies upon one device to maintain the thrill: an isolated person surrounded by an unseen dark force that doesn't reveal itself. The trick in making an effective monster/thriller flick - don't show the monster much and keep the special effects to a minimum becuase they're not needed and can be counter-productive. Just compare the original The Haunting to its remake to see this fact. Super super film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not "The Sixth Sense," but a good movie overall.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has been so much buzz around this movie and it's director Night Shyamalan that perhaps I was expecting too much. It's a good movie. Mel Gibson and J. Phoenix are great in their roles. The movie is beautifully filmed and directed, but as the ending credits began to roll I felt there had to be more.Unlike "Unbreakable" and "The Sixth Sense," which dealt with earth-bound topics, "Signs" spends too much time eluding to aliens that we never get to see much of. That worked well during the first half of the movie when you're not sure if the entire thing is a hoax or not; however, by the end of the movie I found myself wishing that I could have seen more of what was going on in the corn field and less of what was going on in Gibson's beautiful Victorian farm house."Signs" is a good movie, worth the price of admission, but if Shyamalan truly is "The Next Spielberg" as Newsweek Magazine proclaims, then he needs to show us what's going on in the corn field and in the sky above Mexico City next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TOTALLY INCREDIBLE!!! Hilarious, heartbreaking, horrifying! Scariest movie I've ever seen!STUNNING CLIMAX! 9 out of 10!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen The Sixth Sense, but I have heard enough about M. Night Shymalan to know he could be the next Spielberg. I have seen Unbreakable and I thought it was terrific. I'm still waiting to see the highly praised Sixth Sense, but I saw Signs (twice already). Signs is the best movie this year in my opinion. Better than Minority Report, Spider-Man, better than K-19 (which are some of my favorites this summer). The movie begins with the appearance of crop circles in former reverend, Graham Hess's (Mel Gibson) farm. His children, Morgan Hess and Bo Hess, are terrified and confused by them and their dogs begin acting strange, as if they sense a predator. They try to shake off the shock of the signs but the children become obsessed with aliens and it soon rubs off onto former baseball star Merill Hess (Joaquin Phoenix), Graham's brother. Six months before the movie opens, Graham's wife died and he's lost all faith in God (just a big part of the movie). From then on you are frightened out of your mind with nerve wracking intense scenes and jump scenes.This movie was the scariest movie I've yet seen. Even scarier than the rather ridiculous "The Exorcist". This movie has the three H's. It's Hilarious, Heartbraking, and Horrifying. The only thing that keeps it from getting a perfect 10 is this: When they actually showed an alien, it didn't scare me. The scene was intense but the aliens aren't that scary. That's just me though. People in the audience were screaming their lungs out. The climax was incredible though.We had a great audience. People cheered when an alien was (spoiler!) getting the Hellen of Troy beat out of it. People were laughing, people were crying, and at the end, their was an applause.Great movie, 9 out of 10.See it or be disappointed you didn't!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little too much corn in those fields?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While not as breathtaking as The Sixth Sense (with its goosebump-inducing-no-matter-how-many-times-I-see-it surprise ending) nor as majestic as Unbreakable (with its unique believe-it-if-you-dare reality), Signs is still an M. Night Shyamalan film, which means it will not bore you, at least. There are great performances as well: Mel Gibson conveys profound sadness with incredible subtlety, Joaquin Phoenix permeates his every scene with complexity, and Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin have no false moves, thanks to Shyamalan's superb direction, particularly with children.So we have a potentially brilliant film that doesn't quite pay off at the end (which in any other filmmaker's hands would most likely have been downright corny). I do, however, appreciate Shyamalan's attempt to depict a very tricky subject - the 'mysterious ways' of divine guidance, the lack of coincidence in events that seemingly appear disconnected, which come together when they're meant to, in order to make what is supposed to happen occur. For that alone, I give him the thumbs-up sign.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic, Subtle, Riveting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all Mr. Shyamalan, I am much too old, mature and jaded a movie-goer to be on the edge of my seat for 90 minutes. How dare you craft a piece of cinema so compelling, in this day and age when we have seen it ALL. How dare you subtlety tone your movie so it's emotional impact is thunderous? How dare you craft a film with real emotional resonance that doesn't use gushing music to cover it's hollowness? How DARE you defy the special effects gurus and show LESS and end up affecting the viewer MORE? How dare you employ the talents of the overlooked Tak Fujimoto as your DP and blow us away with beautiful visuals of relatively mundane things? I DON'T GET SCARED AT MOVIES. THIS MOVIE SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME. If you haven't seen this movie, go get in line, and buy a ticket. It's worth every penny. !!!MAJOR SPOILERS!!! One of the best things about this movie is the way it shows how events affect and reverberate within a family. Parents: It shows how children ARE watching your every move. They understand and absorb far more than you tell them, AND when you wish to keep something hidden, their little antennea extend that much further. This is all under the surface however, as Shyamalan bucks movie conventions by NOT hammering us over the head with his message. He's to smart for that and he doesn't insult our intelligence as an audience.Let's get this out of the way. This movie has an alien invasion in it. The film may even borrow from "War of the Worlds" or others of the genre. But the similarities end in the pitch. Rather, it's about a man's loss of faith, of hope. Ultimately it's about the pressure that loss has on his family. It's about the redemption that is only a leap of faith away for the most hardened atheist. Actually, that isn't strictly true. It's the relationship between a father (God) and his estranged son (Man). M. Night could have slacked off and made a candy coated version. Most directors faced with profit concerns and annoying producers would have had to. He is far too serious an artist to do that. Let's face it...he makes his movies on one level for the many to enjoy and then he makes them on another level for smart people. He creates a tone and stays with it throughout the film. His subtlety isn't reminiscent of early Spielberg (as some have alluded) but more like Hitchcock. The title music could have been written by Lalo Schifrin. I haven't felt such an emotional connection with a main character since "Vertigo". Far too many films are made where one cares little about the fate of the characters, primarily because the characters fit some cookie-cutter role designed for "stars". The realistic use of humor in strange situations threw some reviewers for a loop. Perhaps they are more comfortable with a "tongue-in cheek" Tommy Lee Jones one-liner during a completely unbelievable conflict with aliens in "MIB". That's unfortunate. The humor in this film is the humor of everyday life, the peculiar and amusing incongruencies of people and human interaction.Just see the movie. But please don't talk or put your feet on the seats, because that guy in front of you is me seeing the film again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Signs is clearly the best work I've seen M.Night Shamalan do. The Sixth Sense is overrated and Unbreakable needded more action. But with Signs Shyamlan has made a film where silence and the dark can be the most scary thing one will experience. The cinematography in the film is some of the best I've seen all summer. Shyamlan script is some what a horror film but it goes deeper than that and when you see the film you'll know what I'm talking about. Mel Gibosn and Joaquin Phoenix turn in excllent performances as usual. But it's the child actors Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin who turn stellar performances. Culkin gives a better acting job than his older brother ever did and Breslin is very good in her first role. All in all Signs is a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gibson's Sign.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs (2002): Dir: M. Night Shyamalan / Cast: Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, Cherry Jones, Abigail Breslin: Powerful thriller about direction. The signs themselves can be taken from the physical structure or as a sign of faith. Mel Gibson plays a former Priest who lost his faith when his wife was killed when struck by a truck. He lives with his son and daughter with his brother providing emotional support. He discovers circular patterns matted down their corn field. The media sees it as an alien invasion and Gibson claims that he has seen ominous figures that cause hostility in animals. His son possesses a baby monitor and can somehow read peculiar signals. Exhilarating, intelligent and scary using small details such as the monitor or the girl's half empty glasses of water to make big connections. Directed by M. Night Shyamalan who uses the same ominous appeal that worked in his previous masterpieces The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. Excellent performances by Gibson whose grieving is interrupted by this strange event. Joaquin Phoenix as his brother provides stability and an exciting climatic standoff. Rory Culkin plays his asthmatic son, and Abigail Breslin plays his young daughter. Finally Cherry Jones plays a local cop who has seen Gibson through much tragedy and shows up periodically. Excellent shocker about faith and understanding. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Science Fiction used to make a statement about Faith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this in the Theatre, so my first impressions were from that perspective. I always enjoy movies more when I see them big.I understand why people react to this film, but it's from misconception. Mainly, that this is a science fiction movie. It is, but it is not. I'll get to that in a bit, why the "Science Fiction" aspects are plausible within that genre. The more I watched it the first time I understood that this was a story about a man, a Priest even, who after a lifetime of being a pillar of Faith for his small town- the one person who everyone depended on to bolster their own Faith, has lost his own Faith.This is a Man who hates his God, for the loss of his Wife, maybe other things. He has quit his position as Leader of his local Diocese, but even in that resigned position, his 'constituents' still look up to him. This is shown in one scene as he takes his family into town and is approached to give advice. He is still called "Father", they still confess their sins to him.As a decent man he still gives 'fatherly' advice to whoever asks- It's as if they don't accept that he has quit his church and his God. And his Faith. But old 'habits" die hard, he still will not curse and he still acts as an impromptu confession booth. I must address the misconception that as a Catholic Priest, he "would not be Married". Whoever thinks that, is living in the 1950's, Catholic Priests have been getting Married as far back as the 60's and Rome even made changes in doctrine to allow it. So it was not unbelievable that this man would be a Married Priest with a family- Of course, it is not common, but it is within reality. Actually he could be an Episcopalian Priest, but whether Catholic or Episcopalian, it's believable either way.As far as the fabric of Alien Invasion which underlies this story about Loss of Faith, Crop Circles and Abductions are referred to. What is given are the basic beliefs by Ufologists about what Crop Circles might be, and the two theories about why an Extra Terrestrial would visit Earth: Observation or Hostility. The first half of this film dissects some of those theories, and even refers to the wearing of "Tin Foil Hats", which I thought was a great jab at conspiracy theorists.But these Aliens are shown to have a weakness: Water. So, the question rises up as to why Aliens would invade a Water-based planet. Well, the answer is right in the movie; they are not invading but collecting.As far as the concept that this film is trying to "preach" some kind of specific Christian message, I don't see that. Faith is the same, regardless of religion. I'm not talking about the Christian concept of "Faith vs Works", that's a whole other issue. What is being reflected is basic Faith, all Faith is a working Faith, regardless of what it is applied to, even Science. Basically, you have Faith in a certain thing, and that Faith causes you to follow through in a certain way, because you have expectations based on that Faith.But what is Christian here, is the concept of "Miracles" in the form of "coincidences". When added up, if they hadn't happened that way, then something worse would have been the result.This is something I understand, I think many people do. How many times, after a string of unfortunate events, has it turned out that in the long run, they proved beneficial? For instance, you get held up in Traffic or by any other delay, and something bad had occurred at your destination? Had you been on time, it would have happened to you. The film provides its own fictional examples of this phenomenon, but regardless of the fictional aspects, things like that do happen.I don't think many people initially gleaned this from the film at first viewing, focusing more on this "Water" vulnerability, and of course, if these beings were intent on taking over Earth, it would have been a big mistake for them. But the fact that this is not what they were doing at all only becomes apparent if you watch the whole film through.And of course, this revelation occurs in the film as one of M Night Shyamalan's famous reversals, one that sets the whole Alien Invasion scenario as the thing of secondary importance, showing that the Reverend Graham Hess's return to Faith as the main point- An issue that had been affecting his family and interpersonal relationships. And in that light, my favorite part was when Hess confronts "Ray Reddy" (played by Night himself) as the man who had accidentally killed his wife, it was one of Night's best Hitchcockian "Cameos".I just felt that this film had more positive things to say, it did not show mass destruction and vaporization, which are blatant in films like Independence Day or War of the Worlds (Both versions). But the whole "Invasion" aspect was done as something Subtle, which I myself believe is how it would happen.My review has probably spoiled that for first time viewers, which is why I hope that it is read after viewing. Other than that, this film impacted me because it hits home several key aspects about Faith.It was as if the film were speaking right to me, not just me, but the people I was with, we all agreed on this. So I think anyone who has difficulty with this film may be having a Faith crisis the way Reverend Hess was at the start of the film- And generally, I've found that when we kick against an issue which is being brought up, we are having trouble with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An analysis of the human psyche</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie, I did not particularly liked it, it is not a good 'alien invade earth' kind of movie, there are many flaws in that as many pointed out, technology advanced alien capable of traveling through space would not invade sending virtually unprepared and unequipped troops to the planet, I know people have said that is a tactic to avoid destroying earth in a human conflict, but it does not make sense, there are a lot of technological attacks that would disable the hole earth defense system quickly without need to do it in a guerrilla type of invasion.Anyway someone pointed out that most people did not get the movie, that there were no aliens, that the director intentionally misled the beliefs of the spectators to think in a way, and I thought, maybe it is true, and I saw it again, but there is a strange alien type being in the movie, and there are things on the sky, and signs on the ground of course.So there are aliens, but when I saw it again, I thought maybe the director really misled the spectators, it is really not a good 'alien invades earth' kind of movie, because they are not invading earth, I think they are leaving earth, the aliens are not soldier ground troops, they were already on earth for a long time, somewhere away from humans, that is why they are not good fighters maybe they are just scientists and have just very basic self-defense skills, I am not sure, but they communicate with home with the signs on the fields, like they have been doing for decades, it is just that now they finished whatever they were doing and put up signs so someone comes pick them up. And they do so and go away... there is no major war, in the chaos and fear of humans some of them are killed, but I guess they knew that doing research in an savage planet might have its risks, like any researcher can die on duty going to the middle of the jungle, no big deal really, it is part of the risk of the job.Anyway I think the movie is really more about human faith, what we belief in, how we perceive reality, and how we bend reality to justify what we belief in, how we put meaning in things we don't understand, how humans need to understand and rationalize things they don't really understand what their true nature means.Seeing the movie in this light makes the movie much more enjoyable as an analysis of the human psyche. But even then I wonder if I am not the one rationalizing myself... :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely love this movie. I first saw it when I was young and I must watch it once every four months. It gets better every time I watch it, and I pick up on things. First off, the story sets itself up to be suspenseful, and one wrong turn could have ruined that. But Shyamalan knew better back then. He teases the audience with suspense, showing us something very quickly, or in the corner of our eye. He knows what he's doing, and it works perfectly. The acting in this movie is phenomenal, and many scenes move me to tears every time I watch it. The direction and writing is amazing, there is a couch scene where Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix have a ten minute conversation, and it holds you so deeply. SPOILERS Lots of people who saw this movie didn't like it because they were expecting a horror movie. THIS IS NOT A HORROR MOVIE. This is a moving, emotional, suspense movie that is focused on story, acting, cinematography. This is an amazing movie if you can appreciate those things. It's not an Independence Day movie, and thank gosh for it. This movie focuses on one family and puts you through the emotions and fears that they are feeling. I repeat, an amazing movie all together. Another thing that annoys me is people are always talking about how stupid it was that water killed the aliens. People are always saying, why did the aliens come to earth if it's covered in water? Okay, maybe the aliens had never come into contact with water before and didn't know it could harm them. Or maybe they did know, but earth was the only planet around with the kind of resources they needed. The movie's not about the aliens anyway, it's about a man regaining his faith. Watch this movie with those thoughts in mind and you may have a different response than you did before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike some, I really enjoyed this film.It was midnight when I watched it, in darkness, and it scared, thrilled and entertained me.If you haven't seen it: basically it's about a family of four who find strange patterns in their crops, later to find aliens are coming. But you can guess that in the first few minutes. I don't wish to spoil anything.I've seen Unbreakable, The Happening, Lady in the Water, Sixth Sense, pretty much all of them, and this film does meet the standards, with a good storyline, good characters, and a good atmosphere.It freaked me at some points, but it's only jumpy style horror, no blood or gore or screams on torture, not even implications of that stuff. So it's fine for children.There are holes in the story, involving how the aliens, even though they can build a ship to get to Earth, they're somewhat weak and stupid. And other things. But when you watch, you don't notice it. You don't care that the aliens can be taken down; after all that's happened to the characters it's good that some ass can be kicked.None of the characters bored me, the aliens weren't some pathetic imitation of 1950's' War of the Worlds, nobody's guts were thrown around, it's a good family film. Give it a chance. It's worth every penny. Made me jump twice too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A little corny but I love this movie and will watch it over and over. Probably how I saw the goof that isn't listed in the official list of goofs. When Graham is going down to the basement after everyone else, if you look up behind him, the door or window that is in the background already has the stars and moons etc cut into it. This is supposed to only be shown after it's all over and they all come back up stairs. My favorite part of the movie is when Graham is talking to Bo in the beginning and sees the first alien on the roof top. The music makes that scene great. My second favorite part is when Graham and Merrill are running around the house trying to scare off Lionel Prichard and the Wolfington brothers!!! "I'm insane with anger!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was preparing for a more in--deep review of Signs, but then I fell on the IDBM file of Shyalaman, where I saw that, after the almost uninterrupted string of turkeys he has been serving the public for the last decade, his filmmaker career may be in jeopardy. I hope things won't arrive to that, but in any case this makes my review somewhat different. So, I'll use the occasion to answer some repeated criticism here about the "stupidity" of water--sensitive aliens invading planet Earth.First, we have to understand we don't know much about these invaders. For ex, how do we know those we see here are really their dominant species and not simply their beasts of prey--like hounds?-that they have unleashed on us? Or what if they are the "soldiers" they sacrifice, their first line of attack?--remember what Stalin's generals use to do during WWII, to send "unworthy" soldiers marching into minefields, so they'd open the way there for their best units. Why wouldn't these aliens be doing the same? And what if they are using this first line of dispensable soldiers as Guinea pigs, to see if their bodies are capable of synthesizing the hormones, enzymes that would serve them as antibodies or serums to cure the ill effects of water in their organisms? What I mean by all this is simply that we must not be so quickly to judge, as we are talking about something we know nothing about. (In this case it appears the "experiment" failed, so the invasion). Then we got the question of the very technologically advanced aliens being incapable of opening wooden doors. As social scientists will tell you, there are MANY ways in which a given society may evolve--so you may have people extremely good at technical matters and at the same time retards in other fields. Also some improvements in standard of life provoke atrophies in capabilities, organs, which are less used, or not used at all, as the result. The best ex. is how people starts forgetting how to make ordinary Mathematical operations as they depend more and more on calculators. So, there's nothing incredible in the fact that members of a super-advanced civilization may have forgotten how to open doors.There is also the question of the religious message that Mrs. Shyamalan &amp; Gibson may be trying to convey with their story of faith in God lost and retrieved. I have no problem with that. I'd have no problem even with a movie made by extreme fundamentalists trying to convince me that planet Earth is 4000 years old or that babies are brought by FEDEX. All I ask for in a film is a good story, good acting, decent cinematography and appropriate score. I personally have a Catholic background but as an adult I'm kind of an agnostic--I don't really care if God exists as, if He/She/It exists it must be doing it in a much higher cosmic plane, so why bother believing or not?and any religious message sent in my direction will be met with the most complete indifference. (why to pray to Someone I don't even think about).Now, I can't understand how Shyalaman's career may be now on the skids, when he has shown, at least in the 2 films I've seen of him, that he's a tremendously gifted filmmaker. About Signs, I was completely into it for 92 min. Already that initial shot of the outside, the picnic table, the swing, the corn field, had given me the creeps. (I don't know how he did it, but he can give you the goose bumps out of the most trivial, ordinary scene). It got even better when the camera went into the corridors in the corn field. They looked truly spooky, full of danger at broad daylight; not to mention at night, when submerged in a fine haze (Kubrick's maze in The Shinning is an innocuous sandbox compared to it). But Shyalaman is gifted also in other areas: he can extract superb acting from almost every actor who falls under his command--even if he's not a very good one himself?including two I never imagined capable of doing much more than blowing up things in screen:Willis &amp; Gibson. And yet, in both their respective films they are unforgettable. But the best thing I see Night doing in Signs is the mental manipulation of the audience: Night can make of a simple open door the most unnerving, terrifying, thing--in fact, the most scary scene I've ever seen since Alien (1979) is that of the ghost of the suicidal housewife in TSS; it still gives me the creeps every time I think about it.I have never been a Gibson fan, but I must recognize he's perfect here as the father who has lost his faith because of the tragic death of his wife, who has both hands full raising his two kids and who starts witnessing some very strange things going on in his cornfield. There's something naturally dark, somberly stoic, in his facial expression; something that is always there, and which Shyamalan exploits to the fullest with his repeated close ups. As I have spent my space let's say this film is not about aliens but about people, families, in times of crisis; specially when the disasters keep piling up on them; when they have to hide and cower in cellars, basements because of a very big danger outside while grieving at the same time for the lost of a loved one; exs. The Rwanda genocide; the tornadoes in the U.S.; earthquakes all over, etc. Everyone having lived through such situations knows what this film is all about, not surely aliens. That's why I'd cut that dumb ending out (the fighting alien &amp; the dead--resurrected Morgan) and I'd replace it for a more appropriated one; or I'd simply end it all with Bo's cute "dance in the street" number". Until then, 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish slice of pulp scifi marred slightly by dishonest, but heartfelt, evangelism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In UFO lore, there's a famous case called the Kelly-Hopkinsville Encounter. The incident, which occurred in 1955 and featured numerous witnesses, involved a family farmhouse being menaced by strange lights and inhuman creatures. The incident went on to have a profound effect on UFO lore, and today even septics take the case seriously.While UFO and "invasion movies" were common before 1955 ? most notably the 1953 classic, "Invaders From Mars" - the Kelly-Hopkinsville Encounter helped set in stone the mythology and iconography of future UFO lore. This was a budding folklore defined by isolated farm houses, pick-up trucks, rural folk, spooked dogs, strange lights, bug eyed creatures, dead cattle, odd radar reports, disappearing planes, government conspiracies, men in black, stopped clocks, magnetic disturbances and CIA cover-ups. With the UFO boom of the 80s, spurred by "academics" like Budd Hopkins and Whitley Strieber, came even more motifs added to the mythology: nose bleeds, traumatic abductions, sexual experiments, hypnosis, implants, memory wipes, human clones, poisonous spray, alien impregnation, alien hybrids and tales of whole generations of families being abducted. Aliens were no longer bogeymen, but intergalactic rapists.In the mid 90s, the "X Files" TV series pulled together 60 years worth of UFO mythology, but by the time the series ended, the entire UFO phenomenon was dead and the series, which once promised that "the truth was out there" and that "we all want to believe", itself no longer believed. This reflected a profound cultural change. Man had probed inner and outer space and found nothing. Wonder, imagination and mystery were dead, scientific knowledge, the hyper-connectedness of the network society and the logic of late capitalism, all with their emphasis on order and consistency, confiscating our minds and assassinating our hearts. "Surprise" became redefined as "limited knowledge"; something that could swiftly be rectified.This impasse was predicted by philosophers decades ago. Today, in a way, it's epitomised by Gaspar Noe's "Enter The Void", a systematic reversal of Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey". While Kubrick's film is structured around a series of violent, but ultimately hopeful rebirths, Noe's film journeys through time and space and finds only intoxication, hedonism, drugs, sex and masturbation. Here, man has forgotten about outer space and instead turned hopelessly inwards, until, in a parody of the birth of Kubrick's star child, Noe ends his film with an ejaculating penis and a baby being graphically born...before the whole ugly cycle starts again. Where Kubrick gave us Nietzsche's triumphant bermensch, Noe captures the complete decimation of spirituality and hope; the apathy of Nietzsche's Last Man.So the UFO genre and faith, and by extension spirituality, go hand in hand, and with the collapse of one came the collapse of the other. Indeed, look closer, and many "alien films" are really about spirituality and religion. The 1950s in particular were rife with alien B movies which functioned more as Christian message movies and even the big budget stuff that came later dealt heavily with spirituality. George Pal's "War of the Worlds", for example, was one big Christian love letter, Kubrick's "2001" saw man reaching out for Godhood in the face of Godlessness, Tarkovsky's scifi flicks (not strictly UFO movies) were all about the sublime divine, Spielberg's "Close Encounters" exalted Hollywood special effects as the West's new Deity (it was originally written by Jesus-boy Paul Schrader as a Catholic rites of passage) and even the recent "Knowing" is a thinly disguised Christian allegory.What does all of this have to do with director M. Night Shyamalan "Signs"? Firstly, "Signs" is a modern reinterpretation of the Kelly-Hopkinsville Encounter, an incident which influenced numerous Spielberg films ("Gremlins", "Poltegeist", "Close Encounters", "ET", "War of The Worlds") and paranormal home invasion movies ( "McPearson Tapes" etc).Secondly, "Signs", with its cornfields, tractors, small town sheriffs and farms, is making a conscious effort to not only tap into 1950s UFO iconography, but the genre's early optimism and spiritual hope. Here, actor Mel Gibson plays a priest who has lost his faith and blames God for both the death of his wife and an alien invasion. Gradually, however, Gibson begins to see the "signs" all around him, and realises that all is not chaos, coincidence and violence but predestined and intricately set up by the hands of God.Shyamalan went to Catholic school and Mel Gibson is a psycho Catholic, so the film is unashamedly religious, Shyamalan ending with a shot of a cross, inserting symbolic holy water and much talk of "Middle Eastern countries" - the cradle of Christianity - "repelling the invaders with ancient methods".Shyamalan's first two films ("Praying with Anger" and "Wide Awake") were themselves about young kids trying to find God, and the rest of his filmography likewise deals with issues of faith and religion. What makes his preaching palatable is the way Shyamalan adopts the religious minimalism of directors like Bresson and Dreyer. Shyamalan may make popcorn flicks, but his films have a solemnity which bely their pulpy, "Twilight Zone" origins.Aesthetically, "Signs" is great. Every scene is emphatically slow, Shyamalan's actors speaking with the hushed whispers of Medieval monks. Likewise, his script unfolds deliberately, his camera is intelligent, his Hitchcock inspired score moving and his rejection of SFX refreshing. "Signs" also contains some memorable scenes, like a brilliant "asthma attack" and a climax that is epic despite its small scale. Like Leone and De Palma, he's good at stretching simple sequences out to operatic lengths.The film's message is problematic. On the plus side, it favours a personal or spiritual victory over agitprop populist triumph. On the negative side, Shyamalan is a charlatan and the miracles of "Signs" are tricks carefully placed by a scheming directorial God. The idea that a non-religious parent could be a good parent is outside this movie's purview and Shyamalan is oblivious to the fact that his God is vengeful and torments those who reject him.8.5/10 ? Bad message, good ambiance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this film came out I was stunned by the negative reviews it received. I thought people would have had enough time to figure it out. M. Night Shyamalan's films are never entirely about the "scare factor." There's always another layer, another discussion taking place. This movie is about a man who's lost his faith. It's not about an alien invasion at all. The invasion provides an interesting background, an extraordinary environment of stress and fear that drives the characters. The title Signs is a dual reference to the crop circle and the divine markers that lead Graham back to his faith, allowing him to save his family. The other thing that was overlooked was Shyamalan's superb sense of art. Everything has been carefully crafted, every shot perfectly framed for his purposes. He knows how to manipulate an audience through his choice of camera angles and editing patterns. After all, what's most frightening is what you can't see. What sells the danger is the position and movement of the camera, the sequence of shots, the sound, and the actors' reactions. The other amazing thing is the film's sense of extreme isolation. Almost the entire film takes place at the farm, which places a lot of responsibility on both the actors and the director to keep things fresh and innovative. This film is so underrated, but it does require the patience to think about what you're watching. Pay attention and you'll enjoy it too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all the function of a review I think is to recommend whether one should watch a film, if you want to not have to read the rest of the review then YES, I recommend this film.I read a review today saying that the odd blend of religion and sci-fi is an interesting idea but Night focuses too much on the religious elements than the sci-fi and does not strike the right balance. I would first of all disagree with this statement I think it strikes the right balance of sci-fi and religion, and even if the scales tip in favour of the religious elements, why would that be bad? There are plenty of sci-fi films, the skew on this film towards religion, in my opinion, builds the suspense.I think the themes are interwoven very skillfully the writing is superb, fresh, funny, suspenseful, you get a real sense of danger in this family. What I like most about Night is that he manages to make things real. I genuinely believed the film and I think that is because the film is not about saving the world, its about saving our faiths and beliefs, and about destiny and...signs. It's focused on a family that are going through trouble much like Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, and this makes the story real and the characters more likable.In any case its business as usual from Night, visually its stunning, it has some scary moments, some very funny moments, and in general is very touching. The best bit is when the alien turns out to be Spock...yeah that didn't happen. Watch the film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I found hope in my life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I watched "Signs," the suffering of Episcopalian Father Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) reminded me of Ecclesiastes 8:14. The righteous man got what the wicked deserved. That's why Father Hess couldn't comprehend what went on under the sun (Ecclesiastes 8:17). And he lost his faith when he faced the death of his wife and was attacked by aliens. When he said, "I am not going to spend a second saying prayers," I thought about what faith was. And I asked myself, "What if God doesn't exist?" Despite all my efforts to search for the answer, I know that I can't find the meaning of life (8:17). But I was so glad that Father Hess regained his faith back in the Infinite at the end of the movie. Why was I so glad? I think it is because "anyone who is among the living has hope" (9:4). I found hope in Hess's life. And I found hope in my life.</fullReview>

Also, Mel Gibson is great, and so is t he gladiator guy. THe only bad thing I can say about this film, is the boy (Mel's "son") is damn annoying and is always nagging to the father.

		<shortDescription>Outstanding film-making. Period!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs is a 2002 science fiction thriller film written, produced and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. It was one of the highest grossing movies of that particular year, and garnered critical acclaim worldwide. The film stars Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin. Shayamalan himself also has a small, yet crucial, role in the film.Signs is a more personal take on a worldwide event. The film delves into certain events that really occurred, giving them a science fiction turn (Read: The crop circles which caused a worldwide uproar in the 1970's). Once again, like most Shayamalan movies, Signs is visually terrific! It's edge of the seat value is off the chart. The film has as little plot as possible, and all of its time is concentrated on building up the characters. The fear and the tension it creates is the work of a master film-maker. There are no flashy special effects. It is all Tak Fujimoto's moving photography; and an outstanding background score from Howard Newton Shore, which, without changing its main tune, is both scary and comforting. Straight from the opening credits, Signs is, simply put, a work of art.Whether it is the sudden shot of a figure standing on the rooftop in the darkness, the sound of a dog barking, the sound of the wind, a thump, a reflection - everything is done perfectly in order to create something scarier than any blood-and-guts gore movie you've ever seen. The sequence at the Brazilian kid's Birthday party - I almost ran out of the theatre after seeing it. Like the newscaster puts it, "What you are about to see may disturb you." I cannot put into words how brilliant a movie Signs is.10/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why all the hate? This is brilliant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen Unbreakable yet but after the Sixth Sense and Signs I have to say that M. Night might possibly be the new Hitchcock for thrillers. This film is brilliant and one of my favorite Gibson movies. It's very different from most thrillers. It's not all blood and gore and violence, so maybe that's why some people hate it? I still can't imagine why so many love movies like Saw but hates Signs. Signs is slow paced, yes, but that is what makes is different from the other thrillers. It doesn't show you the aliens right away. It leaves you guessing on what's happening other places, something that Cloeverfield tried to do recently with the monster in the city-but I think kind of failed. M. Nigh succeeds, though, in setting a spooky theme and the ending is great. The acting is superb and the writing is fantastic but the directing is what makes this film special. With any other director, other than Spielberg, this film might have been ruined the visual masterpiece. Seriously people, watch it again if you've already seen it, and try and see it in a new light. This is a brilliant Hollywood thriller. One that they don't make very often and one that is to be treasured.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generally good... until the ending which ruins it a little</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, "Signs" is an okay movie, entertaining enough and has a good level of tension, suspense and thriller, as well as a reasonably dramatic story. But it isn't much more than just an okay piece of entertainment.At my point of view, most of the climax of the movie is during nearly the entire film, because we don't really know how the ET's look like until almost the ending. When the ET's finally appear, it's a major disappointment, because they're so ugly, badly designed and they even look green-like (as if they were wearing military or war clothes)! This is mostly what makes me rate this movie a bit lower, although, to be fair, fortunately the ET's appearance is short.If you ask me, they should have created these ET's more carefully, like Steven Spielberg did in "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" and "A.I.: Artificial Intelligence".Mel Gibson proves once again to be a good dramatic actor, portraying an ex-priest (or Father) who has lost his faith... until he recovers it at the end.Besides the tension, thriller, suspense and drama, I also like very much those giant crop circles made by the aliens. No doubt that they were perfectly made. Really very well made. Apparently not even a human hand could do crop circles this fine.Overall, a reasonable movie, but the same director (M. Night Shyamalan) has a much better movie than this: "The Sixth Sense", his most popular and most praised movie all over the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Science fiction mingles with faith.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M Night Shyamalan's SIGNS is a movie ostensibly titled for the worldwide crop circles that have mysteriously begun increasing in frequency, but a stronger argument can be made that the title refers to the signs from God that people of faith see in every day occurrences that atheists might dismiss as coincidences. The lead character, Graham, an Episcopal priest portrayed by Mel Gibson, says as much during the film.In addition to finding one of these crop circles in their own field, Graham's faith has been shaken by a tragedy that he is trying to recover from, while raising his two young children with the help of his down on his luck brother, portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix. The crop circles indeed portend something sinister, and the tension that builds as the family hunkers down and tries to survive is reminiscent of Hitchcock. We do not see the threat until the very end, and suspense is built with mundane dangers like asthma attacks, and sculpted by letting our imaginations fill the shadows and groans.There are many types of science fiction, and the science fiction that takes a background role to its characters always has greater appeal. Also, there are many movies that approach the question of faith; those that attempt to persuade one side aren't as successful as those films that simply try to present a test of faith. SIGNS manages to do both, although the payoff for the faith subplot far surpasses that of the science fiction plot. Very few films combine science fiction with faith. SIGNS is much more successful than the Jody Foster vehicle, CONTACT, and SIGNS manages to present the test of faith in a manner that is believable and eloquent. In a pivotal moment during the film, Graham must decide if he was given a sign from God, and act on it. Audience members of faith will see the sign, atheists will see coincidence. Shyamalan beautifully makes this moment ambiguous, as are all such signs in life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit that this film did have me on the edge of my seat because it was scary, fun and well written, however Shyamalan end this movie with the worst twist passable. " Water burns the aliens skin". I mean what the hell was that. Alien = intelligent life form ... erm lets invade a planet with more water than land and where its inhabitance are 70 percent water ....... i mean what the hell was he on. Normally i like his twists but this 0mg its just so stupid. lets get onto a different subject shall we. Acting - Mel Gibson does a amazing job as usual but sadly Joaquin Phoenix did a really bad job. He put no effort into his character but i never think he does. This Movie isn't horrible but it isn't great. I really wanted to give this movie a 6/10 but that ending, just oh god. If you happen to come across this movie in a rental store and your looking for some good clean scares i say rent it but be ready for that vile ending. Also if your a fan of Mel Gibson fan i'd say give this movie a shot but don't be expecting a masterpiece. Shyamalan hasn't done himself any favours here. My Faverite Shyamalan is the village.If you enjoyed this review you may want to check out my review for The Village.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If the aliens were so intent on offing the ex-priest and his brood why not just smoke them and go back to Planet X? Instead they hang around running across his roof, killing the dog, stomping his corn down, then trashing his home. How could these beings come here from 900 zillion lights years away and be unable to work a simple door latch? Couldn't they point a laser beam and cut the hinges? Just wondering. I actually enjoyed the film after putting off watching it for months, figuring it to be another "Alien", a movie I detested.

		<fullReview>Excellent in respect to keeping me attentive. M. Night Shyamalan's clever Sci-Fi thriller falls short in regards to the promos giving you some false hopes of a really scary story. There are a couple of scenes that come close to making you *#^S your pants. Mel Gibson plays a widowed farmer and former man of the cloth. When crop circles show up in his corn fields as well as multiple sites around the world, shattered faith is put to the test. His brother(Joaquin Phoenix) a down on his luck minor league home run champion comes to live with his recently widowed brother and two children. There is the little boy with asthma and a daughter that has a phobia concerning drinking water. Screen time for the alien visitor is not much, but down right creepy. The budget must have been spent on Gibson because the E.T. was mainly in the shadows and looking like a Halloween costume contestant. Tension is high and yes you do have to wait and wait for the suspense to flop out at you. All in all, I really liked this as compared to say... "SPIDER-MAN". Watch the skies! They will be back!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wasn't intended to be science fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of reviewers are missing the fact, that Signs wasn't intended to be sci-fi. Just because aliens are involved, coming from space? That's kinda weak explanation from a sci-fi fan. You can't judge Spartacus upon the base it's a comedy. Taken as a comedy it's a bad comedy, because it's not funny. The same way Signs is of course a bad sci-fi, because it's isn't sci-fi at all... And it was not even intended to be sci-fi. So it's a fantasy/horror movie with some drama, as it is with all Shyamalan movies, you should have noticed that by now. A very likable fantasy/horror movie with much suspense and atmosphere, and also with a feel for drama and for actual human psychological themes. But it's all metaphoric, and of course, if you don't like or don't get metaphors, obviously this movie isn't for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific family/suspense film from a director with an eye of suspense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reverend Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) lives on a farm in Pennsylvania with his two children (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin) and his brother (Joaquin Phoenix). One day, they all find a 500-foot crop circle in the middle of their corn field. All of this causes a media frenzy happening on nearly every single TV station as the family is about to encounter the extraterrestrial.'Signs' was the first Shyamalan movie that I've seen. Ever since I've watched it for the first time, it has been my favorite movie from Shyamalan. Right until I re-watched 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable'. After stating that 'Unbreakable' is now my favorite film from Shyamalan, does it mean that I disliked 'Signs' more than the first few times I've watched it? No; of course not. But I still do love this movie very much.Mel Gibson delivers a terrific performance as Graham Hess, the reverend that lost his faith after his wife died in a car accident. He has been struggling to restore his faith leading to the present day. You can feel his emotions as he is trying to do so. Joaquin Phoenix also does great as Merrill, Graham's brother; who brings some light-hearted humor to an otherwise emotional and quite a suspenseful movie. This movie probably has the best acting from children that I'd ever seen. Kudos to Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin.It's been a shame that M. Night Shyamalan's directing career had went to the crapper after the release of 'Lady in the Water', because he had an eye of building up the suspense throughout the movie (sort of similar to Alfred Hitchcock). Notably in one scene, where Merrill is watching the news and it shows footage of a birthday party in Brazil; the kids are looking out the window and they see an alien passing by. The creepy atmosphere and the creepy/suspenseful music by James Newton Howard with the mix of a shocking home video, makes it a very jumpy scene. It still makes me jump every time I sit down and watch 'Signs'. That example is one of the reasons why 'Signs' works; where the suspense starts to build from the first scene, then in the middle act, we get into the suspense and getting chills down our spine, then the suspense starts to pay off at the end.'Signs' is the second movie where Shyamalan wrote, produced and directed - the first being 'Unbreakable' (in 'The Sixth Sense', he only wrote and directed). I thought his writing was really good. A lot of people had criticized the story as ridiculous, especially with the certain plot point where aliens are invading our planet, which is 70% covered with water (and the rest covered with land). I do understand their point-of-view about it, but it seems like is that Shyamalan wanted the audience to think. My theory about that plot point is maybe the aliens have been living on a dry planet, and maybe they wanted to invade the dry lands and leaving behind the wet lands. I know I'm not 100% correct, but that's the best I could explain.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie. Mr. Phoenix performance was outstanding. Mel Gibson did a fine job as a the over protective figure and proves he still had it going. M Night Shamalym did a great job with his suspense, foreshadowing and mysterious delivery. It was a nice touch how the water is what is the antidote to destroy the alien invaders. Very metaphoric I suppose. Also the film delivers in its hero portrayal. I especially liked how they came together as a family to try and stop how the aliens were taking over the society at large. They banded together worked hard and were able to defeat the enemy. Very patriotic story indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Date: 13 April -Re-watched- After re-watching 'Signs' I still firmly believe it's one of the greatest movies ever. Ever since my parents first showed me this movie last October, I've been in love with. The entire cast is spectacular and the storyline was amazing. Mel Gibson gives one of his best performances, after 'Braveheart' of course, as Graham Hess, a washed up reverend who tries to stay calm during unusual events. Joaquin Phoenix plays the hilarious yet trying to be serious brother Merrill. It's really hard to believe Phoenix did this movie almost right after 'Gladiator' since the characters are the exact opposite. Then there are the kids, Morgan and Bo, who give us extra humor and seriousness. The movie is amazing and I really wish I was part of that family. Awesome movie. Watch it! You won't be disappointed.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good creepy film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a horror film fan for 30 years. While I remember a few films actually scaring me as a kid (Jaws, Psycho), I have failed to encounter many in my adult life. I like to be scared, but Hollywood has seen fit to retread every tired formulaic convention in just about everything it throws at the local multiplex. Even the independent filmmakers, free of the "system", seem to forget what FEAR is. Mostly I sit solemnly staring in disbelief at the screen, waiting and hoping to get those goosebumps. Then, finally, we were given Signs. Most will say, including the director, that this is not a horror film; I genuinely disagree. If this is not a horror flick, then it is time for this film to start a branch of its own and begin a new genre. I admired every little aspect of this picture, from the use of everyday objects: baby monitor, a blank television screen and a half empty glass of water, to convey and act as a vehicle to extract fear from the ordinary. Most of all, Shyamalan is an expert craftsman and knows how to get the most out of space, actors and sound. It is the lingering shot on a basement staircase when you are desperately hoping he moves his camera to show us more, or the screeching sound in the next room whose source he won't reveal . This director knows just how long to hold the shot, to increase the tension and build the suspense, long enough for our mind to begin forming pictures. And those pictures can be the most frightening of all. Stay the course Shyamalan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film frighting and exciting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The start of the film is what Hitchcock would have done. It keeps you interested and alert. The film again is very exciting and i know M. Night Shyamalan could make horror films just as frighting as Hitchcock. (Even though Shyamalan screwed up with The Village and Lady in the Water). One of the best bits i've seen in a horror film ever is the T.V. report from Brazil when you first see an alien. But before you even see an alien Shyamalan kept you on the edge of your seat. The film could have got a rating of 10 out of 10 but mistakes such as water can kill an alien,But wouldn't they realize most of earth is water. Another mistake is that they left their dog out to die,And i own a dog and if i was in that situation i would keep my dog safe. I would have liked to see some scenes in the cities but of course they didn't have a lot of money. But besides those little mistakes it's a great film to watch and if you like horror films you wont be disappointed.</fullReview>

His direction and a great cinematography make this film a unique experience.If you don't like movies about aliens and supernatural things you can still like Signs. It goes much further. It is about faith and about the questions if everything happens for a reason or not, if everything is meant to be or everything is just coincidence.Mel Gibson has a very strong performance. Joaquin Phoenix and the kids, Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin, are great. The kids did remind me a little of Haley Joel Osment and his strong performance.Overall this is a great movie. The climax is a great one. If you really think of it not much has decided in the end, but it doesn't matter, it is perfect the way it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Up 967% since last week, and here's why</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a turkey, it follows the classic no-budget b-movie tactic of telling you an awful lot about what's going on without showing you because it's a hell of a lot cheaper. There are some moments of tension that collapse into inanity as the plot unfolds into farce. You've probably already seen this big gobbling turkey of a film and either love it or hate it.The truth is if you love it it's probably because it mentions Jesus. Just look at the stats for this one, in one week it's gone up nearly 1000% based on the fanatical voting of people who are stoked there's a religious message in it, even though it's absolutely nonsensical, that and people who "get" M Night Ramadamadingdong.It still only gets on average a 6 at the time of writing and I think even that is generous. This is THE worst film I've ever paid money to see, the plot and characters are laughable and the whole thing is one long egotistic stroke job. I feel sorry for people who think this is a great movie, it's fair enough that people have different opinions on films but the fanatical love this turd produces sickens me.If you have any taste in films and haven't had your mouth swilled by M Night Shandyhands blend of egotistical meaningless turdery then do yourself a favour and don't be fooled by a few dozen die hard fans that vote and vote and vote for this rubbish.It really is THE worst film I've ever coughed up money to watch.

		<shortDescription>Effective, creepy, and ultimately excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not the first time I have seen Signs, but it is the first time I actually get to review the film. I saw it back in 2002 when I was just 9 years old, and it was one of the first horror films I ever saw. I remember being indifferent to it and remember me preferring the other popular horror of the year, The Ring. Having seen it again after 8 years, I can say it is a strong, effective, and emotionally resonant film.The writing in the film is superb. Shyamalan builds effective scenes with some great dialogue that only benefits the characters more. His direction is also impressive. He make the story itself be creepy and mysterious without showing too much, and that ultimately is what makes this a great film. At first I didn't think I would be able to say it was anything more than a good film, but it is great. The atmosphere and tension is first-class, and in that way it seems already as one of those old classic thrillers. The performances are also great, especially from the two youngsters. Abigail Breslin is of course an Oscar nominee now but still seeing her acting range at this age is marvelous. Rory Culkin also is very impressive, as is Phoenix. Mel Gibson I am mixed about and actually think was the weakest link here. Of course, knowing Gibson's reputation now does not help but I still say he was solid.Overall, it is a great film, and despite many saying it is not horror, it IS. It handled the subject of another alien existence in a very restrained and different way. The climax is done very well, but the visual effects and the fact that they somehow still did what we didn't really need them to do is probably a backtrack. But it still doesn't ruin the film as a whole. Shyamalan should not be forgotten for making this gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starring Mel Gibson - not always a warranty of enjoyment.The aliens are coming to get us. And the kids can hear them talking in obscure ways in television static, phone-line crackle, and stuff like that. For the most part the audience is left frustrated and wondering, like long-suffering dad Mel Gibson.The 'Signs' progressively increase in intensity. There are massed UFO sightings. Something seems to be creeping about in the tall, rustling corn crops, which seems to draw upon a Stephen King short story for its particular inspiration.The crisis arrives, and the aliens lay siege to the Gibson family home, which is little more than a big clapboard shack.Unfortunately, these aliens who can travel across the galaxy in flying-saucers encounter something quite beyond their experience and - it seems - utterly defeating: the doors have locks! Yup; just shut 'em in the pantry and they're screwed. Or lock yourself in the cellar and there's nothing for it but to admit defeat and go back to your home-planet. Locks - who would've believed it? Those darned, crafty humans.Ah - but one get's left behind. And I'm not surprised; he looks like ET's great Uncle Fester. Wouldn't want to spend hypersleep lying next to him - or her, or whatever.When it's spooky, it does a really good job. But - gosh - when it comes to being silly, it has few equals.Be sure to lock your doors before you go to bed and you should be safe from any risk of abduction. Unless they manage to Shanghai a locksmith first, that is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily Shymalan's best film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is M. Night Shymalan's Masterpiece, not Unbreakable, not even the Sixth Sense, Signs is not only one of my favorite movies of all time, but in my opinion it is one of the greatest thrillers ever made.It's a little slow, that is the only thing wrong with the movie, I will be discussing why the other problems people THINK are wrong with the movie later.The following does have spoilers. The acting is great, the characters are likable, the effects are minimal but well done, the message is subtle so that people don't feel like they are being preached at and being called morons for being Atheists. It has good undertones, it's is directed extremely well, it's scary at times, and the part that makes it way better than Unbreakble, it has a sense of humor. It doesn't take itself too seriously and lets you laugh quite a bit.Now for my rant about how people call the ending to this movie stupid. The ending reveals that the alien's poison is water, so why would this advanced alien race come to a planet that would kill them? 1. We don't know for sure the aliens did know that water was harmful to them. We are only given one small hint when Ray Reddy says that none of the circles are near water. Take into account how many crop circles vs. how many crop fields there are in the world. And they knew humans would be on land, so they would want to attack away from the water, where most people would be. Plus when the water does hit the alien near the end, he seems very surprised, almost like he didn't know.2. If they did know, they were probably desperate. They wanted to heard the humans, so they would do anything to get us. Hey, I hated science, but if there is one thing I did learn, enough water can kill us too.3. Ray said they didn't have them near water, so they obviously were taking precautions. They said the aliens were leaving by the next day, so they probably didn't want to stay that long knowing the air would eventually kill them.There, three reasons why the aliens would come to a planet filled with their toxic. But what about the fact that they couldn't get through a wooden door. Well, every door we saw them try to get through was blocked by something, ever try and get inside when a door is blocked, not easy. We even see them turn the door knob, so they obviously know how to get in.Why did God have to kill Graham's wife just so they would live through the alien encounter? You ever see Run Lola Run and realize how much one little thing you do can greatly effect your future. Imagine if his wife had lived. She only said swing away because she was delirious. Plus if she was alive, maybe they would have tried to leave and been killed. Maybe Merril wouldn't have come to stay with them and thus the whole family would have died. According to this movie, God knew exactly how to make sure the family lived through the ordeal. And taking his wife was part of the plan.And lastly, why does Graham not just rush Morgan to a hospital and instead rely on faith? Well, one, sometimes logic and reasoning don't make sense and faith is all you have left. If that's not good enough for you, the hospital was quite a bit away and there were probably hundreds of people there, Morgan might not have been able to get in. Plus Graham had good reason to believe he might be alright.Signs is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Signs' of intelligent life in Hollywood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: A criminally underrated thriller with some genuinely suspenseful moments and a meditation of faith.For my money, M. Night Shymalan is one of the most misunderstood directors working in Hollywood, if not the one that tops the list. With a body of work which began with the success of THE SIXTH SENSE, Shymalan has made some of the most intriguing films ever to sprout from Hollywood, even if not all of his works are great or perfect in every way. His stories are more than just superior genre entries or just-plain-weird movies, some of them also deal with some sort of personal or religious issue. Although the setup is consistent in every film, each film is always different from the last one; each new movie is something worth waiting for with the thought of how he would pull it off, even if it sort of give us a feeling of uneasiness and uncertainty.The basic premise for SIGNS can be summed up in a few words: Aliens attack a farmhouse. Former preacher widower Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) wakes up one morning to find a large crop circle in his field of corn, stunning both his kids and brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), especially when strange unseen men run around the fields at night. But SIGNS is more than just an average alien-invasion movie, or a typical sci-fi movie. In fact, SIGNS goes beyond science-fiction and into the realm of fear; it's not about giving off scientific jargon or explanations, it's just about the fear and uncertainty of the unknown. This is probably why many were so disappointed with the films big "twist" (which, despite a few holes, is not too big a deal). The character of a widower and problematic father has been ventured before, but this isn't the only thing tackled in the movie. There's the relevant use of a past death which affects future events in life. Then there's the question of believing in "seeing miracles" as opposed to believing that people "just get lucky", which is the whole point of the much-maligned twist ending. And the way Shymalan builds tension in the situations is something worth noting. How he uses simple everyday tools as in a Baby Monitor, a glass of water and flashlights as means to establish suspense is a triumph. He might have not been the heir of the throne of the great Hitchcock, but he sure learned a lot from him.Whereas Shymalan's other films deal with certain issues, SIGNS is about faith, bending the science-fiction genre into a drama with certain questions about faith. It's not just about questioning the existence of a God, but if He really is out there, are we willing to put our faith in Him in times of perilous situations? But Shymalan discusses these issue in a hushed tone; they never come off too preachy or overbearing. SIGNS is an example of the intriguing, albeit different, storytelling abilities of the underrated Shymalan. It's a slow-burn thriller which will still continue to divide the audience. To some, it may come off as a slow-moving science-fiction thriller. To others, myself included, it's old-fashioned film making and storytelling at its best.Rating: ***** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>M. Night Shamylan's films, for a while, were good. The last good one that I saw was Signs. Signs is a movie that, when I was younger, used to scare me a lot. When I say a lot, I mean a lot. That is why I liked this film the most of his. I like a film that creeps me out. This is a good one.The film is about a widowed minister(Mel Gibson). They live on a field. When they learn of alien invasions all around the world and notice a crop circle in their field, they prepare for aliens. And that is really the story.The thing that I loved most about this film is that it is very creepy. I can sometimes get scared a little too easily. I was with this film. Definitely. Shamylan has a great way of telling a story and it's a shame that a lot of his movies nowadays aren't that good. They all suck really. I think Signs is Shamylan's best though. I also liked how the film had some funny parts. Gibson and Phoenix give good performances, even for a film like this. Signs gave me the chills. I love Alien. I love this movie because the aliens aren't that scary. But the way they arrive is scary. This is a great film.Signs:****/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Interesting Take on a Well-Used SF Theme: SF takes a Back-seat to the Relationships of the Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You could almost make the case that "Signs" is probably the most spirited attempt to date to combine science fiction and chick flicks. The UFO's and aliens are there for the guys, the relationships between the characters are there for the girls. The closest analogy I can think of to describe this movie is "Independence Day" meets "Ordinary People", two films that you would never imagine being combined because their respective genres are about as polar opposites as they come. Even something like "Field of Dreams" meets "King Kong" seems more plausible. But "Signs" somehow works, probably because of the magic of director M. Night Shyamalan whose work is primarily in the SF/Horror genres and yet focuses a lot on character, much like Steven Spielberg. As science fiction stories go, strange sentient beings coming to Earth via UFO's goes back to the days of HG Wells' War of the Worlds near the turn of the last century. Films in which the aliens may be either benevolent or malevolent include "The Day the Earth Stood Still", "Earth Versus the Flying Saucers", "Invaders from Mars", "The Invaders" (TV show), "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", "Independence Day". The list goes on and on. So my point is that the central SF idea behind "Signs" is certainly nothing that hasn't been penned, shot, and edited, going as far back as the silent era. What is new in "Signs" is that the story focuses more on the characters and their inter-relationships with each other which comes out because of the events concerning malevolent extra-terrestrials. The closest film to it may be the 1953 SF classic "Invaders from Mars" in which a family is abducted by space aliens.Of course, this combining of SF and drama could turn off many hardcover science fiction fans who are more interested in long action sequences in which aliens and humans battle it out, like "War of the Worlds" or "Independence Day". If you want lots of laser gun action and dog fight scenes in space, "Signs" will certainly leave you feeling like you were had. On the other hand, if you want a new angle on a familiar sub-genre of SF that relies less on action and more on character, you might give "Signs" a try. "Signs" could have been a really ridiculous movie if it wasn't for the fine acting of all four leads, particularly the child actors. I was absolutely stunned by the realism of the two youngsters, around the ages of 6 and 10. They are really the ones that make this movie work. Added to the mix is Mel Gibson as their father who conveys paternalistic emotions that is uncommon for him. The story is really about the father reconciling with his children because of a piece of back-story that becomes, in the end, far more important than the space aliens. The back-story which is finally revealed toward the end has almost nothing to do with the aliens except for a singular aspect. This is what makes "Signs" a very unique film, and just when you thought nothing more could be added to the Earth vs UFO genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No one has an imagination anymore!!!! Great Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was excellent! It did not deserve the bad reviews it got. Does anyone have an imagination anymore?? The people who said this movie had plot holes were not thinking correctly. Maybe the reason the aliens had no idea that they were allergic to water is because their planet did not have any water on it. Maybe they were scouting our planet to see what resources we had. Could it have been that this was their first time off of their spaceship and that from now on they will know better. Maybe the crop circles were made to mark where they needed to get off of their ships and scout while being still being efficient and covering equal ground. The reason the alien was able to be locked in the pantry was because on his planet they have no need for doors or handles or locks or any combination there of. Or maybe he wasn't smart. I think the reason they were able to pick up the aliens voices was because they were on a different frequency then the government. We were never told that the government didn't pick up the signal. The reason Mel Gibson's character was angry at God was because he didn't understand how his wife could be taken like she was and in her final moments speak nothing but gibberish. The reason he found God again was because he found out in the end that God allowed her to save her family with her final words. That was enough to let him realize that there is a reason for all things and that God loved him and had a purpose for him still. I believe the director was trying to get us to use our minds and our imaginations. That isn't too much to ask, is it??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another M. Night Shyamalan WINNER!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take it from a sci-fi fan, this is an excellent movie. Again those who criticize it are clueless. What makes it work are many things; the way the aliens are filmed where you see only shadows and quick shots of them and especially those creepy clicking sounds they make. The actors are well cast and highly effective in moving things along and adding to the film's authenticity. Tak Fujimoto's brilliant cinematography also adds realism and moodiness to the proceedings as does James Newton Howard's score. Mel Gibson is great as usual as is Joaquin Phoenix who adds a touch of humor to the story. Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin in her film debut illustrate why they are exceptional young actors. Shyamalan's pacing and techniques are indicative of his film making talent. His screenplay makes this just as much a testing of one's faith tale as it is a science fiction story. I am hoping that Shyamalan will re-discover the creativity of his early films as they are exceptional works of film-making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One the few films that still scares me today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a fan neither of Mel Gibson or M.Night Shyamalan, but when I saw the trailer for signs I thought that it might a decent film, but it was more than decent it was brilliant. Mel Gibson plays an ex-priest who gave up on praying after his wife past away. He and his family start to experience strange things, like finding crops circles and seeing weird creatures outside the house. The storyline of the film is solid and very entertaining, there is no gore in this movie which is a relief because even a gore fan can get tired of to much blood in movies. The acting is good and very well done, now for the scary parts, they didn't show perfectly the aliens which wasn't that bad, there were scenes that did make me jump and did give goosebumps, though some scenes may be a little bit too predictable the movie is still very well done. Signs may not be a masterpiece but it is a very frightening film with a well scripted story and superb acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cream of the Crop Circles.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SIGNS is a storytelling masterpiece from writer-director, M. Night Shyamalan; a master moviemaker's layered mosaic of fear, faith, family - and alien invasion.Like every Night thriller, SIGNS is not of the Running and Screaming stripe, rather, a beautifully crafted lesson in film "making"; creative angles, smart reveals, subtle foreshadowing, tension-filled tableaux, nuanced humor. No frame wasted, no scene superfluous, no Night un-Shyamalaned.Mel Gibson is widower Reverend Graham Hess, a priest who has lost his faith, one day waking on his farm to discover - crop circles. Resurrecting that grand hoax, Shyamalan comes right out and attributes crop circles to extra-terrestrial aliens. But the aliens are the McGuffin - we only see this "invasion" through snippets on TV news and one chilling scene at a children's party. SIGNS concerns itself only with Graham's family and their unbidden involvement in this world-shaking event.Joaquin Phoenix is Merrill, Graham's brother, helping him tend his farm and raise Graham's two young kids, Morgan and Bo (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin in sensational performances). In most films, when a person "loses their faith" it doesn't mean they have come to their senses - it means they are waiting for some supernatural event to turn them BACK to that faith. Graham stopped practicing priesty things after the death of his wife, run down by a town local that fell asleep at the wheel (M. Night himself, in his usual Hitchcock-ian cameo). Usually a gutless filmic device, Night uses Graham's loss of faith as part of a much bigger picture, working it as another reference to the movie's title.The crux of SIGNS is a foreboding monologue that Graham shares with Merrill, about "two kinds of people" - the type that believe someone is watching over us, and the type that believe no one is. As they watch television reports of crop circles and hovering spaceships appearing throughout the world, Graham confesses his wife's unnecessary death made him cross over from "someone" to "no one." Religionists regard this as a tragedy. The only tragedy was his wife's death. "Losing faith" is the best thing that could happen to anyone in this delusional society - they become responsible for the first time in their lives. What Religionists fail to realize is that if no one is watching over us, we are the rulers of our own destiny. Why imagine some great clockmaker planning our floods, quakes, flat tires and stubbed toes? We forgive Night these pseudo-theological forays because every scene in SIGNS ratchets the tension higher; Night can conjure fear from the whisper of the wind, a rustle in the cornstalks, a hand groping under a pantry door.The passive ominousness of crops laying flat shows us we don't need screaming chase scenes to create excitement, nor knives stabbed through eyes to create horror - all it takes is a shift in normalcy: a shadowy figure on the roof, clicking sounds on a baby monitor, a shin disappearing into foliage.James Newton Howard's chilling, eerie, evocative soundtrack only raises the hairs more.Every subplot in SIGNS is a sign itself, as it jigsaws into the fabric of the last scene, where the Hess family confront a full frontal alien, left behind after the "invasion" forces abandon Earth. Graham finds that everything his wife said to him with her dying breath attains fruition to save their lives - from Bo's obsession with leaving "contaminated" water glasses around the house, to Morgan's asthma attacks, and Merrill's impulsive cannonball batting arm. "Tell Merrill... swing away!" Many people try to find signs, allegories and messages in movies with this tone, but few deride SIGNS for being absolutely bereft of intelligence when it advocates predestination. Graham's wife, while pinned to a tree by Night's car, blabbers all the info Graham will need to save his life later, explained away by Graham as "the last sparks of her brain firing arbitrarily." You lost me at medulla oblongata.Predestination negates free will. I've said it at least 4,560,670 times. But Christians never seem to get it. Graham actually believes - as many viewers do - that events can be foretold by a dying woman who was fed information by some outside source powerful enough to mind-meld with her (yet not powerful enough to keep the car from hitting her); an outside source with such dubious discernment that it would relate life-saving info through a dying woman instead of simply mind-melding the info into the living people who needed that info. Smart. Graham's "faith" must have been Church of Nostradamus, or whatever you prophesy weirdoes call yourselves - oh, that's right: Christians.But I forgive Night. Because SIGNS suspends our disbelief so artfully even with the contradiction of predestination. The love and closeness of Graham's family bedrocks their adversity, and the performances breathe beyond three dimensions. What can we say about Joaquin and Mel? Both have wells of emotion so deep and nuanced, it makes us wonder why their shelves are not creaking with Oscars.As one day, M. Night Shyamalan must surely be recognized by that insular, backslapping academy. All they need is a sign.Or SIGNS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love the way the story unfolds from master storyteller Shyamalan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike many modern movies that feel the need to spoon feed us info incessantly so that we "get" the movie (either with constant narrating or infantile dialogue) - this movie keeps us guessing as what exactly happened in the past to cause Graham to give up being a priest. I much prefer to have things unfold slowly and allow viewers to discover the facts for themselves.I think Shyamalan is a master of suspense, similar to Hitchcock, which happens to be one of his idols. This film has so much tension, and yet Shyamalan also allows for moments of comic relief to break up this tension as well. He pays Hitchcock several compliments by copying some of his trademarks - such as making a cameo appearance in the film (although he is a horrible actor. He should do non-speaking cameo's like Hitch). He also uses similar camera techniques like extremely close shots and unusual camera angles and perspectives. There's also a big similarity to Hitchcock's "The Birds" in the way that something is trying to get in the home and they have to board up all the doors and windows.Thia is one of the few "scary" movies I let my kids watch. It has no blood and gore like the "slasher" movies. It became an ongoing practical joke at my house where my husband would hide and make the alien "clicking" noise - and my kids would just roar with laughter. (of course they would never admit it "scared" them). I like that the film doesn't rely heavily on CGI or other special effects. It makes the film seem more realistic and believable, rather than the product of some big budget Hollywood production.I also like that the picture has a deeper meaning about whether we think we are alone, or believe that there are "NO coincidences".I think Gibson's performance was good, but I thought Joaquin Phoenix's was even better. His portrayal of "akwardness" and the failings in his life are so palpable and believable. He seems to be more a 3rd child in the film than Graham's adult counterpart. I absolutely love the scene where he joins the 2 kids on the sofa with the aluminum foil hats. We laughed hysterically. Abigail Breslin's performance was amazing given her very young age - and is a testament to the skilled direction of Shyamalan.In addition to some comic relief, there are some tender moments - like when Graham relays the story of the kids birth to them at a very tense moment. I had tears in my eyes at how delicately and intimately Gibson delivers these lines - you forget that he's reciting lines and truly believe what he's saying.I loved the music score - especially the opening credits. It has a chaotic and tense melody. I think the accompanying graphics were cool as well. But the music is a very crucial part in the building of suspense. And the movie gets off to a fast start with the little girl screaming and also sets the stage for a fast pace in the rest of the film.Word of warning - I have caught this on TV and it is guilty of cutting out key scenes (must be in order to fit in time slot because there is nothing inappropriate about the cut scenes). So be sure to get the DVD so you don't miss anything.</fullReview>

They have some type of beauty to them though that is unique and mysterious. It is really hard to even describe it. Like his work, this film contains so many turns and jerks that really make you think and wonder whats going to happen next.I can definitely say that I'd watch this film again. Probably because it's one of a kind, generally creepiness that is hard to find in movies.

		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan is a fantabulous director with the ability to set a plot that is both breath-taking and mysterious. Each scene is significant and cleverly set up. He always adds a deeper, more intellectual meaning to the movie. For instance, although he does a great job with the frightening and suspenseful aliens that attack earth, the movie also contains a character (played by Mel Gibson) that loses his faith because of a death in his family. After, experiencing all of the horrifying events when the creatures come to their house, he discovers that things aren't just coincidences, but miracles and that God has a deeper purpose to everything that happens. This is an entertaining and thrilling movie. Get ready to have your muscles tense and your soul be emotionally moved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly ending aside, this is a very good sci-fi thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First came The Sixth Sense, then Unbreakable: two near perfect movies in a row. M. Night Shyamalan hasn't made a film that good since, but that does't mean his subsequent works aren't worth watching: they are flawed, but Shyamalan's talent in creating compelling characters and a creepy mood shines throughout all of them.Continuing in the direction of his previous two hits, Shyamalan tells a supernatural story where plot and characters are favored over action. Signs takes place in Pennsylvania, where the widowed farmer Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) finds crop circles just outside his house. The phenomenon keeps repeating itself night after night, prompting all kinds of speculation: Graham's brother (Joaquin Phoenix) and children (Abigail Breslin and Rory Culkin) believe it's the work of God; Graham himself, who used to be a priest but lost his faith after his wife died in a car crash, on the other hand, doesn't know what to think. However, it seems like something is moving in the fields and scaring the animals, suggesting those circles might foreshadow an alien invasion.Just like he didn't deliver a straight horror movie or a traditional comic-book flick, Shyamalan tries to get beyond the conventions of sci-fi, using the alien premise as an excuse to focus on a man's spirituality and his quest for lost faith. The religious subtext may annoy science-fiction purists expecting immediate action, but if all genre films were alike, people would get bored pretty quickly, wouldn't they? Besides, isn't it a bit hypocritical to criticize Shyamalan for making a meditative alien movie and praise Steven Spielberg (one of the director's major influences) for doing something similar with E.T.?Also, spiritual message aside, the trademark suspense is consistently present, meaning that formally speaking Signs isn't that different from the average sci-fi thriller. In addition, the acting is as strong as expected from thespians working with Shyamalan: Gibson, in an unusually understated role, finds the soul of his character with relative ease, partly because his Catholic upbringing suits the film's themes, partly because he's used to playing widowers, as seen in Mad Max, Lethal Weapon and Braveheart; Phoenix is equally unpretentious, and the children manage to be sympathetic in a not too cutesy way.Granted, the famously bad-mouthed ending is very weak, even downright stupid if compared to everything that came before it. But that's just the last fifteen minutes: the rest is a classic example of a good story well told.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen this film in over six months, but I remember it well.The only thing that makes this movie good is that Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix are in it. Their performances are terrific. I don't appreciate the language they use, and the young boy, Morgan, (Rory Culkin) uses a term that I strongly object to.***MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!!! DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE!!!!*** The story, on the other hand is pretty good. This movie is no longer among my Top 30 list, but it would probably be on my top 50.The death of the two dogs should not have had to happen, though. I don't think that the male dog should have gotten violent, and Isabel, the female dog, should not have had to die the way she did.We don't actually see her die. We assume she dies, by way of the aliens that come to their farm.Overall, it's worth seeing on Halloween. I would not recommend little kids watching it, however. Also, do not watch it alone, and do not watch it in the middle of the night, or in a cornfield! My score: 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching the Dr.Who xmas invasion I decided to go with my alien invasion / sci-fi mood . When I checked out the trailer for Signs , it looked really good and appealed to me and I decided to go and check it out . What I first of all would like to say is if your going to watch this film and are expecting a huge epic like Independence Day or War of the Worlds then forget it . This movie does not use special affects a lot but instead builds up tension and suspense just like back in the "old days" when you people would be glued to the TV with your jaw touching the ground not believing what happening . Thats what Signs done for me . Instead of showing space ships tearing New York,Tokyo , London apart or F-16 fighter jets roaring through the sky , your given huge level of tension that builds up and jumps out at you at all the right moments . Mel Gibson and the future Jhonny Cash-Joaquin Phoneix were a joy to watch and also the 2 kids all pulled in brilliant acting performances . I guess the only real flaw was how much info could the little boy pull out of one book which seemed a little odd as to how all his theories could be correct ???? But in general a brilliant film and not to be missed ! 8.5 out of 10 for me .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece (MASSIVE SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Warning: There are SPOILERS ahead)"Signs" underscores the blatant hypocrisy of critics of summer movies. They complain that summer blockbusters use noise and explosions in lieu of plot and are rarely thoughtful. "Signs" is an extremely thoughtful summer blockbuster, and one that relies on mood and indirection, the way Spielberg built "Jaws", or they way Hitchcock constructed his suspense movies. The problem? Well, the thoughtfulness of "Signs" takes a different direction than critics like.Father Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is having a crisis of faith after the accidental death of his wife. He's living on a farm in Pennsylvania with his children, as if hiding from the world and the eye of God. He's angry at God, and won't even allow prayer in his house. A set-up shot shows a spot on the wall where a cross or crucifix once hung. Because of his crisis he's run away from his congregation and hidden himself away from humanity, with whom he either feels or wants to feel no connection. His brother (Joaquin Phoenix) also lives with him.Bizarre things begin happening on the Hess farm. Crop circles. The family dog attacks the children. Odd persons are seen indistinctly in the darkness outside. At first he thinks he's the victim of hoaxers and vandals. Slowly, and with some hair-raising scenes, Father Hess grows aware of the possibility of an alien invasion of earth -- and one of the signs seems to be in his own cornfield. But are the aliens (if there are aliens) vegetarians come to be friends; or have they come to destroy, and enslave humanity? The movie takes the latter course, and after one of the best gradual set-ups in movie history (or at least since the death of Hitchcock) the Hess family finds themselves locked in a cellar with really mean aliens running through the house and trying to get in to do them some harm. These aren't your wussy Spielberg phone-homers. These are the the sort who are probably kin to the aliens that burst out of John Hurt's chest.Despite the excellence of the movie's unfolding, many viewers have fundamental misunderstandings of the way the movie works. The movie is the story of a man's crisis of faith set during the time of an alien invasion of the earth. Most critics (professional and amateur) seem to think Father Graham Hess has _lost_ his faith. In fact, he hasn't. This is clarified later, when his son seems ready to die of an asthmatic seizure. It's clear at that point that Father Hess has never lost his belief in God's existence, but he has lost his sense that God is beneficent, and he certainly doesn't like the way God sometime works (all believers have this problem, quick to ask God where God was in bad times but rarely acknowledging his presence during fat times). All believers in any religious, philosophical, social or political doctrine) should at some point reconsider the very foundations of their belief: do they hold a social, scientific, political, or religious hypothesis because that's how they were broght up? Have they let others (parents, peers, teachers) impose beliefs on them? Did they have individual enlightenment? Do they really understand what they believe in any of the above contexts?Father Graham was having a crisis of faith, which every believer in anything should have if he's a healthy thinker; he hasn't lost a belief in God, but he has had the foundations of what he thought God was undermined. This is a healthy thing in Christianity or Judaism, since in these traditions one accepts God for what God is, rather than attempting to impose one's own personality on the Creator.As for the vapid criticisms that a man's faith in "traditional" faiths should be undermined by extraterrestrials, the argument is extraordinarily shallow and shows a lack of understanding, certainly of Bible based faith, Jewish or Christian, and not only in their theology but their history. In fact, there has been long and fascinating debate a long time about the possibility of extraterrestrial life. There are many strands of Christian thought dating even from the middle ages (and no, no one ever was burned for suggesting such a thing, it's not a heresy). The strand of thought most intriguing to me suggests that God alone is unique and Satan is not; therefore the drama of fall and redemption happens throughout the universe. If one reads the Bible it says, "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth . . ." That humble sentence covers hundreds of thousands of years in the age of the universe. But the Bible is a book about God's realtionship to intelligent carbon-based life forms on the planet Earth, and the second sentence focuses on the Earth. There are suggestions through Scripture that there are other worlds, but until the time of Canon Copernicus it was little understood what forms these worlds might take. But it was never a part of Christian doctrine that man was unique -- or alone -- in the universe (though he may yet prove to be).The ending is invariably misunderstood, and is set up by an earlier scene involving Father Hess' brother.It's not clear what happened to the alien invaders at the end. Did they have a strategic withdrawal? Will they be back? Possibly. This is the purpose of the last scene: Just as in an earlier scene Father Hess' brother went into an army recruiting station, probably toying with the idea of enlisting in case the earth was under attack, so Father Hess has enlisted to fight the invaders the best way he knows how. Some people go into war to fight to defend their country (or planet) but others have to clean up: medics, preachers and priests, and people just to carry stretchers or wash up. Father Hess has re-enlisted in God's service to give spiritual aid and comfort while his brother may enlist in the armed forces to fight the earth's enemy physically. Even if the aliens don't return, it is clear there is much misery, death, and broken-heartedness among the survivors, and Father Hess, having been through his own crisis, is well equipped to help people understand their own loss; he's as much a healer, at the end, as a doctor, and as much a fighter as his brother may be as a soldier. Others will be better for his suffering and doubt.Anyone hoping for a trick ending is disappointed (as Father Hess tried to impose himself on God, so too many critics and viewers have tried to impose themselves on the movie, refusing to accept it as it was and therefore rejecting it out of hand), but anyone who has given the movie thought will understand why the ending is perfect, and why the movie is therefore a masterpiece: Father Hess has not out of the blue regained lost faith; he's come to better understand a God he never doubted, and because of the uncertainty of the alien situation, he has to serve both God and his fellow men the best way he knows how. He's lost the love of his life (his wife) but he has too much love to give, both for God and mankind, to hide himself in a cornfield when people need him. It's a courageous ending, a thoughtful ending, well set up, and most professional critics hate it because they hate Christianity and the fact that it is portrayed in a not unpleasant light. But anti-Christians can take heart: there is only one scene of unmitigated theological discussion, and it undercuts the idea of comfort in religion alone. If you're hiding in your own "cornfield" from the possibilty of a God, so much that you can't even bear the mention of one in a pluralistic society but must see them silenced, you won't be offended. The movie is anything but preachy: I don't recall the name of Christ actually mentioned, though it may have been; and it certainly has no such heavy preachy theological mumbo-jumbo as we get in George Lucas' movies about "The Force".Ultimately, the movie does consider free will vs predestination. Which gets the upper hand? Both. While the movie is full of unexplained and unexplainable little oddities that gradually converge, Father Hess himself must tie the (seeming) coincidences together. God gives "signs", but Hess must pick up on them. And this, too, is sound theology. It's not the signs themselves, though, that ultimately lead to Father Hess' conversion to God (he reminds me of John Wesley, who was a fairly poor preacher for many years before he actually had a conversion and a sense of the reality of the Redemptive power of Jesus Christ).The movie, while thoughtful and largely quiet (not full of explosions), contains many scenes of suspese that will become classic: the Hesses climbing up on the family car to pick up "alien" signals on a baby monitor, for instance; nd the momentarily glimpse of a green leg disappearing in the corn (and it ain't the jolly green giant). The suspense is relieved by moments of comedy, most involving Phoenix but also in the David Lynchean parade of local townspeople.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slight Spoiler Alert Is this movie "scientifically correct"? no, who cares, its very entertaining. People get wrapped around the aliens being hurt by water, and that they are so smart but couldn't get suits made. But no one said anything about a Terminator who can travel through time and not pick out the right Sarah Conner. His plan was to travel through time, then use a phone book? Or when we used a Apple computer to defeat the Aliens in Independence day. Point is, in all movies, even very famous and successful ones, there are scenarios that don't really work. If you go into this movie and put your mind on vacation, like we do time and time again, you will enjoy it. If you cant do that, maybe reading a Stephen Hawking book would be more entertaining and beneficial.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than just a sci-fi movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may be Mel Gibson's best movie. The movie is ostensibly a sci-fi but actually it's a drama about faith, using the sci-fi motif for dramatic effect. The movie contains a compelling plot, wonderful acting, excellent cinematography, and a powerful theme. The movie immediately engages the audience and effectively sets forth the moral issues confronting the principal character. The movie has a great cast, but Mel Gibson is definitely in center stage, with all the action revolving around his character. Although the special effects may seem subdued by contemporary standards, they actually help to enhance the drama, especially relating to the depiction of the aliens. This movie could have easily a War of the Worlds remake, but the director deftly avoids that pitfall, leaving the audience to ponder larger, more esoteric questions that deal with the nature of existence.</fullReview>

Joaquin Phoenix couldn't have played Merill better, and Rory Culkin and Abigail Preslin were perfect choices as the kids. Not many, if any at all, aspects of this movie that I don't like. Its hard to get me to like an alien movie, but this one did. It made the alien presence a major factor, but put it aside for important scenes to work in the religious aspect and the aspect of family perfectly. Mel Gibson and Shayamalan made a great team in this one to make a great movie.</fullReview>

His included it a topic called People Who Should Not Ever Be Considered Artists/Geniuses/Good People/Actual Human Being(you laughed at the last part admit it). And I actually watched only three of his movies, liked 1 and loved 1 and hated third. And the one I loved is as you already guessed is Signs (wow that sound cool). So on the field of different country signs appears. And some think that that's bullshit but some people believe that aliens are here. So I won't spoil anything for you guys I'll just say that the plot is great the dialogs are awesome and of cause it has a twist. Oh you Night. So that's that now to acting. Mel Gibson (yeah the guy who promised to kill his girlfriend) plays great I loved him. The guy from Gladiator is good and the kids are decent. The soundtrack is bad-ass if anything I would love that movie just for that. Although I love it for a different thing - the atmosphere. Yes it's really cool. There're scary moments where you go - d...m what a f...g s...t just happened and it's great. So the movie is great and the only complaint about it is the look of the alien well his... just watch the movie and find out for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signs ain't just another sci-fi movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched signs on DVD, and found the movie to be highly enjoyable. I loved Shyamalan's cinematography style which certainly pays homage to the great Hitchcock. Shyamalan's ability to stir up emotions from so little on screen is incredible taking you form laugh out loud comedic moments to edge of your seat fear. This is the sort of movie I'd watch when I want something different from the standard Hollywood fare of big budget CG and over the top acting.Before I watched this movie I already knew about the aliens weakness against water and I do admit it does make you scratch your head as to how silly it is in the overall plot, but you would have to be foolish to give this movie a bad review just on that alone.I read some of the negative reviews on this site and all I can see is how they have only treated this movie like just another Sci-fi movie and that is a huge mistake.When reviewers evaluate a movie according to sci-fi and particularly the classic alien invasion plot, They immediately conjure up movies like War of the Worlds, Independence day etc. Movies whose plot can be summed up in a single sentence "advanced alien race arrives in space ships and plan an invasion of earth". That is the first mistake, thinking that that is why the aliens have come to earth. The true intension of the aliens isn't made very clear in the entire movie. Who they are? , Where they come from? , The reason they have come to earth. We get snippets and assumptions a few abductions, but that's it. The only thing even remotely indicates that this is an invasion is the number of space ships hovering in the sky, and this is when "in the box thinking" occurs, they drag up the 'Invasion' plot as a critical template. Lets look at a few criticisms and some alternate explanations.1) (The biggest complaint) Aliens come to invade a planet mostly made up of water and harvest humans who are made up of up to 70% or more which is harmful to them.Again the intension of invasion is not made clear, and just because they are hovering over earth doesn't mean they are planning to invade. Lets look at simple logic and psychology, The aliens are in full view hovering over the earth sending down small groups, to what seems to be primarily observation and capture of specimens. If we take the comparison of a man and a fire ant hill, The man believing he is more intelligent and superior to the ants has little fear of them so casually observes them and perhaps kills and takes a few for closer study. The 'Water' argument relies on the assumption that this is an invasion, alternatively perhaps they are just passing through, logging life around the galaxy or are were forced to come to earth looking to restock resources. At the end the aliens seem to have disappeared after reports of people attacking them which goes against the hostile takeover theory. There are many things that harm us which in the realm of science fiction can just be an everyday substance to other alien species i.e. the acid blood of the creature in Alien, So who is to say that logic can't be turned on its head to make up all sorts of crazy theories, the aliens might be mostly made up of gas, or potassium.2)The aliens were advanced enough to travel in space ships, but too stupid to get through a pantry door.Now this makes assumptions on the aliens' (The ones walking around) intelligence and that they are the same aliens who built the ships in the first place. Who is to say that these aliens aren't a less intelligent species used by a more superior alien race to do the dangerous work. Humans have used animal species to do all kinds of work through out history, in many cases training them to perform simple tasks such as sending messages, fetching items and more. Also What about the societal structure is it like ours or is it akin to a hive with drones, soldiers, A queen or more, a drone only has enough to get the job done and is only intelligent enough to carry out a few actions. Point is placed in a situation outside of its intellect it wouldn't know how to react. Hence the pantry situation even though it escapes eventually.3)Level of technical sophistication = Level of preparation.So the aliens did or didn't take into account that water a substance most deadly to them is everywhere on earth, or that their communication can be picked by a simple baby monitor despite their ships not showing up on radar of the most advanced military on earth. What if those two aspects are just coincidence. In war of the worlds the aliens were advanced enough to wipe out all human life on earth but died because of common germs humans had grown resistant to. Just because they are advanced doesn't mean they have taken every bit of human technology or situation into account. So little information has been given about the aliens we can't begin to make assumptions of how they function.------------------------------------------------------------------ I'll say again you shouldn't write this movie off because it doesn't meet your expectations. Instead watch it with fresh eyes and an open mind, that's what's so great about Shyamalan's movies, they delve into the unexpected and at times are powerful yet subtle. If anything watch the movie for the directing style alone witness the superb example in quality over quantity in cinematic direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Signs was aired on telly last night and must confess that the first time I had watched the movie (in 2002) my expectations played the spoilt-sport and I was disappointed. Remove "The Sixth Sen" and "M. Night Shyamalan" tag and you might agree with me saying "You have a gift, surely do".The writing is good and execution deft, though at few places the melodramatic lines are unwarranted. Mel Gibson could have done better or rather Mel wasn't the right choice in the first place. Joaquin Phoenix and the two kids did their parts well.The audience wants to tricked yet again as in "The Sixth Sense" and Mr. Shyamalan has a daunting task to pull-off another spectacular feat. To quote Albert Einstein "Problems cannot be solved at the same level of awareness that created them". Are you listening Mr. Shyamalan?</fullReview>

Gibson in particular shines in his role, as do all the other players. Good cast. These things, along with a subdued musical score that adds to and doesn't distract from, and good photographic technique, all add up to a very entertaining piece of work. The plots, plural, string the thing together so as to provide an ending, singular, for both. If I explained that further I'd spoil it for you. I won't do that. This film deserves a look see. If you haven't seen it yet you ought to. You'll enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece in excitement and mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie for the second time and it's worth seeing. It is a masterpiece in excitement, probably in this point the best film ever made. The explanation for Crop circles that way, in a family of a priest, working as a farmer now and living in an indigenous milieu makes the movie special. A great compliment to director M. Night Shyamalan, who proved as a genius in getting the audience goose pimples. His special picture of the aliens as green creatures without a face and that you fully see them first in the end of the movie increases excitement as well as his working with silhouettes. I think this movie is more realistic than any other alien-movie because of the inconspicuous picturing them. The only negative think is, in my mind, that water hurts the friends from outer space, but okay you have to find a way how to eliminate them. Of course I have to add the wonderful acting of Mel Gibson and the children who showed a realistic picture of what people would do when aliens take over our planet. The last scene of the film when Morgan is remaining unharmed because of his asthma decease is also well-considered. On balance it is awesome to watch this movie and I would recommend it to everyone.</fullReview>

Shyamalan once again proves why he is a superb director, as he makes the film very creepy in addition to the jump scares provided by the music. Speaking of which, the Herrmann-esquire score by James Newton Howard is absolutely terrific, as it adds a sense of ominous thrill to each scene. The story was involving and scary, the acting was great all around, and the ending was a perfect fit. Though the alien does look a bit too fake, the entire end scene is expertly crafted, with every aspect excelling. An incredibly rewatchable flick, too, as I've seen it going on ten times now.

		<shortDescription>A fascinating story of reconciliation and hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>M. Night Shyamalan delivers once again in a film that is sure not to disappoint anyone who enjoys scifi flicks. From it's amazing soundtrack to top notch acting, "Signs" keeps you on the edge of your seat, wondering what's going to happen next. As far as the plot is concerned,Shyamalan tells the story of an normal American family experiencing crisis on every side. The film documents the struggle of a family grieving the loss of a loved one while also dealing with a world falling apart around them. Although much attention is focused on how the family as a whole deals with grief and despair, the real story centers around Graham Hess (Mel Gibson). Hess is confronted with a existential crisis of whether God really exists in the light of his wife's death. "Signs" uses the phenomena of crop circles and the threat of alien invasion as a metaphor for the truth that God really does have a plan in mind for humanity. Could all the evil and hurt in the world actually be used toward some future good? Shyamalan seems to think it could. The spiritual significance of this film is overwhelming. As a Christian, I view this film as a fascinating and deeply moving story of the questions that all of us ask in life. Could God actually be using the present evil we experience in life for good? I side with Shyamalan's conclusion. Just as suffering is a mandatory part of life on Earth, so to is the possibility of healing and hope. Of course, since I am a Christian, I see suffering as a result of man's decision to rebel against God. However, God has a plan! Just as sin brought about suffering and death to every person, so to God through Christ lived a life of suffering and experienced death without sinning, so that by believing in Christ's payment for sin we can experience reconciliation and hope ourselves. God has a plan! Please don't lose hope, find it in Christ.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly, I don't understand why this film didn't receive the love it deserves. Maybe it's because this generation of audience prefers action and fact over allurement and artistry. Or maybe because it escaped the viewers' understanding of poetic story telling. The art of story telling has no restraints in any case. Any argument against a film's regard for scientific, historical, and logical accuracy is already invalid, because a film is not made to be truthful, it's made to be experienced.To see a film should be to have a dream. Sometimes dreams disagree with what is logical in this world, but it is the journey that captivates you. The way a story is told is what should define it. In Signs, all elements work together to create power in poetry. Never have I heard a film's score fit so perfectly to its mood. Camera angles and duration leave you hanging while throwing you into the story, letting you witness it as if you were there, as well as holding symbolic themes of which most viewers miss. The dialogue is real and philosophical, and whether a believer or not, will cause thought provoking attention. The story is fascinating and is supported by actors who completely capture the awe and disbelief of what they are experiencing. There are metaphors and allegory around every corner. There's tenderness and there's heart break, there's joy and there's terror, there's comedy and there's utter sincerity. You experience an alien invasion unlike any other, with an isolated family so blissfully ignorant to what is happening that it alone is terrifying. It is exquisitely genuine. Sometimes if you want to subtly and metaphorically portray a fault or weakness in a characters motive, you may make him unable to perform the simplest task of opening a pantry door or inability to come in contact with the purist of substances. In order to be a creative and intelligent story teller, you must sometimes break rules of logic. As a viewer who judges a film by its poetic integrity and engaging experience rather than its coherence with and regard to real life logic, I give Signs an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this film many times and I feel it is that rare thing: A perfect film. Shyamalan manages to combine the touching story of a good man's lost faith with a gripping and atmospheric tale of alien invasion. I have been exasperated by it's critics who seemed to have missed the point completely and pick holes in this movie. For me from the very first scene to the last the direction is sublime. Every shot, camera angle and scene works, and it's a delight to marvel at the work of such a great director, whilst enjoying the story build and grip you. The cast is excellent, Mel portrays his character with depth and honesty, Joaquin is intense and mesmerising, the children are a delight, and every one of the side characters are memorable, another "sign" of a great director. James Newton Howard's music enhances the movie utterly, with the basic melody building along with the story to a crescendo, building our tension and emotions to their peak. There are some truly beautiful scenes in this movie and the story is ultimately a human one, the "Signs" are many and profound and they lead us beautifully to the film's conclusion. I can't recommend this film highly enough, and after 30 years of watching movies and admiring the art that is film making this movie went in to my list of favourites the first time I saw it, and there it will remain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signs is the ultimate movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one of my all time favorites.First off, I think it deserves more credit then what people have been giving it. Its called willingly suspending your disbelief. The elements in this film are Shyamalan's, which he imaginatively wrote and put together as he saw fit. So forget what most sci-fi resources would say in terms of what would be more likely to happen if aliens made contact with humans.Most of the entire story and events are revolved around the Hess family on their country property. The television and radio are the only things that even remotely show what is happening to other places around the world. This is extremely effective. It allows the audience to be more engaged and attached to the Hess family.The acting is phenomenal, absolutely pristine. This is my favorite Mel Gibson movie. His performance as a beloved father struggling to cope with the loss of his wife with abandoned faith is outstanding. The dinner scene and the ending is where he really works his magic.Joaguin Phoenix is a perfect addition to the cast, as a charming, yet still caring younger brother living with Mel Gibson.You couldn't ask for better child acting from Abigail Breslin and Rory Culkin as the kids of Mel Gibson's character (Graham) The film is surprisingly funny. Quite frequently there are golden touches of humour in the first 3/4 of the movie.It is perfectly suspenseful. Not showing the audience everything at once, but little bits at a time is the perfect trick. Then when the ending comes around, Bam! "Oh jeez this is intense!" And lastly, it is tear-your-heart-out emotional. Deep down it is quite a sad story, as this family is struggling to survive, and Mel Gibson is barely holding his family together from everything that is being thrown his way. His battle with faith and God is one of the key elements, and I think it is spectacular how this conflict is finally resolved at the end.Amazing movie, perfect in every way. It is funny, suspenseful, emotional (I will admit to tearing up every time) The acting, the story, just everything is top notch. I recommend this to everyone. If you like movies at all, watch this, give it a chance. I want to see it have at least a 7.0 rating on this site, right now! come on!10/10------5/5------20/20, any variation of perfect</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SIGNSWitnessing the progression of films by M. Night Shyamalan is like following the years of refinement that Japanese-made cars go through. M. Night is on a steady pace towards perfecting his craft. As with the convention of the Eastern world, M. Night is not interested in making visionary work. While The Sixth Sense is considered M. Night's breakthrough film, Unbreakable was questionably superior in depth, range and complexity. Signs might not diversify M. Night's thriller/horror repertoire that has become his bread and butter arsenal, but it certainly makes his existing arsenal more authoritative. The picture perfect screenplay functions on a successful yet basic scheme: lighten the hearts of the audience with humor and the security of a small town farm family, then terrify the life out of them with strategically placed everyday occurrences, such as dogs barking, objects falling, etc. In this fashion the real apocalyptic horror remains a mystery while the audience waits with laughter in their mouths, hearts in their throats. This film is so well done it wouldn't be absurd to presume that the same audience that enjoyed this film on it's opening weekend would sit through three more suspenseful hours just to get another glimpse of the shadowy intruder's hand. I expected to see Bruce Willis in Signs. But I speculate that he turned down the role of Father Graham Hess and responded with something like: I already made this film, twice. (Just for the record I'm not saying he was offered the role.) Playing father on two different levels, Mel Gibson shines in what will be his greatest performance in quite a few years- a family guy role. Joaquin Phoenix plays Graham's brother Merrill, reflecting the screenplay by acting at times humorous and strange, at other times deadly serious. Rounding out the Bucks County Pennsylvania family are two overtly bright children (A sure sign of a M. Night Shyamalan flick.) who end up parenting the grownups. Thankfully this film doesn't rely as heavily on audience expectations as did The Sixth Sense. From the trailers we know that Signs involves some extra terrestrial beings- I'm not spoiling anything here. This story, in Shyamalan fashion, fits together like a magnetic Jenga tower. I wouldn't be spoiling your experience if I told you about Father Graham's flashbacks of his wife's death, or if I mentioned his daughter's habit of leaving half empty (Half full?) glasses of water around the house; I would be giving nothing away by telling you that Marrill used to be a slugger baseball player in his younger years. Signs is not like The Sixth Sense in this way. Mel Gibson's character is not already dead; thus the story remains exciting and provocative with subsequent viewing. It doesn't bother me that M. Night is sticking to his guns, enhancing his stockpile. He's doing personal work that has become very successful and lucrative; no artist could ask for anything more. Furthermore it doesn't bother me that M. Night is shamelessly borrowing from film making legends such as Alfred Hitchcock and Steven Spielberg. The fact is that most directors are influenced just the same, the difference is that other directors tend to obscure such influence. Signs' opening credits features a classic Bernard Herrmann style score that is reminiscent of Hitchcock's Psycho. Also like Hitchcock, M. Night fancies the idea of making guest appearances in his own pictures. As for the Spielberg influence, I merely need to mention Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T. and formulaic themes such as broken home and the black and white simplification of good versus evil. Did I say I highly recommend this film? Well if I didn't, I meant to. M. Night Shyamalan is a four star director within the sci-fi/fantasy/family thriller genre; Signs comes within a few rows of corn to being a four star movie. What remains to be proven by this director is a diversification of genre and a willingness to explore unfamiliar territory as have legends such as Hitchcock, Welles, Kubrick, and Spielberg. Of course there is absolutely nothing wrong with maintaining a career that will put you in company with the likes of heavy hitting specialists John Ford, Martin Scorsese, and Woody Allen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best M. Night Film So Far!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the death of his wife in a freak accident, Reverend Graham Hess questions his faith and even leaves the church. Six months later, he discovers a gigantic crop circle in his yard. Similar events happen all over the world. Graham's children think it's aliens, his brother thinks it's pranksters, and Graham doesn't know what to think. However, as more and more strange events occur, he realizes something big is coming, and it's probably not going to be friendly.I would simply love to say this is one of the best science fiction film and one of the best films ever made. It's a masterpiece. It's brilliant. I loved every minute of it. From one of the best title sequences ever made to the ending. First of all, this is not a CGI blockbuster. I mean, literally, there are a few action scenes in this film, abnormal for an alien invasion film. I love the idea! it's original and the story is more about the family and what they are going through.The film's score is great! This is probably James Newton Howard's best work he has ever done! The music provides something mysterious and obviously give homages to Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Psycho. I also love the simplicity of the film. There's nothing too complex right here. Everything is just there in front of the screen while you go in "awe".I also liked the camera-work done. Another great thing from this is the use of suspense and tension. The first time I've ever seen this (I've seen this movie many times already), it made me crap my pants and I'm not usually scared in movies. In this movie, less is certainly more. Each information is given off little by little until the big finale.I liked the subtle humor in this film. It's certainly not laugh-out-loud funny but it's great to laugh when you're filled with suspense. Mel Gibson's performance is fantastic as well as Joaquin Phoenix. Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin were good too.This film is certainly underrated. Most people didn't like it for the twist ending or the overall conclusion of the movie. It's not that bad, really. It's ridiculous that they don't like the movie for that reason. I even liked this better than The Sixth Sense! This is why people make movies! This film is not just another alien invasion movie. It has many underlying themes to those who want to look deeper into the film.It has a fantastic script, brilliant score, terrific performances, great camera-work, extremely underrated, and is one of the best films ever made! I loved it that much! Do not go into this movie thinking of a CGI-filled film (although it has a $70 million budget) because it's trying to be much more than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing movie!...till the last 30 minutes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't you just hate it when an ending totally ruins a good movie? "Signs" unfortunately is a movie like that.The movie starts of extremely well, with original opening credits and some nice character building. The characters are extremely well portrayed by the entire cast and very realistic and likable. M. Night Shyamalan perfectly knows how to build up a nice atmosphere and tension in a very original way like he did before in his previous well known movies "The Sixth Sense" and "Unbreakable". The movie stays original till the last 30 minutes, after that the movie turns into some standard Sci-Fi movie with all the clichs you can expect. A shame because "Signs" could have very well been the best movie of 2002 and the "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" of the 21st century.But needless to say the movie is not a complete disaster, how could a movie with some many talent (cast as well as crew) involved be. It still has some genius moments that show the amazing talent of M. Night Shyamalan.The use of sound and light makes the movie very tense and yes also really scary at times! Next to "Das Boot" easily the best movie with the use of sound. The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto is over the top at times but a good job nevertheless! And James Newton Howard finally delivers a good score for a M. Night Shyamalan movie (never felt much for "The Sixth Sense" and "Unbreakable" score).All in all still a movie very well worth watching, with some scene's that you will never forget. It just a shame about the last 30 minutes...Let's hope we will get to see many more M. Night Shyamalan projects with endings that will do more justice to the rest of the movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do you guys believe I haven't ever seen this film before? We are in 2011, this movie had a hype for years... I just saw yesterday because a friend of mine told me it was scary to the bone.It is not fake, this movie is really scary and frightening, much more than "The Sixth Sense" and "The Village". The cast is average, I saw no big acting. The story is intriguing, involving and when the director wants to startle the audience, he does it very well. The knife scene was so intense that a girl friend of mine kept screaming for some seconds, while I was motionless because of it's impact.Also, it is interesting and real the fact that some religious people start questioning their own faith in God when some relative dies. And it is understandable that the ex father didn't want to pray anymore, he was frustrated with his "god". The twist in the end was interesting and unexpected also, Mr. Shaylaehoasdebna did it again!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Signs" is about a widowed and now faithless ex-priest who discovers a crop circles in his field. Afterwards, many other countries discover these same crop circles and the rumor of extra-terrestrials begins to spread. His children begin to research the extra-terrestrials. Are they real, are they not real? And will the widowed priest gain his faith again? Only the viewer can say.Overall, it's one of my favorite M. Night Shyamalan movies, and the first of his that I saw actually. As with every other M. Night Shyamalan movie, I won't give anything away, because you'll have to see it for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>much credit for a fantastic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently viewing the votes for this particular movie have shown it to be at a 7 of 10, which is FAR too low. to be honest, many of my friends I speak with, tell me that director M. Night Shyamalan is a "sham" and an overall bad director, but they could not be more wrong. Although many of his more famous works (signs, the village, etc...) seem to rely upon the suspense that builds up the climax of the movie, which may make younger or 'less intelligent' persons to become quickly uninterested, it is within this style that he shines. for example, multiple scenes in the movie would show Mel Gibson in some scary and harrowing situation, (I:E: in the abandoned house with the alien trapped in the pantry), where you the viewer KNOWS that someone or something is watching him, possibly even on the verge of the attack. unlike the cheap and clich-riddled, quote-un-quote "horror movies" produced today, signs departs from said cheap-theatrics, and think; the thought being utilized here, :what will happen next? it is what the viewer cannot see, that the should and do fear. Also, many little messages and morals can be received throughout the movie, one such example: Don't give up hope or faith. All things considered, signs is a rocking good time, that plays out like Jaws, but with a classic Hitchcock ending. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M. Night Shyamalan's annoying direction style actually works here!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Shyamalan has made three good movies in my opinion (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs), which happen to be his three consecutive drama/thrillers. Shyamalan's most recent films may have some good qualities to them, but they aren't exceptional in any way because of his poor and repetitive direction. In Signs, he got lucky that his direction of the actors happened to work. In every one of his movies, he has the actors at moment of "extreme drama" whisper to each other, no matter where they are, and it's a strange and usually ineffective technique. Here, for some reason it worked...probably because Mel Gibson is a good enough actor to actually convey the drama that was meant to be shown in the scenes. Shyamalan also does this annoying thing where he has a character ask another character something and they look away and give a belated answer of a nod or a small head shake. These techniques don't seem that bad, but when every movie he makes has the same character direction, you wonder how diverse or good of a director this person actually is. Luckily, any of his techniques were lost among the powerful script, enthralling story and overall real drama that this movie has.Alien crop circles are appearing various places all over the world. One of them is on the Hess's farm. Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is an ex-priest who lost his faith after his wife was killed in a car accident. Also living on the farm are his brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix) and his two kids Bo (Abigail Breslin) and Morgan (Rory Culkin). Aliens start appearing on the farm, never actually visible, usually hiding in the cornfields, and Graham feels he must board up the house. Drama and some pretty tense and suspenseful scenes ensue.M. Night Shyamalan's screenplays seem to try to be deep, and this movie actually felt sort of deep. Not to give away any spoilers, but signs can be found in many ways, not just in the crop fields. The movie is funny when it's trying to be, and sad when it's trying to be, and even at times it sent a chill down my spine from some of the scares thrown in, and they aren't just the typical jump scares. The characters are likable and pretty easy to connect with as real people. It can be slow at times, which is true with any of the director's (I'm tired of writing out his last name) movies, but most of the slow scenes added to character development. Up to this point M. Night was known for his surprising twist endings, and the ending is sort of a twist here, but it was also just a great ending.I've come to realise that M.N.S. is not as great a writer or director as he was once touted, but he still has made some really good movies, and this was a wonderful one. Please Mr. Shyamalan, come out of your stage of mediocrity and come up with another great movie like this one!My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 110 mins. PG-13 for terror and language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film is better than all the critics make it out to be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, just to clarify - this is not M. Night Shyamalan's BEST work. However, this movie is still good, and does not deserve all the abuse that seems to be hurled at it here.Within the movie, all the key points which people say make it an awful movie, are explained, and if you just think logically, you will notice this.Overly Relgious: Some people claim that the film is overly religious, however it is religion that is being promoted - it is faith, which is different. The movie can be interpreted many different ways; this is just one of them.Aliens have interstellar technology and cannot open doors: Aliens, like the name suggests, do not know our planet, and most likely have never encountered doors, and locked doors for that matter also, so they do not IMMEDIATELY know how to open them. HOWEVER if you notice within the film they are referred to as "problem solvers" which is how they discovered how to get into the coal shoot. This explains how the alien which Mel Gibson cuts its fingers off, must have learnt eventually how to use doors and get out of doors locked by a chair propped against them.THE WATER: This one is a biggy, and the main criticism of the movie: the fact that aliens get hurt by water. I do not think this is necessarily stupid. They might not have even experienced water until going to earth, and the movie never even theorises to where the aliens came from - they could have come from Mars, for all we know. It is the same story as War of the Worlds - no one is criticising War of the Worlds because aliens were defeated by viruses on earth - in fact people seem to applaud it. The aliens might not have encountered it yet, and when they did; they left the planet.Why would aliens come to a planet just to eat us? Surely they have other sources of food on their own planet - or if they have such good technology could do so? The suggestion in the movie is that aliens are vegetarians, and it seems that their natural resources, or their farming land or something went wrong on their planet, and they came to ours. It also seems that they have been pushed into such dire straights they have to resort to killing humans. There is no comment to them NOT slaughtering animals for food - as they killed the dog in the movie, and could well have eaten it. It seems that they just want to survive, whether it means killing humans or not.Why are they naked in the movie with no good technology for killing humans, or at least making them easier to eat? The aliens came from dire straights on their own planet so they could survive (supposedly) and if this were true, they might not have the technology at all, or available at this time for this kind of warfare - it might be new to them, or they could have left with non-or little of it. You have to remember that the film is just following the case of four people on a farm - who is to say other people in the world didn't run into more trouble.I hope this shows how the movie, isn't completely silly, and that it is in fact a good film.Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Signs isn't an alien invasion movie and that's why it's awesome.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Principal photography started right on the heels of 9/11. The ideas of faith and redemption in the face of tremendous personal loss are the elements that drive this story. It's a hybrid genre. Shyamalan's wraps his primary message in suspense thriller, and there are plenty of bumps in the night. The mise-en-scene and production design is incredible, and there are plenty of gems in the cinematography and acting too. This is some of Shyamalan's best.It's true that the alien invasion logic is not utterly thought out. They make some serious mistakes. But look at America in Iraq, or Vietnam for Christ's sake. Never underestimate the power of hubris.If anyone feels like complaining about this film, it's because they got something different from what they expected. When will Shyamalan's marketing team learn to stop promoting his films like teen slashers? They are intellectual thrillers and if you go in knowing that, you're in for a terrific piece of drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was a great movie because this is not supposed to be an actiony, suspense movie, it is a movie sending a message to always have faith. Of course not everything was perfect like the aliens and water condensing the aliens would die since they have a weakness and that is water. Take this for example: In the movie, they say everything happens for a reason. His son had asthma and if he didn't he would of died from the poison. If his daughter Bow didn't think the water was old and gross, they couldn't of killed the alien by hitting him into the water. If Grahm's brother didn't have the bat he set the record with on the wall, he couldn't of hit the alien into the water and if Grahm's wife didn't tell Grahm to tell Marrel to swing away, he wouldn't remember the bat on the wall. This movie is not just for entertainment, it's to send the message that God is always with you and to always have faith. Oh and I thought the music was great.</fullReview>

I didn't have a problem with any of these elements.The main problem with this work was the creature effects. As a creature feature, this one falls flat. As a sci-fi, it rates as a "B" movie because of the hokey, ill-designed aliens. The story was quite compelling, but the effects left a LOT to be desired.It's still an entertaining work, but it could have been much, MUCH better.It rates a 6.6/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A profound and spiritual movie hidden in a great horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a thoroughly excellent movie, in every aspect. The acting, writing, direction, camera work, and sound editing and score are so well meshed, they flow together as you forget that you are only watching a movie. The title is a metaphor with multiple meanings, the least important being the crop circles which are used in the promotional posters and trailers for the movie. The beauty of this movie is the way Mel Gibson's character lets us experience both the unbelievable societal events occurring, as well as a more profound inner transformation of faith and perspective. There are so many scenes to savor in this movie, ones that touch every possible emotion, and the ending is powerful and satisfying. It is impossible not to be swept up along with this story and its characters. Don't think too hard about the rationale for the alien invasion and the predominance of water on our planet-that is one of the only problems or flaws in the movie. Shyamalan leaves the viewer with closure, but questions, and room for different interpretations. A beautiful, mesmerizing, frightening, and uplifting movie experience!</fullReview>

The children's' mother. The father however is alive and well and with the help of his brother Merrill Hess, the family is doing well for themselves. One morning however that all changed. On a seemingly normal morning, Graham was woken up by his daughter Bo's screaming. He went to investigate with his brother Merrill. What they found would change their lives forever. With the incident all over the news and more of these incidents occurring around the world, it looks as though there is something strange happening.Signs is my favorite movie of 2002. Everything it has to offer is of top quality. The acting in this movie is fantastic, the suspense is just brilliant, and the effects for the alien are great. Mr. Shyamalan has created himself a masterpiece. I have never witnessed a movie with suspense so effective! It keeps you guessing until the end and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. This is how a sci-fi thriller should be made. Mr. Shyamalan really knew what he was doing when he made this movie. It is the work of a genius. There is no other way to put it. It is sheer brilliance.the verdict: A brilliant example of how a thriller should be made.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a simply brilliant and well-made movie is "Signs" by Manoj Night Shyamalan. The ingenious ideas of linking the whole movie with aliens, coincidences, the existence of a supreme power, the ever wavering human mind and how events change a person for good or bad Mel Gibson is one of the greatest actors I have seen And the script has been so well written that it suits perfectly for a person like him. The super caring and concerned Father who is going through a personal misery. And the two kids have played their parts brilliantly too. Especially the little girl is really cute. And the brother has played his part really well. Everyone has played their parts so well that the movie feels so real. The movie's script has been really well thought. The way the things are linked right from the beginning till the very end. Including the brain nerves of Mel's wife going all crazy and recollecting "Swing away" and Mel thinking about his wife all though the movie resulting in the outstanding climax that suits this movie perfectly. The boy having asthma and the aliens secreting small amounts of poison. This movie is quite simply made of coincidences and has been put forth brilliantly. And the very simple fact that they hardly even show the Alien, is the best part. One of the many concepts of crop circles being for navigation and they are for forming maps . The aliens using only hand to hand combat as they know that humans would eventually use nuclear weapons making the planet useless . Shows how well the movie has been made. The dialogs have been so well written. Touching , really sensible &amp; perfectly written in context. Yes there are some clichs here and there that cannot be avoided while making a movie. When the family decides to vote as to what they want to do there one, Mel Gibson says, "my vote counts as two cos I represent two parents"... Typical parent behavior It's a brilliant emotional, scary, family movie...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, there are scientific inconsistencies with this cleverly paced, highly entertaining movie. However, the majority of criticisms are based on things WE know; not on things that the aliens may (or may not) know. Maybe the aliens can't stand something chemical in TREATED water. Did anyone consider the fact that fluoride may be the deadly component? Perhaps they've never even SEEN a wooden door before, let alone housing such as ours; and tend not to break doors down because they don't know what lies beyond them. And we have no idea what they may actually want human bodies for ...so what if humans are made out of water, perhaps they extract enzymes or something.Taking these things into consideration, it's a bit easier to suspend one's disbelief. Plus, I'm an atheist and even I didn't mind the spiritual tie-in to the movie's plot line. After all, spirituality is supposed to have meaning to those who believe it, and this movie merely affirms such.I found the movie to be alternately frightening and humorous; open your mind and you will too!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shyamalan's Best-- A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs is one of the most touching, thought-provoking films I have seen in years. It is Mel Gibson's best movie since Lethal Weapon, and an amazing piece of art by M. Night Shyamalan. What Shyamalan does with his films is so much more intelligent and awe-inspiring than the dreadfully meaningless films we see today, that filmmakers like Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis should be embarrassed to say they work in the same business as him.To call Signs a thriller is wrong. Watch it with your kids, your entire family. It is on of those movies where you don't just watch it, you experience it. And after it is finished, you will want to see it again. Signs is about a former pastor who now lives on his farm with his children and brother, whom is helping him out after a family tragedy. One morning, they wake up to find an enormous crop circle in their corn field. Once these begin popping up across the globe, strange things begin happening. Signs is the story of one family who face their fears, their past, and the terrifying present as the world is being invaded No you might have read that thinking "Oh boy another alien flick". This is NOT an alien flick. I wont even say if aliens appear in the movie--because it doesn't matter. What this film plays on is not special effects, loud explosions or extreme-action sequences; it is something entirely different. Quiet. Never has there been a film where silence is more scary. M. Night Shyamalan is one masterful director. He can get an audience to cry so brilliantly--I have never seen so many people cry in one theater Please, do yourself a favor, and see this movie. Its got one of the greatest endings of any movie I've seen, and as one last tip--don't think about all the technical stuff when its over Just enjoy it You will be glad you did</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a "sign" that Shyamalan's work may have been deteriorating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Sixth Sense" was great (I literally did not see that ending coming); "Unbreakable" was passable (I didn't predict the ending that time either); "Signs" was dragging at best. It might have been slightly better without all the religious stuff. And anyway, if the aliens are allergic to water, how were they able to enter our atmosphere? And if they can travel through space, why can't they open a simple door? As for Mel Gibson, I heard that "The Passion of the Christ" was basically an anti-Semitic screed, so that weakens Gibson's appearance in any movie. And no doubt Joaquin Phoenix is a lot prouder of "Walk the Line" than of this. Just why M. Night Shyamalan - who plays a larger role here than he usually does in his movies - had to do this, I'll never understand. "Scary Movie 3" may have been ridiculous, but at least they spoofed this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Minor SpoilerGraham Hess (Mel Gibson) is a recently widowed farmer and ex-Father. He is grieving due to the death of his wife in an accident caused by a car driven by a neighbor. His son and daughter, and his young brother (Joaquin Phoenix) live with him. One day, they find some mysterious signs in his cornfield and along the movie they will realize that aliens are invading Earth. In 1953, the tale of H.G. Well was greatly adapted in the screen in 'The War of the Worlds'. In 1996, we have basically the same story, in 'Independence Day', using lots of special effects and a computer virus (instead of an influenza virus) to defeat the aliens. Now, M. Night Shyamalan presents us basically the same plot, replacing the virus by water, but in a different perspective: inside an isolated farmhouse, with a very few special effects (basically sound effects), showing a simple family frightened. In the end, I found it a nice Sci-Fi movie. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Sinais" ("Signs")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My thoughts on M. Night Shyamalan's SIGNSRated: PG (Canada), PG-13 (U.S.)Starring: Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Kulkin, Abigail Breslin, Cherry Jones and M Night Shayamalan"Daddy there's a monster beside my bed, can I have a glass of water?"When Graham (Mel Gibson) and Merill Hess (Joaquin Phoenix) discover 50 ft circle and square shapes carved in their crops, the two try and find out the truth behind what is going on. However, what Graham learns soon is that the battle he will soon be facing is not that of extra terrestrial beings but that within his own self.In facing a universal theme of life on other planets, Shyamalan's handling is different from your ordinary type of supernatural movie. This is because the underlying theme of this movie is not aliens, but in fact, it is faith. Faith in something larger, faith of miracles, faith that nothing in this life is coincidental and everything happens for a reason. The theme of this movie is not survival of outer forces rather than survival of internal and seemingly more powerful than what is even happening outside.There is not a single movie that is out there which scares the viewer on a level of things they are NOT seeing rather than what they do see. It does not deserve to be classified in any category because this film is in a league of its own. The base of supernatural and extra terrestrial beings in this case forms the base for human self exploration and finding who they truly are.PERFORMANCESIn all sequences, Shyamalan concentrates on character development and even from the first scene, we seemingly have a look into the world of a man, who is emotionally wounded, and yet silent and powerful. Shyamalan has gone with Mel Gibson to play the title role, which some fans of M. Night would have rather gone with Bruce Willis who has played the quiter type role in Sixth Sense and even starred in Shyamalan's "Unbreakable". However, from the very first frame, you can see that Gibson becomes the role and lives through the role. In terms of his performance, the transformation he goes through the entire frame of the movie really is a true testament to the powerful skill that this actor embodies. In many scenes, his eyes do the talking, and it takes a powerful director to really capitalize on what Gibson does in this type of role.Joaquin Phoenix, playing Graham's brother Merill, is a powerful support in the movie. His character gains a lot of sympathy. Even as he is trying to find his place in the world, his support for his family is unwavering, making this role one of the most sympathetic and yet powerful roles the talented actor has ever faced.Once again, Shyamalan gets unbelievably powerful performances from his child artistes in this movie. Rory Culkin, playing Graham's son in the movie, as well as Abigial Breslin, give such emotion filled performances that it really surprises us that Shyamalan can extract performances of this calibre from them.Even Cherry Jones, who plays the local police officer, puts in a realistic and heartfelt performance as the local police officer in Graham's community.Finally, Shyamalan himself makes a mark in the film. His role is an essential one and yet does not require many scenes. Shyamalan pulls them off with full ease and power.DIRECTION/SCREENPLAYIf you try and compare "Signs" to any previous movies you may be able to find some ground from this movie in Shyamalan's first movie, "The Sixth Sense". However, in terms of comparisons, this is where they end. Shyamalan knows how to create and move in terms of environment, which is very important for all his movies. Shyamalan's direction is powerful and really gets under the skin of the characters.Being a thriller, Shyamalan has used an older technique, where he uses comedy to offset a particular mood, even in the gravest of scenes. Shyamalan pulls this off extremely well, even as the screenplay pulls into frightening moments. It takes a brilliant filmmaker to do something like this even when the mood of the scene is totally contrasting to that of what the audience is experiencing.Its something refreshing to see a brand new director like Shyamalan using the rules of filmmaking that have been forgotten by many of the newer filmmakers these days into making something so powerful and so refreshingly different for the summer. While many new filmmakers base their movies on subjects that really don't take any risks, Shyamalan has made a seemingly new genre, one of self exploration and discovery while in the face of fear or adversity. There is no other film like this one, as it takes two genres and really powers itself into making a seemingly hard hitting combination.Even the title of the film has a meaning, as the signs are everywhere. There are subtle and hidden messages everywhere, from the scene where Merill is in the Army office and the Recruiter is speaking, or the flashback sequences which Mel Gibson has of a particular incident in his life.OVERALL EFFECTThis film is unlike any other film to have ever come out in the genre of supernatural thriller or drama. Its something that lets you leave the cinema thinking truly that in this life there are no coincidences and things happen for a reason. As Gibson said in the film, there are two kinds of people. There are those who believe that everything happens for a reason and that we are not alone; and there are those who believe that we live in metaphysical solitude. There are people with faith and without it. He now has to figure out which group he belongs to, and so he does in the chilling climax.The film is one of the most powerful pieces of cinema I have witnessed and simply put is a much watch.Rating: 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not anything to do with aliens...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>and everything to do with belief and fear.M. Night Shyamalan is a genius. He can write, direct and guide a film better than anyone living or dead. While Steven Spielberg is his equal as director, he cannot write as well.This film is so perfect, so finely-tuned, crafted and sewn together, it will accompany you around for days to come.It doesn't matter the theme is "aliens invading Earth," as that has nothing to do with the film. It could have been "KKK burning a black family's home" or "Nazis killing Jews." This film, in its entirety, is about the experience of being human. That it's juxtaposed against aliens just makes it more interesting. Two disparate species who want the same thing: to survive.What makes this film so important is the dialogue. The script is tight, each weft and warp - each thread - pulled tightly into the weave of the whole. Each word is polished and trenchant. There is not a single wasted or unnecessary sentence. Even the unexpected humor belonged right *there*. For that, Shamalayan deserved recognition. I have no idea why "Signs" wasn't nominated for any of the Oscars. Three of the five nominated films bored me silly, while "Signs" kept me riveted in my seat. If that's not the mark of a great film, then I don't understand the medium.Brilliant director, brilliant screenplay and film and brilliant cast. Mel Gibson has had a 50/50 success rate with his roles, but this one of a man struggling with the destruction of his faith, is on the uptick side of his performances.Joaquin Phoenix is riveting, absolutely riveting, as a lost man clinging to the broken shards of a past neither brilliant nor terrible, but somewhere in a destructive in-between.The children are eerily un-childlike, yet as vulnerable and tender as only children can be. How Shyamalan wrung such performances out of Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin, I've no idea, but I was mesmerized.I hope the members of AMPAS wake up and realize what a treasure we have in M. Night Shyamalan. I don't want to see - 30 years hence - a "lifetime achievement award" for a man overlooked during his distinguished career.Last comment: Shyalmalan's performance as Ray Reddy was superb. He was important, yet unobtrusive, in the life of the script. That all actors can be so powerful and yet restrained. I saw the Reddy character as the true alien of the film... of this Earth and yet condemned to hell for his actions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well worth it if you're into spooky, eerie films that cover horror and science fiction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Signs is the third film from Shyamalan and the third that I've seen from him. After an impressive debut with The Sixth Sense and a horrid more recent instalment called Lady in the Water, Signs is actually somewhere in the middle in terms of overall quality. It takes some conventions from both films but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. It has all the slow, character driven build up revolving around a single setting (like in Lady in the Water) but it also has, at times, that eerie, uncanny feeling The Sixth Sense contained.The mystery surrounding the odd circles found outside is interesting and maintains a healthy amount of suspense and intrigue. Something a little more disturbing and unsettling, however, is a lot more closer to home. The amount of glasses of water that build up inside the house and the way in which the very young little girl claims that 'they're contaminated' or something to that effect is something very simple done in a very eerie way. It's complemented by the lighting and the way nobody in the family ever smiles or seems happy.As the film unfolds, clues are presented to us and the characters but neither of us are entirely sure of what is going on. The baby monitor is a good example. Up to this point, nobody in the world knows who's doing what or what is going on but over this family's baby monitor, there are some eerie, odd sounding noises that one member of the family actually identifies. Some other family members have other ideas and even we; the audience are allowed to make of it what we will which I thought was quite clever.Onto the characters and the children in particular: the kids seem to be too smart for their own good. Where the adults and brothers of Graham Hess (Gibson) and Merrill Hess (Phoenix) are busy suspecting rival neighbour farmers; the children are busy reading up on extra-terrestrials and solving it themselves ? this is also hinted at later on in the film when Merrill is watching television (allowing people to tell him what to make of it all) whilst the children are busy predicting what the crop circles mean and what might happen next - they're often correct, as well.As Signs builds and builds, its divulge into past events that explain the undeniable feeling of depression in the house is cleverly revealed as is the tension built up for the film's climax which plays out like Night of the Living Dead or quite possibly any film from the 'Dead' trilogy. I'm not too sure how I'd react in a situation like that involving basements and extra terrestrials but I know for one thing that I'd have some sort of weapon lined up ? this is tackled later on but only when the pressure is off to a certain extent and when they're out-numbering the critters.Signs is a good film on the whole, with some impressive tension built up along with good lighting, likable characters that you get a feel for and some clues thrown in at the beginning that add up very simply if thought through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Horror Movie I've Ever Seen..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SIGNS was one of the best movies I've seen so far, or probably it is the best. I have an interest in learning about alien civilization, is there life on other planets, etc. This movie was interesting as it showed us what is probably the views of M. Night Shyamalan on this subject.I thought it was odd how those aliens were injured by the touch of water when actually our oxygen contains a small percentage of water. Maybe they should have said they get injured by a large percentage of water but no one knew that and no one really cares about that.I love how Morgan could hear the aliens on a walkie-talkie and everyone went on top of the vehicle to listen. It really frightened me and I never want to hear that sound again or I will grow insane.When every channel on the television showed the same news report on UFOs and everyone hiding really made me think about the end of the world, also, it reminded me of Hurricane Katrina when I had to stay away from the window because a whole group of people were breaking in a store across the street of my home and looting.The scene where they showed a "recording" of children screaming because there was an alien outside hiding from the bushes at someone's birthday party really freaked me out.I think this movie was a great film and I'm almost too scared to watch it again. But it was a very great film and I recommend it if you have an interest in viewing horror films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best suspense/horror script I've ever seen enacted on the screen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe this to be M. Night Shyamalan's best work to date. The script was very well written and acted out by the cast. There was excellent interaction between all members of the cast, and no scene appeared stilted or contrived. I was intrigued by the cameo role in the movie by Mr. Shyamalan himself; the fact that he didn't portray a "good ol' boy" in the rural town lent to the air of suspicion surrounding his character. The range of emotions that Mel and his "family" displayed were executed believably, and was the main (although far from ONLY) ingredient to the overall excellence of the movie.The script was so well written, the acting by the cast so believable, and the cinematography so precisely executed, that I felt I was literally transported in time and space to the farm, sensing deep within myself, scene by scene, the entire range of emotions that the family went through. Rod Serling and Alfred Hitchcock were excellent mystery writers, but this work by M. Night Shyamalan surpasses them all. Thank you, Mr. Shyamalan, for an excellent, believable story!</fullReview>

Filmmaker M.Night Shyamalan (who also appears onscreen) again plumbs the depths of supernatural and spiritual enigmas with deft lan while precariously walking the razor's edge of preciousness ala Spielberg and Hitchcock yet remaining true to his signature: man's desire to seek what is clearly in front of him (i.e. faith for the faithless).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw it in the cinema, I thought it was one of the creepiest films ever, and made me jump quite a lot, that's without the flashbacks of course. From director M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense, also appearing in the film as Ray Peddy) the story revolves around ex-Reverand Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) with his farm and family, his brother Merril (Joaquin Phoenix, brother of River), son Morgan (Rory Culkin, brother of Macaulay), daughter Bo (Abigail Breslin). His crops have been taken down, and from a birds-eye-view, they could see that something is making "signs", or crop circles. As they wonder further about this incident, they later get closer and closer to other life on the farm and in other parts of the Bucks county. Also starring Cherry Jones as Officer Paski and Patricia Kalember as Colleen Hess. The scenes in the basement were the most tense in the cinema, the flashbacks to Graham's wife's death get in the way, and the small moments of comedy fit in okay, a good science fiction thriller. Worth watching!</fullReview>
