		<shortDescription>Clever little thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A clever idea - an thriller played along real time to involve the viewer directly in the tension and pressure of the deadlines. Depp is forced to kill a senator or his daughter will be killed by Walken and Maffia. He is given a gun and a time limit to carry it out.As the basis for a thriller it doesn't quite work - the real time concept falls apart a few times, but with this much talent on board it still holds it own. A throwback to the Hitchcock everyman thrillers of years ago, Depp plays his character well and you always believe he is just an ordinary man in an unbelievable situation rather than an action hero in the making while Walken does what he does best and plays the villain well.The plot holds together well and you really find stuff out at the same time as Depp does. Some of the conspiracy stuff towards the end of the film is obvious and doesn't add anything to the film, but the main story revolving around Depp and Walken is tense enough to carry the film.It doesn't contain any explosions or martial arts but the tension is good throughout. It's not a classic thriller but it's quite an original idea and plot and almost manages to keep the tension for the whole movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was a pretty good movie. A suspenseful movie, Hitchcockian in that an innocent man gets involved in a deadly plot. An intriguing plot that had me thinking what I would do in the situation. Christopher Walken was, as usual, creepy and Johnny Depp was believable. The rest of the cast was very competent. I'd advise renting it. Not a special effects extravaganza but a nicely written fast moving movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful and Entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read a lot of poor reviews for this movie. I don't understand it. The move is very good, it's not a 5 star movie, but it's still good. Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood) stars as an average guy whose wife has just recently died. One day on the way home, Depp and his daughter are kidnapped by two people, one of them being Christopher Walken (The Deer Hunter, The Dead Zone). They tell him that his daughter will die if he doesn't kill a certain person. He soon finds out that this person is the Governor of his state. They give him a gun and tell him that if she's not dead by a certain time his daughter is dead. This is a great premise for a suspense movie and is carried out very well. The great Charles S. Dutton (Rudy, Mimic) plays a shoe-shiner who helps Depp. Depp is solid as the father in a role that's different from a lot of his earlier roles. The always excellent Walken is, as usual, awesome as the bad guy, a role I always love to see him in. The film keeps you going, by offering a couple of nice twists. Ignore the reviews and rent this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting thriller with an excellent cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Depp takes a break from his usual roles as outcasts, in this playing a clean-cut accountant who travels by train back to LA with his daughter after the wake of his deceased ex-wife. Upon entering the station, 2 people show him a police badge, take him into a van, and blackmail him into assassinating the governor in one hour or else they'll kill his daughter. The remainder of the entire movie takes place in a hotel where the paranoid atmosphere gives clues about how big the conspiracy is and the political motives behind it; with nearly everyone keeping their eye on him and very little time, he's faced with the difficult task of getting out of this situation. A must-see if you like edge of your seat excitement and an excellent cast, with Depp (great as Gene Watson), Marsha Mason, Charles S. Dutton, and Christopher Walken, playing the most despicable bad guy since Laurence Olivier in "Marathon Man".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good little thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Nick of time" is directed by John Badham - man behind an amusing 70's classic "Saturday Night Fever". It was a funny and a jovial little flick but this one goes maybe just a little bit further. "Nick of time" is a splendid, action-packed and entertaining thriller and it creates lots of excitement by practically stealing good ideas from dozens of other thrillers but still keeping the own basic idea as unique as possible. Even though this isn't actually the greatest movie of Johnny Depp or Christopher Walken (mostly because they've appeared in too many unforgettable masterpieces) it's impossible to deny the fact that their roles in here are quite amazing.Depp is great as an ordinary dad of a little girl who's facing the trial of his life and Walken has always been magnificent in the role of a villain. His mean performance as a blackmailer called Mr. Smith is just fabulous. Although "Nick of time" is basically an excellent stuff the idea of the film is unfortunately way too unbelievable. Could this actually happen and is this the way assassins work? Not necessarily... It won't bother too much if you just let the the increasing tension get a hold of you. Best thing of this movie is the fact that it's got absolutely nothing unnecessary in it and it certainly isn't over-long. Exquisite "Nick of time" is an interesting film and it does exactly what it's supposed to do. One of the most functional and successful thrillers of the mid-90's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally underrated film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie in the theater and I have to say that it is one of the most underrated films I have ever seen. This movie received a lot of bad press when it was released but I don't see how it was justified. The story is great and it makes you nervous watching it unfold. You will know what I am talking about if you see it. Christopher Walken gives another great performance as the "policeman" as he calls himself. Walken's voice is one of the best in the business. I highly recommend this movie if you want to be entertained with a great suspenseful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good if far fetched premise makes this movie oddly watchable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An young accountant Gene Wilson (Johnny Deep) arrived at L.A.'s Union Station with his daughter (Courtney Chase). From the moment, they arrived, two mysterious strangers (Oscar-Winner:Christopher Walken and Roma Maffia) separate him from his daughter. One of them proposed Gene to assassinate a government official (Marsha Mason) or else, they will murder his daughter.Directed by John Badham (The Hard Way, Short Circuit, Stakeout) made an entertaining, clever if barely believable. suspense thriller that was filmed in "real time". Which it doesn't always paid off, especially the director used endless close-up of clocks. Which does at times makes this movie claustrophobic but not enough. This was one of the major box office flops and critical disappointments of 1995. But the picture plays surprisingly better on video and went on to have a sort of a cult following years later.DVD has an fine anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an good-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD's only extra is the theatrical trailer. What makes this flawed movie watchable is a game cast, sometimes amusing dark sense of humour and a few good moments of genuine suspense. But at times, the film nearly falls apart from the unlikely false plot moment near the third act and an unsatisfying conclusion. Despite all this, this is a well directed picture that certainly worth a look of this truly real mixed bag film. Written by Patrick Sheane Duncan (Courage Under Fire, A Home of Our Own, Mr. Holland's Opus). (*** ?/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Suspenseful For One Look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most suspenseful movies you'll ever see, but that good for only viewing. After you've seen it, the impact is greatly lost for further viewings.It got panned by many critics for having too far-fetched a storyline, and I agree. However, if you can put your brain on "hold" for 90 minutes, you'll enjoy the movie. The only annoying part for me was the typical Liberal bias in here where the Liberal politician is the target of a Conservative fanatic. They never show you the other way around. At least the writers here were somewhat subtle.As interesting the characters as Johnny Depp usually plays, the two villains in here were more fun to watch than him. Christopher Walken and Roma Maffia were riveting as the killers. Depp actually played a normal person, which is not normal for him.The suspense was so good, I could hardly watch parts of this. That was the best part of the movie. The worst may have been the so-overplayed cliché of the killers hesitating before shooting and then, because of that, being shot themselves. That is so tiresome. Or sometimes the crooks talk instead of shoot, and then are shot. It's one of critic Robert Ebert's biggest pet peeves and I agree with him. It's another reason this film got low grades by most critics. However, this "real time" movie (trying to get the viewer even more involved), is guaranteed, if you've never seen it, to give you an entertaining hour-and-a-half.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you see the name Wes Craven, John Carpenter or Brian de Palma, we know that we can trust that we're in for a couple of hours of fine entertainment.Although not as much a household name as the directors above, John Badham knows how to tell a suspenseful story as well as any of the other "kids on the block." Please look up his filmography and see all the countless house of excellent entertainment he has brought us; not only on the big screen but on television as well.In "Nick of Time" John carefully guides us through one disaster after another. Johnny Depp conveys his frustration and fear that he might not be able to prevent any of the bad things that will happen.Christopher Walken again proves that he is as comfortable being the "heavy" as he has been the "hero."At a time when sometimes the good guys don't always win and the bad guys sometimes "get away with it," this is one cinematic thriller that should keep you on the edge of your seat the whole 90 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has some nice elements, but very flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie a couple of years ago I thought it was pretty good. Seeing it again I can't remember what I thought was good about it. There are some enjoyable things like Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken; it seems that everything these actors do has some joy in it. Another nice thing is that the movie plays in real time. The movie is ninety minutes long, and so is the story.Walken orders Depp to kill a woman, the governor of California (Marsha Mason), and to persuade him he and some others kidnap his little daughter. He is given a gun by Walken. He has ninety minutes to do so and we see that ninety minutes. My problem with this movie is the Walken character. Although he is enjoyable to watch, he pops up everywhere, only to serve the plot and make things harder for Depp. Help comes from Huey (Charles S. Dutton), how I will not reveal, but his qualities and handicaps are only there to serve the plot, again. There are some clever moments, I liked them, but I kept wondering things.Pretty early in the movie we learn that almost everybody is in the conspiracy to kill the woman, including members of the security. There must have been an easier way to kill this woman when security is on your side. I kept thinking about that, spoiling parts of the movie for me. Still, if you like Depp or Walken you might enjoy this since both are on screen almost the entire time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything in that movie is phony. The basic thing if you want to make a good suspense film is that the situation is believable and you can identify with the protagonist and think: "Oh my Gosh that could happen to me" "If it does, I would react exactly like this"... In this film a very strong and professional outfit (Christopher Walken) wants to kill the governor of California (we'll never know why) during a political meeting (so corny, already in 1995).This outfit include almost everybody except the governor herself, including all the security crew (!??). And in order to do that they kidnap some guy (Johnny Depp) and his daughter randomly at the train station, give a gun to this guy (who has never used a gun before in his life) and tell him that if he doesn't kill the governor at 1:30 pm they will execute his daughter. Off course the guy doesn't want to do it and try to escape them but Christopher Walken keeps popping up from everywhere to keep the pressure on Johnny Depp. So the question is: "Why didn't they hire some hit-man to do the job????"Because there would have been no film? Yes, it's true but it would have made more sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overwrought and under thought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The consistent struggle for originality in the genre of action thrillers has lead to certain less than outstanding premises being lauded as innovative - Nick of Time being a perfect example. While the premise of an everyman being blackmailed into murder to prevent his daughter's murder is undeniably a clever one, showing glimmers of Hitchcock, it was hardly an instant meal ticket to a successful film. In the hands of a sturdy, capable filmmaker and boasting a taut, terse script, Nick of Time might have evolved into a nail biting masterpiece of tension, but as it is, the results fall disappointingly short of initial expectations. While the idea of the film's plot unfolding in real time is intriguing, despite its concise hour and a half length the film still feels overlong, as if it is pushing its slight concept over too extended a period, leading to many repetitions or slack moments as opposed to the taut, gripping thriller it intended to be. Director John Badham (name related puns were just bound to surface given the quality of his work here) appears uncomfortable with the notion of an intense, claustrophobic thriller, and continually inundates the film with long shots, as if attempting to broaden its scope - the result being an expansive laxity of the tension which was ultimately necessary to make the film a success. Similarly, despite its "thriller" classification, the action in the film is restricted to only two brief setpieces (one being an ill- advised dream sequence), suggesting its being primarily fuelled by suspense and emotional tension - however, apart from the odd patch of effectively generated tension, the film is so poorly executed on these fronts that it is often simply a lackluster, or simply uninteresting watch, falling short of expectations that were never terribly high to begin with. The paltry, often laughable script offers nothing more than poor lines, a mostly entirely absent sense of palpable tension and frequent absurdly inexplicable character motivations (seeing as Walken's character oversees the pending murder so closely, why not simply do the job himself?) leading to plot twists which make little sense. Even the initially appealing premise reveals itself to be a thinly thought out one, complete with dollops of plot holes too large to be swallowed up by the pithy enjoyment factor. While some peculiar cinematography adds a mildly unique quality to the film, the ever so subtle recurring visual motif of clocks or watches serves to slow the film down rather than amp up the tension.Despite being deprived a venue for his usual lunacies, Johnny Depp does what he can with the role of a harried everyman blackmailed into an assassination plot, exuding enough charisma to keep the thin premise afloat. Christopher Walken has a great deal more fun, oozing wild eyed menace as the mysterious captor coercing Depp into murder, and delivering the only really noteworthy performance of the film. Charles S. Dutton is amusing as a jovial shoe shiner swept into the midst, though his character's offbeat humour more often than not seems out of place considering his grim surroundings. Roma Maffia puts a slightly inventive spin on the archetypal hostage captor, but Marsha Mason gives an embarrassingly melodramatic rendition of the threatened senatorial candidate, Depp's target. Similarly, Courtney Chase fulfils just about every "irritating little girl" cliché in the book as Depp's kidnapped daughter, doing little to sympathise the character in the audience's eyes. While the film can hardly be described as anywhere near as downright despicable as it might have become, disappointing is indeed the word of choice as a decently intriguing premise is overwhelmed by inattentive, lacklustre directing and lazy screen writing generating hardly a scrap of tension in a film intended to thrive on it. While the odd sliver of enjoyment can frequently be extracted from the experience, most would be well advised to avoid Nick of Time apart from those willing to tolerate its glaring inadequacies. -5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just an "OK" movie, has some cleverness the second half.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After once again seeing Walken's fine comedic performance in "Blast From The Past", I looked up "Nick of Time" at my public library. A bonus was Johnny Depp, whom I always enjoy. The first 20 or 30 minutes I considered turning it off, it seemed that "uninteresting". However, my wife and I stuck with it, and found the second half fairly interesting, and even entertaining at times. The 90-minute movie takes place over a 90-minute period one day.SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW. Not revealed chronologically, the California governor's (Marsha Mason) husband (Peter Strauss) and most of her "security" force had plotted to have her killed at the hotel during the afternoon political rally for her re-election. Mr. Smith (Walken) came up with the absurd idea that if they kidnapped a man and his girl, and held her under threat of death, they could give the man a gun and have him kill the governor to save the girl. So they were at the airport looking for a likely candidate when they happened upon Gene Watson (Depp), an accountant, and his young daughter Lynn. Holding Lynn in a van, Mr. Smith looks silly to me, following Gene around, telling him "you have to do it, you have to shoot her." This is where I considered that turning it off might be the best choice. However ...MORE SPOILERS FOLLOW. Common sense dictates that Gene would never be able to kill the governor, it just isn't right, even if it means saving your child. So the plot never worked for me. I would have shot Mr. Smith the first chance I got, then take my chances. Anyway Gene eventually recruits the shoe shine man Huey (Charles Dutton), who eventually storms the van outside to disarm the lady and free the child. In a funny scene leading up to that, Huey pretends to be deaf, and overhears Mr. Smith and Gene talking about the "job", which convinces him Gene's story is valid. So, in the end Gene ends up shooting Mr. Smith, which I thought all along would be the outcome, it just happened differently.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The cast, the crew (I guess), the props, the set, the acting were all fine, it was just the story that was sorely lacking. We all have to suspend our disbelief to a certain extent when watching a movie, but we shouldn't be asked to work quite so hard at it.Right from the git-go, to think that a professional "hit" squad would relinquish all control of their upcoming, VERY high profile job to a complete stranger, strains credulity to it's breaking point. That and one fortunate coincidence after another (like finding a capable, former soldier, who not only believes a very fantastic tale, but is willing and able to IMMEDIATELY arrange numerous details to save everyone's life)just constantly reminds you that this flimsy story couldn't possibly be really happening.So, nice try, but next time, strive for a teensy bit more believability, huh?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Depp, Walken, and Dutton get 5 out of 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILER*This movie has its good tools-- like its cast, and the suspense. However, it was the bad parts I couldn't overlook. The holes in the plot are retarded. For instance, these conspirators include the governor's husband, the head of her security, multiple guards, the husband's "colleague"(the guy that gets away in the car at the end), and Mr. Smith (Christopher Walken's character). I mean they have some insane resources, it could be done very easily. But the idea they come up with is to wait at the train station and blackmail an ordinary guy to assassinate the governor at a big campaign speech. Such an obviously doubtful way of going about it.If Gene Watson (Jonny Depp's character) was clear thinking then the movie would have been ten minutes long. By the way, whats up with Watson? Is he supposed to be slow? They do a horrible job of making him look brave. Why didn't he just kill Mr. Smith when he first gave him the gun at the station, and he then could shoot Ms. Jones (Roma Maffia's character) and grab his daughter. Just the once he got with the program in the middle of the movie, when he was standing right next to his daughter and pointing the loaded gun at the woman's forehead. Yet, he decides he would take his chances going back into the hotel, like it caught him off guard the lady had a gun or something. He should have asked her a question like "Are you sure you can trust that man? There is too much pointing at him now, and he just told to me he is going to get rid of you too" or whatever just to get her to think, and just shoot her in the head. How about after its all over and the governor finds Watson and the shoe-shiner (Charles Dutton's character), and she talks to him for a minute or two like all he did was find her wallet for her. Nice to meet you again. Oh, and call my office if you guys need anything. I mean, how about making it point to get a good job for the one-legged, veteran shoe shiner? Or making sure Watson and his daughter have a nice place to sleep? She should make an effort to do something nice for them at least. It is hard to see her not being very appreciative in real life, and there are too many parts in the movie where there are little holes like that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd like to say that although the script was horrible at least Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken made the film worth a watch. We're talking about two fine American actors here.But, even if you've enjoyed every performance you've ever seen from Johnny Depp or Christopher Walken, take a pass on this movie. I've never seen a more uninspired performance from either of them. Ever.As for the script here's the deal - Some people who are politically connected want a certain governor dead. These are high powered people with serious money and inside connections with law enforcement. It would be very difficult to stop them.Well, unless of course their plan was "Let's grab some random stranger off a train, kidnap his daughter and blackmail him into killing the governor for us." Yea, that's gonna work.The Three Stooges in a Banana Republic might come up with a assassination scheme like this. It still wouldn't work, but at least it would be more fun to watch.I won't spoil it for you and tell you how things work out for Johnny Depp and his daughter but then again, do I really have to? And what's up with all the revolvers? I haven't seen this many revolvers in a film since the Dirty Harry films in the 1970's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real time thriller that's half an hour too long.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A suspense thriller that gets by on a tense plot with the audience unable to see the outcome, which becomes evermore tedious which each repeat viewing.Mild-mannered Mr Watson has ninety minutes to kill the governor, or his little girl will be murdered, and everyone he turns to for help is in on it. A shame there is nothing else to the film.The opening credits with close-ups of clocks and guns should set the tone for the film, which comes across more like a television episode than a motion picture, full of amateurish tilty cameras and endlessly repetitive scenes to stress the predicament Mr Watson is in, but just make it hard to watch. The lack of character development, and the fact that some scenes do not include Mr Watson make what John Badham is going for in his direction a mystery.Christopher Walken as Mr Smith, the hit man forcing Mr Watson into this situation, is more irritating than scary, as he constantly pops up and checks his watch, as if he is waiting for Mr Watson to finish in a shopping queue rather than commit murder.The climax is a disappointment, as the whole film balances on the audience's desire to know how Mr Watson will get out of this situation, only to find at the climax he still has no idea, and the final shot of the film, of the man behind it all getting away is redundant, as both Watson and the governor know he is in on it, so he's going to get caught.Enjoyable suspenseful thriller if there's nothing better on, but not of good enough quality, and not one for repeat viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Formulaic and terribly clichéd.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've seen one clichéd, formulaic, predictable action-thriller than you've already seen Nick of Time. The story centers around the recently widowed Gene Watson (Johnny Depp) and his daughter who are stopped by two 'police officers' when they get off their train. The mysterious Mr. Smith (Christopher Walken) hands Gene a pistol and a picture of a Governor; he then tells Gene that he has ninety minutes to kill the woman or his daughter's life will be taken instead. Thus ensues a mildly entertaining journey of Gene trying to figure a way out, while Smith barks orders at him the entire time. Walken's performance is way too over-the-top and I'm hoping that Depp only did this film because of how vastly diverse it is from his other 1995 release, Jim Jarmusch's surreal western Dead Man. Nick of Time contains every cliché in the book and the finale is completely predictable and unrealistic. Some mild entertainment, a very short running time and the fact that I always love to watch Depp barely make up for the formulaic mess this film is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie Christopher Walken &amp; Johnny Depp would want to forget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick of Time is less than a typical run-of-the mill Hollywood movie with an idiotic plot. The basic idea has been done many times before (better and more believably) and Christopher Walken did not present his character as well as he has in most other movies (he did have little to work with) and the whole, if you are a fan of either Johnny Depp or Christopher Walken (or in my case both) this movie is best avoided. Better to leave them in the high esteem they both deserve... To add fuel to an already dismal fire, the supporting actors were poor at best (particularly Roma Maffia). The 'hook' is that the movie is filmed in 'real' time and it quickly becomes obvious this could have (and should have) been a 10 minute film. Throw in the convenient 'how did he get from there to there' suddenly scenes the entire movie is quite simply a shocker.</fullReview>

But, too many people are involved for the plot to be plausible, including the governor's husband and her security guards. Depp gets too many time reprieves and even passes up the chance to kill the kidnapper holding his daughter captive. This movie's plotline is not rooted in reality at all and the viewer must suspend all notions of reality to participate in this movie. Don't waste your time or money on this one.

Walken steals the film (what's new?) as the ubiquitous villain of the piece while Depp's taut portrayal of the emotionally stretched father is both believable and captivating. It is still Walken's "I love that guy" speech that sticks firmly in the mind making one truly root for the hero whilst despising (yet respecting) the nemesis. The inspiration for the format for "24", the original and still the best. If you're looking for a tense thriller watch "The Game".

		<fullReview>It is not a gratifying task to write a bad review on a movie. I am doing it to save some of my soul mates from spending valuable ninety minutes on this movie.The plot is an unpleasent mix of boring predictability and irritating implausibility. The actors (believe it or not: even Christopher Walken) are struggling to push through the irrealistic and unjustifiable actions of their cartoon-like characters. The athmosphere, the political message, the acting, the plot... It just doesn't work.Even if you are not fastidious about the depth and credibility of the movies you like, this one may easily ruin your evening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Standard Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The clock is ticking for Johnny Depp in Nick of Time, a twist-filled, race-against-time thriller directed by John Badham. And indeed it is a race, filmed in "real time" so that on screen events unfold minute by nail-biting minute as they would in real life.Christopher Walken, Charles S. Dutton and Courtney Chase co-stars in this film.A stranger pulled into a deadly scheme races against time to save his daughter in this thriller. Gene Watson is an accountant who comes to L.A. with his ten-year-old daughter Lynn to attend a funeral. On the street, Gene and Lynn are pulled aside by Mr. Smith and Ms. Jones, who flash what look like police badges and usher them into a van. Gene soon discovers that he's been kidnapped, and his captors have an unusual demand that is if Gene does not murder Gov. Eleanor Grant within 75 minutes, his daughter will be killed. Gene now has just an hour and a quarter to tip off the authorities, spare Gov. Grant, and find out what Smith and Jones are trying to do, along with saving his daughter's life. He finds a much-needed ally in one-legged shoe-shine man Huey. This is a fast and furious 90 minutes that doesn't waste a second.Also,it is an exciting albeit illogical tale of mystery and suspense.Unfortunately,this is an average movie that was saved by the excellent performances of the cast particularly Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken. Aside from that,the plot is clichéd and predictable as well as it has been already seen in many movies before even with "real time" involved in the premise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp as your average Joe C.P.A.?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Depp as your average Joe C.P.A.? Naw, say it isn't so. Isn't this the guy who rose to fame with strange robotic blades for fingers, with an eye-patch and catchy phrases, with a reputation for playing the strange and unusual? Well, the role may not be strange or unusual, but the movie certainly is. For one thing, it is extremely rare for a 90 minute movie to actually happen in 90 minutes. But Nick of Time is about the occurrences in Gene Watson's life over a span of 90 minutes.Christopher Walken shines as the SOB cop/assassin who manipulates Depp's character, and Roma Maffia excels as his partner. I think the most interesting aspect of this film is combining two powerful character actors (Depp and Walken) across from each other.The action is fast and non-stop, and the tension builds throughout the film. When Depp finally finds help in the form of Charles S. Dutton, a shoe shine man in the lobby of the Bonaventure, the help comes in the strangest way.Rated R for violence and language, this is a interesting, breakneck paced film that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great cast with a bit of a far fetched quite annoying storyline. The beginning was very weak, picking some random person at an airport to kill the governor. If you can get past the fact that the governors husband and his team of security are so well organized to arrange the whole assassination and leave main key principle in the equation (the hit-man ) to a complete stranger who they know nothing about.Look past these points and sit back a watch then you can get through the movie and arrive at the end and think " that's not so bad " But on reflection it was. Clips with a shoe shine man with one false leg getting totally involved to help out and eventually getting shot, fortunately in his bad leg, which he then whacks one of the bad guys and knock her out with the false leg which she had just shot off. ( please !)Again this is my opinion. I read other reviews that people love this movie. Well ! we are not all the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the ride it should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a watchable movie, but laughably predictable. Christopher Walken's character is not nearly as well-developed as the psychotic villain of the James Bond film, "View To A Kill", and Johnny Depp is just a pretty boy fumbling for a way out of a seemingly hopeless situation. The "the clock is ticking" setup is not taken advantage of to create any real suspense, I'm afraid, and you know who's involved in the conspiracy before the film reveals it. And when it's all said and done, you wonder why the murderous conspirators went to such great lengths to get Johnny Depp's character to do the job when they could have done it so much more neatly themselves. But of course, if they'd done that, the world would have been delivered from yet another mediocre film. A generous 2 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

You almost sigh and learn to accept it in a 24 type of way if it's paced fast enough. But once in a while, there is a complete showstopper that ruins the suspension of disbelief.A moment like this happens not 10 minutes into the film where Depp passes a policeman and decides not turn in the unarmed Walken standing next to him. Kind of similar to Butterfly on a Wheel in terms of the stupid contrived lazy plot factor. At any time these people could have informed the authorities and have a much better chance of saving their loved ones than embarking upon their lunatic impossible mission *and* trusting that their tormentors will live up to their part of the deal. At least in 24, the baddies always double-cross these idiots...Not worth even a nickel of your time..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While not the worst film I've ever seen, the plot of "Nick of Time" is annoying in its lack of logic. If you want to assassinate someone at a large public gathering you don't just drag someone in off the street. You get a professional who is prepared. Then, if you are threatening them, you don't hand them a loaded gun. Why doesn't Depp {as Watson} blow off Walken's {as Smith} head at his first chance? Or say something out loud when he is in the elevator with the governor and Walken? Also, if the governor's campaign team are so intent on her not being governor why not just resign from her re-election team en masse? The movie just doesn't make sense. But, if you don't think to much about these questions, the film is mildly entertaining and thrilling.</fullReview>

He always sees to play cruel and hard rôles but for all I know may in real life be a nice friendly chap !! There are a few far-fetched moments in the film and one feels that Depp could have extricated himself from his perillous predicament on several occasions,but if you turn a blind eye to these, as you should, the film is really very entertaining.

		<shortDescription>Unrealistic Thriller Not Worth Watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick Of Time is only worth watching if you are a die hard fan of Johnny Depp and/or Christopher Walken. In my opinion, both these actors are highly over-rated, and their respective performances in this film is not close to either's best.Depp's character, who seems tough and smart at the beginning of the film quickly becomes stupid and weak. I guess we are to believe that because of his situation, he cannot think clearly. His daughter is kidnapped by Walken who tells him that he must kill a politician in order for her to live. Depp has numerous opportunities to save his daughter and take out Walken, but doesn't do so. You just want to smack Depp after a while for his stupidity. Walken...well...plays Walken as he always does. Personally, I feel this guy is riding on the success of The Deer Hunter; I've never seen him give another decent performance besides that movie. He plays the same part over and over again. A weird bad guy. Walken is a gimmick that Hollywood uses; stick him in any movie as a weird guy, usually a weird bad guy -- and you might get a few laughs from loyal weird-guy loving fans.In my opinion you will not enjoy this film unless you are a fan who is loyal to either Depp or Walken period. Rating 3 of 10 stars.</fullReview>

Johnny Depp has his good movies and bad movies, and so does Christopher Walken. But together, you would think this would be a surefire hit. Walken is pretty good as the menacing bad guy... but Depp, he just seems lost in the material.The concept and plot are fine, but it seems to run on and on, and how many times can one guy bump into the governor? There are some plausibility questions, but we can ignore those. Really, it just comes down to Depp not selling the role.</fullReview>

Mr. Smith (Christopher Walken) and Ms. Jones (Roma Maffia) are debating about people at the train station and pick out Gene and his daughter. They flash a badge and take them back to their van. They kidnap his daughter and demand that he murder Gov. Eleanor Grant (Marsha Mason). He has less than ninety minutes. With Smith watching over him, he is finally able to convince Grant's assistant Krista Brooks (Gloria Reuben). Smith kills her revealing a big conspiracy within Grant's inner circle. Gene has only shoeshine guy Huey (Charles S. Dutton) to turn to.It's an intriguing premise of a thriller taking place mostly in real time. It does feel like the movie is trying too hard. Walken keeps coming by injecting his weirdness as threats. It needs a few moments of quiet to build up the intensity. I would also think that Gene would take the shot when he has Jones cornered with his daughter. There are a few moments where the movie stuck me as wrong. I like the premise more than the result.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riding thin Mr Badham</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick Of Time is one of those short nifty films that just gets by by being cute, (so darn cute here) throwing everything in, but the kitchen sink. Depp and daughter arrive at an L.A. train station where they are approached by two mysterious figures (Walken and Mafia, like you've never seen her before) posing as plain clothes cops. At the flash of a badge, the daughter is snatched from Depp, and Walken gives him an ultimatum: assassinate this senator (Mason) within 75 minutes, of the daughter will be killed. These pro killers will carry out on their promise too. So we're working with real time, where it's hard to believe all of what Depp goes through, happens in this time space. I'll be honest, it's almost improbable, and you will notice by the cut back to time readings, time moves slow. It is interesting though in how Depp does his own thing, using his smarts, trying to figure an answer out of the dilemma, and what he resorts to. There are holes in this film, trust me. Depp plays it down the line, Mr Goody clean, in one of his sanest roles. He's superb, where Walken is fantastic as always, and menacing where Mafia is scary and disturbing. Mason with her doting public figure character, couldn't be finer, where Strauss, as a bad guy? yeah, and Mason's husband, does well. There are some thrilling turns in this, where Depp must outwit a sea of good and bad guys, but on the whole, NOT is weak, get by thriller, written by the guy who strangely enough wrote 94's dark, flat, adult pic, The Pornographer, where his baby was 82's The Beach Girls. NOT does have a truly thrilling and spectacular climax, bringing it's quality up, in something too little, too late. It isn't one of the brightest films, or brightest written, parts, involving dialogue too, seemed to be made up as it went, by a writer who's written his share of pics, and a consistent director, who's made his share.</fullReview>

And they just did. And it was awesome.You know, this movie just entertained the crap outta me. It's short, quick and not the least bit realistic. (I don't like to use that word when describing movies though, reaslism in movies hardly exists at all) But this movie does not try to be, either.It's like a mix between a video game and an episode of MacGyver, or some sort of light TV entertainment. Feels kind of like a dream, or something.

		<fullReview>Gene Watson arrives home in Los Angeles, after attending his ex-wife's funeral, with his daughter. Soon, his daughter is kidnapped. He is given a gun, and the picture and itinerary of a person, and told that if he hasn't killed that person in one hour and fifteen minutes, his daughter will be killed. The following takes place between 12:00 and 1:30.......In the eighties and the early Nineties, John Badham was the king of really cheesy action movies that featured quite big name actors. The majority of them are not very good, but all of them are ridiculously funny, and, for reasons always unbeknown to myself, they are always worth going back to, for some strange sadistic reason.The gimmick in this particular movie is the fact that it's set in real time, and this just makes the film even more stupidly entertaining than it should be. The narrative is simple, as is the plot. Depp has to kill someone, or his daughter gets killed, and everyone he seeks help from is either in on it, or buys the big one.It shouldn't be as good as it is, it's all over the place, but it's really worth watching for three reasons.1) The film shows that Depp can do normal if he wants. His Watson is a thousand miles away from Jack Sparrow, and him not having to mug his way through a film is quite refreshing.2) The real time. It is a neat gimmick, and this was before the advent of 24. It makes the film that little bit more urgent. But then you have to consider the fact that Badham uses slow motion........and a dream sequence in real time. And Johnny Depp goes to the toilet more times in ninety minutes than Jack Bauer has done in his whole career.3) Christopher Walken. If you appreciate the actors career from 1990 to around 2003, you will understand what I mean when I say the this is him at his most 'Walken'. The little wink when he's angry, the little hunch head and smile when someone disagrees with him. And of course, the high pitch and sudden gravelly voice change he's best known for.It's all here.If these three elements were not included in the film, it wouldn't be anything more than a lethargic, below par, race against time thriller starring a career struggling Stallone or Willis, which is quite surprising as around this movies release, both said actors were struggling with their careers.Worth watching for all the wrong reasons.</fullReview>

Not to Say that this Midland Movie was to Blame but Although it Does Have Some Energy and Engaging Scenes, as a Whole the Film Fails on the Most Basic Level.Our Old Friend "Suspension of Disbelief" Won't Let Go of This Thing and Keeps it From Becoming an Involving Thriller. It is Just too Contrived and Forced to be Much More than a Time Waster and Considering Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken Manage to Bring Their Characters to Life, the Film Itself is on Life Support from the Get Go.It's One of Those that Takes Place in "Real Time" and the Minutes Count Down as the Plot Unfolds as Clocks Can be Seen Full Face or in the Periphery in Almost Every Scene. But as the Characters Tick-Tock In and Out of the Frame the Film Becomes a Rather Failed Mechanical Exercise. There is One Dream Sequence that Works and the Movie as a Whole Isn't Awful (thanks mostly to Depp and Walken) it Remains a Failed Attempt at Worst and a Mild Entertainment at Best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast, Exciting &amp; Tense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just like many of the old B-movies, this fast, exciting and often tense thriller makes a big impact by delivering its story with great economy and style. The circumstances under which an ordinary man finds himself embroiled in a political assassination plot, unfold very quickly and from that point on, his desperation, fear and confusion are both obvious and understandable. Audiences naturally warm to characters who are extremely average and through no fault of their own, find themselves thrust into dangerous circumstances where they're completely out of their depth. In "Nick Of Time", the combination of just such a character, circumstances that seem to offer him no way out and the need to conform to an extremely tight deadline, all create plenty of intrigue and suspense which is ratcheted up even further by the action being presented in real-time.Gene Watson (Johnny Depp) is a recently-widowed accountant who arrives at Union Station in L.A. with his 6-year-old daughter Lynn (Courtney Chase) and is spotted by a man and a woman who approach him claiming to be police officers. After ushering him to their nearby van, the very threatening Mr Smith (Christopher Walken) instructs Gene to kill the Governor of California, Eleanor Grant (Marsha Mason) by 1.30pm that afternoon or he will kill Lynn who is held in the back of the van by the sinister-looking Ms Jones (Roma Maffia). Smith gives Gene a gun, a photograph of the Governor and a copy of her schedule for the day and Gene, unable to think of any way out of this nightmare, makes his way to the Bonaventure Hotel where the Governor's due to give a speech as part of her re-election campaign.On numerous occasions , Gene attempts to tell people such as a taxi driver, a cop and anyone he thinks might be able to help, about the plot but Mr Smith always suddenly appears at the critical moment to prevent him from doing so and to reiterate his threat to kill Lynn. Despite this, Gene eventually manages to convince a young campaign worker called Krista Brooks (Gloria Reuben) of his sincerity but when she's killed in shocking circumstances, he realises that an awful lot of people are involved in the conspiracy including many of those who are close to the Governor and those who are responsible for her protection.With time running out and his anxiety increasing by the minute, Gene makes his most meaningful breakthrough when he conscripts the help of Huey (Charles S Dutton) who's the hotel shoeshine man. This one-legged Vietnam veteran enlists the co-operation of the other staff in the hotel to enable Gene to alert the Governor to the danger she's in before she's due to make her speech. A shootout follows in the ballroom where Governor Grant is due to speak and Huey uses his initiative to good effect to delay Ms Jones from harming Lynn before the story reaches its surprising conclusion.It's really interesting to see Johnny Depp in a role where his character doesn't have numerous eccentricities and his understated portrayal of Gene Watson is both skillful and effective. Christopher Walken is always superb in menacing roles and his work in this movie is no exception.Gene Watson's predicament creates great natural anxiety and this is intensified further by Mr Smith's ubiquity and the numerous shots of clocks and watches which are a constant reminder of how little time is left. The fact that so many people are involved in the assassination plot introduces an element of paranoia into the action and the fact that Gene is being watched all the time and is unable to leave the hotel makes the whole atmosphere incredibly claustrophobic. "Nick Of Time" is essentially a very modest undertaking but one which creditably achieves what it set out to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Christopher Walken extorts Johnny Depp into assassinating Marsha Mason</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen the neo-noir, "Nick of Time", twice, and it holds up very well the second time with Johnny Depp handling his central role very believably and Christopher Walken suitably menacing as the man manipulating Depp into assassinating the governor of California. The story may seem far-fetched but it becomes much more plausible if one understands that Johnny Depp is being set up as a fall guy, a lone gunman who will be killed whether or not he shoots. This becomes clear on second viewing because he is photographed several times in the hotel where the governor of California, Marsha Mason, is supposed to be shot by him. For example, he is intentionally photographed in the crowd awaiting her entry to make a speech. Furthermore, Christopher Walken is ready to shoot from above as in "The Manchurian Candidate". Is it at Depp after he shoots, or is it at Mason, or at both? This is left ambiguous. However, Walken's gun doesn't track Depp's movements and it is Walken who actually shoots at Mason. Plus we have the guards in on the conspiracy who have pulled their guns before she even begins speaking, and they are ready to shoot Depp.The entire story is an embroidered take on Lee Harvey Oswald as a single gunman. The clever and suspenseful writing lets us in on the whole conspiracy, however, and it is made plausible as told in real time. The lead conspirator is G.D. Spradlin, who played the blackmailed Nevada senator in the Godfather series. Here he's a right-wing fascist-style corporate type, a man who makes and breaks politicians. Mason has not lived up to her pre-election promises to the establishment types and is slated for assassination. The corruption is widespread enough that it takes in Mason's craven husband, Peter Strauss. The corrupted security guards in the story are making an implicit comment on questions raised about the Secret Service's actions with respect to JFK.While the movie is simply entertainment, its neo-noir credentials are apparent throughout both in cinematography and as it revisits the theme that conspiracy exists in politics and particularly in recent politics. Behind the glitzy hotel facade, the dinners and the speeches lie darker forces who are pulling the strings. Depp is the innocent victim of fate, being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and he struggles to elude an impossible moral choice, either kill Mason or see his kidnapped daughter killed. Good use is made of the hotel's external elevators. They go up to bring Depp and everyone else to the "heights" of luxurious suites, where we find murderous motives, murder and conspiracy. The final and climactic descent of Depp and Walken to everyday life and a return to normality is on interior stairwells. It involves the "little" people in ordinary subservient jobs.</fullReview>

Depp still manages to unravel a conspiracy.The film may have a preposterous plot, surely there are easier ways to kill the Governor but the film kicks in quickly and director John Badham clearly brings a Hitchcockian sheen to the film. You seem the time motif regularly in the film and an increasingly frantic Depp as time goes on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Nick of Time" features the novel hook of unfurling in real-time, which is still cool, even after "24" took ownership of the gimmick. Sadly, that's where the similarities between the two end. This isn't in the same league as "24".Alright, so Johnny Depp's being forced to kill the Governor or "they" will kill his kid. He can't make a move because Christopher Walken's on him like a hawk. He doesn't trip the metal detector because the security guy's a plant. So's the Secret Service head honcho. All there to make sure Depp does his job like a good boy. The conspiracy even goes all the way up to the Gov's husband (really?). But with so many people involved, why not use one of the existing conspirators? The guys posing as Secret Service would have to know the security to even be there - surely one of them can iron out an escape route and just do the job. Or just use a high-powered rifle (as mentioned in the movie). There's no way the people in charge would support such a top-heavy infrastructure. This is melodrama at its hammiest; things just get more preposterous at every turn. I've gotta admit, I did hang in just to see how they ended this thing. Which didn't help.This was awful.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's one scene in "Nick Of Time" that really brings the movie down for me, and because I'm a negative person I'll start with it. The way they make the Huey character important to the plot is one of the most ridiculous cases of deus ex machina I've ever seen in a Hollywood movie. It requires such severe dumbness from the in all other scenes rather intelligent Mr.Smith that it totally yanks you out of the story. Smith has taken care of absolutely everything and is in complete control, he shows up out of nowhere every time Gene tries to warn authorities like he's psychic. But damn it, the plot needs to move along so let's lower his IQ 100 points for one scene and have him take an enormous risk by believing Huey's deaf. It doesn't hurt the overall suspense of the movie, but it's just such a huge facepalm of a scene. I got over every other plot element that didn't make sense (blackmailing a random guy who's never touched a gun before into killing a governor isn't exactly a brilliant idea to begin with), but that part still makes me groan. While up to then the movie has been fantastic, featuring inventive camera work, plenty of clever twists and Christopher Walken saying things, from that scene on you really just get a by the numbers action movie climax. Nothing wrong with a by the numbers action movie climax of course, but that first half came damn near to a perfect 10. "Nick Of Time" is still a must-see though, it could just have been even better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hitchcock done wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With movies like The 39 Steps, The Man Who Knew Too Much, Rear Window and North by Northwest, Hitchcock perfected the template of the thriller with the ordinary guy enmeshed in a crime/conspiracy - a model which inspired directors like De Palma, Argento, Zemeckis, Fincher and countless others.The plot? Conspirators kidnap everyman Johnny Depp's daughter and blackmail him into murdering a politician.Unfortunately, the movie commits a few serious blunders. First, as magnetic a presence as Walken is, villains in these scenarios are best used as ominous, vague threats in the background. Here, Depp keeps bumping into a grimacing, threat-spouting Walken every two minutes, so any sense of menace fades and the story takes a farcical turn. Second, when it becomes apparent *everyone* is involved in the conspiracy, suspension of disbelief shatters into tiny pieces. Why introduce such an erratic element in your plan when you have this kind of complete control over the situation? The movie reaches its nadir with an incredibly clichéd dream sequence halfway through, but even the rest is far from stellar. Hitchcock, this ain't.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A governor thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is interesting seeing Johnny Depp star in a movie where he is actually clean-shaven and short-haired. In this political thriller, he plays every-day man Gene Watson, whose daughter is kidnapped by henchmen Mr. Smith (Christopher Walken) and Ms. Jones (Roma Maffia). To get her back, Gene is forced to assassinate the governor in 90 minutes.With a plot element about a race against time, this movie has some nice riveting excitement and thrills. It will get your adrenaline going and have you glued to the screen.The acting itself isn't half-bad, though, I thought Depp seemed pretty uninterested in his role and looked rather bored. Walken, on the other hand, always plays a cold and love-to-hate villain.Looks pass some of the negative reviews of this movie and just enjoy this it for some good action fun. For 90 minutes, it isn't a boring or dragged-out movie considering the amount of thrills in it.Grade B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains spoiler. This Johnny Depp/Christopher Walken film is unremarkable in quite a few ways: at least, cinematography, script, acting are on the list . . . But I was drawn to the central theme?the paralyzing horror of Depp's predicament. I think Johnny pretty well covers the range of emotions you'd think everyone would feel in his situation. His desperation seems real. Realistic. Lost. Enervated. Enraged. Galvanized. The unremitting adrenaline, pushing him to act, or run . . . or kill. I was on his side, but I did not want to be him. Almost too dreadful to say it in words: kill, or see his child killed. I waited and watched for his escape, his release, his salvation. I fiercely wonder how I would act in such a raging, tormented dilemma. My salvation, right at the moment, is that I don't have to make the choice.

		<fullReview>(Credit IMDb) An unimpressive, every-day man is forced into a situation where he is told to kill a politician to save his kidnapped daughter.This isn't your typical Johnny Depp film. It's quite surreal to see him play such a usual, everyday man role. While this isn't exactly original, and it's undoubtedly derivative, I still managed to have some fun with it. It has some fair suspense, and Johnny Depp makes for a likable, if flawed hero. It does get a little convoluted in the second half, but it moves at such a swift pace, I managed to block it out. Christopher Walken can do this type of stuff in his sleep. He always makes for a fantastic villain. Charles S. Dutton plays a shoe shiner, and is Depp's helper. He did a pretty good job, and adds solid presence like he does in most movies. Courtney Chase is quite tolerable as the daughter. With kid actors, I can't ask for much more than that. It's not original, it won't make your day, but it's fairly entertaining. If you need time to kill on a slow moving day, this is your ticket6.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only thing that stands out is that the time in the movie is the same time in real life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a simple action movie with a little twist. The twist is that it is filmed in real time. That is the time that passes in the movie is exactly the same time that passes in the real world. Thus the movie plays out over about an hour and forty minutes, and the same amount of time passes in the world of the movie.An accountant comes into Los Angeles with his beautiful little daughter after going to his ex-wife's funeral. At the railway station, two people, claiming to be police officers (and I do not doubt that they are police officers) approach him and ask him to come with them. Once they are in the van, they hold his daughter hostage and tell him that unless his kills a specific woman within one and a half hours, his daughter will die. It turns out that this woman is the governess of California.The plot is interesting as it turns out that a lot of people have conspired to kill the governor. The reason is that she broke a number of promises when she was elected, and these promises were to her sponsors. She got into office on a business platform, and once she was there, she took a social justice platform, and her one time allies did not like this. This seems to be central in American politics. This I will look at after I look at the plot itself.Everybody was involved in this, but the accountant was simply a scape goat. This becomes even more evident in the closing scenes where at least three people draw guns. What happens though is that there is an Asian guy with a video camera who keeps his eye on the accountant. This is because the accountant is a scape goat and will take the brunt of the public anger while the real conspirators escape. Yet the accountant is very willing to go through with the deed, but only if he does not get caught - this is seen when he is alone in the room with the sleeping governor - but once she awakens his attitude changes. He will do it to save his daughter, but he knows that if he does it, he will go to gaol - or be executed, which is more likely, and his daughter will probably die anyway.This is interesting that the movie also deals with the battle between the left and the right. The right has always been for less state intervention and the free market economy, while the left has been for social justice. Social justice infringes on the free market and as such the right does not like it. LBJ, one of my favourite presidents, was very much for social justice. This movie represents, in a more violent way, the struggle between the right and the left in America - and the right is very much stronger, as we see here. In 1968, when Nixon was elected, it is said that the left and the New Deal, which is represented by the governor, was finally defeated and that the Americans went for a free market economy. It is interesting that the ones who have the power in the movie are those behind the scenes, while everybody seems to be supporting the governor.This movie was alright, and it is that real-time aspect of it that makes it interesting. It is also a decent action movie, and Johnny Depp is a pretty cool actor - especially how he seems to devote himself to independent movies. He actually seems to play the innocent accountant much better than the punk cop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>90 Minutes Or Less.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Depp plays Gene Watson, who disembarks off a train at Union station in Los Angeles with his daughter Lynn. He is approached by two people named Smith(Christopher Walken) &amp; Jones(Roma Maffia) who claim to be cops who need his help. Unfortunately they lie, and instead Lynn is taken by Jones and held captive in a van. Smith informs Gene that he must assassinate the California governor(played by Marsha Mason) in the next ninety minutes, or his daughter will be killed. He is given a gun with six bullets, and sent to the hotel where the governor will be giving a speech, and that he better not tell the police, since Smith will be watching him closely the whole time. How can Gene get out of this situation alive? Interesting idea for a thriller to be told in "real time", and though it has good performances, it never really gels because the premise is so far-fetched. (Enlisting a random person to do a killing seems far too risky. Why not get a professional to do it?)Watchable enough if you have 90 minutes to kill, but that's all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Previously, when initially released in 1995 and in years following, I was a huge fan of Nick of Time. I had loved Johnny Depp's straight man performance, even though in 1995, he hadn't gone all crazy-role just yet.It's been probably well over a decade since I've last seen this movie and back in the 1990s, I had seen it multiple times. Today, it somewhat holds up.I still like Johnny in a non-looney role ? ironically, I think he's trying too over-the-top for his past decade roles in order to be original, and yet, it might actually be original for him to return to this kind of character. I also appreciate Christopher Walken in pretty much anything, including this and always have liked Roma Maffia. I dig that chick.The movie cannot be taken seriously and you might enjoy it a little more. I don't think they were trying for anything too heavy and as a short and tight thriller with actual decent performances (not mentioned above, but still good, was shoe-shinning Charles S. Dutton,) it's entertaining.Pre-24 days, everyday man, Gene (Depp,) travels via train with his daughter when they're approached and coerced into assassinating the Governor at a nearby hotel and rally. Basically, and the plot is basic, two parties, Walken's Mr. Smith and Maffia's Mrs. Smith are watching Gene and his daughter, respectively and separately. Gene can't go to the police because bad man Mr. Smith's got eyes everywhere and his daughter is unaware she's in danger.Oh, and he's got 90 minutes to get close to and kill the Governor, or his daughter dies. Probably him, too.On the surface ? or from a distance, the premise seems exciting and thrilling. And for the most part, the ingeniousness of Gene to handle something, including a gun, that he's never had to before, was pretty entertaining. But, once watched, it does show a little bit of B-movie qualities that reminds us again: don't take this seriously.Sure, I recommend it, but if I watched it for the first time today, I probably wouldn't have seen it the many times I did back in the 1990s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An edge-of-your-seat thrill ride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught this film on HBO today and was immediately sucked into it and couldn't take my eyes off the screen from beginning to end. Walken turns in one of his best bad guy performances since "True Romance" - he is very good at instilling dread and fear with his piercing stare and his deadpan delivery, and yet, in a film like "The Dead Zone" he can be as sympathetic a character as any you have ever seen. For an actor with only a couple of expressions, he has a range that is quite hard to pin down.Johnny Depp is a chameleon of an actor, playing roles as varied as Edward Scissorhands and Hunter Thompson in the highly underrated "Fear and Loathing in Las Vega$." Here, he's an Everyman, thrust unwillingly into a situation from which there is seemingly no easy escape, or, perhaps, no escape at all. Nick of Time boils down to Depp and his daughter, kidnapped at L.A.'s Union Station, tossed in a van by two fake FBI agents who then tell him he must kill the Governor of California by 1:30 pm or his young daughter will be killed. Simple as that. The remaining 90 minutes, played out in "real time", (or close to it..).. incorporate some amazing direction inside and around L.A.'s Bonaventure Hotel, which, if you've ever been inside it, you know is an utterly confusing labyrinth of glass towers, fountains, circular hallways, and this strange space lends itself perfectly to the taught confusion and tension the film tries to project. Your job, as viewer is to try to figure out who is part of the assassination conspiracy, and who can be trusted. It ain't easy. Your other job is to put yourself in Depp's shoes.. what would you do? Charles Dutton shines in his supporting role of a disabled American veteran shoe-shine man in the hotel lobby. While this film got tepid reviews, in this case, I think the mainstream reviewers were wrong. It isn't Hitchcock, no, and Depp is not supposed to be a super-hero either. Just a plain guy thrust into a situation which is sheer nightmare in nature, but with enough wit and wiles to try to find a solution. Marsha Mason is also solid as the Governor. Well-worth renting or catching on cable. Riveting. Taut. An all-around nail-biting thrill ride. Don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a hoot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick of Time has a laughable premise, but it is best just to go with the flow in this movie. Johnny Depp is forced to become an assassin by Christopher Walken who has kidnapped his daughter. The whole film is in real time, that is 90 minutes go by in the movie. It is an interesting technique which adds to the unintentional humour in this movie. Walken appears almost like a cardboard cutout, the photography is rather chilling (and he does keep popping up out of nowhere to warn Depp not to seek assistance). As usual in these conspiracy based movies, EVERYONE is involved, except for a few sympathetic characters in the movie. Depp looks suitably frazzled, Walken is Walken, and the rest of the cast has lots of fun. A good time waster and a real hoot of an unintentional comedy. Sure I didn't identify with Depp's character, the whole premise is totally preposterous! Walken throws Johnny around like a rag doll when given the chance, and he relishes the role. He seems to have accepted being typecast as an off-the-wall bad guy, and he takes the ball and runs with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engrossing Hitchcockian Thriller Of Everyman Forced Into Political Assassination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gene Watson arrives at a Los Angeles railway station with his young daughter. When she is abruptly kidnapped, Gene is instructed to shoot the state governor, who is giving a speech at a nearby hotel, otherwise the kidnappers will kill the girl. Will he go through with the plot, and is there any alternative ?This is a pretty cool thriller. Patrick Sheane Duncan's script is ambitious - the events take place in real time and there are no comic relief or character development scenes - it's all sweaty-faced tension as Depp tries desperately to think of a way out of his predicament. It might work better as a half-hour TV treatment ? la Alfred Hitchcock Presents, but there are very few lulls and lots of juicy twists along the way. It's also expertly put together by old pro Badham, with a great nail-biting score by Arthur B. Rubinstein and excellent crisp photography throughout from Roy H. Wagner. The quartet of classy leads all make their mark; Depp's nervous accountant is another of his atypical hero roles, Walken is his usual electrifying psychotic self (although admittedly he's played this role at least a few times before), Dutton is great as the unlikely cavalry in the form of a crippled shoe-shine guy, and Mason sells the story well as the unwitting gubernatorial victim. If the movie has a flaw it's that it's a little bit familiar - you kind of expect the conspiracy, and you know the kid isn't really gonna buy the farm - but it's still a lot of fun just the same. Not a showstopper, but a classy, unpretentious, well-written and sharply put together thriller in the mold of say Peter Hyams' Narrow Margin or David Fincher's Panic Room, although it's really an amalgam of High Noon and The Man Who Knew Too Much. A fine evening's entertainment by a much underrated director.</fullReview>

I never knew what to expect, and the fact that this is in real time, and that they don't show the time too often, only adds to the suspense. It's a shame that this movie didn't do well at the box office, it really is incredible. The story is actually believable, the directing fits the story so well, and the cast is simply incredible. I never knew what Christopher Walken would do next, or who was in on the conspiracy. The little "reveal", if it could even be considered one, is predictable, but handled so well that you don't even notice, or care. Nick of Time went above and beyond all the expectations I had before watching it. This is without a doubt the best movie in the suspense genre. 10/10</fullReview>

Thirty minutes into this movie, I wanted to borrow one of those bullets to put me out of my misery.On his way home from his ex-wife's funeral, L.A. accountant Gene Watson (Johnny Depp) and his young daughter are accosted in a railway station by a shady character named Mr. Smith (Christopher Walken). Watson follows Smith, who claims to be a cop, out to his van wherein he is handed gun and an envelope. Watson is told that he has 90 minutes to assassinate the person whose identity is contained in the envelope - or his daughter will be killed.Thus began what I thought was going to be a roller-coaster ride of suspense. In retrospect, I am not sure if the roller-coaster train ever left the station. With yawns aplenty, I watched as Watson bumbled around trying to figure out what to do. It didn't even dawn on him until halfway through the movie to look in the envelope to find out who he was supposed to murder.For most of his 90 minutes, Watson darts around the Bonaventure Hotel trying to evade Smith long enough to find help; but around every corner and in every bathroom stall, there is the creepy cop. For some reason, the idea never enters Watson's mind to just shoot Smith, grab his daughter, and go home. Instead, Watson ends up enlisting the service of a near deaf, one-legged shoe shiner named Huey, who demonstrates what a Disabled American Veteran can do when armed with a prosthetic leg. Director John Badham (Saturday Night Fever) perpetuates this preposterous premise and carries it through to a predictable and unsatisfying conclusion.The movie wasn't a total loss. Christopher Walken, always the perfect psycho-villain, offers an excellently creepy performance. His unique humor was always present; though I never let myself laugh out loud for fear that he might have heard me.Writer Patrick Sheane Duncan is ultimately to blame for this farce of a thriller. The storyline was simply silly, and insulting to the intelligence. The best thing that I can say about this lackluster yarn, with a gimmicky run-time of 90 minutes, is that it ends - just in the nick of time.DIRECTOR: John BadhamCAST: Johnny Depp (Gene Watson), Christopher Walken (Mr. Smith), Charles S.

		<shortDescription>Very quick thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot outline is quite simple: A young man's daughter is kidnapped and he is given less than two hours to assassinate a politician for the kidnappers, otherwise his daughter will be killed. The special thing about this movie is the way it is carried off. It takes place in real time, in just one building, in the midst of a far-ranging conspiracy. This creates tension and thrills, not least because the scope of possible actions for the hero appear so limited. This is not Arnold Schwarzenegger hunting after the bad guys to get his daughter back: It is an average person caught at his most vulnerable point, not sure how to react to the situation, and at times overwhelmed by the pressure put on him. Especially during the first half of the movie, there appears to be no easy way out, which makes it all the more thrilling. This movie wastes no second. It is breathless, quick at getting to the point, short and good entertainment.One of my favourite thrillers. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Edge of your seat thriller, but aged and in need of a Special Edition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching Nick of Time, forgive me, a long time ago. Ever since then whenever people talk about how revolutionary 24 is, I mention this movie. Nick of Time is filmed in real time, and I don't think it's the first one, but it's definitely the first I've seen. Yet it's not overly in your face, there's no ticking clock all over the screen, and even without the knowledge that it's happening in your time frame it's still suspenseful.Movie You'll be forgiven at times for thinking you're watching a TV Movie, that's very much the feel here and it's just legacy of the times I'm afraid, but if you hold with it you'll have some payback. The story is simple yet very strong, a mans daughter is kidnapped and he is told that he has under ninety minutes to kill someone in order for her to survive. What would any Father do? Exactly, he looks for a way out at every opportunity, and every time he's foiled by his watcher.Johnny Depp stars as the Father willing to do anything to save his daughters life but struggling with a strong sense of morality. Christopher Walken plays the man who sets the situation up and shadows him at every moment, forcing him to make the killing. Both perform very strongly, and Walken is just classic in this role, relishing the moments to turn totally crazy in a second. The only problem is that Walken sometimes just goes totally over the top, there are a few moments where it just doesn't fit, and you wonder if he would just be drawing too much attention to himself.The plot is great though, and there are strong twists and turns throughout. Just when you think he's found a way out it's closed with a dramatic crash. You'll find yourself getting to the edge of your seat for the final acts, it does build the suspense and tension really well, and it delivers. The ending is strong, fast, and not entirely expected. Not that it's a big surprise, but it takes you in some good directions.At times though the use of the camera becomes so blatant it's cheesy. It's used to over explain certain moments, like mad zooms or repeated closeups that just don't need to be there, the audience doesn't need spoon fed they've already guessed what's happening! There's a lot of hand-held in the film too, and at times it does get a little too much, however overall the filming is good and does help to build the harassed feeling of running with the main character.The other noticeable affect of the time in which it was filmed is the totally overpowering soundtrack. The music tends to overtake the scenes and drown out the action, distracting you from the movie and fighting for your attention. While I'm talking about the soundtrack, the use of the echo effect is also overused, and it would end up annoying me rather than heightening a feeling.Audio Presented: Dolby Digital 5.1 The sound is fine for watching, but there's nothing to really take advantage of a decent Home Cinema, or for that matter of any Home Cinema. You could just as easily watch this on a Stereo TV, and I actually ended up doing just that.Picture Presented: 1.85:1 Anamorphic It's quite obvious that this is the straight DVD offering of the movie that Studios churn out from their back catalogue, checking the the sale figures to see if they could invest in a Special Edition and then re-issue. The picture looks as though it's taken straight from the stock print without any digitisation or clean up. It's not awful, but it's not DVD quality.Extras Presented: Trailer No, I will not write down that it has scene access, that is not an extra, that's a standard. So all we have to offer on this release is the movie itself and a trailer. Very disappointing. It would have been wonderful to find out the inside story on the creation of a real time movie, but alas no.Overall It's a great story, well executed and filled with blocked turns and a few twists. You'll enjoy it and most likely you'll have that anticipation in the final act wondering how the lead is going to get out of this situation. However it could really do with a Special Edition treatment, a revitalised picture and audio, with a good audio commentary to boot. For now though, it's worth a rental for the story alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>really good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only hired this movie because Johnny Depp and the great Christopher Walken are in this movie and i thought the movie would be a bit crap but it turned out to be really good.The movies about a man (Depp) who just got off a train with his daughter and a man (Walken) and a woman (Roma Maffia) kidnap his daughter and give him a gun and tell him he has to kill the Governor (Marsha Mason)with in an hour and a half or his daughter will be killed.This film also stars Charles S. Dutton from the films Gothika,A Time To Kill,Mimic and Black Dog and nick of time is by far one of his best movies.Over all this movie is good and it keep me entertained from start to finish and my rating is 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marsha Mason's dynamic portrayal skews film from its purpose.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is an odd example where one excellent performance prevents the film from working due to the fact that noone else is up to her level. The premise here is that Nick is blackmailed to kill Governor Eleanor Grant (Marsha Mason). If he does not, his kidnapped child will be murdered. Stupid premise! But the fact that Ms. Mason creates a thoroughly believable three dimensional character the audience cares about - and that Depp does not - skews the film from its purpose - that being - we should identify with Depp and his dilemma. We don't. We don't care a hoot about him or his child. We want Governor Grant to live. So, although we wait for each of her scenes with interest and tension, we WANT him to fail, because we only care about her. If anyone else had played the role, or if Depp had given a better performance, we might have had a balance and therefore been drawn into the film. He did not and we are not. Worth seeing to observe this unusual phenomenon. When an actress of this quality and talent can steal a film in a supporting role, why, we ask, isn't she still playing leads - like Meryl Streep. She should. We need her back on top.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had but one word to use to describe this movie I'd say "unique." I've never really seen anything like it before. I liked the cast of Johnny Depp as a geek and Christopher Walken as an angry-creepy man who has only one thing on his mind: assassination. The movie is done in real time which adds a very interesting element. The plot is good because it keeps twisting and twisting at all the right times. The suspense is breath taking. I didn't think I would get so into this one, but I found myself squeezing my couch arm with a gorilla grip - it's tense. I was satisfied with pretty much every aspect of this movie, especially the part where Johnny Depp's character back talks Walken's character. Every second of this movie counts, and every second of it is great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depp goes mainstream, and in doing so proves he should stay in offbeat territory...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(EDIT: I'd like to remind people that this was written BEFORE 'Pirates'!)Johnny Depp has acknowledged in the past that he is not 'blockbuster boy', and never wanted to be. "Nick of Time" is the closest he's come in his career so far to entering that field ("21 Jump Street" doesn't count) The resulting movie suggests that he is entirely right in his assertion, and that his talents are better suited to more outlandish projects.There are many problems with "Nick of Time", however, and the fact that Johnny Depp doesn't suit the film is just one of them. Truth be told, NOBODY looks entirely comfortable with their part, each performer generating the sense that they'd really rather be somewhere else. Frankly, I don't blame them. Walken appears to have utilised the escape clause of hamming up his part dreadfully, which may have been a slight amusement for him, but was downright painful for me. None of the characters are sketched anything more than very thinly, which I realise owes slightly to the dynamics of the central concept; but then, if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen, as they say...(SPOILERS ONWARD.)What might have been a gripping premise if we actually cared about any of the characters, is instead looked on as a godsend because it ensures a mercifully short running time. Most of the details of the scenario presented herein are fantastically implausible, such as the ability of Walken to materialise from nowhere just as Depp finds a way to get help. The mini fight scene in the lift is hysterical, owing to Walken's panto villain demeanour, Depp's unease, and the fact that the director tries (and fails) to extract maximum tension from his claustrophobic surroundings by 'throwing' the camera around as if it were on a string.Good idea, potentially talented cast, horrendous execution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really enjoyed watching this thriller of the 90's. The film is a short run, describing the high paced story of an executive who visits the USA with his daughter, and who is then blackmailed by conspirators into assassinating the to be governor, else his daughter will be killed.It may look old fashioned now, but it definitely will keep one at the edge of his seat from start to end, like "Vantage point". Johnny Depp has played his part well. Everything in the film is commendable. It has good thrills and action sequences, and sudden twists that you probably would not even expect.Should be watchable</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tense and suspenseful Neo-noir film with an exciting race against time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Hichcockian movie deals about an accountant named Watson(Johnny Deep)arriving L.A. Union Station accompanied by his daughter named Lynn(Courtney Chase). He's approached by a pair of rare people(Christopher Walken, Roma Maffia). The daughter is taken hostage into a van and Watson suffers a blackmail, he's given a gun with six bullets and he must to go the Bonaventure Hotel and commit murder a known people(Marsha Mason). Watson is only helped by a shoeshine boy(Charles S Dutton).Gripping, original action movie with Deep desperately trying to find the means avoid his daughter to be murdered.Excellent thriller full of intrigue and tense, this is a fast-paced, stylized action-suspense film. The tension of this picture keeps snowballing as the clock ticks ever close for killing the daughter. The tale appear to unfold in real time as the many on screen clocks will verify. Most unusual is the device of having the victim play desperado and hunt the killers, and saving his daughter , as time runs out. Casting is frankly magnificent, Johnny Deep as tormented businessman, Christopher Walken takes honors as a psychopath who attempts to turn the tables on the victim before he can inform the police. Plus, a good secondary cast, such as Peter Strauss, Gloria Reuben, Marsha Mason, G D Spradlin, among them. Adequate musical score accompanying the action by Arthur B Rubinstein and inventively photographed by Roy Wagner. The motion picture is accurately directed by John Badham. He's a nice director who achieved his greatest success in the 80s. He directed several hits(Saturday night fever, Short circuit, Blue thunder, Drop zone, War games,Skateout), though today making TV movies(Jack Bull, Floating away) and television episodes(Crossing Jordan,Psych,Las Vegas,Standoff, Heroes).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keeps you on the edge of your seat...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie late on a Saturday night. I didn't sleep for an hour after it was over because this film does such a good job at keeping the suspense going. The story focuses on Johnny Depp, who has just arrived in a city with his daughter and is spotted by Christopher Walken, who kidnaps his daughter and tells Depp if he doesn't assassinate the governor, his daughter is dead. From there the story is pure suspense, with Depp trying everything he can to keep his daughter safe without killing the governor. I won't go into any more details at the risk of ruining the movie, but let me just say it's a very good movie. There's never a slow moment, and of course Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken are incredible actors, especially when Walken plays the antagonist. I give this movie a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>space and time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like this particular project, i like Badham a lot, generally speaking. He is usually able to build his films world around very contained environments, both in time and in space. Even in Saturday Night Fever this device was visible, in a subtle way: there we had a film that was about an era, a certain youth, in a certain portion of the world we can talk about time and space container in a pop culture sense. WarGames was also about this, chasing time was the excuse to increase tension, and build cinematically the suspense mood. Here we have the same premises as in WarGames, a guy has to do something in a short amount of time, otherwise something terrible will happen. The terrible thing to happen and the action he must fulfill are all located around the same city block, so all the development will move around that.Here Badham has a stronger element, comparing to WarGames: he has Depp. We're looking at one of the best current actors, here in a time where he was (even) more than today a risk taker. He tried many things, here is another one. Just looking at Depp is reason enough to watch this. He is one of the few actors who can carry alone the hole audience to make believable what might be questionable, and deepen his performance with the over layering of inner questions, here mostly associated with whether he should complete his "mission" or try to abort it: his daughter vs doing "the right thing". It's rather repetitive material, but the question with Depp (and great actors) is never on What but on How.I could not stop wondering what De Palma could have done here. 3 years after this one, he directed his very personal Snake Eyes, one of his essays on cinematic eye behavior/movement. There, De Palma's cinematic sensibility was collecting the fruits of his careers experiments in moving camera and eye work, but all the rest was so lame, acting, even some scriptwriting (all the writing that wasn't under de Palma's preoccupations) that the experience lost something. That same improved script with Depp could have thrown it yet to another level. Pity Anyway, John Badham is competent enough to make this worthwhile, and he can move around. Walken is (as usual) over the top, he is the tough "smart with words" guy, has usually good recognition from the audiences, but he is not what i enjoy. Nevertheless overall this is a good experience. Try it if you haven't yet.My evaluation: 4/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this on TV, and thought anything with Depp and Walken in had to be worth a look. I loved it. It has a fast pace (real-time like 24? - need to watch it again to check), great set-piece action and some superb acting by just about everyone involved. Walken's character is frightening in his ability to anticipate every move by Depp's character. The viewer really feels for the main character, the huge injustice of his predicament, and shares in his frequent frustrations as the battle of wits swings one way then the other. It reminded me of some Hitchcock films, and thrillers from the 40s-60s in general. They should make more films like this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know that there was a specific reason why this film went straight out onto video in the uk. I just cant remember the reason! I think something or someone important (maybe a political figure) was shot/gunned down so they pulled it about a month before it was due at the cinema. Does anyone remember what happened for this sort of action to be taken? If you know, then great - please tell me and put me out of my misery!On the whole I think it is a pretty good film and I enjoy watching it although I'm somewhat bias as I love all films that Johnny Depp appears in - although this is defo his weakest flick.

Couldn't be any much more simplier and I am sure the story lacks any form of reality it still let you sit at the edge of your seat for 90 minutes, and fans from Christopher Walken might be warned that he never played such a bad vilain as here before.

		<fullReview>Saw this on TV on a Sunday night where nothing else was on offer, and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. I thought I would have heard of it if it was any good and I hadn't. If you get a slight feeling of de ja vu watching it, its because its not the first film where christopher walken is involved in a plot to assasinate a governor. The last time was in The Dead Zone (1983). There are a few very similar scenes but its altogether a very different film. Walken excels at playing the baddie, in the same way he did in films like Things to do in Denver When You're Dead and True Romance. Johnny Depp is great as well as the poor guy roped into the conspiracy to kill a top politician. Hes an average joe whose daughter is kidnapped and held hostage and threatened with execution if Johnnys task isn't carried out. Theres just enough twists and suspense to keep you interested and follow this through to the end, although I was a little disappointed with some elements of the ending, without giving much away, you will spend most of the film wondering who, in the end, lives or dies. From a certain point on the film sets a pace which tells you that anyone is potentially in the line of fire and no character is indispensable when it comes to stepping up the suspense. Quite a short film compared to many, at just 90 minutes but its about the right length and does what it needs to do, with an OK script, although with a few oddly placed characters (shoe shine man may have been miscast)and Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken lighting up the screen this film free wheeled through an hour and a half of my evening and left me wondering why I missed out on it first time round.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Done Hitchcock Styled Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching this movie several months back on TV and was pleasantly surprised. The directing is great, the characters are well developed and dynamic, and the acting is better than average.Johnny Depp returns to Los Angeles with his daughter (Courtney Watson). When he stops at the train station he discovers his daughter is missing and comes across Mr. Smith (Christopher Walken) and Ms. Jones (Roma Maffia). He is told he must assassinate Governor Grant (Marsha Mason) within an hour or his daughter will be killed.There are many interesting plot twists in this movie that kept me on the edge of my seat. Christopher Walken is perfectly cast as "Mr. Smith". He is always cast as the antagonist, and he always carries it out perfectly. Roma Maffia brings wry sarcastic comedy. And the rest of the actors shine in this under-rated thriller.If you catch this on TV, or can rent it, I recommend it to you. You won't be disappointed. It'll keep you on the edge of your seat for a good hour and a half or so.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and hope I can catch it again sometime.Rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I watched Johnny Depp running from place to place in a mad rush to save his daughter, I thought of the old black and white Hitchcock films. This movie had me sitting up on the edge of my seat and ringing out my hands as I anticipated and wondered just how this desperate father would make his way out of his delimma. It is good to see Charles S. Dutton in action in a role which winds up serving as tension relief to a large extent. The building suspense of this one is great. Depp is in top form here as a likeable character as opposed to the seedy dark characters he has portrayed in "Blow" and that movie about Jack the Ripper.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the movie, but one thing irritated me about it.Possible spoiler . . . .When Johnny Depp is talking to Dutton while he is getting his shoes shined and is revealing what is happening, Christopher Walken is always watching him yet never suspects that he is summoning help. Earlier someone was killed for trying to help Depp. When Depp and Walken are at Dutton's shoe stand he reveals all (believing Depp when he says Dutton is deaf). Even though he kills indiscriminately earlier, I thought this is a really stupid thing to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there is one thing that stands out in this movie it is Christopher Walken's acting. Brilliant. Along with the low budget style of camera work, this movie is everything a thriller should be. Without giving too much of the movie away, it is about a man whose child is kidnapped, and he has to kill someone to get her back from the people who took her. I think this movie is memorable for the scene with Christopher Walken and Johnny Depp when Christopher Walken is talking about his friend who he had to kill. "Now if you have DOUBTS about what I'm gunna do to your little girl, LEMMIE TELL YA SOMETHING, I'm GUNNA MAKE GRAVY OUT YOUR LITTLE GIRL, just to season that black Irish co%$suckers meat" Whenever I watch this movie I always anticipate this scene, it is just so funny and enjoyable to watch. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like the guy, but let's be honest: Commercial success hitting a Johnny Depp film is like sunlight hitting Dracula. The only way any of his films are successful is if they're also weird. And that ain't the case here."Nick of Time" isn't awful, but Depp just does not have any business being in this movie. Maybe they were looking for someone unconventional to star in it, thereby making the whole "take an average guy and plop him in a tough situation" plot more realistic, but it backfires.For a short movie -- less than 90 minutes -- it stacks up quite a few implausibilities and just plain stupid actions. Several times, people get halfway through an action only to abandon it, or undertake some unbelievable action just to keep the premise (barely) intact. If you're killing time watching Cinemax at 2 a.m., "Nick of Time" is passable. If you're settling down with a 9 p.m. Friday movie to start your weekend, look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>&lt;possible spoilers&gt;Nick of Time was a good movie, but it could have been a lot better. For instance, I'd like to have heard more about the actual motive to kill the Governor. It was just kind of like, well, there was a conspiracy. But what was the motive behind the conspiracy? With such a huge part of the plot unanswered, it's hard to give this movie an incredibly great review.Another problem I had with this movie was that it started off a bit too fast. There was nothing primal about it - no hint as to what Watson's personal life was like. We don't find out that his ex-wife had died until later on in the movie, for better or for worse. I'd like to have seen more of his personal life and possibly planning of the asassination - maybe that would clear up some of the plot questions too. But, one could argue that if they told too much of the plot in the beginning there wouldn't be anything shocking about finding out who all was in on the conspiracy. Either way, I still would've liked to seen a good half hour before where the movie actually starts out as to getting to know the characters a little better.But all that aside, I did think this was a good movie, definitely worth a rent. I don't have any plans to go out and buy this movie, though. This movie was good, but it could have been better.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A businessman (Johnny Depp) has just arrived in L.A. with his young daughter, when she is kidnaped by a man and a woman. Depp is ordered to assassin a very important Governor, or his daughter will be killed. And he is only given about an hour to do the dirty work. Since Depp loves his daughter very much, he is prepared to do almost everything to save her. But how will he save her without killing any innocent people? The clock is ticking.The smart gimmick with "Nick of Time" is actually the fact that the clock is ticking while we (the audience) are watching. Depp has exactly as much time to kill the Governor as it takes for us viewers to see this movie. A very clever idea, which works pretty well. Even if the dramatic close-ups of the time ticking appears every third minute and therefore becomes irritating after while. The acting is first class all the way. One of my personal favorite actors, Johnny Depp, makes an excellent performance as Mr Watson, the innocent man being dragged into this conspiracy against his own will. Christopher Walken (always great) is terrifying as the man following Depp all the time, checking that he will do what he is supposed to. Good direction as well, it feels like you´re following Depp around trying to find a solution to the big problem on his hands. The movie contains many clever turns, but unfortunately also some huge gaps in the story. And sometimes the story´s a bit too silly, for my taste.But this is still an underrated thriller, with a smart plot and great acting. * * * ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Muted Suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main idea of the film is very intriguing but unfortunately the filmmakers never fullfills its potential. The first half is well set up with the main character having to do a job in order to get his daughter back. The second half is where the film begins to fall apart. If it weren't for the formulatic climatic and ending this film might have turned out into an excellent film. Could have benefitted by a solid plot twist in the style of Arlington Road(1999). Johnny Depp does alright in his role of the everyman but I feel he never adds any real depth in his character. G.D Spradlin is very good in the role of the mysterious friend of the Governor's husband. Like High Noon(1952), Nick of Time(1995) takes place in real time. The major ideas of the film may have been borrowed from High Noon(1952) which used a similar set up in suspense. Nick of Time(1952) is not a classic film like High Noon(1952) because of the inconsistent direction and writing. Christopher Walken gives another solid performance as the cool and psychotic Mr. Smith. The best scenes in Nick of Time(1995) involve the characters played by Johnny Depp and Charles Dutton. John Badham I feel has done better films like Blue Thunder(1982).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I ran across this film on HBO one night and ended up watching the entire film. I was surprised at how good it was despite the bad reviews I had read.In some of the reviews on here, I saw that some thought the premise was ridiculous. It was stated that if there was a huge conspiracy, why did they need to get Depp's character to kill the governor. This is explained in the movie. The governor's husband and the contributor ask why they were going this route when a high-powered rifle would do the trick. The key is the ego of Walken's character. He claimed he could make a killer out of anyone.Whoever thought the plot was predictable, I want to get lottery numbers from them because they are obviously psychic! The twists in the plot were good and I was pulled into the story. I also think that the acting was good all the way around. Johnny Depp looked like a man who had just come from a funeral and was overwhelmed by the extortion. Of course, Christopher Walken knows how to play the bad guy!This isn't an award-winning quality film, but was very entertaining. I give it a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unpredictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Nick of Time, Johnny Depp plays an innocent man(Gene Watson) returning from his wife's funeral with his daughter when he is without reason blackmailed by people he doesn't know to kill the governor within 90 minutes or his daughter will die. A rather interesting plot i must say. At first when the reason why Watson is suddenly forced with the task of assassination is never presented, you might go "this is clearly a bad movie. They don't even tell me why he has to kill the person", but, contrary to that, it does later on. Most of the plot is never directly explained in Nick of Time, because when certain events unfold, anyone with enough common sense can realize whats going on. One reviewer said the conspirators could have killed the governor on their own. If they did this, then their involvement in the assassination would be easier revealed. By using Gene Watson, they can put the blame far away from them, and to make doubly sure nobody assumes they did it, they even plan to videotape Gene's actions. The acting was very good. Charles Dutton's performance as a shoe shiner looks extremely genuine, especially when he is inviting people for a shoe shine. Christopher Walken's performance as a murderous conspirator is also just as good. The way he threatens Watson and pushes him around makes you really hate him. I don't know what to make of Depp's acting though. Most of the time he retains this blank look on his face, but, since he always does in real life as well, i guess he can't help it, so its okay. Most people say the plot is predictable. It is NOT. During the movie you wonder "how is Watson going to prevent the deaths of two important people when any wrong move he makes will result in his daughter's death?" and so on. All in all, a good thriller, though i wished that the ending would be more conclusive. If you're not picky with what movies you watch, and you're not expecting oscar-winning material, this is a good pick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This may not be the best thriller I've ever seen, but it sure wasn't the worst either. At first it is a bit chaotic and not always as intense as you might want to, but as the movie progresses it gets better and better.First you see a man and his daughter arriving at a train station. The police immediately takes them into custody, forcing them to come with them to their van. Their they make the man an offer. He has to kill a woman who he doesn't know. He gets 1.5 hours for it and if he fails or refuses his little daughter will die. Soon he finds out that the woman he has to kill is the governor and that he is involved in a conspiracy. As I already said the movie isn't really great at the beginning, but from the moment on that you are past the half way point it seems to shift up a few gears and it does exactly what you can expect from a thriller. That's why I give it a 7/10. Not really special, but certainly worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My mom and I have been on a Johnny Depp trip, so the next film on our list was Nick of Time. I watched it the other day and I have to say that I was so excited throughout the film, not to mention, it also stars one of the coolest actors ever, Chrisopher Walken! But the ending just left me with tons and tons of questions, my mom was just as puzzled. I just thought that while it's a good movie, it just lacked the rest of the story. It forgot to mention what happened to the characters and why they had motives. Also, I didn't like the way they developed Depp's character, why should I care about him so much? Just because he has a daughter doesn't mean he's a good person that I have to love or root for. Thank goodness they picked a likable actor though, other wise the story would have never worked.Gene Watson is walking with his daughter, we learn that his soon to be ex-wife died, but his day is about to get a thousand times worse when he is taken by who appears to be a cop. Mr. Smith, the cop, tells him that he has to kill a woman or he and his partner will kill his daughter. Lucky for Gene, the woman he's supposed to kill is the governor! Gene does whatever he can to get out of the situation, but its going to be more difficult when he finds out that almost everyone is involved in this attempt to assassinate.Nick of Time is over all a decent thriller, but it didn't necessarily excite me, I was a bit disappointed with the way they "developed" the characters and how it ended. It just left me with an empty feeling and a lot of questions. I love Christopher and Johnny so much and I really don't want to dislike this movie, but sometimes I guess the actors just get stuck with a bad director. Just the story needs some work, I wouldn't really recommend the movie though, it's just alright, I probably won't see it again though.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I previously asked 'has Johnny Depp ever *been* in a bad movie'?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The answer is now yes after viewing this one.Where do I start...Depp plays Gene Watson, an accountant who's travelled to LA with his daughter (For reasons never properly explained) and arrives at the train station only for the child to be kidnapped with her release being dependent on him murdering a woman at his girl's kidnappers' behest.From the off the story stretches credibility to an absurd degree, and demands you suspend disbelief throughout as events get dafter and dafter.Depp is gloriously miscast here, and struggles with a pretty appalling script which is as 2 dimensional as Bugs Bunny. His role was clearly more suited to a lesser actor whose reputation wouldn't be on the line...Herein lies a flaw - this comes across like a straight to video or made for TV movie. At no point does it ever convince that it's anything above 3rd rate, and its only single saving grace is a truly despicable bad guy in Christopher Walken (The master of such roles). Even *he* struggles at times, however, to remain believable given he seems to have a super-human knack of having eyes on the sides as well as back and front of his head.In truth it's *reasonably* entertaining as long as you accept that the story is ludicrous.</fullReview>

Like most recent reviewers, I am catching up on Johnny Depp movies and I just have to say that this one in a clunker along an otherwise smooth road. Stupid Plot, stupid, stupid, stupid.

		<shortDescription>Good cast and director, mediocre returns...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lately, Johnny Depp has proved he can do no wrong at the box-office, though occasionally in the past he has stumbled or the pictures themselves failed to catch fire. Although he generally makes movies of quality, it's in films like "Nick of Time", with the actor playing an Everyman embroiled in danger, where Depp tends to flounder. Cast as an accountant (and wearing stereotypical 'accountant' garb such as yuppie clothes and wire-rimmed glasses!), Depp becomes involved in a plot to assassinate the Governor of California. Filmed in 'real time' a la "High Noon", the picture has a good director (the workman-like John Badman) and fine support from Marsha Mason (a good choice as the Governor) and Charles S. Dutton (a guy from the working-class who believes Johnny's story). Yet, the set-up for this derivative plot is completely ludicrous, with unintentional laughter and shameless holes in the script mitigating any hope for suspense. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

Walken barely walks through this, undoubtedly because he knew there was little point after seeing just how poor a job the screenwriter did on this movie. Gloria Reuben and the rest of the cast are wasted, as well. The premise would stretch credulity in the hands of a master director. Badham is NOT that (though he did a decent job with "Point of No Return" in 1993). Save your time and money. Watch the Bridget Fonda flick I just mentioned. Or try "No Way Out" or its predecessor "The Big Clock" if you want something old school. Just don't bother with this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first comment that I would like to make about this movie is that if Johhny Depp wasn't in it, it would be worth almost nothing. Depp is what made this movie what it is. The plot is too ordinary and by far not unique enough. Even though I had never seen it before, I had felt like I saw it prior to the first time I actually did. However, Johnny Depp's character is what gives this movie its value, even though Christopher Walken is excellent in this movie too. A man named Gene Watson (Depp) and his daughter face a great deal of peril when two criminals who want the governor dead use Watson as a scapegoat and drastically blackmail him in the process. They kidnap his daughter and threaten to kill her by 1:30 if he doesn't kill the governor by then. They give him a job to do, and he desperately attempts to escape it by seeking out help by other people, but one of the criminals (Walken) stalks him and appears to be everywhere he tries to go. The final showdown is excellent and magnificently performed. This is a decent thriller, and I recommend it to anyone who likes Johhny Depp and expects a good action-packed and adventurous ride. 8/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never planned on watching this film last night, but as I was channel hopping I saw the names Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken in the opening tiles, and I figured it would be a good film. And I certainly was not disappointed.From the very beginning I was hooked, not taking my eyes away from the television for a second. The plot was simple yet fantastic, and I loved the fact that I had absolutely no idea what was going to happen next, whereas in many films it is easy to second guess the ending.It was extremely refreshing to see Johnny Depp playing an everyday father in this film, because everyone has seen him play the outcast role fantastically dozens of times, and this film showed that he is an extremely versatile actor who can turn his hand to anything. Although Depp was brilliant, the main star in this film for me was Christopher Walken. having only ever watched him before in Hairspray and Click, where his characters are much more light-hearted, it was really odd to see him playing somebody so vindictive and evil. However, he was so convincing in his role that I am sure I'll never watch Hairspray again in the same light! So all in all, this film was amazing. The acting was fantastic, the plot was gripping and the tension stayed in the room long after the television had been turned off.</fullReview>

Well, how about if the film's length is as long/short as the time our hero has to kill the politician? I'm sure this looked good on paper and in pitches but it's been done before ("real-time cinema") and this story isn't very good. It has potential but goes nowhere - basically it's Johnny Depp wandering around like a cry-baby for 90 minutes trying to make up his mind: kill or lose his daughter.Clich?©s are all here too: the kind black man who helps him out, the cute naive daughter, the evil villain who seems to do whatever he wants without getting caught, the female co-villain, etc., etc.Overall this isn't really worth 90 minutes and the same thing could have been done in five minutes - as a short this might have been really good but at a full-length running time it's just as long for us as it is for Depp's character.</fullReview>

(Brad Pitt is just as versatile, but nobody can claim he's undersung.) The action is tight, the drama keeps one on the edge of their seat, very few plot holes remain unfilled, and the tension sings. If you like drama, and haven't seen this yet, I envy you - you've got a gem to look forward to. The DVD cut isn't the best - there are some scenes cut.

		<fullReview>A movie which respects the three unities:action ,place and time.Not much food for thought but a lot of suspense and a good entertainment ,ideal for a rainy day.Johnny Depp portrays a plausible hero ,using more his brain than his muscles (no "Die Hard" 1,2 or 3 here),with a little help from a disabled black man.Christopher Walken ("Mister Smith" ) and Roma Maffia are delightful villains.And six-year -old daughter does not overact,as often abducted children do (in movies!) The clock plays a prominent part in the plot.A movie in real time,a trick used by Robert Wise for "the set up " in 1949.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unmitigated nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most preposterous "thriller" I've ever seen. Completely without any redeeming feature, apart from the fact that it's only 90 minutes. With a movie this bad, the shorter the better.There are so many flaws in this movie, I don't have time to enumerate them all. It's completely unbelievable, the writing is terrible, and the acting is mediocre. The acting might be decent, actually, but with a script this bad, who can tell? If you want to see a riveting thriller based on a simple idea, see Phonebooth. If you're a glutton for punishment or have never seen a movie before, then Nick of Time may be a good choice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp continued his interesting streak (preceded by "What's Eating Gilbert Grape", "Ed Wood" and "Don Juan DeMarco") with "Nick of Time". He plays accountant Gene Watson, whose daughter gets kidnapped. The kidnappers (Christopher Walken and Roma Maffia) give him a envelope and tell him to murder the person on the photo within the next hour and 15 minutes or his daughter dies. It raises the stakes when it turns out that they want him to assassinate the governor (Marsha Mason), and there's a conspiracy at work.I will admit that this movie isn't really anything special, but happening in real time heightens the suspense. Also starring Charles S. Dutton.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NICK OF TIME has a fairly good premise , okay it`s not the most original thriller ever made but it had potential but by about half through it becomes more and more contrived and ridiculous . I won`t give away any spoilers but there`s a scene when it looks like Gene is going to die for certain at the hands of the bad guy but then .... like I said I won`t spoil it for you but if you see the movie you`ll know the scene I`m talking about which had me convinced Gene was going to wake up and realise it`s all been a bad dream or something</fullReview>
