		<shortDescription>An intelligent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is really an example of how a romantic comedy should be and how fantastic a romantic comedy can be. Intelligent, witty and great fun. It gives its audience respect by delivering a clever story with good actors and great lines. The story is quite absurd and so is the duo in it - Marlon Brando and Johnny Depp. But this is just a good thing. Hollywood usually thinks its audience is filled with morons when making romantic comedies, but this is not so. There are still a few of us out here who enjoy the combination of intelligence, elegance and romance. This film delivers on all counts.Love is a simple enough ingredient for a film. This film knows how to use it and the result is wonderful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every bit as great a performance as in "Pirates".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie. Within five minutes I was smiling and didn't break stride for the entire performance. Depp is strong in this role and very convincing as the world's greatest lover. Marlon Brando is funny and witty and is well supported by Faye Dunaway in the marital relationship of a couple heading for retirement and the best times of their lives.Johnny Depp is perhaps one of the most versatile actors of all time. His performance is true and expressive and I just love his smile. I compare this performance to that of his character of Jack Sparrow in "Pirates of the Caribbean". I have no problem, whatsoever, recommending this movie to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>4 SECRETS OF THIS FILM YOU SHOULD NOT MISS !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unless you understand these 4 secrets, you will miss what the film is all about:1. The film is NOT about Don Juan !2. The film tells us how to rekindle love in our lives, even if we are old and gray-haired. This is so very important!!3. If we do not have a good dose of fantasy, of rich imagination, of beautiful dreams in our lives, then we will become 'burned out' by the harsh boredom of reality-as-we-perceive it. We are also challenged by the question "What really is real?"4. If we have too much fantasy and not enough reality, then we cannot cope with the rest of the world. Also, society will not be able to cope with us and we will be isolated, perhaps in a mental institution or at least in our own twisted world.Oh - did I say that this film is not about Don Juan? Well, in a sense, I lied. It is and it is not. See the film and think about it.Superbly well acted by Johnny Depp, Marlon Brando, and Fay Dunaway (what an incredible beauty even at her age!). An amazing script and a very original story. Unless you understand the meanings above, or if you have a cold heart, you'll probably rate it a 5 or 6. I give it a 9 out of 10!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its one of those never-fail pick-me-up movies - fun, cheeky and sensual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Psychologist Dr Jack Mickler (Marlon Brando) is called upon to negotiate a man down from the top of a tall building - a man claiming to be the great Latin lover Don Juan de Marco (Johnny Depp). Although Mickler is about to retire, he agrees to take Mr de Marco on, and delve into his mind and past. What he didn't count on was that Don Juan is starting to make him feel like HE'S missing something...The lives of Brando and Dunaway interact with their roles in the film - as oldies in need of rejuvenation by the young sex god. They were both sex symbols in their youth - Brando, till about the age of 60, was a real life Don Juan - he really HAS probably slept with over a thousand women. So if you know this it brings an interesting layer to the movie.It is a great journey which calls up all the great noble romances of the past in a tongue in cheek manner, with a love of stories, of fantasy, of women.I wouldn't hesitate to call it the most romantic movie ever made. If there was one flick you had to put on to set the right mood between you and a girl, this would be it.Looking at Johnny Depp might also help her in that regard.Its also a great fun family movie - which is a delicate balance to strike.4/5Disclaimer: there are about two sex scenes, which, though very discreetly and beautifully shot, featuring no vital organs, may be inappropriate for littlies, if you wish to shield them thus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A superb story where patient helps heal the doctor. In this case by spreading a bit of his romantic affliction. When one is so utterly convincing in their fantasy, it can become charming and attractive. If you have one ounce of the whimsical in your soul, who can't help but be drawn in. A story so well written and acted by all involved, it has to get a perfect 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A witty and original story with a real sense of character. I was compelled by the mysteries of Don Juan before gradually understanding that the question I had been asking myself - whether Depp is a slightly insane guy from Phoenix, or the world's greatest lover of 1502+1 women - is irrelevant. His story, whether fact or fiction, is a highly effective feel-good fable that brings across a whole new concept of the meaning of passion -- while not attempting to take itself too seriously. Equally enjoyable is psychiatrist Brando's transformation from mid life crisis-ridden man to great Hispanic lover. Hilarious, thought-provoking and romantic in equal measure, this film will make you hum latino melodies for days to come, and is perhaps the ultimate date movie for those less fortunate than the Don.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I want to live in Don Juan's world. Johnny Depp at 32(?) is quite believable as a 19 year old. He is also even more sexy than usual. I love him as Don Juan, but I think the most touching scene is when he is being interviewed by the judge and is "just a kid" and admitting to his real story. I cried when Marlon Brando asks Faye Dunaway what she wants to do and she says "I thought you'd never ask." I missed these characters after the movie was over.

		<fullReview>I recently re-watched this film with some friends and found myself, yet again, swept away by it's enchantment, romance, and live of life. In talking about it afterwards, I was struck by how well this film serves to reflect the romantic state of our souls.Quite simply, watch the film and, at the end, notice how you feel the about the character of Don Juan DeMarco.Was he a sad, lonely youth who invented a rich, romantic fantasy world for himself that became so appealing and rejuvenating to his psychiatrist that in the end they fly off to Mexico to re-live that fantasy world under his benevolent supervision?Or was he Don Juan DeMarco relating his adventures to Dr Mickler who becomes transformed by his tales of life and romance and is convinced of who Don Juan DeMarco is so that, in the end, they rehearse a story believable for the staff of the mental hospital that would set Don Juan free to fly off and reunite with his beloved Dona Anna?The film supports both interpretations. Ponder deeply which one you *really* believe and it will reveal the state of your romantic soul.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wholly different the usual fare Hollyood dished up in the nineties, DON JUAN DEMARCO is charming and disarming. The screenplay seems lovingly crafted around the two stars, Marlon Brando and Johnny Depp. They share scenes of relating, discovery and moving, personal respect. Mr. Brando shows easily, why he is still one of America's leading thespians. Faye Dunaway as his wife, is marvellous beyond words. The interplay between these three characters is a spirit lifting tour de force, that will leave you holding hands long after the screen has gone dark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is simply another great film by Johnny Depp. In the film, he plays a delusional man who believes that he is Don Juan. When I first watched the film I was actually waiting for another film to begin. However, I'm glad that I watched it. It has just the right balance of comedy and drama to make it a very unique film. As the movie progresses, Don Juan is telling his life story to his psychiatric doctor. As Don Juan commences, his doctor is also affected in many ways. The movie is directed very well, the ending is well done as well. I definitely recommend this movie to those who are fans of Depp's other works or just for anyone who hasn't seen a good film in a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guienuenly a good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My mom and I have been trying to see more Johnny Depp movies since we saw his biography, we've seen the main movies that highlighted his career, but never the little one's along the way. Don Juan DeMarco, I don't remember hearing much about it when it was released, I think it was one of those small success films. But the thing that was interesting is that so many people who compared Johnny Depp to Marlon Brando on his diverse roles and character acting methods, they finally got to work together in this movie and bonus, they had great chemistry on screen. Don Juan DeMarco isn't by any means my favorite Johnny Depp film or a great film, but it's a good one that I think had a decent story and is very watchable at least one time. Johnny and Marlon just deliver the story so well and were so charismatic on screen. Johnny truly became Don Juan DeMarco.Dr. Jack Mickler is a psychiatrist who is on his last few days before his big retirement. He meets a suicidal man who is claiming that he is the legendary Don Juan DeMarco, he is put into the hospital. He begs Jack to take the time to tell him his story and that if he can convince him that he is Don Juan, that Jack will let him go. He agrees and Don tells him his story. But Don's grandmother tells Jack a different story, is Don really Don or just some crazy guy who is desperately in love with a woman? But Jack believes him and even becomes a Don Juan at home with his wife.Don Juan DeMarco is a cute film and is definitely worth a look. There's nothing wrong with the film, I just wasn't into it as much as I am usually thrilled with Johnny or Marlon. But I think this was one of those films they could be more relaxed with and they were already very much established as great actors, so they could do a movie like this. It didn't matter that it wasn't a box office success, it's just a cute movie that I'm sure you'll enjoy. It definitely leaves a smile on your face and makes you feel good, so I would recommend it for a fun little comedy.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spice up your life with some love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this film. It made me think if I'm dreaming enough? Or am I just living life by its face value? Don Juan DeMarco, is about dreams, about fantasies, and about love. It raises the important question, how much of imagination is enough to spice up your life, and not turn you into a delusional freak. Everybody knows and accepts the fact that one can not have everything one desires, one can become everything one wants to be. so what do you do? Give up, and live the dull and routine life you have, or have 2 different worlds, one for yourself and one for everybody around you. But while doing that how do you make sure you don't end up severing your link with the real world and end up in a mental asylum. Its this tight rope that Don Juan DeMarco, played brilliantly by Johny Depp has to walk on. His real life leaves lot to be desired for. Rejected by his one and only true love, he drifts away in his fantasy world, where he is the greatest lover of all. By doing that, though he is able to transform himself into a real charmer, he distances himself from the real world, and his real identity. So he ends up in a clinic for delusional patients under the care of weary and dreary pshychatrist Dr Jack, played by charming Marlyn Brando. And this is the beginning of the delightful exchange of ideas and vision between the 2 completely different personas. In the process both of them tend to gain, and make their lives a little better. Don Juan gets back his identity, so that he doesn't have to live in the mental hospital, while Jack gets his grove back :-) Coming back to the technical aspects of the film, I don't think there's anything lacking there. Good screenplay, solid acting and soothing original score. The script comes up with jewels every now and then, which makes you rexamine your own beliefs in life, and love. A highly enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Its a simple working of a common but clever idea. You have the reality of the viewer, the reality of the film and a separate reality of a character within the film. Here, as with hundreds of others, the third impinges on the second in such a way as to blur the relationship between our reality and that of the film. But this time, we have two of the three living actors capable of shifting among all these worlds. Under the foolishness, that's just what they do, though it is hard to tease out behind the rather vapid direction and somewhat silly story. One scene tells all about what masters these are: Brando in bed with popcorn. Here, you can see all sorts of things going on under that childish abandon toward DeMarco's Mexico.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A girlfriend put it best: "Johnny Depp is sex on a stick in this movie, you have to see it!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Don Juan De Marco" is really the ideal romantic comedy. It's so adorable! The best part is definitely the star, Johnny Depp, which the name should speak for itself but as long as I'm writing... sexy, sensual, mysterious, and amazingly charasmatic. His accent is wonderful and his mannerisms draw you in. Not to mention his eyes...Then there are the monologues he goes into that make all of us women wish that there was a "Don Juan De Marco: How to Make Love to a Woman 101" course for all boyfriends/husbands/one night stands to take. His descriptions of sex that many men would turn into vulgar vocabulary lessons nobody ever wanted to hear instead are romantic and sweet. Really, we know that we can't expect all guys to live up to a written character that was actually designed to be the greatest lover the world has ever seen... but who's concerned with reality when they're watching Johnny?How this got by with a PG-13 rating, I do NOT know, but who's complaining! I definitely have a feeling this movie was geared towards female audiences, and for once the sex scenes highlight the guy! That's where the "sex on a stick" part comes in. Yummy!I love movies that answer everything, and the end to this movie is perfect. It's too good to be true, but that's ok. It's unbelievable, but that's alright. If you're cynical, or if you're, well, a straight male... then this movie probably isn't the best for you. If you're a Johnny Depp fan, or, well, a straight female... then this is definitely worth checking out. But bottom line, its romantic, entertaining, sexy as HELL, and just plain fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jeremy Leven wrote the screenplay as an instructional piece on attaining higher consciousness and, as such, is superior to any other work including the other fine works of this genre, The Thin Red Line, The Mission (1985), and American Beauty.Most individuals observing the film, unless learned in the mystical teachings, will have difficulty grasping the metaphor, which encompasses the film from beginning to end. For those who have not had the privilege of yet viewing this film, may I suggest that Don Juan's perception be viewed as (divine)"Truth"; the "facts" are completely irrelevant except as a means to discover these Truths.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my all time favorite movies. I wrote a rhetorical analysis of it for a film class I took last semester. On the surface the film is a fun little story where the patient cures the doctor, but if you look a little deeper there are a couple of messages that were important to me. Romanticism is not a malady that needs to be cured, but the very thing that makes life worth living. There is a quote from the movie that explains it best: "There are only four questions of value in life, Don Octavio. What is sacred? Of what is the spirit made? What is worth living for, and what is worth dying for? The answer to each is the same: only love."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don Juan DeMarcoEvery movie lover/reviewer harbors a shameful little secret - while they spend their time lauding serious films with deep messages, talking about visionary cinematography or writing expository essays about tortuous characterizations, they don't tell you about that one film that they really love. It may be a B-movie starring their favorite big-busted scream queen, or trashy gross out comedy or one of dozen other genres. But be assured that that film is kept amongst the blank tapes and will never shares the same shelf space as the serious films in their collection. Well I for one won't hide my copy anymore! Warning: Spoilers ahead.Unable to find his true love, Don Juan DeMarco, the giver of pleasure, cannot, go on living. His efforts are foiled by one Dr. Mickler, a skilled and weary physician who has grown tired of paint by the numbers psychiatry. Shipped off to a psychiatric hospital for an evaluation, Don Juan asks to be given the opportunity to recount his tragic life and convince the doctor that he is not delusional. Mickler, surprised by Don Juan's candor and apparent lack of artifice agrees to the deal. And thus begins a remarkable journey.I first saw this movie in 1996- I had gone to get some rentals at the local video outlet and found the no brainer action flick I wanted, but needed to find something romantic for my girlfriend (I made a promise). While scouring the shelves for something that didn't look too mushy, I accidentally knocked this movie off the shelf. I did a quick scan of the synopsis, and figured "Bingo" and ran home. It was one of the most fortuitous mistakes I ever made.Johnny Depp shines as Don Juan DeMarco - he is witty, fresh, and sincere. Depp repeatedly takes us into the realm of cheeziness, but playing Don Juan any other way would be a mistake -his message would be too hard to accept if it weren't tongue in cheek. Don Juan's exuberant spirit and ability to discern what is truly important is readily contagious. Marlon Brando is also a joy to watch as Dr. Mickler, indeed it's the most he's given himself over to a role in decades. His transformation from bitter, tired old man to vibrant wide eyed optimist open to life's gifts is thoroughly engaging. Rounding off the cast is Faye Dunaway, as Dr. Mickler's devoted. She successfully conveys the stunned amazement and joy at discovering an unknown side of a partner she has lived with for decades. Many aspects of this film are far-fetched, indeed ridiculous, but the underlying story and its message are too hard to resist. Unless you are a dyed in wool cynic, you will find the magic in Don Juan DeMarco. I still do?</fullReview>

The thing I liked best about this film was that it set up the question of whether Johnny Depp was really (a) Don Juan DeMarco or (b) a troubled youth from Phoenix.

I loved the way the film advocated using your imagination, and then allowed you to do so within its ending.Who else could play Don Juan other than Johnny Depp? I thank him for the roles he chooses to play. Marlon Brando was also good, but I thought Faye Dunaway was a real standout.

		<shortDescription>Exceptional Romance spiced by witty comedic dialog worth its 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every movie reflects its times. This one is certainly no exception. The mysteries of courtship have reduced to awkward teen-age comedies or sexual romps where the sex has little or no relevance and even less lust.So much of the wonder of this film is derived from its fantasy. As long as we think its fantasy, we do not have to ask how accurate it may represent our reality. In other words this film wisely avoids what is and focuses on what should be. Or maybe what was.The movie opens with Don Juan DeMarco (Johnny Depp) walking with purpose and in the full costume of an 18th century cavalier (complete with a cape). He goes into a restaurant. There he finds a beautiful young woman waiting for her dinner companion (who is late). Don Juan begins to talk to her. He takes her hand, and noticing her knuckles (a word of cacophony if ever there was one) and delivers an ode, which celebrates the perfection of that part of her hand. His words are smooth and his delivery flawless. His sincerity cannot be questioned. She succumbs to his charm. After a seduction (he would not have been concerned if he had failed), he announces that he is now ready to kill himself! Talk about tongue in cheek.He is set to do it when Marlon Brando enters as the wonderful Dr. Mickler/ Don Octavio De Flores who is hoisted up to where Don Juan is by a Cherry Picker that he has trouble getting into. Don Octavio immediately talks Don Juan down by accepting whom Juan thinks they both are. That's the wonderful beginning.In the next 10 days, Don Juan tells Don Octavio, a series of tales that reminds one of Scherezade. In the meantime every woman and one of the men besides Don Octavio (a really tall muscular masculine type named Rocco) come completely under his spell and they all listen to their hidden romantic side.Don't confuse Don Juan DeMarco with the Decameron. The movie is not really about sex, seduction, or relationships between men and woman.I may be wrong, but I think it is a yearning. It is a cry for something better that we all want for ourselves. What woman would not want to have notice taken of the effort she has gone to make herself as good looking as she can? What man would not like to have the skill to make a woman believe what he says about her? What man does not secretly wish he was so deeply committed to something (women in this case) that his words would convey his deep feelings effortlessly? Furthermore that his commitment was pure and truthful? That it was not a line? We cannot look at these questions in a movie without covering them with something like fantasy. The ideal is so unappealing. We want instant gratification.I have thought about this for a considerable time and have come to the conclusion that a woman could never accept what I have written without thinking it was masculine crap. If cornered I would agree. But before I did, I would point out that Don Juan was a poet whose verses are life. He believes what he says: it is his ultimate truth. Seduction and sex are really quite secondary. Finding perfection and conveying it is primary.Don Juan is well worth your two-hour investment. Perhaps it will connect you to what you yearn for and the truth everyone seeks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have yet to see a bad Johnny Depp movie (I haven't seen Cry Baby), and this is one of his better flicks. I can't imagine anyone else playing the part of Don Juan better. Marlon Brando also lends a solid performance (but he's definitely had roles that better showcase his talent than this). The costuming was superb, the old Mexico scenes were handled well, and the plot was an entertaining mix of flashbacks and present day. Depp's monologue about the "two great questions in life" will forever be ingrained in my memory. This movie, while not ground-breaking, is an excellent choice for an evening with a special someone. It's a charming tale that will give you a warm feeling every time you watch it. I bought it and have not regretted the decision. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whimsical. Brando and Depp are great together.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brando, matinee idol of the 1950s, some consider him the greatest actor of all time. Johnny Depp, always takes chances with his roles, I've never seen a bad performance of his. Here Brando, old and blimp-like, plays the shrink ten days away from retirement, who goes via forklift to the top of a roadside billboard at night, to talk down this caped man who claims to be 'the' Don Juan Demarco, greatest lover of all time. Brando does nothing fancy here, is just very good and believable as the shrink and husband (wife played by Faye Dunaway) who has settled into a dull routine. Especially with his wife. This is not a great movie, but a very good one, enjoyable for the whimsy and the good story telling. There is one scene which shows a harem of partially nude women briefly, in a non-sexual manner, other than that it is pretty tame.SPOILERS follow, don't read further if you have yet to see the movie. Against his boss's wishes, Brando takes the 10-day assignment to try and straighten this guy out, to cure his delusions that he is 'the' Don Juan. But the shrink gets caught up in the stories, acted out vividly as flashbacks, and begins to see that he himself had abdicated as his wife's great lover. He systematically begins to rectify that, and the movie becomes mainly Brando's and Dunaway's, as these tales of romance get them to rekindle their love life. In fact, that is the whole theme of the Don Juan character, to remind everyone that love is all that really matters. A cute little movie. It ends with the three main characters on a south seas island beach, and 'Don Juan' walks to greet the girl he described as his great true love, and the audience wonders 'what if he really is Don Juan Demarco?'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unabashedly amorous and sweet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DON JUAN DEMARCO lives in the comedy section at my local Blockbuster. I suppose that is the best place for it; it does not suffer under the weight of its psychiatric-evaluation plot device, is exultant and exhilarating, and includes some truly laugh out loud funny lines.For the most part, though, DJDM is a romantic fable with lessons not just for men (about how to seduce a woman touching nothing but her hand, for example), but for women as well (about how romance can exist in our everyday lives, even if we never encounter Don Juan).Johnny Depp plays Don Juan DeMarco, the world's greatest lover - a 21 year old man in Queens, NY when we meet him. He has nothing left to live for and climbs to the top of a billboard to await a worthy adversary who will endhis life. Instead, he gets a somnambulistic psychiatrist on the verge of retirement (Marlon Brando), who convinces him to come down and promptly commits him for observation.In tone, the film is similar to CHOCOLAT (which also stats Depp) and LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE; its environment of a psychiatric hospital where the young Don Juan must prove his sanity reminds me of the grandfather in A PRINCESS BRIDE. It gives us a point of reference in our own world and prevents the unbridled romanticism of Don Juan's monologues from getting out of hand.No man other than Depp could sit squarely in this modern-world fishbowl and deliver the lines of Don Juan. He insisted on working with Brando on the film, but he outshines the cinema icon in every shared shot. His physical beauty is less important than his utter sincerity - a sincerity so convincing that even my "I hate chick flicks" husband can watch with a straight face and come away in a better mood.As Don Juan says, "there are only four questions of value in life: What is sacred? Of what is the spirit made? What is worth living for? What is worth dying for?" By the end of the film, he has proven his point: "the answer to each is the same - only love." Not that the story answers all of its own questions...Is Don Juan a pathological liar and a schizophrenic? Is he troubled but sincere? Does Brando's Dr. Mickler really get conflicting evidence from Don Juan's family, or has he slipped into a daydream fueled by his desire to recapture the part of himself Don Juan represents? No matter how many times I see the film, I end up believing *in* Don Juan, even if I do not *believe* him.DJDM gets a 7 in spite of being one of my favorite films. The reason: Brando can be nearly intolerable at times, but Depp picks up his slack. Highly recommended to romantics of all ages - one of the sexiest movies in my collection, despite its PG rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very cute romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Don Juan DeMarco" works as long as you're willing to meet it halfway. If you allow yourself to get swept up in its spell, then it's a fine romance. However, if you look at it through the eyes of an "enlightened intellectual," then it falls flat on its face. The trick is allowing yourself to go with the flow, because the film quality is poor, and it's distancing.At the beginning of the film, a young man dressed as a first-class Zorro wannabe is walking on top of a billboard, demanding to die honorably in a duo with a person named Don Franciso. Enter Dr. Jack Mickler (Marlon Brando), a brilliant psychiatrist 10 days to retirement. Mickler talks him down, and despite objections, decides to treat this apparently delusional 21-year old, and ends up getting more than he bargained for.Johnny Depp. Marlon Brando. Faye Dunaway. All three are brilliant performers, and the thought of them being in the same movie is enough to motivate any film lover to put this in the DVD player. While no one is especially bad, this is not a masterpiece of thespian abilities. Johnny Depp is clearly enjoying himself as the great lover (complete with cliché romantic accent). Marlon Brando is solid as Mickler, although it can be hard to understand what he's saying sometimes. Faye Dunaway is hardly ever on screen, but she's in it.The film is not flawless, however. The film's look is terrible; it looks as if every last penny was spent on the actors (judging by how Hollywood works, it probably was). Had the film itself looked better, its faults would have been easier to overlook. Additionally, in Don Juan's "flashbacks," some of the names are so similar and the people look so much alike that it's hard to tell who's who.If you ever wonder what an ideal PG-13 romance looks like, this is it. There are some sex scenes, and a few shots of breasts and buns (all female) including one of a harem where hundreds of women are completely nude (shown from far away of course). Thankfully, the MPAA had the sense to give this a PG-13 (I have no idea how though...), but it's appropriate. The sex and nudity are discreet, and the tone is playful. Sadly, in today's world, the view of the harem would have to be cut to avoid an NC-17 rating.If you're looking for something lighthearted and playful (not to mention romantic), "Don Juan DeMarco" is a solid choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romance is the spice of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a wonderful reminder of how important romance is at any age; no matter how long you're been married or how old you are, romance is the spice of life, and you can have with the person you've been lying next to for 20 minutes or 20 years.Brando and Dunaway are wonderful. Johnny, well, he was superb, even this old lady would not have minded finding herself in his path of one-night stands during his journey. What he said is so true, what a woman is, mostly, is a reflection of what you show her. Every woman is beautiful, question is, is the man man enough to bring it out in her? Here the psychiatrist has been married all those years, about to retire and because he listens to the stories of one last young male patient who finds beauty in every woman, the doctor, almost contagiously, brings these feelings of romance home to a wife who has been waiting years for him to look for this side of her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>El Burlador de Seville</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I have yet to read it, I assume Don Juan DeMarco is loosely based on Tirso's original oeuvre. "Burlador" is Spanish for mocker; Don Juan mocks women and faith. In my opinion this movie doesn't try to ridicule women, rather it shows them as sensuous, and glorious...although it still pokes fun at religion in a light hearted way. DeMarco isn't delusional. He's fully cognizant of 'reality', but to acknowledge it is too painful - he takes a less "limited and creative" view of his situation.The whole movie is a little tongue in cheek - e.g., calling Marlon Brando's character 'Don', a reference to his role in the Godfather. Dismissing why DeMarco is an Italian name, he was born in Mexico, and has a Castillian accent (I laughed even harder when I found out Depp modelled his accent after Ricardo Montalban, a Mexican). Octavio asking Lucita to "come" upstairs.The Mickler's garden scene has inconsistent lighting, which is probably to make the actors appear softer, as opposed to the harsh incandescent lighting previously. And a little sloppy editing. If Dona Anna takes his mask on Eros, how does he start the movie with it? I realized "eros" is sex, and part of his OCD. fwiw, there is an Eros, Louisiana:) His goatee changes or disappears at odd times.I see DeMarco growing sexually (if only in his imagination). Loving one woman, then 1501, then finally his true love Dona Anna (which makes exactly 1503). How can a man truly love one woman? Or love 1500? Does he believe in true love, or is it just a nice movie ending? I still can't resolve how he could have such an effect on all the women in the institution, but not be successful in his personal life. He and Dr Mickler (Jack or John?) lose their masks at the end.The whole premise of a 32 year old portraying a 16 and 21 year old - and two sex symbols unlucky in love - is a little far fetched in the first place.DeMarco has such a strong reality that it pulls everyone in...despite it being a fantasy. After a short battle, Bill finally accepts DeMarco's reality (saying "villa" in Spanish). Rocco moves to Madrid after a short time around DeMarco. It even spills into Faye Dunaway's character, despite never having met DeMarco.In his own words, his fantasy is harmless enough, as long as it makes him happy. He deals with identity a couple of times throughout the movie. For someone who decided to become Don Juan, his foundation beliefs and reality is awfully solid and consistent.This movie is very charming, and has a lot of nuance that I'm still picking up on the 3rd viewing. It's never too late to feed the pyre, even if you've convinced yourself that a 'warm glow' is good enough.</fullReview>

When Brando's character first appears, he picks on another guy about how fat he's getting, which is hilarious.The movie also contains some of the most classic lines in movie history, such as:"As luck would have it, she was the only one that mattered.""...One thousand, five hundred, and two."Should you see this movie?"Why not?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just read a review from someone who saw this twice in seven years and they didn't like it. Well, that's what makes a horse race: difference on option. I just saw it again for the first time since I saw it when it came out and I was thinking "What a nice movie". Brando and Dunaway were really nice playing off one another, she not in it much, but it's nice when they are together. And the ending is nice as well. No spoiler, but how could it end any other way but "nice". Depp couldn't have done it any better. Maybe 'coz I'm just a few years from Don Carlo's place that I find it such a nice movie, but when end of career movies play it honestly, it's nice. I keep saying "nice", like it's some like of curse, but it's not, it's just the only word I can think of that does this film justice: nice, as in winning the Power Ball would be nice.It's not On the Waterfront, it's not Cane or even Pirates, just a nice solid movie with three solid actors and a good supporting cast and crew doing what they do best: nice, solid work. So get your best movie partner, a bowl of popcorn and sit back and enjoy the show. And oh yeah, if you don't take it (or yourself) too seriously, you might even laugh a time or two!</fullReview>

The psychiatrist comes to this realization and is saved by the patient. This movie challenges us to view our personal lives and relationships through the mind and actions of a young self-proclaimed Don Juan who not only believes that he is Don Juan but has become Don Juan - and who are we to say he is not?

		<shortDescription>Ahh....the lovely world of fantasy....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don Juan DeMarco - more than any movie I have ever seen - takes you into a world of fantasy. Of course there are other movies; but none really combined realty with fantasy the way this did and left you wondering at the end which is the true way to go - which is how it should be. The entire movie is nothing but the clashing of reality and fantasy, though, not distinguishing which is which.There was something unique about Don Juan and his character and that is one simple fact: he KNEW he was crazy. Well, he knew he would appear to be crazy to the "normal" people in society. Yet, he created his fantasy and his dreams because it is what satisfied him, and it is what made him disperse his love (not metaphorically speaking). He created this dream, this "fantasy" of himself so he could live to be the person he would be his best at. We all have different people living inside of us - we just have to find which one is our best and go with that.Don Juan DeMarco is a brilliant fairy tale of the differences between reality and fantasy. It leaves you wondering how exactly you can achieve such a thing as reality and fantasy co-existing in the same world. But, as Marlon Brando's character put it in the closing lines of the movie....why not?</fullReview>

When you have been married as long as I have then the scenes between Brando and Dunaway have an intense pertinence and reflect clearly how individuals feel when their 'best years' have past.Depp is fantastic and I could clearly see the genesis of many of the 'Pirates' mannerisms in his performance. Watch the scene where he is training to sword fight with his father...pure 'Jack Sparrow'!! His accent was totally convincing and the truly romantic language slid off his tongue like pure gold.A superb and very distinctive music score ensured that this was a gripping and enjoyable watch.Thoroughly recommended.</fullReview>

I was pleasantly surprised by what I saw.This is a movie that is nothing less than charming; a fantastic blend of quirky, delicate humour and a heart-warming message about life and love. Johnny Depp again dazzles the viewer with his ability to sink wholly into his role, this time with a convincing Spanish accent, and Marlon Brando gives a wonderful performance, as usual. Everyone else, though having minor roles, did nothing to take away from the film.I'll admit, it took me a while to sink into this movie, but I when I did, I was lost in its charming atmosphere, which was oddly reminiscent of Burton's "Big Fish", though less exaggerated. It was well made, and had my attention for the rest of the movie. When it was over, I felt better having watched it. It has no violence of note, aside from a couple of ungraphic stabbings, one fully naked woman (from behind), a few glimpses of partial nudity, and approached raunchiness from time to time, but nothing to discourage the faint of heart.It's not perfect, to be sure, but how many movies are? This movie is as good as any, and I was not disappointed. Try it out, and you'll be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp is very persuading as a delusional youth living out the fantasy that he is Lord Byron's mythical ladies man, Don Juan, in DON JUAN DEMARCO. Institutionalized after a failed suicide attempt made in the name of a lost love, Depp is analyzed by none other than one-time real-life lothario Marlon Brando, playing a retiring psychiatrist who has lost the meaning of life and love. The film is in fact as much about Brando as Depp, as Depp weaves his tales of lost loves and Brando regains his ardor for life and his long-suffering wife, masterfully played by Faye Dunaway in one of her last great roles. It is no surprise, then, that the final shot of the movie is not of Depp in the arms of his lost love but of Brando in the arms of Dunaway, grandly dancing to the title tune. Fantasy or reality? I vote for reality, but I suspect just as many of you will say it is all fantasy. The film bogs down momentarily halfway through, but stay with it and be rewarded. If your mate doesn't jump your bones immediately after watching this, then jump hers. Or find yourself a new mate to watch this with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the previews for this movie right before it came out and was captivated just from those. I saw it pretty soon after it was released and thought it one of the oddest movies I've ever seen but charming too and very well acted.It's tough for me to do a complete review because I've only seen this once and that was way back when, but I did enjoy it very much and found the whole concept to be unique, quirky and very original. And I have to admit, though, I'm no major Depp fan, his Don Juan was certainly an unforgettable movie character. One of the interesting things about this movie is how it really does reach across all age groups and really doesn't fall into a certain movie "type." I think there's a lot that makes this movie unique, there's first the whimsical story itself, the intrigue felt through the movie(is he or isn't he really Don Juan), the strange, off beat characters, accompanied by terrific acting and captivating visuals. Don Juan Demarco didn't really make me wanna see it multiple times once it was over, but it did distinguish itself in the above mentioned ways and it was a unique and interesting movie to view. I'd give it a strong 7.5 out of 10. It is quirky and charming just like the main character himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inconsistent but still quite ingenious romantic comedy (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Don Juan DeMarco" is a successful Nineties updating of Lord Byron's most famous work. This film's Don Juan (played by Johnny Depp) is a poetic, romantic young man who, when we first see him, dresses up in a bizarre old-fashioned costume (complete with mask), seduces a lonely woman in a restaurant, and makes an extravagant attempt to kill himself, having recently lost his great love Don Ana (Geraldine Pailhas). He is taken in by Dr Mickler (Marlon Brando), who interns him at the mental hospital where he works as a psychiatrist. Mickler believes Don Juan to be a delusional patient, but is given ten days to let the young man to persuade him otherwise...The comedy of the plot lies in that Don Juan is who he says he is. The film presents evidence that he is really a deluded, misguided young man and the catch, of course, is that he's not. There is further an element of reverse psychiatry here. Through relating the story of his life (which plays like a mythical Greek tragedy), Don Juan rejuvenates Mickler's marriage to his lovely wife Marilyn (Faye Dunaway). The sexuality of the film is handled with grace and appropriate discretion, and is not too explicit that it upsets the tone of the picture. There is some good comedy moments where Don Juan gets the better of the other stilted, staid psychiatrists who populate the hospital.The key to the film, however, is in the dialogue and themes. Don Juan seems a very creative, interpretive young man who is disenchanted with modern society and likes to be able to see things, especially women, in new and original ways. Much of Don Juan's dialogue is poetic and evocative, and Johnny Depp makes the most of it. The late Marlon Brando plays it straight as Mickler, but is never less than convincing and makes his character's change seem real. He is well-partnered with Faye Dunaway as his relaxed, fun-loving wife. The stunning Taliso Soto and Geraldine Pailhas play the two main loves of Don Juan's life.There are some annoying inconsistencies. In spite of Don Juan's insistence that he loves all women, the film isn't brave enough to capture him courting anyone but the most dazzling Hollywood beauties. The film looks good, but could have been edited together much better. At times it slips too abruptly from one scenario to the next. In addition there some glaringly careless visual errors (Brando's character is called Jack but the notice on his office door says 'John').Nevertheless, at nearly ten years old, "Don Juan DeMarco" still makes for a great summer movie and remains a fine lighthearted fable on the glory of romantic love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* Some Minor Spoilers Material Below *Normally I find drama or romance movies to be quite boring, but this one was a definite exception to the rule. Johnny Depp was perfect for his role, the acting was great, and the story was wonderfully done. Johnny Depp's romanticized story of his past was really good. The comedy in the movie was done very tactfully as well. There was no real outright laughter comedy, it was all more like something that just makes you smile. The romantic sets of Johnny Depp's past were so perfectly romantic they made you smile as well. Overall, the movie was very fun to watch, there was no action (except for one swordfight) yet I still found it to be more fun to watch than most action movies I've seen. I recommend this movie to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is plenty of action and moving scenes in the movie, Johnny is at his best! It was so good that they decided to let him go to the beach he came from. and I liked, that Don Juan was always as honest as he could be. he found hes true love in the end and thats a big "awh!" for me at least...I think its good to belief in a adventure as great and daring as that, like "Don Octavio".thumbs up fore that idea in that movie, caus it just shows us that honest love is pure and lasts for a very long time. you can always forgive mistakes if you love the on who made the mistake, like Don Juan told the virgin on the island that he had slept with 1501 women!!now that was interesting!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent Movie, usually not understood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The significance of this story has been been explained at a very shallow level by most reviewers, externally &amp; internally. If the cognoscenti will recall, a classic psychiatric collection of short stories, written by whom I cannot recall, entitled "The 50 Minute Hour" The author, a practicing psychiatrist, wrote of his case histories; gleaned, as it were, from his experiences at a state mental institution. The common theme of each story was based on this premise: A major delusion can only support one resident. If perhaps another individual attempts to enter the delusion, and seems to believe the the elements of the delusion, the original delusive person, i.e. the patient, will surrender his claim to the delusion, and essentially drop it for another. When this shift occurs, the patient (ideally) surrenders his delusive behavior, and declares the therapist to be an intruder, and therefore denies the delusion. mental health ensues. But Coppola has said "what if the therapist becomes entrapped in the delusion?" What then? And it is a romantically captivating delusion, hmmmmmm?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Depp and Brando tugged at my heart when I first saw the movie in the theater in 1995. Then, ahhhhh, to my great surprise, I recently viewed the DVD version of Don Juan! What could be better than Depp's Costillian-accented voice narrating the movie? On the DVD version try selecting the full-length motion-picture with the movie's musical score only! You can see the full length motion picture with no sound except the musical score! The music rises with the passion of the love scenes, and decrescendos with Don Juan DeMarco's bitter dissappointments. The music-only sound version made me appreciate the fine acting of each member of the cast; the expressive facial changes, and the erotic glances and gentle touches of the two comedic heros played by Depp and Brando. I recommend this experience for any lovers who would like a truly touching, sweet, experience. It would be a nice choice for Valentine's Day or an Anniversary.</fullReview>

The doctor learned whit him how to give his wife more attention, and to love her another time...That is: the mad man was wiser than the doctor! I'll enjoy this history forever! Curiously, men do not like, or don't want either see this film. I think this make them unconfortable, because can't understand what they make wrong. Don Juan is for them only a strange person. Nobody makes love like him, he don't exists. But, how mad are women? What see they about that guy? That's a simple thing: tenderly, sensibility, understanding. It's too easy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastical romance - but a really good time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, first things first - this movie is a fairy tale. The point of the movie is not that Johnny Depp's character really did all these things - it's that sometimes, getting a little carried away with romance and fantasy can actually be a good thing.It's about this psychiatrist (Brando) who is days away from retirement at the correction center when in comes a new patient to be evaluated (Depp) who thinks that he's Don Juan. What starts out as an absurd and seemingly easy "final project" for Dr. Brando actually becomes complex. The doctor, while listening to Depp's fantastical life story, is simultaneously inspired to help the young man AND to inject his own mundane life with a little of Depp's spark...and mojo.It may be a little hard for some people to get behind this movie at first. Depp's character is a little out there, and the stories are crazy! And it's more than a little depressing to see Brando approximately 9 times the size he once was. But it's supposed to be funny, and it is. Depp is intoxicatingly sensual in this movie, and one of the best things is the transformation of Brando's character from a tubby, boring, aging man to one rejuvenated with life and passion for his beautiful wife (Faye Dunaway).This is a really fun, feel-good kind of movie, well-acted and with a beautiful score. I recommend this for a couple to watch together to enhance the romance, or also for a group of girlfriends to enjoy together.8/10 on the romantic comedy scale!</fullReview>

Don Juan De Marco is by far, the best romantic movie ever. I adore this movie very much, and actually I find that Don Juan De Marco's character is very similar to mine, and I learned much from this wonderful movie.So, to all of you out there who are hopeless romantic and need help in how to treat your women, you've got to watch this adorable film, and you better not watch it alone (go ahead and make it up to your girlfriend and invite her to watch the movie with you).Very good acting done by Johnny Depp, he makes you believe that he is really Don Juan De Marco, the world's greatest lover of all time. Also Marlon Brando played a very good character (Dr. Mickler the psychiatrist).Finally, the movie has a touch of comedy that accompanies most of the romantic scenes. You find yourself at the end of the movie simply crying with tears of joy. This movie is sure 10 out of 10 (and even more).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unique look at the question of identity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don Juan DeMarco is in many ways an under-rated film. Its strengths lie not in the plot or narrative per se, but rather in the way it treats the question of personal identity, against the backdrop of mental illness.The film begins with a caped Don Juan (Depp) threatening to throw himself of an advertising billboard, but is eventually talked out of it by Dr Jack Mickler (Brando), a psychiatrist about to go into retirement. Mickler is intrigued by this person, and takes him under professional supervision. The psychiatrist is intrigued with this caped character, and wants to find out exactly who he is. And that is the central question of the whole movie - who exactly is this person who claims to be Don Juan DeMarco, the greatest lover in the world?In fact, this Don Juan seems to be so like his fictitious counterpart that Mickler becomes absorbed in his patient's story. During therapy, amazing tales emerge of a debonair, charming individual with an exotic and colourful past. Don Juan is depressed because although he has wooed hundreds of women all over the world, he has been rejected by the only one he has ever truly loved. Complete with an accent and dark good looks, Don Juan could easily be right out of the pages of fiction.While his patient's story is unfolding at work, we also follow an interesting parallel regarding Mickler's domestic life. We can see an interesting effect observed by very few Hollywood films, and that is not the effect of therapist on patient, but the effect of patient on therapist.Depp and Brando are talented actors who take their parts admirably, and are backed up by a strong supporting cast. This combination is dynamic in advancing the central theme of the whole film - that of identity. Throughout the film, the characters develop a rich understanding, and the end of the film is both touching and memorable.Blended with genuine humor, very human emotions and a subtle but unmistakable poke at the established Western tradition of psychiatry, "Don Juan DeMarco" is a splendid and compelling film. Any film fan will find what they are looking for here, from the lover of romance to the comedy connoisseur, or those who are just looking for something a little different from the norm. To anyone who has ever loved or been loved, I would heartily recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unsuccessful Romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unsuccessful romance and would-be satire which attempts to suggest that in the real world we are all seventeenth century Spanish noblemen and women (and all fantastic lovers), if only we could see.Johnny Depp is Johnn De Marco (Don Juan De Marco), a depressed twenty-one year old who is convinced he is the famous womaniser. Marlon Brando plays the kid's psychologist Dr. Mickler (a.k.a. Don Octavio De Florez), who agrees to give Johnny ten days to convince him he is in fact De Marco.It is never quite clear whether writer/director Jeremy Leven is actually trying to convince us, or is merely playing around with an idea. Perhaps he felt he might provide us with a little light entertainment. In truth, "Don Juan De Marco" is nothing more than a hedonist's dream, as De Marco goes from one woman to the next, literally. One thousand, five hundred and two women bend to his will. If sexual conquest is your thing, then maybe Don Juan is you man. For me though, all play and no morals make Jack a promiscuous boy.The cast, including Depp, Brando and Faye Dunaway, do little to help.Sunday, June 8, 1997 - Video</fullReview>

Guess I'll have to buy the DVD.For the life of me I don't know why we have to pay our good money to see movies and get scene after scenes in darkness, performed by actors who think mumbling is acting, and sound tracks that blast the ears and obliterate most dialogue. If I want to see nothing, I can turn out the lights for free. But I have become fairly adept at lip reading and manage to understand scenes despite the unintelligible dialogue that script writers have labored so hard to produce. (IMBd's computer says I misspelled "dialogue" but I and my trusty Webster's Collegiate, circa 1944 stand by our choice. Besides, it looks prettier.) Don Juan DeMarco is truly a masterpiece in so many ways, I give it a ten without hesitation. Why carp when you see true beauty and artistry</fullReview>

For those of you who are not familiar with it, it is characterized by elements of the fantastic woven into the story with a deadpan sense of presentation. One of the best examples of this is the opening sentence of One Hundred Years of Solitude: "Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice."Don Juan DeMarco struck me as being magical realism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm sure glad I didn't go to film critic school so I could LOVE this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My parents met when my father hired my mother to work for the small family chain of theaters which he managed. I love movies! I grew up at a time when movies seemed more focused on entertaining, uplifting, giving hope, and taking us OUT, and away from, our humdrum and sometimes, ugly lives. A few of my favorite movies are: GLEN MILLER STORY; MAN FROM SNOWY RIVER; THE MUSIC MAN; ROCKY (only the original); AWAKENINGS; Almost anything with Jimmy Stewart, Kirk Douglas, Burt Lancaster, Robin Williams, Whoopie Goldberg, or June Allyson in it. Lately, however, I have been turned off from attending movie theaters because of the seeming unending crude, glorification of gratuitous language, sex, and violence; technological gadgetry; heavy-handed political agendas; ugly, demoralizing views of life and human nature (however realistic they may be), etc. I think you should know these things about me before you read any further, because movie reviews tend to reveal more about the reviewer than about the movie. Viewing DON JUAN DEMARCO the first time was one of the most fun, thought-provoking, and feeling movie experiences I've ever had. I saw it alone, and immediatley wanted to share it with my wife, and all my married children. When I did, they had the same reaction to it as I did: Pure delight; wonder; warmth; and a desire to really LIVE life in a more substantial way than before. My teen-aged, single, childen were mostly drawn to the very romantic story and characters. But they, too, were undeniably charmed by what one critic called, a fluff of a movie. DON JUAN DEMARCO blurs fantasy with reality from beginning to end just as most of us do in our own lives. It made us constantly wonder. We found ourselves drawn into the story and character of Don Juan (or is it Johnny DeMarco?) played by Johhny Depp, just as the psychiatrist Dr. Mickler, played by Marlon Brando, is inexhorably drawn in. After viewing this movie twice in one night I immediately went online to see what the expert critics had to say about it. Much to my chagrin, nearly every one of the big name critics panned it, as mediocre filmmaking; especially criticising the going through the motions acting of Marlon Brando; and the silly screenplay and affected performance of Johnny Depp.I'm sure glad I didn't go to film critic school so I could LOVE this movie!Brando wasn't playing Stanlely Kowalski, he was playing a burned out psychiatrist and lethargic husband who, as his boss pointed out, had been just painting by the numbers. He was playing a CHARACTER who was just going through the motions. If, as an actor, he seemed to be just going through the motions, he not only played the part, he WAS the part. Johnny Depp was so off-beat and charming that, even as a middle-aged man, I found myself being drawn to his character in the same way all those women, the male nurse, and even the Brando character did. I wasn't drawn to Johhny Depp, but to the whole philosophy and persona of Don Juan. If the script (by Jeremy Leven), and Depp1s playing had NOT been full of corny affectation, he would not have been Don Juan. You can read the plot line elsewhere. I want to emphathise that I completely lost track of the famous people playing the main characters, and believed they WERE the characters. This is what I call good acting--when no one seems to be acting at all. My wife, my family, and I have been talking about DON JUAN DEMARCO for several days since seeing it. It may have changed our lives. At the end I still didn't know what was reality and what was fantasy. But I knew I wanted a little more fantasy in my own reality. ---J.

		<fullReview>It's odd how you can see a movie twice within, let's say, 5-10 years and totally change opinions of it. When I saw this movie in the theater I really enjoyed it. It was unique and, like a lot of Johnny Depp films, had a bizarre character that was fun to watch. It also was unique to see Marlon Brando in this kind of odd comedy. Both she and Faye Dunaway are very subdued in here. Depp is rarely subdued.When I saw it again on tape about seven years later, I thought this was so stupid it was an insult. I couldn't believe I liked it the first time. What I was I thinking?I will say, only Johnny Depp could play a guy who THINKS he's "Don Juan," and convince me he's sincere! He's that wacky, film after film. He is his usual self and keeps this film alive, not Brando or Dunaway who are both very dull. I blame the script for that. Neither of this famous actors was given much to work with in this movie. At least Brando was having fun making the film. That's obvious....and unusual.By the way, for those who look at ratings, despite the light, fluffy atmosphere of this story, this is yet another PG-13 that should be "R" for all the sexual content. Always beware of the rating PG-13; it's the most misleading rating of them all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>for the meeting between Brando and Deep. for the music of Bryan Adams. for the story - mixture of crumbs of fairy tale and lovely romanticism. for the message. for a kind of cinnamon aura. for a form of seduction who do not transforms it in a blockbuster but in source of a lot of comfortable memories. a psychiatrist. and a kind of hero. it is enough for a soft adventure in which the emotions becomes more important than the story itself. one of small movies who represents a delight. and it is enough for a fascinating trip in heart of a sort of miracles. little didacticist, it is sweet, naive, amusing. a good work. without high ambitions but with chance to impress. a beautiful movie. so, see it for a time of of relaxation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Might Have Been a Cult Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This gently fanciful comedy is genuinely charming and funny, leisured and mellow, heartrending; it may have been set up as a vehicle, but the direction has zest and coherence, and Brando was generally very good in his '90s comedies, in his late career, masterful and mind-blowing.It's one of the last endearing B movies made in the '80s style, prolonged in the '90s. In the '80s, these B outings offered room for leisure and fun.'Don Juan DeMarco' is intriguing, tempered, lyrical, lively, very likable, vastly good-natured. Enjoy Depp's intelligent, thorough, tactful, subtle and artful acting. There's a side of choreography to all this.This movie is an original Latino fantasy and reading of a myth (it does a bit of that, though), in every way superior to Rodriguez's disheartening trash that was to pour afterward.Reading may create a lyrical disposition, seeing a movie requires it, presupposes it, needs it. You must adjust swiftly.It was an one-off for Leven, who directed, he was 54 yrs by the time the movie got released, he went off writing a bit, even directing another movie, he has been a clinical psychologist, an interesting guy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't really wanna comment deeply about the movie's technical side and all. All I would say is that at the end,.it got me wanting to live in my own dreams.Why let the cruel facts eat you and your life up.Live the way we wish. Love with all heart!.Romanticism isn't that bad,is it?!.No one in the movie requires special comment about their acting.They were marvelous..Sometimes in your life you need to let the imaginations take you away. Tweak your perspectives a bit. Widen your gaze and look beyond what you see. The movie presents these ideas magnificently. I would recommend this movie. It's a great one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you're going to have a fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don Juan DeMarco gives Johnny Depp another one of his quirky roles which have dotted the total sum of his career. But the chance to work with Marlon Brando is not something that any player should pass up, especially when you get a part that perfectly suits you.In the title role Depp plays a young man who believes he's at the least the reincarnation of the great lover Don Juan and he dresses the part complete with Lone Ranger mask like he just came from a ball at the Spanish court. Well if you have to have a fantasy providing you've got the strength and stamina that's as good a one to have as any I've heard. I think it beats thinking you're Theodore Roosevelt by a mile.Arsenic And Old Lace is another film that Don Juan DeMarco could easily be compared to. But another that takes a more light hearted look at mental illness is Harvey. If you remember Jimmy Stewart's whose fantasy was seeing a 6' rabbit also bonded with his treating psychiatrist in an unusual way.Stewart got Cecil Kellaway to want in on his Harvey fantasy. So too does Johnny Depp get his treating psychiatrist Marlon Brando to start thinking if maybe Depp's fantasy beats the reality he operates in. Certainly listening to Depp has got Brando looking at his wife Faye Dunaway in a whole new and romantic way.As for Depp's own work, Don Juan DeMarco can be closely compared to Benny And Joon for quirkiness and just unbridled fun. Depp has such a way with offbeat characters from these two films all the way to his Captain Jack Sparrow that I don't think another player around would even try for the parts he does.Don Juan DeMarco is a fun film with both Depp and Brando looking like they enjoy each other's company and working together. They must have because they were teamed again shortly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp is Don Juan DeMarco</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Depp plays a delusional man who thinks he's Don Juan DeMarco, a legendary lover. When he's on top of a billboard, the police brings in Dr. Jack Mickler (Marlon Brando) to talk the jumper down. Jack is retiring in 10 days, and struggles to get him for his swan song. As everybody gets to know the kid, they start to fall under his spell.Johnny Depp is incredible in this. His magnetism is evident just with him in that costume. The restaurant scene at the start is funny and sets the character up perfectly. Depp is probably the only actor who could have done this character correctly. When every woman goes crazy for him, it's actually believable.As for Brando, it's probably his best performance in awhile. That's not a big praise since he hasn't been in a good movie for over a decade before this movie. His presence is big enough to counter weight Depp's magnetism, and I'm not making fun of his weight. He is basically playing the Robin Williams damaged psychiatrist role in 'Good Will Hunting'.The story isn't much. There are no real surprises, or real insights into mental health. The character is more poetry than reality. And I'm not sure the delusional flashbacks are that compelling. I actually think an early reveal of his real life and a more tragic true love story would make those flashbacks more compelling. For Johnny Depp as Don Juan alone, I would recommend this movie. Otherwise, the movie doesn't have a big enough true story befitting of Don Juan DeMarco.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not really a formal review; all I can say is this is one of my all-time favorite movies. It has it all . . . romance, sword fights, humor . . . and the great actors Marlon Brando, Faye Dunaway, and Johnny Depp. And, you have a feeling of go back and forth in time between the scenes in a modern day big city psychiatric hospital setting and various exotic places that seem from an era gone by. And, it has the best theme of all time . . . love . . . the eternal power of love. Even Don Juan de Marco falls in love. This movie also has some of the best lines, for example: "There are only four questions of value in life, Don Octavio. What is sacred? Of what is the spirit made? What is worth living for, and what is worth dying for? The answer to each is the same: only love."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don Juan DeMarco Will Put The Viewer Into An Amorous Mood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don Juan DeMarco is a romantic comedy starring Johnny Depp as John Arnold DeMarco, a man who believes himself to be Don Juan, the greatest lover in the world. Clad in a cape and domino mask, DeMarco undergoes psychiatric treatment with Marlon Brando's character, Dr. Jack Mickler, to cure him of his apparent delusion. But the psychiatric sessions have an unexpected effect on the psychiatric staff, some of whom find themselves inspired by DeMarco's delusion; the most profoundly affected is Dr. Mickler himself, who rekindles the romance in his complacent marriage.The movie also stars Faye Dunaway.The movie is based on two different sources: the modern-day story is based on director/screenwriter Jeremy Leven's short story Don Juan DeMarco and the Centerfold and the familiar legend of Don Juan,wherein flashbacks depicting DeMarco's back-story are based on.In the movie,a psychiatrist treats a most unusual patient, only to find that the doctor is the one who gains the most from their sessions. A young man in a mask and cape is standing atop a billboard, threatening to jump. When the potential suicide is finally talked down, he's brought to a psychiatric facility where after one doctor washes his hands of the case, he's placed under the supervision of Dr. Jack Mickler, an aging psychiatrist soon to retire. The patient informs Mickler that he is actually the great lover Don Juan, who has seduced over 1,500 women, but has fallen into a deep depression after being unable to win the hand of the woman of his dreams. Mickler has ten days to work with his patient and after which he will either be released on medication or committed to a long-term stay in a mental hospital. As Mickler talks with the young man, who speaks rapturously of the art of love, the doctor finds that his philosophies are helping to kick start his failing relationship with his wife, and he slowly becomes convinced that his patient might really be Don Juan after all.Walking a fine line between precious comedy, wistful drama, and delicate fantasy, it gets a big dose of charm from its esteemed cast, with Johnny Depp delivering dialogue that would have sounded ludicrous from a lesser actor.While the performances by Marlon Brando and Faye Dunaway elevate this likable comedy about love, illusion and delusion way above its inconsequential text.This may not be a great movie, but it is guaranteed to put you in an amorous mood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sweet Must-See Movies for Lovers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched this one again after having not seen it in quite a while and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was still one of the sweetest little movies I have ever seen, and for a person of my cynical nature that is really saying something. One of the secrets of this movie is the casting of Brando and Depp, two actors whom I consider to be "blank slates" and are thus quite adept at falling into and being believable in whatever role is given to them. I thought Brando in particular was sublime as the about-to-retire psychiatrist who appears to be rudderless regarding his impending life of retirement. Johnny Depp's character has some really beautifully-written lines, most of which are quoted on this site, from which we as men and husbands could learn a thing or two. Yes, it's plot is totally implausible but I'm begging you to buy in to the premise and let yourself get lost for a little while. I promise you that you will be holding your wife's hand almost before you know it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite a rather dopey plot, it's enjoyable because of a couple nice performances.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've ever seen the Joanne Woodward and George C. Scott film "They Might Be Giants", then you'll no doubt recognize this plot in "Don Juan DeMarco". The film begins with Johnny Depp making a sexual conquest in modern day America---yet he THINKS he's the legendary lover Don Juan. Later, when this lover suddenly is found contemplating suicide, an aging psychiatrist (Marlon Brando) is called in to help. Not surprisingly, Don Juan DeMarco is committed to the institution where Brando works and Brando fights hard to get assigned him as a patient--even though he's due to retire very soon. The Doctor tries hard as he works with his new patient NOT to medicate him. After all, the Doc LIKES hearing all of his patient's weird stories of love, sex and adventure. And, through the course of the film, DeMarco starts rubbing off on his doctor--to the delight of the man's wife! Johnny Depp is very nice playing a suave Latin lover and Brando is really good because he seems nice and relaxed. My only big complaint is not them but the bafflingly stupid ending. Really. Up until then, I could suspend disbelief and enjoy the film, but the ending really left me shocked at its silliness. Still, worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Quirky Movies from Depp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Depp has made a career of doing quirky movies. This is a charming, soft, quirky movie ideal for a lazy afternoon. Just go without any expectations.It is about a young man who thinks he is Don Juan DeMarco and his interactions with his psychiatrist who is trying to cure him. Though it is not really clear whether he is really delusional or not, it doesn't matters really. It is more about his exploits true or imagined, then anything else. It is about living life on your own terms.While the movie wasn't really very realistic it was pleasant, not recommended for those who try to fit every movie into a genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Depp's most underrated movies. Funny, heartwarming and creative.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Credit IMDb) A young man (who is the legendary Don Juan?), comes to New York in search of his lost love. Feeling like he has nothing to live for, he attempts to commit suicide from atop a billboard. Dr. Mickler is a soon retiring psychiatrist who helps Don Juan, come to his senses. He brings the costumed boy to the psychiatric hospital , in hopes of helping Don Juan find his identity. The doctor works with him for ten days, in which Don tells his life story. Mickler begins to believe that the young man is truly Don Juan, but the rest of the staff doesn't agree. The doctor knows that the only way out for Don Juan, is to pretend he's an average boy whose fantasy got the best of him.This isn't really talked about as one of Depp's best movies, but it sure should be. What I liked most about this movie was the eccentricity. Depp's character has it in spades. The movie was smart to have us wondering if De Marco was delusional about his story or if he was telling the truth. We never really know throughout the movie, but I loved the way they decided to end it. The scenery itself is beautiful.Performances. Johnny Depp can do no wrong in my eyes. 95% of the time he is bang on, and here is no different. He is so good, we aren't ever really sure if he's crazy or not. His chemistry with Brando is on the money. Marlon Brando is not a favorite of mine but he excelled here. He is wonderfully classy, and I loved his old-school approach. Faye Dunnaway is charming in her screen time.Bottom line. It's a wonderful little treat of a movie, one that is severely underrated on Depp's resume. It's not about if it was real or not, it's about what I learned. A must see in my books.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this movie I sat at least 5 minutes with a smile on my face. It's an original movie, not a standard romantic comedy. Johnny Depp is excellent, I could not imagine a better actor for the part. And also Marlon Brando and Faye Dunaway are great as the couple that had been together very long, and find their passion again. I love the fact that in the end you still don't really know what the truth is, I think this is the best way to end the movie. The whole atmosphere of the movie is very nice, the music and sets are beautiful and really make the movie even better. It's not like other romantic comedy's just about finding love, it actually has a deeper story, the story that it doesn't really matter whether what you believe is reality or not, just as long as you believe it. I give this movie 9 out of 10, 'cause I definitely want to see it again.</fullReview>

This movie shows you that it's okay to be a little different and see things a different way, just live your life to the fullest and see yourself as a beautiful person. Isn't that basically what Don Juan told Dr. Mickler...how he sees women for who they truly are, not on their imperfections. My science teacher, who is is a Vietnam vet and an ex cop, reminded me of Dr. Mickler so I gave it to him to watch. And even HE liked it. My boyfriend loved it. It's a movie for all ages and all types of people. But I would recommend watching this with your boyfriend...some of the things Johnny Depp says make shivers go down your spine and it causes romantic moments...if you know what I'm saying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Your fantasy or mine - Retiring Shrink celebrates mid life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw this on DVD and thoroughly enjoyed the love story. Beautiful cinematography, fine acting, lovely women to watch in this story of embracing mid life and retirement. A couple of thoughts - Juan's story is just like he says in the meeting with the judge, Juan in fact struggles with the truth of his life with an unfaithful mother and a father who had just one claim to fame - being dance king of Astoria. An underwhelming life. It's possible Dr. Mickler (Don Octavio) becomes a replacement for Don Juan's real father. Mickler of course becomes DOn Octavio as he is drawn deeper into Don Juan's world. If your reality is not so good, we tend to fill it in with good fantasies. Or, just enjoy it like Neverland or Pirates - a fantasy - a pleasant romantic movie with Depp and a group of fine looking ladies. I prefer to accept Johnny as Don Juan, just as Dr. Mickler did, and to enjoy the fantasy ride. The irony is most of us can identify with Dr. Mickler - having lost our youthful enthusiasm in the midst of raising a family and putting kids through college, still not able to rub two nickles together in our personal life. Like Mickler, we can CHOOSE to live a more romantic, fun, lively existence - all we have to do is choose to do so, give ourselves permission to enjoy. Many middle age men still remember their "Don Juan" days, many years ago, but not out of reach. Many of us would be pleasantly surprised how our spouses are just waiting for us to rediscover the romantic side of our personality. It's still there, just a bit rusty from non-use, and buried perhaps in tuition bills, mortgage payments, car payments, the office, church and community commitments, etc. We have to give ourselves some 'breathing room' just as Don Juan tells Mickler needs. Love the movie, and love the Bryan Adams song, revived this year on Ameircan Idol with Kris Allen.</fullReview>

Alas, there was nothing but flat characters, the silliest accent I have ever heard an actor come up with, and suspension of disbelief was so hard I had to call a friend to moan what a silly movie it was. In fact was it not for my love for both Marlon and Depp I would have given it a zero!

		<fullReview>I have got mixed feelings about this movie. It has everything to be a hit: Coppola at the production, a great song of the duo Adams / Kamen (better than their Robin Hood hit), the finest French Actress (Pailhas), the most talented of the new generation (Deep) and of the old generation (Brando, Dunaway) and a very romantic and original story (it's not easy to make out what's reality and what's fantasy, thus having set the movie in the psychiatric world is brilliant).For sure, having Brando finding his youth again is moving, because as he was such a tremendous actor, this movie has surely talked to him: retirement is coming, is love doomed then ? I am amazed how he can be younger actually in this movie than while he was playing old Vito Corleone.But as I watched it, I found it dull. I think the culprit is found in the writer/director Leven because he gives us a cold soup with all those tasteful components: Then, beware of Leven because he can't level up a movie! in addition, i have got only french version so i lost all the original voices!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Practically everyone agrees that Johnny Depp is one of the most impressive actors of his generation - maybe THE most - but anyone who doubts that Marlon Brando* and Faye Dunaway can still do their stuff need only watch "Don Juan DeMarco". It casts Depp as the title character, who one day appears and claims that he is literally the world's greatest lover, having loved 1,502 women. Marlon Brando plays Dr. Jack Mickler, trying to cure Don Juan, and Faye Dunaway plays Jack's wife Marilyn, wondering how these sessions might affect their lives.What I thought was really neat in the movie was at the end, when it portrays Jack sort of taking on the Don Juan persona, applying it to himself as a psychiatrist. Maybe this is the sort of movie that they just made for fun, but it sure is interesting. You can do a lot with a combination of Ed Wood, Don Corleone, and Bonnie Parker. And Faye Dunaway is still really hot.*Obviously, Marlon Brando is no longer with us, but he still had it up to his death.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young man, dressed in a "Zorro-like" costume and professing that he is Don Juan. wishes to die at the hands of a fellow swordsman, having had his own heart broken by the only woman he truly ever loved, but lost. "Don Juan" is talked off the high precipice by world weary psychiatrist Dr. Jack Mickler and hauled off to a mental hospital in Queens, New York.The state is giving the staff 10 days to decide if he should be taken off of medication and released or locked away. Since Dr. Mickler is slated to retire in 10 days, and being strangely drawn to this new study, he lobbies for and gets the young man's case. In the days that follow, as Don Juan relates his life of adventure, love, danger, tragedy, and sensuality, Dr. Mickler realizes that his life has been one of resignation and complacence, and passed along to his loving wife, and that he is steering them toward a retirement equally as empty. What is this spell of Don Juan? Will Mickler release him or confine him? From the moment Johhny Depp begins his opening restaurant seduction, you know you are watching a charming, inoffensive little masterpiece of a romantic comedy. I don't think Marlon Brando has ever been finer in a role that simply requires him "to be." He wears the role of Dr. Mickler like a comfortable, old slipper. Faye Dunaway blends seamlessly into the story as Mrs. Marilyn Mickler. Their scenes together are as real and enjoyable as you can put on celluloid.Jeremy Leven's script cleverly let's us watch the tug and pull of several conflicts within Brando: Is Depp Don Juan or a Schitzo? Is this the life my wife and I deserve or can there be more? Do I retire in Glory or Humiliation? It's all delightfully done. To watch Don Juan even seduce Dr. Mickler's sense of self, reality, and zenith of life, is charming to watch. Leven is no visionary director, which is a wise choice for this vehicle. It's story and performance driven, not auteur driven.Be aware of the late Michael Kamen's lilting, dreamy, warm, and haunting score. It adds so much to the tale There are some fine touches. As Don Juan, Depp is able to turn the head of every female nurse in the institute to the point he's assigned a male nurse -- and Depp victors over that; in the opening it is magic to listen to Depp explain the passions that kissing a woman's hand ignites within her and watch it have its effect; familiar character actor Bob Dishy's twitchy supervisor Showalter, desperately trying to get Mickler to give Depp the damned "meds" and find out what's in store for the board interview on the tenth day, strums the right chords that have made him a dependable performer; every scene Brando and Funaway have together is just a joy to watch; the tales Don Juan relates are romantic, wistful, hopeful, and make you fall into line with Brando: Is this kid crazy or is this for real? Gee, I hope it's real! Yes, the women in Don Juan's "life" are all gorgeous, even his mother and grandmother have aged as beautiful women, but it is the growing emotions and changes he brings to Dr. Miickler that are the heart and soul of the tale. Grab a date. You'll both love this flick!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch and learn: How to be sexy and charismatic just by using the right words</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Conquests, conquests, conquests... The language... geez,... "Don Juan" uses the most poetic and beautiful language. The way he talks to and about women... lets say, only HE gets away with it. It's in the delivery. I am not sure if I can "MAKE" my boyfriend watch it, both of us aren't exactly romantic comedy fans. I guess I will try to persuade him by telling him how many HOT HOT HOT Latina woman he will get to see ... naked. Don Juans behaviour is as infectious as a smile. He has no bad bone in his body, delusional or not, people can't help but adore him.*adores*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Power of Fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not amazed that women voting in the IMDB poll gave higher marks to this film than male viewers. This film tries to tell more than it looks - it says something about imagination and fantasy making our lives better, or maybe just bearable. The problem is that sometimes imagination is being categorized by society as a mental disorder, and maybe the borders are not that clear. This is how the modern don Juan finds himself in a mental institution, and the society using one of its supreme weapons - the psychiatrist - tries to bring him back to Reality. The issue is that fantasy is stronger and more charismatic than reality, and the outcome is uncertain.Good and original idea, but not a great movie. The story telling is too slow, and at some point in time repeats itself. The acting of Marlon Brando is fabulous, but Johny Depp misses the power to be the magnetic and enchanting character he is supposed to be. As a result, the film gets 7/10 on my personal scale, and remains only a moderately recommended rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming if a little insubstantial ? but then, that's the point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been rejected by his one true love a young man who thinks he is Don Juan de Marco decides to kill himself. He is however taken to a mental hospital and given 10 days of assessment to decide if he's mad or should be set free. Dr Mickler is assigned to the case and finds that, despite the supposed inconsistencies of Don Juan's story, he does seem to have an effect on the staff of the hospital and indeed he himself begins to find his relationship with his wife improving and becoming more romantic.This is filled with charm from start to finish. The story is able to be a bit of a flight of fancy because it is the story from the perspective of a potentially delusional man. The story mixes the romantic tale of our Con Juan with the rekindling effect he has on Mickler and his employees. At times it is too light and the ending is open ? but the final few sentences set it all in context. It is warming and makes a point that transcends it's lightness.The cast is mostly good. Depp is sexy and mysterious and is an ideal Don Juan. Brando however is an aging ham. He is OK but he is almost a comedy character at times and is a shadow of his former self. Dunaway is aging with a lot more class and is really good. Other characters are good although are there to add charm and comedy ? such as Singer and `Tiny' Lister.Overall this is so light that it may be annoying if you're not in the mood. But if you can buy into it then I suspect you'll enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gender-tourism Lite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First-off, I did find this film entertaining in a chick-flicky kinda way, which is a shame because it could have been lot less lightweight and still have been very funny. The screenplay is a quite subtle chapter in the gender wars encyclopedia and thus deserves a subtler approach, I think. The odd thing is that the romantic approach posited by 'the patient' is nearer the normal woman's perspective. The films message appears to be 'think like a woman'. But the women in the film didn't enjoy any individuality and are just served up as units of female simulacrum for the heroes consumption... just a catalogue of centrefolds in fact. Perhaps that was the point. Guffaw! However it looks like Mssrs. Depp and Brando had a lot of fun hamming it up and competing with each other for meaningful facial expressions and it was fun to watch. I just wish the director had kept them under restraint and cranked the movie up a couple of pegs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! This is awful. I thought the equation Brando+Depp+Dunaway would = Great, but it equaled terrible! I found this unfunny, ridiculous and just poor. The performances were alright especially Depp who does quite well in such a stupendously dumb role. Brando does alright in a slightly better role and Dunaway flops horribly. The script falls flat while trying to seem romantic loses focus and drifts into the chasm of stupidity and while some of the scenes seem funny (baby spying on his nude mum) also seems weird (Incest! At eight months old?!). I hoped to find this great but no, I shake my head sadly. I had a choice out of watching M an old Fritz Lang film, or this A Brando/Depp film which seemed alright looking at the cover but after 2 hours I was praying to Fritz Lang for forgiveness of not watching his film and watching this horrendous film. This goes on my list of bad movies with The Brain That Wouldn't Die, Spy Kids 2, The Naked Mile and The Swap. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable plot dampens the movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Spoilers you great lovers)Although this movie does try it's best at pleasing the crowd. However I find the ending... that demands a believe it if you want to type ending rather hard to swallow. Hey.. Johnny Depp is in top form of course. I just wish it had a more solid ending that a Jello type. I can't put my finger on it, but I truely believe that it makes it kinda hard to enjoy the movie when there is no solid plot. Is he or isn't he? Leave's me with that silly notion like the end of Braveheart where your left wondering if the princess is pregnant with Williams child or not. (which of course riles the history buffs against the Braveheart fans) Benny &amp; Joon is so much better at doing a nice movie of this sort. So I'm actually glad that I spent $5 on this dvd. (brand new) Odd movie to find in a bargain bin slot.Another complaint is Marlon Brando. He's like so utterly annoying. His acting portrays a very unbelievable character. That and he's so flipping fat that he's about to suffocate his wife. I think it's particularly with this movie that I notice how utterly overweight this man is. Did he have a straw stuck up his butt stuck to a gas pipe? And it's not that I have anything against fat people, (according to the tech terms I'm supposed to be obese. 270 lbs... sue me.) but it's the fact that this guy used to be an idol. Someone that women ran to.Oh well. At least he's better in The Score.5/10Quality: 2/10 (effort.... 5/10) Entertainment: 4/10 Replayable: 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don Juan DeMarco does several things in a rather unfocused way. It is a vehicle for Depp, a man known for making women everywhere swoon; it gives simple scenes Brando and Dunaway; it tells fantastic stories, through Depp's character, in boldly-colored scenes of romance and humor.I have a few complaints with this movie. First, Brando: both the man and his character. In this part, I really feel he was miscast. Dunaway was convincing where Brando felt flat. This is a shame since, because of the slightly slow-moving directing style, a dynamic performance really could have given the movie another focal point.His scenes with Depp also show this. I could tell by the way my attention kept shifting to Depp's character (and *not* visually, but mentally!) Depp has lines that seem bizarre on paper but somehow make sense when he says them. By far the best scenes are the flashbacks. Besides their bold color and style that make the rest of the film seem to drag, these scenes are where Depp really seems to be enjoying himself. (Spoiler) Depp's face as he first lays eyes on the sultan's harem is priceless. He conveys a sincerity that seems to come more easily to this adventuresome alter ego than to his confined real-world self. The genuine feeling which is hinted at with Depp's sensual real-world dialogue is given a lot more screen time.The message is at once frustratingly cliché (sometimes mental patients have it right; a little imagination spices up reality) and refreshing. I enjoyed how the movie ended with ambiguity; most movies are not willing to do that, which is a shame.Altogether, I'd say 6 or 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun romantic whimsy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Don Juan DeMarco", Depp plays a man who, institutionalized after threatening to jump from a building while being dressed like Zorro, recounts the fantastic romantic tale of his life to his psychiatrist (Brando) and how be became the world's greatest lover. A romantic comedy of sorts, "DJD" begs the question...Who is more crazy: The young man who lives a romantic fantasy and enjoys the fullness of life or the psychiatrist who retires with a gold watch and a marriage with a gaping hole where the romance should be? A fun, fanciful frolic with Depp, Brando, ample romance, a whiff of sensuality, not much sex, and one scene with no less than 40 nude women, "DMD" may not be the best flick available but it is not without its assets. A fun romp for romantics. All others; turn off brain and just go with it. (B-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Suicidal young man believes himself to be a descendant of the legendary Latin lover Don Juan; he's treated by a psychiatrist who could use a little romance in his own staid marriage. Johnny Depp, in a straggly goatee and unkept hair, isn't quite Don Juan material, but portly Marlon Brando is very likable as the doctor and, as his wife, Faye Dunaway shakes off all those old "Mommie Dearest" cobwebs to give a sensual, amiable performance (she hasn't been this warm or flexible on-screen in years). The wispy story has no center and goes back and forth in time without a strong direction, but there are captivating moments beyond Depp's general lack of charisma. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Similar Idea With "K-PAX", But More Incoherent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the excellent film "K-PAX", we have a patient at a mental hospital who claims to be from a far away planet, and while his psychiatrist tries to help him, he gradually starts to doubt whether his patient is actually telling the truth."Don Juan DeMarco", produced around six years before "K-PAX", is built on a quite similar idea: Here, the patient (Depp) believes that he is the legendary lover Don Juan, and he tries to commit suicide because of a broken affair. Dr. Mickler (Brando), a psychiatrist who is about to retire, saves him from his suicide attempt, and becomes his therapist when he is institutionalized. However, he soon becomes fascinated by Don Juan's stories, and he starts to wonder what the true identity of the boy is; moreover, he is also positively affected by Don Juan, and his life becomes different.While "K-PAX" was a fantastic film, it is not easy for me to come up with the same enthusiastic verdict for "DeMarco". The primary reason for this is the plot's incoherence: The elements are good, but for some reason they are not well-connected. The result is a plot that seems to lack a smooth development.The second problem has been Marlon Brando's presence. Brando is one of the greatest icons in the history of cinema, and it is really depressing to watch him giving a performance which can be considered average at best; if it was someone else in his place it wouldn't mind, but watching the talented man who made such an impressive performance in "The Godfather" and "Apocalypse Now" in such a toothless role, is completely sad.Depp and Dunaway were satisfactory in their roles, but nothing beyond that. The same could be said for the rest of the cast, as well.In brief, "Don Juan DeMarco" is a film that will entertain you for two hours, but do not expect anything more. If you want something really good on a similar theme, opt for "K-PAX" instead.6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dismal attempt at a romantic tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is supposed to be romantic, beautiful and full of subtle grace. It fails terribly. All that dancing in the moonglow is supposed to be romantic but it's just corny and ridiculous, and it can only make one laugh. Brando is a good actor, but here he is just out of place. In the final scene, dancing on the beach, he looks like a whale. Both him and his partner instead of looking graceful look like a pair of circus clowns. Others, including Johnny Depp, do no better. This was supposed to be a beautiful, romantic movie but what we get is "Naked Gun 4 1/4".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unholy and horrendous, the unusual fear that Hollywood dishes out in callous disgrace of our mottos, DON JUAN DEMARCO made me want to puke my guts out. The screenplay sent me to a godless paralysis under the circumvented nonsense of two starless nasties, Marlon Brando and Johnny Depp. They shot me down over and over again as I moved my pillow to try to befriend my lover. Mr. Brando shows easily why I myself may someday be the victim of Mafia inJustice. Faye Dunaway as his wifeless victim of our cold war days is making me want to shoot myself before Brando may. The play and its insinuations of fear that these three characters give yield to here when in its day, left me holding my pillow for dear life as my wife left the room for another man.But in the end, I appreciated their niceties and innuendos and said to my wife that I'll be okay now. So be my guest, and see it. But just tell stop smiling so hard, and it will be really all okay.</fullReview>
